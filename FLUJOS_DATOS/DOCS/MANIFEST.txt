Since the beginning of the human era , we have had access to information , by asking , by reading , by watching .    

But wasnt until the greedinesh of a few  that appeard , that this access to information was limited .

What you denny submits you , what you accept transforms you . 

Public information should be free to everybody . 

Private information should be protected , so that no goverment or person cant apply  to much power . 

Dont trust the authority or the authority will eat your privileges .  

One image talks more than 1000 words . 
One graph relates more than 1000 talks . 


The ability to correlate actions with speeches and vice versa 
gives you the power to know about the past . 

He who controls the past controls the future .  
He who controls the present controls the past . 

LOS GIGANTES VISTOS EN PERSPECTIVA 
PARECEN MARIONETAS

Lo que hay que tener es una premisa bien clara : 
Sin miedo no hay limites y  sin limites no hay control.
Sin control no hay limities y sin limites no hay miedo . 

La cuestion no es cuando , la cuestion es como 

Sabes , que hay debajo del asfalto ? 
EL MAR .
