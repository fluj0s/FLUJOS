drugs summary the directtoconsumer dtc advertising of prescription drugs by pharmaceutical companies has been described as any promotional effort with respect to these drugs that targets the general public through the lay media spending by the drug industry on dtc advertising gr ew from 791 million in 1996 to 32 billion in 2003 mostly for promotion of 50 brandname drugs ther is growing consensus among health professionals and others th at dtc advertising may have exacerbated recent problems with drug safety eg vioxx and that it may contribute to the rising cost of health care drug manufacturers claim that dtc advertising reminds patients to visit their doctors and be tested for health problems earlier to take their medicines as prescribed and to become more involved in their own treatment some physicians acknowledge that dtc advertising serves as an effective tool for conveying health information to their patients others however mistrust dtc advertising because in their opinion the information provided by the ads can sometimes be misleading from their perspective dtc ads rarely if ever discuss nondrug forms of treatment such as weight control and othe r beneficial lifestyle changes in 1962 congress gave the food and drug administration fda the authority to regulate prescription drug advertising which at the time consisted primarily of ads in medical journals directed mostly toward physicians the law prohibited fda from issuing regulations that would require prior approval of the content of drug advertising published re gulations require that all drug ads include brief summary statement that discloses all the drugs known risks because most commercial advertising is limited in length or dur ation drug makers found compliance with these regulations difficult particularly in television and radio advertising until 1997 fda had given guidance to the drug industry on how the brief summary requirements for broad cast advertising could be met it then issued draft guidance finalized in 1999 clarifying that it would treat broadcast advertising differently than print advertising it stipulated that broadcast ads had to include the advertised product s most important risks ca lled major statement by fda in the audio portion of the advertis ement fdas guidance provided that the dtc ads should give sources where more complete risk information about drug would be available ie on internet s ites tollfree telephone numbers referral to health care providers and larg ecirculation print sources some members of congress are asking whether fdas current policies on dtc ads give consumers information that appr opriately balances ri sks and benefits or whether ads misrepresent important informa tion patients need prior to purchasing or consuming the drug this report examines legislative concerns and options on risk and health information as they relate to advertising of drugs it also discusses activities that could be undertaken with cu rrent legislative authority to address concerns about dtc advertising and exa mines options for new statutory authority on dtc advertising this report will be updated

advertising is usually described as any promotional effort by pharmaceutical companies to present prescription drug information to the general public through the lay media1 dtc advertising s hows up in magazines newspapers nonmedical jour nals pharmacy brochures nd directmail letters and on television radio videos nd internet websites any one who watche s television or listens to the radio today has likely seen or heard some sort of dtc advertisement for prescription drugs the ads usua lly fall into one of three categories2 productclaim ads that include products name and therapeutic claim about the product helpseeking ads that discuss particular disease or healthcondition and advise the consumer to see your doctor but do not mention the products name reminder ads that call attention to the products name but makeno reference to the health condition the drug is used to treat of these three categories of advertisem ents the food and drug administration fda has the authority to directly regula only productclaim ad s the regulations require that therapeutic claims not be false or misleading the agency regulations differentiate between print and broadcast dtc productcl aim ads print ads must contain all the risk information descri bed in the drugs fdaapproved label including major side effects indications and precautions broadcast advertisements however must directly st ate only major risk information and must direct viewers and listeners to other sources from which they can access the complete risk information helpseeking ads also are directed toward consumers but make health claims reminder ads also make health claims but are primarily directed toward doctors and health care professionals who are more likely than consumers to know about the advertised product and its use they also serve to acquaint consumers with brand names of products although the agency mon itors these two types of ads to ensurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32853crs2 there is implication of

for example are said to be targeted towards women in their 40s and 50s who may have some genetic predisposition for the disease such ads attempt to educate patients about differe nt health conditions and ttempt to create demand for the drug in part by increasing inter action between patient s and their doctors the criteria and discussions leading to company decisions on which medications to advertise are pr oprietary most of the top selling brandname products are extensively advertised and the advertising increases public awareness of these drugs11 impact on number of adverse events recent events have brought fdas policies on dtc advertisements into focus for congress12 some members have expressed concern about post market problems with the safety of certain drugs and the pot ential of causing harm to consumers the perceived connection with dtc is that drug companies often use dtc ads to promote newly approved medica tions although judged safe by fda with evidence from clinical trials these approved drugs had been test ed only on certain number of patients 5000 or fewer nd compared almost always with placebo with largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32853crs6 13 because

the 1999 and 2 002 surveys results are presented as one several other surveys added other perspectives to the issue for example survey by the magazine prevention found that even with the pervasiveness of dtc advertising in magazines and on televi sion and with the tremendous increase in spending on dtc ads patient s requests of their physici ans for or about advertised drugs has remained stable at about 8 the author concludes that the ads cant overcome americans desire to void taking prescription drugs25 however this survey also showed that about 7 of people surveyed asked for and received prescription drug because of dtc advertising and 7 st opped taking drug after seeing it advertised it so established that positive public health response to the advertising was that patients seek informa tion about health conditions for themselves or for people in their care this same survey states that consumers are three times more likely to search for information about medicines family memb ers or friends are already taking than they are to ask their doctors for medicines for themselves26 another study conducted by several harvard professors found portion of patients visits that were spurred by dtc ads were for clinically important conditions that resulted in new diagnosis27 their study did not detect widespread adverse effects of dtc ads on peoples health this study also found that consumers can gain extra benefits not limited to the advertised drug because they get supplementary information about their health physician view some physicians believe that dtc advertising serves as an effective tool for providing health informa tion to consumers so believe that dtc advertising is one reason pa tients are visiting their docto rs more undergoing tests to catch health problems earlier taking their medicines regularly and getting more involved in their own treatment ho wever some physicians mistrust dtc advertising because in their opinion the ad s often promote

survey responses benefits and problems of patient dtc exposure41 of physicians thought exposure was beneficial leading to better discussions greater awareness of treatments and that dtc was source for informing patients 18 said exposure led to problems such as misconceptions requiring physician correction requests for unnecessary drugs and requests for one medication when another treatment was effective 73 said patients asked thoughtful questions b ecause of dtc exposure 41 of physicians said patients were confused about drugs effectiveness because of the dtc ad patient drug requesting behavior the survey distinguished between patients asking if there were drug to treat specific problem and those asking for specific drug 86 of physicians recalled patients asking about drug and 88 of them said that the patient had the condition the drug treats 77 of primary care physicians prescribed the requested drug whereas 74 of specialists did denial of requests most frequent reason given by physicians for denial was that the drug was not right for the patient and another drug was more appropriate primary care physicians denied prescriptions for variety of reasons because there was less expensive drug available prescription was required or patient could engage in behavioral or diet changes specialists declined prescriptions because different drug was appropriate drug was not right for patient or the drug had side effects unknown to the patient pressure to prescribe 50 of physicians reported pressure and 91 reported patient did not try to influence treatment that would have been harmful to patient 22 of primary care physicians felt somewhat or very pressured to prescribe 13 of specialists felt that way 73 of primary care physicians reported patients came to the appointment

peopl are using the drug but more frequently staying compliant the total amount of wh at is spent on the drug will also increase35 as discussed earlier economists have stated that recent growth in dtc

dtc advertising can drive the spending on pha rmaceuticals but is responsible for only small share of the total growth in spending on drugs referring instead to other factors mentioned above37 studies sponsored by both industry and academic researchers suggest that the ads can lead to costeffective treatments in some circumstances38 for example many experts find that although statin dr ugs lower blood choleste rol levels and are relatively costeffective as secondary pr evention in persons with existing heart disease they are much less costeffectiv than primary prevention such as weight control and exercise39 spokesman for the pharm aceutical industry in testimony before congress stated that medicines are the most cost effective form of health care because they can keep patients out of hospitals and nursing homes and avoid surgery40 he quoted national institutes of health study which found that clotbusting drugs used to treat stroke patients save on average 4300 year per patient by reducing the need for hospitalization re habilitation and nursinghome care41 however others who have researched costeffectiveness of pharmaceuticals say that the question of whether drugs are cost

precautions from the products approved labeling50 for the most part conveying ll of products risk information in print advertising is not difficult however because commercial broadcast advertisements are often of limited length 30 to 60 seconds to include this kind of detailed information in tele vision andor radio advertis ing was thought by the drug industry to be too cumbersome and expensive51 although the regulations allowed for an alternative to presenting every risk in broadcast advertisement prior to 1997 fda had not issued any interpretation of how broadcast advertis ements could fulfill the adequate provision regulation which is an alternative to presenting all the risk information in the brief summary52 the industry reportedly assumed that fda expected broadcast dtc advertising to meet the same requirements as ads in print53 in august 1997 fda issued draft gu idance on how pharmaceutical companies fulfill the existing regulatory requirements for advertising prescription drugs on radio and television the draft guidance was fi nalized without major change in august 199954 the guidance provided that dtc broa dcast advertisements had to include the advertised products most important risks called m ajor statement by fda the major statement was required to be in the audio portion of the advertisement but could be in the video portion as well the agency explained that the regulations had always allowed for broadcast advertisements to either include all the drugs risks or ensure that consumers would have adequa provision of an advertised

practitioners brief summary guidance fda requires that any prescription drug advertisement contain information in brief summary relating to the side effects contraindications and eff ectiveness of the drug59 the information on the risks of the product known as the brief summary must disclose all the riskrelated information in the drugs package labeling so ads in print often include the entire

requirement for dtc print ads all woul d require that the manufacturer print all contraindications all warnings the major precautions including any that describe serious adverse drug experiences or

summary guidance draft that it be rewr itten to be understanda ble to consumers the agency has asked drug firms to consider the costs and benefits of each of these options and decide which option is best supporters say that less type and lower information volume will mean lower advertising costs and consumer oriented risk information will mean that the information is more useful critics argue that this approach may be appropriate for only small subset of products they also argue that fda should be going further in deve loping guidelines for the kind of risk disclosures that actually allow patients to use them as basis for further discussion with health professional64 after reviewing the three january 2004 draft guidance documents at fdas request federal trad commission staff agreed that presenting risk information in more accessible language would be better than reprinting the brief summary the ftc report recommended however that fda conduct consumer research to assess the

the struct ure or function of th body of man and are intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitig ation treatment or prevention of disease in humans87 at issue in recent congressional hearings is concern that the known risks from certain drugs have not b een made public nor have risks been systematically evaluated some say that dtc ads have in their presentation minimized the risks as portrayed in the ads in addition there are unanswered questions regarding the relative contribution of dtc advertising of prescription drugs to health and health care generally congre ss in its oversight role is looking at what fda can do under current legislative author ity and what more authority fda may need to meet new challenges risk and health information one concern before congress is whether physicians are receiving appropriate risk information to allow them to convey th risks to patients some believe that not only does the risk information need to be more systematically collected and released so health decisions can be made carefully but also that more care needs to be taken with dtc advertisin g exposure adverse reactions to drugs and negative interactions of one drug with

critics however question the educati onal component of dtc advertisements and have suggested that creating greater access to postmarketing surveillance or clinical trial data rather than just the information gained through submitted dtc ads could provide patients with different source of information about the adverse effects sometimes associat ed with new products89 if this information were collected by nonindustry independent sources or ev by fda and made available to the public through the internet and possibly also made accessible through local pharmacies it could be used to counter an misinformation or omissions contained in dtc advertising activity under current authority one question is whether fda is doing enough with its current authority to protect consumers from potentially misleading advertisements suggested activities involve fda review of ad content fda sponsored consumer education and fda enforcement of dtc advertising guide lines while none of these may require legislative action to increase fdas authority their successful implementation could require additional resources pre and postpublication review one area of questioning involves the timing and the extent of fdas review of dtc advertisements for accuracy and balance as noted above the law explicitly prohibits fda from requiring pre publication review and appr oval of ads however some manufacturers voluntarily choose to submit proposed ads to fda prior to their release to the public to avoid the expense of pulling an already launched ad campaign90 all manufacturers however must submit to the agency with form 2253 the final ad in whatever form it was disseminated to the public the agency believes that there is problem currently with this voluntary prereview and af terthefact system for regulating dtc advertising it claims that most of its reviews are timely and the current statute does not give fda the authority to do more than it is doing91 agency officials do say that close monitoring of visual elements of advertisements is at times necessary because some visuals can mislead consumers about the benefits of drug despite the apparently balanced audio pr esentations about risks ab sent any legislative change the fda currently has the statutory author ity to impose requirements on the content of advertisements to ensure that ads provide accurate and unbiased

advertisers must then show that the advertisement adhere d to the code the advantage of this system is that complaints are processed quickly often w ithin six weeks if an ad is found to breach code

for patients to talk to their physicians fda could also ensure that any new information with respect to particular drug or class of drugs would be widely disse minated particularly if the new information involved adverse events or new contraindications fda could also study whether consumers understand the risk and benefit inform ation presented by ads or whether the information such as patient medication guides about the risks and benefits received by the patient with each new prescription used nonetheless the agency cannot guarantee how patients will use the added information the fda advisory committees that met in february 2005 to ssess the safety of vioxx and other cox2 inhibitors discussed how fda might act if its enforcement system of untitled and warning letters did not inhibit biased industry advertisements they considered whether fda itsel f might create drug information to counter the biased or unbalanced pictures the manufactur ers present in dtc ads and to

panel under the federal advisory committee act which could either itself recommend standards for prescription drug ads or encourage the drug industry to develop new set of standards for

that ads are reliable understandable and trustworthy97 increase fdas enforcement activity at present when fda identifies an ad that does not follow fda regulati ons it can send notice of noncompliance

the public one suggestion discussed in the federal advisory meeting mentioned above would be to categorize ad s depending on the drug it was advertising so that if the opportunity for harm from leading information is seen as large then more rigorous review could be instituted set limits on timing and placement of ads some suggest that the agency could also limit the number type or content of

that drugs risks were not listed in the advertisement in th same proportion as its benefits104 third would have mandated comparative research on the effectiveness and safe ty of drugs covered by the federal employees health benefits program105 it also would have required regulations for ads mandating that the advertisements balance risk and benefit information set civil penalties for viola tions and required an annual report which specified details of all dtc ads including which ads violated the law and describing what the secretary of health and huma n services had done to respond to the violation it also would have required expe dited review of dtc ads none of these bills was reported out of their committees of referral conclusion dtc promotes the advantages of prescrip tion drugs and is used to sell drugs by manufacturers the issue for congress is whether fdas current policies on dtc ads give consumers information that is bala nced with risks and benefits represented equally and whether ads misrepresent impor tant information patients need prior to purchasing or consuming the drug the agency and others say that evidence suggests that dtc ads influence the way patients find out about certain health conditions supporters point to the ads as source of information about treatment options benefits and risks they also attributed to ads educating patients and leading them to take more responsibility for their h ealth care visiting their physicians more regularly so that certain health conditions are caught early and preventing more costly treatments later others argue for stricter requirements for ads coupled with penalties for infractions to assure consum ers of balance in the information about drugs they suggest that ads should be approved prior to release to the
