commemorative issues became more prominent consideration social issues such as c onservation employment of the handicapped and higher education were added as commemorative features to the traditional mix of historical and patriotic themes in 1993 usps released the elvis presley stamp which generated unprecedented enthusiasm among postal customers as distinguished from collectors and still holds the record for stamps saved 124 million with face value of 359 million the usps has been criticized by collectors for issuing too many commemorative stamps as well as for producing too many stam ps of particular issue concerns have been expressed that too many stamps diminis hed the value of the stamps to the hobbyist and had the potential to drive collectors away under postmaster general pmg marvin runyon former collector h imself it became usps policy to produce and market fewer commemorative stamps however in the effort to expand and appeal to wider range of interests usps in the late 1990s began designing stamps not only to attract non collectors but also children2 this expansion has increased the number of commemorative stamps produced and marketed the number of separate commemorative stamps issued rose from 26 in 1997 to 81 in 1998 to 121 in 2002 in 2007 usps will issue 99 commemorative stamps3 errors and subject selection in commemorative stamps have sometimes generated controversy for example in 1994 postal fficials belatedly disc overed that stamp featuring wild west star bill pickett picted the wrong man to prevent such occurrences in the future historian has been hired by the usps to authenticate all chosen stamp designs widelycirculate d news story in 2000 pointed out that of 1722 commemorative stamps issued since 1893 onl 133 8 featured

potter cut stamp from 2003 program linns stamp news apr 5 2004 p 8purpose is to provide philatelic history and artistic judgment and experience in the selection and design of commemorative stamps the committee consists of 15 members none of whom is postal employee and whose backgrounds reflect wide range of educational artistic historical and profe ssional knowledge members are appointed and serve at the pleasure of the pmg for threeyear staggered terms with member able to serve more than four terms current memb ers include joan mondale actor karl malden graphic designer michael brock and harvar d professor henry louis gates jr member may serve more than three terms the pmg appoints one member to serve as chairperson and another member as vice chairperson each serving twoyear terms the committee meets quarterly in washin gton dc or at the call of the csac chairperson to review the thousands of sugge stions that are received by the usps its meetings are not public csac itself employs staff to expedite its work employees of the uspss stamp development group analyze all stamp subject suggestions upon initial receipt subcommittees of staff researchers are formed on special themes such as sports medicine transportati on black heritage and performin g arts to provide additional background and research occasionally co mmemorative ideas require considerable research to explore an ideas merit or to devise strong visual appeal all supporting materials are then presented to the committee along with any suggestions while the primary responsibility of the committee is to review and appraise all proposals submitted for commemoration the pmg has the exclusive and final authority to determine both the subject matter and the designs for us posta ge stamps thus for example although the advisory committee recommended in 2003 that stamp be commissioned for tercentenary of the birth of 18th century theologian jonathan edwards pmg john potter refused to approve the recommendation7 members of congress are often asked by constituents to support particular commemorative theme or event in doing so member may choose to write the pmg expressing support for particular stamp proposal this usually results in referral to the advisory committee it is not uncomm on for members to introduce congressional resolutions encouraging the commemoration of specific subject in the 108th congress 28 resolutions for this purpose were introduced in the 109th congress 23 resolutions were introduced however cong ressional endorsement of proposal accords it special status in the committees deliberations the house committee on oversight and government reform has di scouraged members from intr oducing bills endorsing the issuance of new commemorative stamps for the 110th congress the committees rule 20 reads the committee has adopted the policy that the determination of the subject matter of commemorative stamps is properly for consideration by the postmaster general and that the

proposals for the issuance of commemorative stamps and new semipostal issues it is suggested that recommendations for the issuance of commemorative stamps be submitted to the postmaster general8 thus in the house when commemorative stamp bill is introduced it is referred the committee which takes further action on the bill criteria for selecting commemorative stamps the citizens stamp advisory committ ee receives about 50000 nominations each year and gives special attention to those submitted by congress or other legislative bodies as basis for its recommendation to the postmaster general the advisory committee uses 12 criteria when considering commemorative stamp subjects they are it is general policy that us pos tage stamps and stationery primarily will feature american or

commemorative stamps in order to encourage stamp collecting usps maintains philatelic centers in more than 300 population centers in the united states and in 7 foreign countries while it is feasible to track the gross revenues usps gets from the sale of commemorative issues determining how many stamps ar saved ie not used for postage is difficult this is because commemorative sales and usage ar interchangeable with and not counted separately from other stamps and other forms of postagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20221crs6 in an attempt to gain some knowledge of the contribution its commemorative program makes to its bottom line usps has tried number of approaches to measure the retention rate for commemorative stamps befo re 1989 clerks collected intent to retain data from customers on six to eight issues pe r year and projected retention revenues from the responses in the following years usps launched quarterly surveys of representative sample of approximate ly 60000 households asking them to report the stamps they bought and those they intended to retain this wa s an expensive approach however in part because 84 of the households reported that they retained stamps and thus analysts could learn little from them bout relative appeal of various types of issues in 1999 usps launched what it termed more costeffective design using 10250 quarterly surveys 61 of which were to go to hous eholds prescreened by market research company to be stamp retaining households the resulting reve nue estimates are still inexact and because of frequent methodologi cal changes cannot be directly compared however there seems to be ample evidence that the commemorative postage stamp program provides net revenues measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars for usps according to usps estimates retention revenues have been as follows year retained revenues 1998 1899 million 1999 2151 million 2000 2718 million 2001 1986 million 2002 1738 million 2003 1561 million
