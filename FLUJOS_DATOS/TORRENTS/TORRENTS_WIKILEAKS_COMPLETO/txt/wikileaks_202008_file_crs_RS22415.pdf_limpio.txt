g343g561s part of its budgets for fy2007 and fy2008 the bush administration has proposed that the commodity futures trading commission cftc be funded by transaction fee on futures contracts rather than by appropriated funds the cftc is the federal regulator of the futures markets where financial contracts based on the price of commodities currencies interest rates and other financial indicators are traded its budget authority for fy2007 is 98 million for fy2008 the administration has requested an increase to 116 million in recognition of growth and change in the markets that the agency regulates the same futures transaction fee proposal was included in the administrations fy2003 budget but was not enacted by congress indeed every administration since ronald reagans has called unsuccessfully for such fee g22g145g142g561g21g146g163g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g8g142g142g561 the fy2007 budget did not specify any particular fee amount or rate but simply notes that the proposed fee would cover the cost of the cftcs regulatory activities1 assuming that this means the entire cftc budget and that uniform fee is to be imposed on each futures and options contract traded on us futures exchanges fee of 51 per contract would have been required to cover the cftcs fy2006 budget or fee of 67 to cover the proposed increase to 127 million2 this calculation is based on trading volumes reported by the cftc for fy2005 1554 billion futures contracts and 353 million options3 for fy 2008 the administration proposes smaller feeenough to cover the costs of two cftc functions market oversight and clearing and intermediary oversight which are projected to account for 55 million or 47 of the agencys 116 million budget request4 using the same calculation performed above fee of about 3 per contract would be sufficient how significant is fee of this magnitude in the context of futures trading futures contract size varies according to the underlying commodity but the amounts involved in single contract are substantial for example corn futures contract on the chicago board of trade represents 5000 bushels of corn prices are quoted in increments of 14 cent per bushel called the tick size meaning that the smallest possible price fluctuation is 1250 per contract on the chicago mercantile exchange futures contract based on the standard and poors sps 500 stock index represents 250 times the current sp index value the tick size is 01 index point so that the minimum price fluctuation per contract is 25 of course over the life of contract prices normally fluctuate much more than single tick when the sp 500currently about 1400 rises or falls by 05 each futures contract changes in value by 1750 assuming 7 index points times 250 the fee would also be quite small in relation to other trading costs on the chicago board of trade exchange and clearing fees average about 50 per contract 5 the brokerage fees paid by 1 the budget for fiscal year 2007 appendix p 1119 2 since cftc funding was by continuing resolution in fy2007 the 127 million figure was not approved by congress 3 stock options are not included in this total they are traded on securities exchanges regulated by the sec and are subject to transaction fees that are earmarked to support the secs budget 4 the budget for fiscal year 2008 appendix p 1040 5 cbot 2005 volume

g344g561traders who are not exchange members are subject to negotiation but generally range from about 5 per contract for discount broker to several times that amount for fullservice brokerage

fees that fund the securities and exchange commission sec which regulates stock and bond markets there are three principal fees 1 all sales of stock on us exchange or on nasdaq are subject to fee in the form of percentage of the sale price 2 corporations pay percentage of the value of new stock or bonds registered with the sec prior to sale to the public and 3 certain merger and tender offer transactions are subject to fees the sec is required to adjust the fee rates periodically to ensure that the amount collected is approximately equal to the agencys budget when the fees are collected they go to special offsetting account available to appropriators not to the treasurys general fund as result of the fee collections direct appropriations are used to fund the sec the rates were most recently adjusted in february 2007 for stock sales the fee is 1530 per million dollars or 00015 for registration of new securities and mergers the rate is 3070 per million or 0003 of transaction value

directly from federal regulationusers of the futures marketshould bear the cost of that regulation not the general taxpayer the benefits of financial regulation in terms of investor confidence and deterrence of fraud and price manipulation are wellrecognized the administrations budget notes that the cftc is the only federal financial regulator that does not derive its funding from the specialized entities it regulates 6 the futures industry opposes the fee on the grounds that it will make us futures exchanges less competitive visavis foreign exchanges and the offexchange or overthecounter market according to john damgard president of the fu tures industry association the proposed tax on futures transactions would raise the costs of doing business on regulated futures exchanges and could discourage institutions and individuals from using futures contracts to manage their risks institutional players today have many choices if exchangetraded products become less cost efficient they can choose to do business in the overthecounter derivatives markets or move to more costefficient markets 7 opponents of the fee also note that the futures exchanges themselves have regulatory functions which are paid for by the trader membership and that there are additional fees to fund the national futures association nfa selfregulatory organization 8 6 ibid 7 fia strongly opposes proposed tax on futures transactions futures industry association press release feb 7 2006 8 the nfa is analogous to the national association of secu rities dealers nasd in securities markets

competitive environment foreign futures markets have grown rapidly in recent years and in 2005 accounted for the majority of futures contracts traded9 this does not imply however that foreign growth has come at the expense of us markets in 2005 us futures volume grew by 254 while nonus volume rose by 65 similarly many contracts traded in the unregulated overthecounter market compete directly with exchangetraded products but there is indication as yet that either market has reached saturation point rather than poaching from each other it appears that both markets are attracting new customers the question is whether the competitive balance among these markets is so delicate that even small increase in transaction costs could trigger f light from us futures exchanges it is hard to imagine that any exchange customer contemplating an investment that stands to gain or lose hundreds or thousands of dollars in single day will be deterred by an additional cost of three to seven cents for exchange members whose trading costs are much lower than those of outsiders primarily because they do not pay brokerage fees the proposed fee would have proportionately greater impact but it is not clear that there would be any significant effect on trading decisions the securities market fees that fund the sec cannot be directly compared with the proposed futures fee sec fees are percentages of trade value and they are spread over many more investors firms and market professionals than would be the case in the futures industry however it may be worth noting that the secs budget has more than doubled since the enron scandals and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 10 and that fee rates were raised at the same pace without any marked impact on trading volumes or liquidity the administrations fy2007 budget called for the fee to be set at level to avoid inhibiting the markets competitiveness11 standard percontract fee at the level needed to fund the cftc at its present size or at the size proposed by the administrations fy2008 budget appears likely to meet that test g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 mark jickling
