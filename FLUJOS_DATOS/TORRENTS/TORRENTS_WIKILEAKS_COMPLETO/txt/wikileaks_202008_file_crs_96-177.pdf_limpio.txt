that the mission of the ne w force should be tied to specific benchmarks in the peace implementation process since dayton the civilian side of peace implementation has been challenged by the scope of

pressure bosnian croats agreed to dissolve their hercegbosnia parastate and merge its functions into the federation by august 31 1996 little discernabl progress toward this goal was achieved until

establishment of unified police forc crackdown on organized crime rampant in west mostar and reported ly linked with local government officials and the return of refugees to their homes however few of

the most difficult issues in integrating the federation mistrus t between the two armies still lingers from the war they fought against each other just over two years ago the arbih wants the

and in sarajevo and mostar the republika srpska the republika srpska the other entity within bosnia herzegovina moved more rapidly to set up its structures and start legislative work after the
