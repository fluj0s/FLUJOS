defense and trade division february 10 2005 abstract indias economy has shown relatively healthy growth since 1991 when an economic crisis caused the government to implement various economic reforms yet many analysts view indias economy as falling below its potential especially when compared to country such as china which has achieved far greater economic success over the past decade the united states is indias largest trading partner india is relatively minor us trading partner although us oﬃcials argue that it could be potentially large market if india implemented further economic reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs215021 unless otherwise noted data on india are on fisc year basis that runs from april to march 2 the central governments budget deficit as percent of gdp averaged

congress this repor t will be updated as events warrant indias economy upon achieving independence from british ru in 1947 india pursued policies that sought to assert government planning over most sectors of the economy and strove to promote relative economic selfsufficiency these policies included extensive government spending on infrastructure the promotion of governmentowned companies pervasive regulatory authority over private sector i nvestment and extensive use of trade and investment barriers to protect local firms from foreign competition while these policies achieved some economic goals s uch as rapid industrializati on the overall effect was to promote widespread inefficiency throug hout the economy eg unprofitable staterun firms and constrained private sector and to greatly restrict the level of foreign direct investment fdi in india indias real gdp growth was relatively stagnant during the 1970s averaging about 27 piecemeal ec onomic reforms and increased government spending during the 1980s helped boost average real gdp growth to 601 1991 economic crisis and reforms india suffered major economic crisis in 1991 largely due to the effects of oil price shocks resulting from the 1990 gulf war the collapse of the soviet union major trading partner and source of foreign aid and sharp depletion of its foreign exchange reserves caused largely by large and continuing government budget deficits2 the economic crisis led the indian government to cut the budget deficit and implement number of economic reforms including sharp cuts in

more than 60 of indias software and service exports go to north america mainly to the united states10 comparisons between india and china many analysts argue that indias economy has failed to live up to its potential especially relative to other developing countries such as china which has comp arable population size but has enjoyed far greater economic development in recent years in 1990 indias economy gdp on ppp basis was about threequarters the size of chinas but by 2003 it had fa llen to 44 of chinas size indias living standards per capita gdp on ppp basis were slightly greater than chinas in 1990 but by 2003 they had fallen to about half of chinas india made small gains in fdi flows relative to china from 1990 to 2003 rising from 2 to 7 however the total level of fdi stock in china remains substantially higher than in india in fact fdi flows to china in 2003 alone nearly 54 billion were 54 higher the cumulative stock of fdi in india thr ough 2003 about 35 billion many economists attribute the sharp widening economic gaps be tween india and china to differences in the pace and scope of economic and trade reform s undertaken by each country where china has substantially reformed its trade and investment regimes which has contributed to sharp rises in gdp growth trade and fdi flows indias economic reforms have been far less comprehensive and effective for example chinas average tariff has fallen from 43 in 1992 to12 in 2002 indias aver age tariff during this period dropped substantially from 128 to 32 but still re mains among the highest in the
