divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30553federal excise tax on telephone service history summary the federal excise tax on telephone service applies qually to general and toll local and longdistance telephone service the tax is levied at 3 percent rate and is permanent part of our revenue structure the tax was first imposed in 1898 because of revenue needs brought about by the spanishamerican war this initial tax of 1 cent for calls costing more than 15 cents applied only to longdistance servi ce and was repealed in 1902 revenue needs to prepare for world war i saw the reintr oduction of the tax in 1914 the tax rate was increased at the time america entered the first world war it was not until 1924 that the tax was again repealed depression reduced federa l government receipts and led to the reintroduction of the tax in 1932 in 1941 just before america entered world war ii rates were increased and the tax was extended so that it also applied to cal telephone service for the first time during the war tax ra tes rose to 15 on cal telephone service and 25 on long distance service when the charge was more than 24 cents telephone taxes have b een continuously collected since this period review of federal excises in 1965 brought about reduction in the tax rate and scheduled date for elimination in 1969 however revenue needs resulting from the vietnam conflict not only caused extension of the tax but resulted in higher tax rates large budget deficits in the 1970s 1980s nd 1990s resulted in repeated extensions and postponement of the taxs repeal in 1990 the tax became permanent part of the federal revenue struct ure at 3 tax rate in the current congress confluence of even ts has led to renewed interest in the federal excise tax on communication services the joint committee on taxation has issued report including three possible options for changes to the tax study by the congressional budget office discusses the possible elimination of the tax bills in both the house and the senate have been introduced calling for the taxs repeal including hr 1898 any additional change s made to the tax will be reflected in an updated report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30553contents s p

telephone service history it is popular but erroneous belief th at the federal excise tax on telephone service1 is earmarked for defense spending in fact the revenues that flow from this tax go into the general fund of the united states and are used to pay for general government expenditures whether fo r national defense or for nondefense programs however there are reasons wh this erroneous belief developed the history of the telephone excise tax shows that it has been enacted primarily at times when our national defense re quirements have sharply increased such as during the

but that reductions in expenditures w ould not occur in the short term pay for our military forces could be expected to continue for some time and there was need to provide capital for reconstruction to our allies in europe thus this tax measure was redrafted the redrafte d act not only continued the telephone excise tax but did so at increased rates that were graduated for the first time13 while

1987 the report concluded that the communications excise tax caused economic distortions and inequities between house holds and that there wa s policy rationale for retaining the tax the report also suggested three alternatives to the private communication service exemption if the tax were to be extended since current law created differential tax trea tment of private and nonpriv ate communication services in the report there was call for modifying or repealing some of the exemptions of current law if the tax was to be exte nded since the exemptions had not been reviewed in recent

in the communication excise tax during the 107th and 108th congresses however confluen ce of events has led to renewed interest in this tax during the 109th congress this resurgence in interest in the communications excise tax is predicated on the fact that new technologies and marketing practices have emerged in r ecent years among the technology and marketing practice changes are current law provides private communication services with exemption from the federal excise tax larger companies may thus be able to purchase telephone quipment that reduces both their communication costs and their federal excise tax liability technological change has blurred the lines between taxable and tax exempt service for example in the case of voip voice over internet protocol voice transmissions are sent in the form of packets of information and are indistingu ishable from text messages or mails which are taxexempt companies now offer bundles of service which can include both communication services which are subject to the excise tax along with other services ie cable tv dsl wireless internet access and text messaging not subject to tax in some cases newer marketing plans include the option forconsumers to purchase time that is usable nationwide without long distance charges the internal revenue code defi nes taxable long distance communication rvices as having both the features of time and distance as result the internal revenue service has lost most of those court cases in which ta xpayers have requested refund of the communications excise taxes previously paid in january 2005 the staff of the joint committee on taxation issued report designed to offer options to improve tax compliance and reform tax expenditures included were three possible options for ch anges to the federal excise tax imposed on communication services 35 the three proposals either clarified the existing tax or extended the tax to newer communication t echnologies with resultant increase in
