now impossi ble school lawyer says12 the special educator 1 may 23 1997 discipline provisions in new idea cause seri ous concerns 12 the special educator 1 june 6 1997these provisions were included in idea due to congressional findings that children with disabilities were of ten not receiving an education or were receiving an inappropriate education the house and sena reports for pl 94142 bot h noted statistics indicating that there were more than eight million children with disabilities and that only 39 million such children are receiving an appropriate educati on 17 million handicapped children are receiving educational servi ces at all and 25 milli on handicapped children are receiving an ina ppropriate education2 in addition at the time of enactment of pl 94142 there were number of judicial deci sions finding constitutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providing education for childre n without disabilities3 in fact one of these decisions mills v board of education involved seven school age children who had been excluded from the public schools and had been labeled as behavior problems ment ally retarded emotionally disturbed or hyperactive and received education the di strict court found that this denial of an education was denial of constitutional due process ideas due process protections against school unilaterally ceasing services to child with disability do not mean that school officials have options regarding disciplining such children currently school personnel may suspend child with disability for up to ten days place child with disability in an interim alternative educational setting for up to forty five days for situati ons involving weapons and drugs ask hearing officer to order child to be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to forty five days if it is demonstrated that the child is substantially likely to injure himself or others in his current placement conduct manifestation determination review to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavior is not manifestation of disability long term disciplinary action such as long term suspension or expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease although the idea amendments of 1997 did provide more flexibility for the schools in dealing with children with disabilities who commit acts subject to discipline some school officials have argued that th amendments did not go far enough4 this has given rise to proposal to amend idea in addition to the livingston amendment senators gorton and faircloth proposed an amendment to hr 2646 bill to amend the internal revenue code to allow ta xfree expenditures from edu cation individual retirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98636crs3 5for more detailed discussion of this amendment see jones individuals with disabilities education act proposed amendment on uniform disciplinary policies crs rep 98 385a may 5 1998accounts for elementary and secondary school expenses the amendment which was withdrawn would have allowed state and local educational agencies to establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline for all children within their jurisdiction including children with disab ilities and was identical to an amendment offered and defeated during idea reauthorization last year5 interim alternative educat ional placement amendment representative livingston has proposed an amendment to the individuals with disabilities education act 20 usc 1400 et seq which would add new category to the current provisions on interim alterna tive educational placements essentially this new subsection would allow schools to place child with disability in an interim alternative educational placement if the child intentionally exhibits violent behavior that has resulted or could ve resulted in physical injury to the child or others while at school or at school functi on the amendment also eliminates the current requirement that child with disability can be placed by sc hool in an interim lternative educational placement for maximum of 45 days if this amendment was enacted it would pr ovide the schools with significantly more discretion regarding the placement of ch ildren with disabilities who had violated disciplinary rules the school on its own aut hority would be able to remove child with disability from his or her current placemen t to an interim alte rnative educational placement for the same amount of time that child without disability would be subject to discipline in several situations where child with disability brought weapon to school or school function current law where child with disability brought drugs to school or school function current law or where child with disability intentionally exhibits violent behavior that has resulted in or could have re sulted in physical injury to the child or to others while at school or at school function under th jurisdiction of st ate or local agency proposed amendment the authority of hearing officer is unchanged regarding ordering change in placement to an interim alternative ducation setting for 45 days when the school has demonstrated by substantial evidence that maintaining the current placement of such child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others the house report for hr 4274 hre p 105635 discusses the proposed amendment and states the bill includes language amending the individuals with disabilities education act to give local education agencies flexibility to move child with disabilities to an alternative educational setting in situations where that child exhibitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98636crs4 620 usc 1415fj 720 usc 1414d1b 820 usc 1415k3violent behavior the behavior covered by this provision is limited to that which occurs at school or school function the fort yfive day limit does not apply to sections 615k1aiii 615k1aiiii and 615k1aii iii an example of situation covered would be where child with disability strikes with the intent to harm his or her teacher the provision is not intended to cover situations such as where child with epilepsy strikes his or her teacher while experiencing seizure there is some ambiguity concerning the use of the word intentionally in the proposed amendment since intent is often diffi cult to determine particularly if mental disabilities are involved howe ver the report language wh ich illustrates the type of situations meant to be covered and those not cove red provides some guidance although this amendment would give the schools more flexibility with regard to placement generally it does not otherwise chan ge the due process requirements of the act for example parent would still have th right under 20 usc 1415b6 to present complaint regarding the education or placem ent of the child with disability this complaint would be heard by hearing officer and there is right to appeal to federal court6 under current law 20 usc 1415k7 when parent requests hearing to challenge the interim alternative educational setting or the manifestation determination the child stays put in the interim alternative education setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or the expiration of the time period provided for in paragraph 1aii since the livingston amendment eliminates the 45 day period as described in paragraph 1aii the amendment would keep the child in the interim alternative education setting until the hearing officers decision the interim alternative education placement must also meet the requirements of 20 usc 1415k3 this subsection states th at alternative educati onal settings are to be determined by the iep individualized edu cation program team the iep team is composed of at least one regular education t eacher at least one special education teacher representative of the lea local education agency an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results the childs parents and wherever appropriate the child with disability7 in addition the inter im alternative educational setting is to be selected so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum although in another setting and to continue to receive those services and modifications including those described in the childs current iep that will enable the child to meet the ieps goals this setting is also to include services and modifications designed to address the inappropriate beha vior so that it does not reoccur8
