represented an historic powersharing agreement worked out by the party floor leaders in consultation with their party colleagues was presented to the senate sres 8 on january 5 2001 and agreed to the same day the agreement was clarified by leadership colloquy on january 8 2001 in may of 2001 senator james jeffords of vermont decided to leave the republican party to become an independent and to support the democratic conference on organizational issues control of the senate shifted to the democratic party the power shift annulled major portions of the powersharing agreement after

background twice during the 107th congress the senate had to address fundamental organizational questions first the 2000 senatorial elections produced tied senate necessitating the negotiation of powersharing agreement to govern many aspects of committee and floor activities then the decision of senator james jeffords of vermont to change his party affiliation from republican to independent gave senate democrats numerical control of the body the shift in party strength caused second round of negotiations about the organization and operation of the senate this report reviews these events and the agreements made by the senate on organizational and procedural issues1 107th congress opening day actions the november 2000 elections caused the senate to be tied with 50 republicans and 50 democrats only once before in 1881 had the two major parties been equally represented in the senate due to significant changes in senate procedures 1881 precedents had little relevance to the contemporary senate the issue of senate organization was further complicated by the election of richard b cheney as vice president when the 107th congress convened on january 3 2001 the incumbent vice president albert gore jr presided until vice presidentelect cheney was sworn in on january 20 although titular democratic majority existed because vice president gore was available to break tie votes that could have tried to organize the senate any such organizational proposals might well have been blocked and even if adopted could have been reversed under republican auspices once vice president cheney was in the chair to break ties the senate often negotiates formal and informal agreements to govern the legislative agenda and its consideration of individual measures similar negotiations about the organization of the senate began informally in late november between the democratic leader senator tom daschle dsd and the republican leader senator trent lott rms talks continued after the senate convened and proposals under 1 this report was written in 2001 by paul rundquist specialist at the congressional research service dr rundquist has retired but the listed author can respond to inquiries on the subject crs2 consideration by the two leaders were discussed at meetings of the party conferences2 when the 107th congress first convened senator daschle recognized as majority leader by vice president gore who was presiding made attempt to replace the incumbent senate administrative officers with democratic nominees in an unprecedented step the senate agreed to sres 3 electing senator robert c byrd dwv president pro tempore upon the adoption of the resolution and simultaneously electing senator strom thurmond rsc president pro tempore to be effective at noon on january 20 the senate designated committee chairmen on opening day given that senate committees are continuing bodies senators who had served on panels as of the end of the 106th congress retained their positions and roles when the 107th congress convened several committee chairmen did not return to the 107th congress however and for administrative reasons it was necessary for the senate at minimum to designate acting committee chairs to replace them pending election of the full committee slates the senate went further in adopting sres 7 naming democratic committee chairs on all senate committees to serve as such through january 20 and naming republican chairs to assume their posts at noon on that day the powersharing agreement sres 8 january 5 2001 two days later on the afternoon of january 5 2001 senator daschle presented to the senate sres 8 measure to provide the organizational basis for powersharing in the senate when the parties were equally divided the resolution was agreed to later that day3 its provisions applied for the duration of the 107th congress unless senate party strength changed the key provisions of the resolution were committees all senate committees had equal numbers of republicans and democrats full committee chair could discharge subcommittee from further consideration of measure or matter if it was not reported because of tie vote budgets and office space for all committees were equally divided with overall committee budgets to remain within historic levels4 2 mark preston and paul kane senate strikes historic deal roll call vol 46 jan 8

127128 crs3 equal ratios on committees were to remain for the duration of the 107th congress unless the senate voting strength of the parties changed whereupon committee assignments and party ratios were to be renegotiated discharging measures or matters if measure or nomination had not been reported because of tie vote in committee the majority or minority leader after consultation with committee leaders could move to discharge the committee from further consideration of that measure or nomination5 this discharge motion was to be debatable for 4 hours equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders after the expiration or yielding back of time the senate would vote on the discharge motion without any intervening action motion or debate if the committee were discharged by majority vote the measure or matter would be placed on the appropriate senate calendar to await further parliamentary actions agenda control and cloture the agreement prohibited cloture motion from being filed on any amendable item of business during the first 12 hours it was debated the agreement required both party leaders to seek to attain an equal balance of the interests of the two parties in scheduling and considering senate legislative and executive business the agreement also noted that the motion to proceed to any calendar item shall continue to be considered the prerogative of the majority leader although the resolution qualified this statement with the observation that senate rules do not prohibit the right of the democratic leader or any other senator to move to proceed to any item 5 the senate made use of this procedure to act on the nomination of theodore b olson to be solicitor general of the united states the motion to report his nomination favorably from the senate judiciary committee failed on tie vote 99 audrey hudson senate panel at impasse on olson washington times may 18 2001 p 1 eric lictbau bushs pick for solicitor general is

agreement was further clarified and other new procedures were announced senator harry reid dnv the assistant democratic floor leader received unanimous consent to enter printed colloquy between senators daschle and lott into the congressional record and to direct that the permanent congressional record be corrected to provide for its inclusion with the resolution when it passed the senate last friday6 in addition to summarizing the provisions of sres 8 the colloquy covered several more issues filling the amendment tree limits on floor leaders in perhaps the most significant announcement the two leaders pledged to refrain from using their preferential rights of recognition to fill the amendment tree in an effort to block consideration of controversial issues7 senator lott on behalf of both leaders declared the policy in the written colloquy it is our intention that the senate have full and vigorous debates in this 107th congress and that the right of all senators to have their amendments considered will be honored we have therefore jointly agreed that neither leader nor their designees in the absence of the leader will offer consecutive amendments to fill the amendment tree so as to deprive either side of the right to offer an amendment we both agree that nothing in this resolution or colloquy limits the majority leaders right to amend nonrelevant amendment nor does it limit the sponsor of that nonrelevant amendment from responding with further amendment after the majority leaders amendment or amendments are disposed of8 minority senators as presiding officers the party leaders agreed that minority party senators would be permitted to serve as presiding officers of the senate this ended during the powersharing period the senate practice of the past 2 decades under which only majority party senators served as temporary presiding officers party access to space in the capitol the colloquy further specified that both parties would have equal access to common space in the capitol complex to 6 sen reid remarks in the senate congressional record vol 147 jan 8 2001 p 144 7 an amendment tree is diagram showing the number and types of

call vote to come to the floor and record their position senator daschle explained on the floor madam president this has been constant lament of both senator lott and myself he has attempted to address it on occasion i have always been supportive of the effort to try to be as managerial with these votes as we can be he and i have talked about it as recently as just prior to the break my intent is to do all that we can to terminate the vote at the end of 20 minutes i think that is ample time if we are going to be efficient in the use of our time we cannot allow these votes to drag on this has been source of increasing concern to personally so we will do our utmostsin fact i will ask that the votes be terminated at the end of 20 minutes i hope senators can be made aware that will be the policy and we will implement it if there is an emergency we can accommodate that but i also will attempt to impose some discipline with regard to the votes we will attempt to implement that beginning tomorrow i put all senators on notice in that regard12 senator daschle announced his intention to continue having senators from both parties share the duties of presiding over senate

assignment problem before the senate agreed to sres 120 committees continue to be in state of legislative limbo officially organized as they were at the end of the 106th congress veteran senators who received new committee assignments at the start of the 107th congress are not allowed to vote on their new panels and freshman senators technically do not have any assignments for the purposes of holding hearings those senators have been invited to attend as unofficial committee members aides said paul kane negotiations over senate committee resolution hit snag roll call vol 46 june 14 2001 p 1 technically the only assignments senators continued crs8 3 of the resolution expressly provided that regardless of any future shifts in party strength in the senate during the 107th congress existing agreements about the allocation of committee staff and funds made by committee chairs and ranking minority members would remain in effect unless modified by them disclosing blueslipped nominations the tradition of senatorial courtesy has long history under this practice the senate often declined to confirm presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approved the practice is purely customary one and not always followed by the senate the term blue slip derives from the blue buckslip that the senate judiciary committee uses to solicit senators comments on the suitability of nominees in their states customarily senators have been able to block such nominees without their objections being made publicly known this largely private custom became more formal and more public under terms of dear colleague letter announced by senators patrick leahy dvt and orrin hatch the chair and ranking minority member of the senate judiciary committee the blue slips that the judiciary committee has traditionally sent to home state senators to ask their views on nominees to be us attorneys us marshalls and federal judges will be treated as public information we both believe that such openness in the confirmation process will benefit the judiciary committee and the senate as whole further it is our intention that this policy of openness with regard to blue slips and the blue slip process continue in the future regardless of who is chairman or which party is in the majority in the senate therefore we write to inform you that the chairman of the judiciary committee with the full support of the former chairman and ranking republican member is exercising his authority to declare that the blue slip process shall longer be designated or treated as committee confidential18 due to the fact that the dear colleague letter related only to nominees considered by the judiciary committee the secrecy of senatorial courtesy requests on appropriate nominations that might be considered by other senate committees was not changed consideration of supreme court nominees discussions between the parties focused on possible ways to guarantee senate floor votes on nominations to fill any future vacancies on the supreme court senate democrats opposed any such formal guarantee and republican negotiators were reluctant to insist on vote to make this procedure formal part of the rules or of the organizing resolution the issue was ultimately addressed by another leahyhatch dear colleague letter 17 continued were guaranteed were those they held at the end of the 106th congress 18 letter from sens leahy and hatch printed in congressional record vol 147 june 29 2001 p 12588 making public the names of senators objecting to nominees under the informal blue slip process is in many respects development similar to the wider notification process now required for the senates informal hold process see crs report 98712 holds in the senate crs9 we are cognizant of the important constitutional role of the senate in connection with supreme court nominations we write as chairman and ranking republican member on the judiciary committee to inform you that we are prepared to examine carefully and assess such presidential nominations the judiciary committees traditional practice has been to report supreme court nominees to the senate once the committee has completed its consideration this has been true even in cases where supreme court nominees were opposed by majority of the judiciary committee we both recognize and have every intention of following the practices and precedents of the committee and the senate when considering supreme court nominees19 during his remarks on sres 120 senator daschle referred to the discussions about senate action on future supreme court nominations in the course of our negotiations number of our republican colleagues also raised concerns about how democrats would deal with potential supreme court nominations should that need arise second letter to which senators leahy and hatch agreed says clearly that all nominees to the supreme court will receive full and fair consideration this is the same position i stated publicly many times during our negotiations and i intend to see that the senate lives up to this commitment it has been the traditional practice of the judiciary committee to report supreme court nominees to the senate floor once the committee has completed its consideration this has been true even for number of nominees that were defeated in the judiciary committee now senators leahy and hatch have put in writing their intention that consideration of supreme court nominees will follow the practices and precedents of the judiciary committee and the senate in reaching this agreement we have avoided an unwise and unwarranted change to the standing rules of the senate and sweeping revision to the senates constitutional responsibility to review supreme court nominees20 space allocations with the shift in political control of the senate substantial concern was expressed about relocating committee staff with the new committees democratic majority staff moving into space previously occupied by committees republican staff the senate rules and administration committee announced that as in 1995 staff and equipment in committee rooms would be moved according to schedule in which staff would move to new majority or minority committee rooms first with equipment from their former offices following later21 19 letter from sens

28 2001 pp 1 28 crs10 the controversy surrounding changes in office space led to the inclusion of language in sres 120 recognizing the validity of committee space and staff allocation agreements between committee chairs and ranking minority members and continuing such agreements in force unless modified by subsequent agreements between each committees leaders an additional dear colleague letter this one signed by senators christopher dodd dct and mitch mcconnell rky the chair and ranking member of the senate rules and administration committee clarified the space issue the letter reaffirmed the authority of the rules and administration committee over space allocation in senate office buildings but left to committee chairs the duty to implement any space allocation decisions regarding their panels in the allocation of office space to senate committees pursuant to rule xxv of the standing rules of the senate it is the practice of the committee on rules and administration to assign all such space to the chairman of each committee further the rules committee does not traditionally intervene in the internal space allocation decisions of the committees and therefore is not party to any agreements between the chair and ranking member regarding space allocation it is the intent of the committee on rules and administration to continue such practice22 small business committee renamed in separate and unrelated action on june 29 the senate agreed to sres 123 resolution amending senate rule xxv to change the name of the senate committee on small business to the committee on small business and entrepreneurship the resolution was submitted by senators john kerry dma and christopher bond rmo the chair and ranking minority members of the committee senator kerry observed that adding entrepreneurship to the committee on small businesss name will more accurately reflect the committees valuable role in helping to foster and promote economic development by including entrepreneurial companies and the spirit of entrepreneurship in the united states23 sres 123 did not alter the committees jurisdiction nomination standing order by unanimous consent on august 2 2001 the senate agreed to standing order for the 107th congress governing the referral of future nominations to the post of assistant secretary of the army for civil works the order provided that when such nomination is received by the senate it is to be referred to the committee on armed services and if the armed services committee reports the nomination is then to be sequentially referred to the committee on environment and public works for period of 20 session days if not reported by the environment and public works committee within that period the nomination is to be discharged and placed on the senates executive calendar24 typically 22 letter from sens dodd and mcconnell congressional record vol 147 june 29 2001 p 12588 23 sen kerry remarks in the senate

small number of instances to two or more committees by unanimous consent on casebycase basis25 additional issues agreement to sres 120 did not complete senate work on reorganization under democratic control the two party conferences approved new assignments for their members including the designation of senator jeffords as the new chair of the senate environment and public works committee on july 1026 floor action to approve the new committee chairs was thought to be necessary under the terms of sres 120 some committees decided to revise the internal rules they adopted earlier in the 107th congress27 the senate did not name conferees through its traditional mechanisms during the powersharing period the parliamentary stages though which the senate passes to get to conference are usually handled by unanimous consent this consent includes granting authority to the presiding officer to appoint conferees based on the recommendations of the relevant committee and floor leaders disputes between the parties on the appropriate ratio between republicans and democrats on senate conference delegations caused the senate to avoid going to conference with the house during the powersharing period only two measures went to conference up through the july fourth recess the budget resolution and the reconciliation bill conference procedures for which were governed by the budget act after the shift in party control there was not public objection to having the chair appoint conferees of course private negotiations among senators and party leaders about the size and composition of conference delegations continued conclusion the powersharing agreement was an experiment the new senate organization resolution departed as well from many established practices the success of any senate organizational settlement depends upon its adaptability and that of its members to changing circumstances the comments of senator lott on the powersharing agreement can also apply to the provisions of sres 120 there are those in this chamber who will not agree with that we are going to support this resolution there are those in this chamber who probably will not agree with senator daschle that this is enough some will say it is too much others will say it is not enough who is to say the day may come when we will say well yes we didnt do that right we didnt figure some of the things that 25 the nomination to the post of assistant secretary of the army for civil works was referred to the committee on armed services and then to the committee on environment and public works

reflecting the addition of one additional democratic slot on the committee might happen or the way the rules might be used or abused if that happens then we will have to deal with it senator daschle
