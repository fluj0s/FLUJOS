of valence all long engram running stems from the pc being out of valence we want him in the body he was in when the incident occurred its not necessarily his own valence its the valence he was in when the incident occurred being out of valence is the pcs way of denying responsibility for his part in the incident being in valence just permits him to run the pictures as long as he occupies body and thinks of it as himself hes not really being himself when the pc who is out of valence sees pictures they are small and thin they have nothing to do with him if the auditor is not aware of such phenomena he can make classic errors the pc sees picture the auditor never asks where are you viewing it from or what body do you occupy in the picture not asking these things the auditor thinks its all going fine when in fact the picture is way over there and very thin youre not really running the picture the pc saw you are running safe version with the condition that he never view it from the original viewpoint so it never asises pcs who are run this way on any process never get anyplace dont pay any attention the pc has from someone elses viewpoint it wont do any good conceptual processes have the virtue of moving pc straight back to the picture he is in that is of charging up the chain he is stuck in that makes him out of valence from that point on eventually he will wind up in his own valence in picture if the auditor doesnt make him handle it he doesnt know his business there are several approaches to this if you understand it the track is the series of pictures made by the person from the viewpoint he was occupying at the time of the incidents on it trying to run stuff from other viewpoints is just running branch lines and he wont get erasures his engrams are pictures of engrams and youre trying to erase picture that never occurred though the engram occurred there is simple method to handle this have you ever seen picture from inside the body you were in at the time the pc frequently will say well yes and he tells you about one or several take one of them and ask if theres anything about the auditing question he answered which is unknown run all the unknownnesses out of the incident you can find out that the incident has been with him ever since theres fundamental method find out if he has been in one and put him back in it if hes never been in an engram you can run recall an arc break this will unstack the track to point where hed find himself in the upsetting incident then you can flatten it another one which will do it easily get the idea of action out in front of you 200300 ft away conceive of an action 200300 ft behind you what happened to the mass it shifted you could follow this through use processes of inspection at distance and eventually get the guy to where hed be in the picture he was stuck in that peels down the valence people like repetitive processes if the pc has bad leg but never mentions it dont run it but if he complains about it there is something you can run ask if he has any odd pressures which will be his chronic psychosomatic illness probably his hidden standard run this vicious process who would have an unknown motion around the leg this sort of question will 100 knock out chronic somatics if flattened it also works on absence of sensation another thing to do is see on the meter if motion confusion action etc reads well then make command who would have an unknown action etc around his leg pc who will not view his bank has tremendous intolerance of notions and unknowns motion can become intolerable to someone who is fixated on the subject of pain he believes that all motion adds up to pain pain does involve motion the strange thing is that someone who is trying to stop motion to prevent pain is doing the thing that makes pain occur if the thetan wasnt trying to stop motion around the body the body would experience pain notice with pain how it seems to result from two opposing motions as with all things people dont like it because they havent had enough of it in handling pc who has bank visible these factors must be present 1 he has an intolerance of pain hence of motion and unknowns 2 he has fantastic importance attached to motions and unknowns we see this but notis it people being very concerned about some particular unknown area the most unknownness there can be the most important one is the unknownness of motion being hit by surprise tends to give stuck somatic because of the unknownness of it those engrams which are most seriously stuck on the track are the ones composed of incomprehensibles the pc may keep getting fixed ideas about it in an effort to figure it out pretended knowingness substitutes for nonconfront of unknownness the importance of the unknownness and motion depends on the degree of threat to survival this goes back to the idea that one must survive which is the basic idiocy any way of getting version of unknown and motion together combined with valences gives you process to get the pc into his own pictures in space opera when theyre conditioning thetans theres sometimes tumbler incident this is pretty common hes thrown down shaft which is lighted at the top and bottom spinning as he goes he gets lot of pictures of white spots as he tries to stop himself all the way down so he gets bright spots stuck around him not very far from him at various distances up to 100 feet if you tell someone to look closer in than 200 feet hes likely to run into them there are lots of ways to get somebody dislocated delusory bank like dreams is an effort to locate oneself this is why 8c and tr10 make him feel better nearly every picture pc has is an effort to locate himself at point where he got dislocated unknown time plays major role tool having the pc spot unknown pictures shakes up all these efforts to locate himself by means of them hell get pictures flying by in all directions universe could be seen as an effort to locate oneself therefore because thetan doesnt have to be located its dirty trick to give him the idea he has to be located its very senior concept in processing that thetan does not have to if one could just cog on that out of the blue hed be clear but if you did begin to have that thought youd probably stop because the thought would set unknown motions going trying 101 to locate another thetan must be basic overt but one that is prior to the overtmotivator sequence you try to get the concept i dont have to be located and you run up against the om phenomena you could run think of locating somebody this first runs off as good actions then it goes over into overts then into dispersal where he gets hard to audit if you clean up motion and unknownness well which cleans up valences the pc reaches back and starts changing his mind about these things and we get change of mind processing the route we are looking for is the route to change of mind the thetan just asising his old considerations what boobytraps this is that the pc must have escaped from innumerable pictures and gone off the track in numerous places he doesnt have concept of where hes been and what hes done and the unknownness of that is important because if hes escaped from these things they must have been dangerous thetan proves that things are dangerous by the fact that he ran away people in fact do not escape to the degree that things are dangerous they escape to the degree that they are unknown and have unacceptable motion wars are dangerous but known so people will play that game in war there is an effort to dislocate and locate by the enemy and by ones own commanders one could dream up substitute for war using the principle of locate vs dislocate fix and unfix the whole idea of power stems from the ability to hold location this is an idea of thetans which has become actualized in the physical universe the ability to hold the location depends in part on ones belief that one can hold it the power of body of troops on hilltop depends on their ability to hold their position and to make the enemy hold his position they have to take responsibility for holding the enemy where they are but they usually dont bother to pin the enemy down countries look weak after wars because one terminal has dislodged the other you always get generated energy by thrusting something at something that wont move this applies in the mest or the theta universe thetans friction against life and lifes thrust against him does generate energy the force of an engine depends on the strength of the elements that restrain the motion of the piston eg the bearings etc to the degree thetan resists position he gets picture to get solid 3d picture in pc get him to find time when there were two forces each trying to push the other away or find an argument the pc had with someone girls get the idea that they have to know something about electricity to understand scientology and since theyve gotten out of the habit of fighting holding the front line etc they think they shouldnt know much about power force etc this is not true girls generate more power and sparks than anything else in this society they will get firmly attached to an idea and not let go of it matter how much you argue it banks are charged and bother people to the degree that one has tried to hold positions and knock people off positions bank is like mold of what one tried to dislodge or hold position against when one is dislodged one dramatizes with picture from another position an out of valence picture if you try to force someone into the engram you only restimulate the forces pushing him away from it if you can take him up to it on gradient he can get into it you take the pc on gradient of what led up to the incident or masses and it will go back with confront into thenness and longer impinge on nowness 102 l ron hubbard type 3 idate12961 volnum1 issue52 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec52 clearing breakthrough 6109c12 shspec52 clearing breakthrough hubbard adds engram running to routine 3 gives some details of process sequences arcb processes 1 what have you been unable to tell an auditor 2 what has an auditor failed to do 3 what did an auditor do more details on goals running and ruds engram running is important in clearing because lrh has learned that somatic cannot be unburdened somatic is where it is at the tension and velocity that it is and it is nowhere else it is totally independent of all other incidents it discharges only as what it is and not as any lock and matter how thoroughly it has been unburdened it will come on with the same intensity when you find it where it is all the pcs hidden standards and ptps of long duration stem from the first engram you will contact after the prehav assessment generalized process has ever made those chronic somatics less when you run the engram the pcs ptp of long duration will vanish and that is the only way it will be solved the isness of the situation is in the time and place of the situation and nowhere else the engram necessary to resolve the case didnt resolve the case in 1950 because it was not on the goalterminal line of the pc it wasnt an earlier incident the engram necessary to resolve the case is on the goalterminal line of the pc so unless you found the goalterminal line of the pc the engrams arent going to reduce rapidly if youre not on the goalterminal line of the pc and hes not in valence youre in for 75 hours of reduction in running engrams in r3 the engrams run easily because theyre on the pcs goalterminal line youve got the pc in the valence that was the destructive valence of his case what has been solved is 1 how do you get pc in valence on an engram 2 how do you find an engram on the case that will run 3 what is the engram necessary to resolve the case the reason youve had trouble with engrams in the past is than they werent on the goalterminal line the pc was out of valence and the engrams were associated with other chains now this is all handled as long as the auditor has reality on what bank looks like if he has this reality hell know for instance that the pcs misemotion while running as engram stems from the engram not from what the auditor is doing and why you can get the pcs resistance to the forward motion of the action off the engram by running it backwards then the pc can confront more of it this data has nothing to do with occlusion of cases an occluded case is just one who is stuck in an occluded engram something with black field there is condition of pretended knowingness which can get in our road its super escape factor when the knowingness is too horrible and the notknowingness is too thick and the person feels too stupid about it hes likely to dream it up such that it will have nothing unknown about it you wont get any of these with the prehav technique the keynote of an engram is the fact that the pc knows nothing about it pretended knowingness will get in your road and youll buy garbage then one day youll invalidate pcs data but do run the engram dont jerk the pcs attention off the engram when hes got all the unknownnesses out of it has more somatics have him go through it few times to see if theres anything 103 missing see if hes got sonic and all the other perceptions out of it dont try to force them to be there just note it so when youve run few more you can go back and run it perceptions are the last thing to turn on just be sure you get all the perceptions out of it eventually dont make it too real to the pc let it be comfortably real perception is something which turns off gradually somatics are right now l ron hubbard type 3 idate13961 volnum1 issue53 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000

the hcob 8feb60 honest people have rights too this has been so neglected on this planet that only criminals have rights at saint hill among the domestic staff the ones who had withholds always got rid of the good staff members it always works this way the ones with withholds will tell lies about the good ones and seek to get rid of them because they cant bend them down to their level good staff members are made nervous upset and uncertain about their future in the presence of insecure people spreading entheta withholds cause people to get individuated more and more to the point that theyre not even themselves guy who shoots ducks cant be duck the more individuation occurs the less likely person is to be able to walk out of anywhere its like backing up through succession of isolation rooms person to be in good shape must be able to be almost anything to the degree that you cant be something you have overts on it that you are withholding its well known in the motorcycle world that some people have so many overts against motorcycles that to touch one produces disaster you can stop automobile accidents by having the person reach and withdraw from car hell drive better and stop having accidents you could also run startchangestop on the vehicle this process could give you somatics as the overts start blowing the best way to blow overts is with the sec check because the overt only remains bad if its withheld wars get fought because its so horrible to have war that it gets put on automatic that is individuation from subject and loss of control of it if you can be something you wont have to become it theres another mechanism too after you backed yourself out of life to the end of the corridor you snap terminals and obsessively become the thing you were trying to leave this is valence closure its the withholding of overts that does it where you have pc whos loaded with withholds on sec check youve got someone who cant be and you are trying to find valences you cant find valences easily on someone who cant be but you can find the fixed valence hes in because its this mechanism the mechanism of ow causing valence closure that has led to his becoming that valence so you could find someones terminal without completing his sec check but hell be hard to get into session if hes got lots of withholds because of the resultant individuation he gets easily upset because he cant be pc and is critical of the auditor because he has withholds you can run what are you willing to be what would you rather not be two things will occur if you run it very much it will soften him up on security check because beingness and 104 withholds are opposed and one solves the other however it also walks the pc into his valence chain without identifying the chain so it can get him into engrams hes not ready to run you must remember that she somatic is where it is on the track and in other place and it will release only from that place so you can walk him away from that place on the track which keys it out or you can walk him into that place on the track and asis it thats all processes can do with somatics withholds will often soften up and knock out presenttime somatics by walking the person away from the area and maybe thats good thing he could be stuck tightly into an engram in life and you can move him out of it until youre got him in shape to run it out he could be so tightly in it he couldnt put his attention on the session the best approach to this is security check you could even run it on the basis of his chronic ptp somatic it knocks out his obsessive individuation this is an assist that walks him out of the valence hes been stuck in hes always got the chronic somatic on the chain of the valence which will be his terminal thats why you have to get the correct goal and terminal because theres only one valence chain in which hes stuck the end product of withholds is good communication not clear sec checks can be tailored to hit the area of the persons ptp so as to key it out so you can make progress with the case l ron hubbard type 3 idate19961 volnum1 issue55 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec55 q and period prehav sec checks arc break processes 6109c19 shspec55 q and period prehav sec checks arc break processes details on prehav processes with the 5way brackets and different flows you are trying to knock off the pcs obsessive valence which hes stuck in by some stuck flow eg sergeant always orders troops one orders him thus he gets stuck flow and eventually does something weird like becoming troop or inability to accept orders from officers if someone kept giving orders it would unstick the flow eventually flows are the mechanism by which someone snaps terminals and gets valence closure you run body continually it never runs you so youre in body one day you get reaction from body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body run you if you start consciously driving car youve been driving unconsciously ie you start taking the car somewhere instead of just letting the car take you all sorts of weird things are liable to happen you might lose your ability to drive temporarily in driving the car unconsciously youve already succumbed to stuck flow we have the idea that skill should be unconscious so one doesnt have to think this is big reactive trap when one has run out all the flows on terminal that the pc has as an obsessive valence youll have discharged the pcs compulsion to be interiorized into it or to command it or be unconscious about it the overt act motivator phenomenon has to be part and parcel of this stuck flow phenomenon eg sergeant tells his troops theyre going for picnic when they get out in the field they find they have to build fortifications the lies and prevarications are part of what causes the valence closure if you start teaching student about scientology and pushed bunch of false or misinterpreted data on him that would be an overt in order for the stuck flow to come about you have to have an individuation and unease an unconscious reaction plus something 105 unknown something hidden an overt in instruction at saint hill far instance on the auditor process beingness is in the middle of confusion so the process what are you willing to be what would you rather not be is limited process it picks the stable datum out of the confusion which is reverse auditing it is very good only on limited basis if you were going to run case with this youd have to run some 1a processes problems and sec check processes alternated see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a as part of the auditing commandsee also p 57 paragraph 4 for the theory behind this eg for long run use 1a what would you be willing to be b what would you rather not be 2a what would another be willing to be b what would another rather not be 3a what confusion could you confront b what confusion could another confront you can use problem or motion in the confront command instead of confusion whichever reads best to run whole case with it add two more commands the negative confront parts that could run the whole case to clear maybe after very long time if you ran it without the problems part it would run the pc right into engrams within few hours on withholds you first find some doingness eg fish around for anything he thought he should tell you that hes forgotten about clean up with 2wc if possible first asking what was it when was it what sort of thing would you find it hard to tell etc you could use peter williams version of ow think of something youve donewithheld for 3 or 4 cycles then is there anything youd care to tell to give the pc chance to get the withhold off you could use this latter after 2wc doesnt get it or you could use what is unknown about my reactions to shake it out clearing the auditor so the pc can talk to him you are not trying to run sec check on the pc however if you get read on withhold the pc tells what it was and it still reads you release it with to whom wasnt that known to whom shouldnt that be known this is the nastiest withhold process ever dreamed up this process cleans up basicbasic on the arc break chain what didnt an auditor do when what werent you able to tell an auditor when you can clean up the immediate session arc break with what werent you able to tell when or shorter process what didnt i do when what werent you able to tell when this is the final descendant of the discovery that communication is the most important corner of the arc triangle as long as you run recall its perfectly safe to run what werent you able to say but dont put it in the present or future or it will be an outofarc process eg what wouldnt you be able to say this could even be unanswerable you can use the past tense process with specific terminals eg what werent you able to tell your mother psychotics have gone sane on think of communicating with somebody run for 25 hours despite the stuck flow aspect but it wasnt communication that aberrated anybody it was the notcommunications so recall on the notcommunications operates as very powerful process to round it out as total valence process get the other flow what wasnt terminal able to tell you when that would be powerful valence splitter so skip prehav 13 as way to clean up ptps with present time environment terminals run the above prehav 13 is process which combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets relative to list of charged terminals see tape 6106c21 shspec17 106 theres booster to this the pc is in position where he is expecting somebody to do something because he is depending on somebody to do something if somebody doesnt do it hes left in she soup so in session for an auditor not to have done something and for him not to have been able to tell the auditor is frequent source of arc breaks running that out picks up all the times he wasnt in session and cleans up past sessions to make long run out of this use what didnt an auditor do when what didnt you do when and what werent you able to tell an auditor when what didnt an auditor tell you when that would made wellbalanced process to clean up the pcs auditing track she full dress parade would be to assess all the people who the pc is having arc breaks with take the best reading one and run it in the above commands this moves the valence out dont run it very long on any of these terminals or its dangerous use it especially on terminals who are connected to the pc but object to scientology if you put ritual ahead of getting auditing done you would be wrong every time form can get in your road the time for using perfect form is when everything is going well the whole world of diplomacy is world of form rather than doingness the idea that the safe thing to do is to adhere to ritual because then you are not responsible is the whole basis of diplomacy if you think form will get you out of trouble where you need wit you are wrong always put getting the job done ahead of doing it by the rules the rules will only fit majority of cases being well trained to use form doesnt excuse you from being clever when necessary staying within the auditors code l ron hubbard type 3 idate20961 volnum1 issue56 rev0 rdate000

that which is in the ken of reaction is in the knowledge of the pc that which will react is knowable an emeter can only react on those things which are instantly and immediately restimulated by the preclear himself the reason why you assess for an engram is not to find the hottest charge the reason you assess is to find out what is real to the pc what the pc can connect with emeters always used to be backed up with clever interrogation this is especially true in sec checks if something reacts it is real dont enforce reality on the pc contrary to what the pc says groupers give the pc an apparency that all time has jammed grouper is number of incidents becoming apparently located in one time instant the collapse of track that the pc experiences when they hit him doesnt in fact occur in session it occurred at some earlier track point the anatomy of grouper is commonly coldinstalled vacuum associated with implants person who has grouper has implanted people the only thing which can mash electricity like that is cold vacuum you could brainwash someone by smashing dry ice in his face and holding it there his bank would collapse cold is extreme stillness time is temperature temperature equals time equals motion therefore you must not run 107 nomotion particularly near grouper so all you can run in the vicinity of grouper is motion and time it doesnt necessarily work fast add unknownness to that and it really gets interesting you could ask when was the time unknown to you what havent you known about time what time was unknown to what person has time been unknown what motion wouldnt you care to undertake gives motion and restraint or what motion was unknown which runs surprises and produces mean somatics the grouper will look like its stacking up and getting worse matter what you are doing but its not thats just the apparency you could relieve the grouper by running out the auditor and the session where he hit it all you have to do to free up grouper is to find the picture that the pc isnt grouped in and run it this rehabs his confidence in his ability to run pictures what does grouper look like like an art gallery all of whose pictures were thrown in heap and glued there the incident which produces one is like this rocket jockey lying on bed being hit by electronic rays so as to prevent him from exteriorizing and going back to running one of those planes thats been strafing the capitol they do an implant in which he thinks hes being hit by moving rays when implant they move in cold vacuum on him and plow it straight into his body thetan doesnt move out of that easily especially if hes done it to others the incident is of person lying on bed with pictures flying at him in running it keep the pcs attention on the bed not the pictures find whether hes administering the implant or getting it keep his attention on the bed and off the pictures use what dont you know about that patient etc you can unveil grouper by running arc break straightwire flatten this before starting to run the grouper and always assess engrams dont take one up just because the pc seems in it dont run the grouper get the pc out of it pc is so fixated on it he is so sure it happened in session that he thinks the session should cure it it was intended when put there to keep the person from getting out of it what kind of person applies groupers just about everyone in space opera is liable to decide the enemys habit of exteriorizing from body thats been shot down getting new body etc must be stopped he must be made to forget the information specialized implanting was the answer the most antipathetic things about the implant are that its cold lonely black etc put those things together and you get grouper someone whos alone in his scout craft for few years has only his own pictures to look at hell selfaudit space itself does lot of brainwashing you hit meteorite shower and suddenly youre in space falling into the sun having just been hit with redhot object this mades hefty engram when they implant the guy its presented as big arc break betrayal etc he gets the implant and never knows if they are his pictures or theirs the pictures will all be of class hell be sure theyre not his which is nice trick he disowns them he takes responsibility for it he dramatizes the irresponsibility by saying it happened in the session and he can do nothing about it but you can always find other pictures he can run and some day hell run the overt side of it 108 grouper turns on with big somatic that makes the pc very uncomfortable this somatic can be turned off with what was unknown about that pain thats very good assist too pc whos gone into grouper can be hard to audit so its good thing to find out what hes in when running engrams look at why youre running particular engram its on terminal chain and should be run as what dont you know about it etc youre trying to get the pc as you to run package called valence the engram is the engram of the valence the pc is in so you should mention it while running it if you found as terminal looper you should use that in running it as what wasnt known to looper this also applies to running groupers its more serious problem when you have pc whos in grouper and you dont know his goal or terminal well go ahead and find the goal and terminal running engrams in scientology you run them more symbolically than verbally the same mechanisms are present as in book i bouncers groupers deniers callback etc you should use this trick when you find still picture direct the pcs attention to the motion on the other side of it or just before or after the egyptian area is bad one to get into because its confusing and violates the pcs beliefs it was space opera from one end to the other it was battleground between two space groups pcs have trouble running it because it violates their reality as gotten from history books lrh ran an incident of egyptians printing books of orders of the day from the invader force he knew there must be motion and sure enough he found battle after the death of the pharoah always audit the motion the heat never call for the still or the cold and youll keep your pc out of groupers it is what happens in the picture the picture is held in place by an avoidance of motion or notknownness on the subject of motion not by someone saying stay there you audit the

auditing if an auditor keeps going for total perfection in his auditing he will miss the state of acceptable mediocrity in his frantic figurefigure desperation for technical perfection it is better to do some personalized auditing with majority of rightnesses and have wins the pc forgives anything but auditing if the auditor is worried about the ritual instead of getting in comm with the pc the pc has person to talk to and goes out of session if the pc is already starting to tell you about his case before you get him in the chair dont worry about the formal procedures just audit the pc the session starts when the pc recognizes you as the auditor not when you say start of session difficulties in starting sessions always come because the auditor doesnt recognize the start of session the pc may be leery of going into session because hes been denied sessions too often but you can handle it with ruds if you see that pc is interested in his case and starting to talk to you about it youll see hes in session if if happens in public say im sorry heres my card come see at 200 tuesday this will work to have him not be arc broken lrhs difficulty is getting people out of session not into session if you work very hard to start session youll have 109 corresponding amount of trouble doing it how do you handle the situation of the pc telling you before youve started the session about his case you hear him out but not all the way theres difference between just listening to the pc and auditing the pc the liability of letting pc run on and on is that hell lower his havingness and slip downtone auditing consists in directing the attention of the pc your questions are what direct his attention to where you want him how do you interrogate you should have knowledge enough of the mind to know what to ask be smooth dont arc break him if hes nattering away about something you want to get him to look at his own overt you dont get far with direct what did you do you can always ask when did it all start you dont want to shift the pcs attention too abruptly you can ask him question he cant answer immediately and put him in the chair during his comm lag youve got to size up the situation obnose what needs handling and direct his attention there youll seem very smooth to the pc if you can shift his attention deftly without his awareness of being pushed around this gives you altitude you may be weak at directing the pcs attention because you have low reality on the pcs ability to direct it himself his attention must at one time have been restraining factor for keeping things from coming in on him when we get on the subject of something hes been restraining from coming in on him the pcs attention wanders or disperses because he cant control it because it has been overwhelmed thats what aberrated him if the auditor doesnt direct his attention it will be directed by the valence hes in and the valence will do god knows what with it if you leave session on automatic youre asking for it to be taken over by the valence dont blame the pc who has very little energy to exercise at this point for what goes wrong in the session you can almost predict how hell react once you know his terminal if you lose control of the session how do you direct the pcs attention the pc has put his hope for survival which is totally useless since he cant help surviving in beingness valence to do it for him so these beingnesses have lot of survival mixed up in them once you have survival on via however it becomes succumb valences actions are usually out of time it is incapable of change because its characteristics are all set for survival ie continuing unchanged past civilizations have tried to use punishment to change valence that doesnt work if you do break the valence you have nothing not even person an operating valence is better than nothing but person is far better genetic entity is super packaged valence meat body isnt necessarily bad body form it should be possible to smash it into wall without even bruising it if you can heal body with an assist it must have been the thetan who was perpetuating the process of destruction theres real liability in running meat body in our mechanized society unless one is in body oriented to fighting lions fixed condition of valence which is unchangeable and out of date will make an unhappy person medicine has never been able to handle readjustment of beings or handling valences processing does have an effect of valences which will object to it the most basic processes dont clear someone unless his valence gets audited out the pc is unaware of being who he is being the valence is of help to him it is an addiction to some skill and beingness package you cant excel when operating as valence because it is nonsentient operation an operation 110 in the absence of knowingness when thetan is overwhelmed and has totally given up so that he becomes the valence that did him in he cant even do good job as that valence because of his own overts against that valencebeingness the pcs basic impulse toward the valence is destruction of the valence every time the thetan wakes up even slightly in situation requiring decision it will be destructive decision for the valence this should make your job as an auditor very easy youll also understand the activities of men better and what you are trying to do is to direct the pcs attention toward eradication of all the points on the track which made him slave to valence if you fail to direct his attention theres nothing else there if you overwhelm him hell dramatize the valence the more you know about the valence the easier it is to audit the pc and to predict what the valence will do so when the pc does that you know youd better get ruds in you need ways to observe the pc to know better when hes out of session if hes in the valence that he dramatizes he has rudiment out you dont necessarily put ruds in at the exact point you see it if hes in the middle of some engram youd do better to direct his attention to keep control from the valence anything youre doing which detracts from directing the pcs attention overcoming valences rehabilitating the thetan so he can operate again is utterly unnecessary dont worry about directing your attention and your technical perfection do direct the pcs attention fortunately auditor and pc

field sec checks one can always add to sec checks but never subtract from it for given person depending on his interests and activities this gets complicated enough to be real to someone whos having difficulty in life there are lots of different sec checks for instance you could use the childrens sec check to help restore persons memory of childhood and get all the results freudian psychiatry sought if an auditor can run some process with great confidence of good results have him run that on every pc regardless of what the pc needs you try not to give him pc who can only be run on something else on sec checks you get fast wins this gives an auditor reality fast any auditor who has gotten tired of auditing or upset with auditing has had lot of loses someone who doesnt want to learn how to audit has had long series of disasters with trying to help people an auditor who has an exaggerated idea about what ought to happen in session who gets frantic changes processes continually has had loses with auditing so you want to give him something that gets fast result in order to restore their confidence in their ability to help sec check is good way to get results on pcs who just never cognite who never give you what do you know about their cases especially if you use sec checks that hit on the pcs particular areas you can even cure psychosomatic illness by using the ptp of long duration as the subject of the sec check looking for hidden standards which is the one thing on which his attention is fixed you pay attention when the pc tells you what would have to happen for him to know scientology works which could be something on any of the eight dynamics 111 when you get one that is extensional ie where something would have to happen to someone else youll find that it is easy to audit this on sec check you get all their overts on the other terminal with it this works very well because youre separating valences and terminals withholds add up to lots more than just withholds overts secrecies individuations and games conditions were asking the person to straighten out his relationships with another terminal the normal sec check is addressed to the individual versus his society or family because its what people would consider reprehensible that makes it withhold you could have special mores between husband and wife or auditor and pc if person transgresses against moral code he individuates if he individuates too obsessively he snaps terminals and becomes it the security check clears this all up to get rid of chronic somatic you must first find something the person really thinks is wrong that he wants to recover from you cant assume that if its wrong he wants it fixed it could well be solution to some other problem it could be service fac this generally starts somewhere way back with some series of withholds illnesses are protests against life so you can tailor sec check to reach the areas of life the person is protesting against and run it the psychosomatic illness will disappear it does take lot of figurefigure and detective work the sort of problem about case that many auditors just love so get the thing the person wants to handle trace it back to some area or activity you are looking for activities which had to do with changing the position of mass the massier it is and the more change of positions the more aberrative it is sec check the persons handling of masses and changes of space if you have clue on that go into his most confused motional areas if hes now motionless find what he was doing prior to becoming so motionless and find an area of intolerable activity run sec check on that area of activity get all the items and terminals in that area and invent all possible overts against them crude way to do it is to use modification of an existing sec check it is better still to mock up new one using all the crimes you could do in an area of tight mores you could handle someone whose goal is to fix up his memory both by what wouldnt you mind forgetting plus ow on various terminals with deficient perception plus find who didnt remember well or who insisted he remember and sec check him on those people this will spring him into his what do you know on the subject you can assume if he doesnt cognite that hes really pinned down on the area by withholds from you from the area and even from himself the sec check will increase his freedom to know which is the opposite of the notknowingness enforced by ow so make list of all the items you can think of from his area of difficulty ask if hes done anything to or interfered with those items and activities his cognition may come out little by little or at last with bang the rule is that any zone of life with which person is having difficulty is fruitful area for security check any area where the person is having difficulty hes stupid stupidity is notknowingness which occurs through overts but the overt has to be hidden so its withheld so withholds add up to stupidity so he has trouble in the area 112 you must always assume psychosomatic difficulty is solution after the fact of confusion confusion consists of change of position of particles in time and space predicted or unpredicted if they are unpredicted changes in space youll have confusion the pc puts attention on one particle as stable datum this is fine except that he ends up with psychosomatic complaint to resolve the complaint find the prior confusion and do good security check on the things in the vicinity of the confusion to get off the overts that made it necessary to pull in the somatic all sec checks add up to very thorough keyouts l ron hubbard type 3 idate27961 volnum1 issue59 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec59 q and period

effort to withhold self get involved with it and become it 1 cut comm with something 2 postulate separateness 3 use effort to withhold self 4 get involved with it 5 become it whenever you are avoiding something youll be making energy pictures of it whenever you see it so the bank gets full of the thing you are avoiding and youll start being it you never look at the pictures of the thing so they dont asis so they can become rather dominant you have to have postulated that the thing can overwhelm you before this sequence can start when you start auditing somebody he cant see that he has done anything to the objects he is being but as he confronts more he can individuate himself from his pictures valences start to separate and on sec checking he will come up with more withholds an individual is not responsible for the things that have overwhelmed him to the point where he is being them processing lets him asis some of his pictures so that he can stop being the thing and see that he has overts against it so getting more withholds on subsequent sec checks is an index of case progress theta clear is someone who operates exterior to body without need of body theta clears are clear on all dynamics the state of mest clear has been upgraded because of the stability of the state operating thetan is different state clear would be someone who didnt have bank troubling him and was not influenced in favor of one dynamic over another and not dependent on mest for survival ot would be someone who is in state of being quite manipulative of mest starter of whirlwinds etc this doesnt necessarily mean hes unaberrated the best statement of this definition is that ot someone who has consequences connected with creation it has been state which others have feared and have sought to suppress theres fourth state which is release this is when youve found the pcs goal terminal and level and run sec check on him when release has the idea that his new freedom is really betrayal he hasnt quite made it he must know he wont get any worse mest clear is one who has completed routine 3 he has persistent fn hed have to have had his ptp of long duration handled 113 the common denominator of all cases that have bodies is that their attitudes of havingness are incorrect they have anxieties about getting food air etc you clear clear of hunger clear tends to go onto the fourth dynamic with crash he gets very aware of the need to do something about it clears tend to lead and infect people with their enthusiasm the only problem is that the clears reality is beyond that of the surrounding populace the most you can realistically do is to get them started and have an hgc to clear them the clear will go on past awareness of the problems of the fourth dynamic to the fifth seventh and eighth then back to the sixth by this time hell be upwards towards theta clear if at this point he felt there was need to do something about mankind hed do it eg straightening out peoples games conditions etc the best thing you can do for society is to rehabilitate knowingness so people can work things out for themselves those solutions which restore comprehension are the only ones which really work in the long run the more people who are responsible able to decide able to tell right from wrong the better things will be person has as much power as he can trust himself to have at the lower and of the spectrum you have criminal who responds only to exterior stimuli in this case theres sentience left so where many people are at this level all you get in confusion the randomity of mest the police make the error of granting him more beingness than is warranted the trouble is that society is rigged for people to be responsible in if there are large numbers of people being irresponsible in it its hard to see how it can go on running if you want to disestablish chaos all you need to do is to return responsibility to the area l ron hubbard type 3 idate28961 volnum1

29sep61 hgc allowed processes when you run into the imponderables the pc whose case doesnt move youre tempted to use some extraordinary solution instead of finding the gross auditing error this permits the error to go uncorrected youll be adding new errors to old ones the error may be that the pc isnt doing the auditing command which could involve the pc doing something different or doing something else in addition to it if the pc has hidden standard hell do something else to produce an effect on his hidden standard when pc has ptp of long duration hell always try to create an effect on it with whatever auditing command has been given so you cant just audit over it you have to get ruds in and also be curious to know what the pc is doing with the command the pc with ptp of long duration will apply the auditing command not to his terminal but to terminal of his problem it is good idea to ask the pc what his idea is of the terminal he is running to be sure its the one you assessed now that you have the rule of the prior confusion you have an undercut to the ptp of long duration the terminal the pc is complaining of is the solution to the prior confusion and is stillness nomotion point you dont audit stillnesses anyway you get rid of the chronic somatic by finding the prior confusion by assessment take the personnel of the prior confusion and sec check them this is bit similar to 114 doing ow on the terminal of the ptp but better since it is auditing confusion not stillness this might even apply to engrams you could find where the fellow is stuck assess the prior confusion and sec check its terminals thats just guess at present dont q and with the pc telling you he cant confront the confusion get the terminals involved and sec check them on check made up to apply to the possible overts general ow may be too permissive to get him to confront it so thats the anatomy of stuck point on the track this also predicts that lot of confusion went on before the person picked up the valence hes in theres possibility that you might get the valence and goal to blow by looking at it but its not likely the earlier on the track they were the beefier they were as thetans and the more confusion there would be it gets pretty unreal when you get them looking at it now if they can even confront it at all other gross auditing errors which could be preventing the pc from making progress could be grossly out ruds or the auditor having an attitude that drives the pc out the bottom or try to audit scientologist who has been around awhile without

prior confusion 6110c04 shspec61 the prior confusion chronic somatic is the stuck point on the time track which is the stable datum of prior confusion so is hidden standard its easy to miss this because the confusion is earlier and is confusing the stable datum isnt in the middle of it if its aberrative you can always adopt stable datum in the middle of confusion its the one chosen later that sticks you on the track this isnt necessarily logical it is true because it is observed to be true not because of any theoretical reason the way to blow the chronic somatic is to blow the confusion immediately before its start it may be tricky to get the pc to look at the confusion not at the stable datum his attention bounces to later periods the confusion has lot of unknownness in it which may be masked by lot of pretended knowingness when looking for the prior confusion dont get just whatever was there right before it may be six months earlier lots of odd forgettingness turns up as you look forgettingness is caused be inability to confront motion the confusion area is notknow area which the guy handles with know later even if its stupid and painful its still knowingness all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cure for mysteries one can get feeling of relief following confusion that isnt really much relieved it can be just from getting knownness following confusion chronic somatic can be knowingness if its being used as hidden standard it is being used for knowingness there must have been some confusion before it this could be an explanation for the phenomenon of getting somatics following misunderstood words it can take some time for the pc to sort out when the somatic started and what the prior confusion was about when it started you can ask when did you notice it earlier or what happened before you noticed its not repetitive command you can even by assessment get the pc to look at the confusion accurately enough so it will asis and blow 118 where the pc is not making progress on routine 3 you can bet that the pc has not done and is not doing the auditing command the pc may be being the auditing command he does the command and applies it to some area of the mind or body and looks at it to see if anything happened you are auditing pc whose attention is fixed on some special area and is doing something extra with the command it indicates outruds since the pc isnt under the auditors control but is putting in selfaudit step on each cycle any pc who hasnt gone clear in 150 hours is doing this he may resist telling the auditor what hes doing also if you ask him when did you start to notice the thing hes complaining of and he gives nonsequitur answer you can see him bounce out of the confusion and up to pt this tells you that you are on the right track you have to direct his attention to the right area to get the confusion dont just give him carte blanche to natter about the terminal hes fixated on keep guiding him to the occluded area that precedes the somatic or whatever ask about confusions or upsets or whatever you can get this sounds like long process this phenomenon can show up when you run an engram you start with the motionless point and search around to find the earlier action parts just auditing the motionless part with the chronic somatic in it wont resolve it even when running an ordinary engram as part of routine 3 if part of the engram sticks get the earlier part of the engram more basic question arises here how does person get stuck on the track in the first place and why is one on time track at all could it be that theres confusion at the beginning what is time maybe its retreat from confusion we did not care to confront persons ability to confront confusion could just blow chronic somatics but its not to be counted on it might be necessary to get several hidden standards out of the way so it might be well to clean them up well before getting into prehave levels using prior confusion

withhold one is nonsecurity checkable its just necessary to find the areas where he has what he considers to be overts if he doesnt read on standard sec check it just means those things arent transgressions against his moral code criminals moral code is about the reverse of lawabiding persons all pcs have moral codes against which they have transgressed youll only get withholds off case when you locate the code against which the pc has transgressed withhold is an unannounced transgression against moral code by which the person was bound moral code is that series of agreements to which person has subscribed in order to guarantee the survival of group man has learned down the track that where he has agreed on proper conduct he has survived and where he hasnt he hasnt survived so people agree on what is moral ie survivalconducive actions the us was founded on an agreement the constitution wherever it has been breached the country has gotten in trouble the reason for the trouble is that there arent any other agreements than the basic agreement there arent modified agreements you start with moral code which eventually gets interpreted and altered and people longer knew what was moral it thus 116 got to be confusion people tried to enforce it but the confusion increased finally people dispersed and left the group and formed or entered other groups there they got new moral codes which eventually got diluted time marched on and more confusion entered etc etc the cycle of action of civilizations is 1 an agreement on optimum conduct 2 disbanding of the group 3 formation of new group with new agreement on optimum conduct 4 disintegration of this agreement 5 etc etc the disintegration occurs because of the individuation that results from overts moral codes can also disintegrate when attacked by another code that gets imposed on them eg by colonialists on native peoples one reason auditors find scientologists harder to audit than nonscientologists is that when you flub youve transgressed against the survival codes of the group this is why the last two pages of hcoww form 3 straighten out oldtime scientologists who natter about scientology the most important code to the person is the one by which he is currently living if you transgress against the code of your group you tend to feel like an outsider if the group is scientology the transgression prevents one from making progress in auditing transgression of moral code separates the transgressor from free communication with the group the seriousness of the transgression is monitored by the degree of cut comm and impossibility of communicating which is accomplished by pretending to be member of the group when hes transgressed he individuates and thus the group disintegrates another element of this is coaction mutual action toward common goal the crew of ship is good until it has been through some common danger business group could get cohered if management let everyone in on the attacks against them otherwise not group becomes group when it encounters danger to its survival the common denominator of the moral codes and of transgression is one must not injure the survival of fellow group member therefore manager or leader of group tends to be isolated from the group because of the occasional necessity for injuring the survival of group member who has transgressed against the others if the leader has led slightly detached life so he hasnt been affected by the offenders transgressions he commits an unmotivated overt when he kicks him out he gets these undisclosed overts against exgroup members he seldom tells the group why the ousted group member has to be ousted because he thinks it will be too enturbulative this is so widely true that man has accepted the idea of the loneliness of command as natural when it isnt you can change groups leader but if the new leader changes the mores of the group there will be trouble the leader of the group can destroy it this leads to the popularity of such things as socialism and communism why is the old soldier always degraded its not because the military in itself is bad its because hes group member who is longer part of the group his old mores longer 117 apply he is degraded not even because of his overts he is degraded because when person is longer part of group he feels automatically that he must have overts against it and was driven out of it even if he didnt have any overts because the result exists people feel that the crime must have existed people will feel responsible for effects they havent really caused this is the same mechanism so youll find yourself processing someone at times who feels he has tremendous overts against group which you as an auditor cant find on the meter its simply because he is longer member of the group whose purpose may have ended hell be very happy to get off his transgressions because it will make his longer being member ok it justifies the state hes in what actions are necessary to cohere group coaction in the direction of survival with two or more people inevitably results in social more if one of the group dies the other in group of two will feel he must have transgressed and will be glad to find what his overts were so that it makes sense to be longer member the coaction doesnt even have to be toward mutual survival it can be opposed eg two fighter pilots who are enemies they will have certain fellowfeeling and if they withhold their failure to kill the other from their own groups theyve got bit individuated from the groups etc so this gets complex on the basis of agreement what is agreement it is two or more people making the same postulate stick if they go into mutual action toward survival they have coaction and they confuse one with another they dont quite distinguish whose is whose and they misown action in their vicinity engine drivers start sounding like engines after awhile they can be unidentified by having them get the idea of mutual action with the motor that is the source of overt acts you have mutual action with something else you do something cruel to that with which you have mutual action and you experience the somatic thats the exact mechanics of the overtmotivator sequence after youve had lot of group coaction you embark upon cruel action to that with which you have coacted and you will get the somatic the group dramatizes it with you must be punished for your act but thats not part of the mechanism religionists who push the golden rule are forcing into existence something that already exists overtmotivator sequences become very pronounced when cruel actions against ones group members ars engaged in while withholding one is really member of the group but engages in cruel action against another member and tries to back out why does one try to withhold it is because he doesnt want the effect of the coaction he tries to individuate disowns the coaction in an effort to avoid the motivator he doesnt want the somatics of coaction that experience has taught him will inevitably occur were down to fundamentals of nondifferentiation and identification he identifies his action with every group members action so he withholds self in an effort to escape if you ask him to recognize his coaction with the group member he has injured the coaction prior to the overt the overt will blow the more commotion action withholds and nonsense preceded his overt act the more it will hang up and the more he will try to withhold it he can only suffer from his overt 118 because of former coaction because he is involved with mutual action toward survival every time he has tried to back out of mutual action he has sought to deny the mutuality of the action he thinks he can avoid the overtmotivator sequence by denying it so he individuates you have to knock out the individuation before he can walk out the action he takes to escape punishment is the action which settles in the punishment withholds and overts will become visible as you uncover the confusion and coaction which preceded the overt when he blows the withhold he can move again on the time track every time he withholds he parks himself on the time track so it eventually becomes one big now which is the reactive mind he has never really succeeded in individuating from any group he has belonged to therefore all groups newly formed are formed by transgressors so if scientologists could get off that mechanism they could form the first true group since the beginning of the universe one reason withhold sticks on the track is that its noaction nomotion point when the pc has picture where nothing is happening get the earlier commotion or confusion and the overt will show up one can withhold oneself as well as data thoughts or deeds or objects withhold of self is the commonest when you clear somebody you clear the identities which the person has teamed up with and their withholds and nowimsupposedtos theres process that hits at this find something the person has identified with something tell him to think of mutual action with first the one thing then the other and the identifications will spring apart fifteen or twenty other subjects will emerge as you go dont q and with them stay with the original two broader simpler process would be tell group you are longer part

following the revelation of withholds is mechanism of older groups by which they sought to enforce their mores it is bad mechanism since it encourages withholding if you the auditor are worried about your own withholds or trying to present an image of sinlessness because youre scientologist youll q and at times with the pcs withholds and start mutual avoidance of certain subjects the auditor must have the courage to ask the sec check questions matter how crude and nasty it seems to do so its rough enough if your withholds are off if they arent youll back off the subject altogether auditors instructors etc can back off from being sec checked because of fear of loss of reputation or image theyll then slack off sec checking other people if you find someone who is ducking being sec checked he will also duck sec checking but it is not true that to be good auditor you must never have done anything wrong if you let yourself take that viewpoint you are surrendering to an oughttobe which action would slow the progress of scientology by putting every good auditor in lousy case shape along with every good exec 119 the mechanism by which man has been governed had in it the idea that man was evil and therefore has to be held in line by evil practices they never noticed that the evil in the world stemmed from holding men in line society without arc is society which will inevitably have crime man is good but only to the degree that he is in arc with existence the primary mechanism someone uses who is out of arc with existence yet trying to survive is to withhold society is forced apart to the degree that people are made guilty to prevent murder dont hang murderers make it unnecessary for people to resign from the human race people get grievances about things theres agency in society to remedy the grievance and they end up committing desperate overts the unintentional withhold is something that occurs when the person is not able to tell anybody though hes willing to this could be because one is there or one is listening it happens in insane asylums all the time you get this peculiar kind of withhold which you mustnt overlook in sec checking then there is kind of withhold where the pc knew that he was withholding because hed be punished if others knew or theres withhold which would damage his beingness or reputation not necessarily doingness thats withheld it could be beingness group is based on communication withholds all add up to cut communication so it falls apart to the degree that there is communication up to point withholds appear to cohere group sec check is dedicated to the restoration of communication if comm were restored totally in any past group the pc will longer be hung in that group he will not be parked on the track so he will be more able to be part of his present group the group you are most concerned with in auditing isnt the group called scientology its the little group which is the session when the individual is too individuated end develops an unintentional withhold in that group or the auditor conducts himself in such way as to bring about punishment because of withhold or crime or demands specious reactions from the pc the auditor has shot the session group auditing is third dynamic activity for the session to be good group youve got to get all three kinds of withholds off 1 unintentional withholds when one will listen to the pc hence the process what werent you able to tell an auditor 2 reputational withholds defense of ones beingness eg ones family came from the wrong side of the tracks 3 withholds for fear of punishment the only thing that can deteriorate graph is arc breaks the basis of an arc break is being made to have an unintentional withhold from that immediate group thats more serious evidently than an intentional withhold as far as session results go then theres the enforced withhold on the basis of improved state someone who is pretending to audit gets result but seeks to convince the pc that hes much better here the pc thinks hed better not say otherwise then youve got the withhold of protecting beingness this is the reputational withhold its 120 pretty rare on this basis but you can also have the propitiative pc who tells the auditor its all fine because he doesnt want to make the auditor feel bad when actually he still has his headache or whatever rudiments are aimed at handling these withholds the arc break questions ask for unintentional withholds what couldnt you tell an auditor and what didnt an auditor do the latter question is going after an auditor in games condition unintentional withhold and games condition questions go together compartmenting question you take the words get the charge off them you get reads off any phrases in it then if it still reads the read is on the question never leave question still reading it will throw the pc out of session immediately you can leave it for the next session but tell the pc that thats what you are doing another important point is to select sec check relevant to the pcs activities sec check against the reality of the pc taking into account the moral codes by which he lives never treat sec checking as repetitive process its for getting off withholds so vary the question and be real be inquisitive nosey and imaginative theres an overt act consisting of enforcing the mores of group to make others withhold thats the makeguilty action which also acts as withhold eg girl says i never raped anybody ive been raped and the question keeps reading dont q and by auditing out the rape get the overt which is gotten by whom have you made guilty of rape youll find the makeguilties lie on an actual done anyway so always come back to the original question with the same wording as you first used if pc thinks question is insulting he is telling you that he has done the thing l ron hubbard type 3 idate101061 volnum1 issue64 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec64 problems intensives 6110c10 shspec64 problems intensives supposing that dianetics and scientology did everything they were supposed to do what would your problem have been before you came into it your own personal problem that is the approach you should use on pe course give all the firsts of scientology and dianetics give very broad complete description then ask what is the problem that would make you come into scientology this is assuming that everything that was said about scientology was true you restimulate their ptp of long duration then ask what is your problem the problem is now staring them in the face and in some percentage they will for the first time recognize the source of some discomfort then give them some data about processing and get them into the hgc that should be the first lecture on pe course because it gives stable datum conditional but desirable stable datum on certain number you will produce startling change theres new addition to pc assessment sheet it gets you list of things you take the bestreading and run list of processes on it reassess the list of thinks and repeat the process it gets the prior confusion and handles it with ruds problems processes and sec check on the personnel in the prior confusion the first list asks for times the pcs life changed ask when the changes occurred 121 each of them will be handled with the problem that existed just prior as well as the prior confusion the change was solution get the changes of lifestyle also the when doesnt have to be very precise now get the bestreading change and ask what problem did you have immediately before that change get him to state the problem not just fact it should have question mystery about it how why or what then just run the problems rud process until flat eg when the somatic that got going quiets down it gets at the ptp of long duration which gives hidden standards run it by the ta after it is flat ask what was the confusion in your life just before that then assess the people in that confusion the idea of listing and asking for another person in the confusion will put the pc back in the confusion and stop him from skidding forward and youll wind up with list of personnel you sec check the list this requires some acumen to mock up the sec check its really glorified ow and you could just run ow except that it has some danger since its running against terminal which hasnt been assessed so its better to sec check if terminal is not on goals line running it can beef up case unless run on sec check the sec check neednt be awfully extensive though doing it very thoroughly will give better result you continue the process with the next bestreading change etc when all is done we could say that the person was release and has hidden standards and would do auditing commands this fully supplants routine 1a as way to handle problems the reason you are handling hidden standards is not because the individual has his attention stuck someplace nor because the pc vias your auditing commands through it though these things are true you are running it because to the pc its an oracle hes not really analytically checking his eyesight every session to see if auditing is making it better his eyesight somatic knows and thats the only data there is observation and experience have bearing on his knowingness its more than ptp of long duration of specialized sort its pretty vicious proposition the pc does it every command or every session if he does it every command it knows and he doesnt so he has to consult it to find out he does it in life all the time too unbeknownst to you he judges goodness and badness truth and falsity by whether he gets somatic which comes from some circuit or other criminal knows right from wrong because circuit is restimulated or not therefore the cops are crazy because the little green light in his skull lit up when he was about to commit his crime hes baffled when hes arrested he knows nobody can tell right from wrong or he knows by the way he feels whether hes doing right or wrong the way people get that way is thus 1 they are thetan as themselves 2 they get so invalidated or invalidate others so much that they get overwhelmed with their own inval and they pick up valence 3 somatic overwhelm while being the valence he got hell of somatic an impact is easily substituted for knowingness it can also seem to be punishment for some unknown crime so hes got terrible problem what has he done to be punished for it he doesnt know he just feels guilty anyway impact seems like knowingness ones own knowingness as valence is in validated so hes got an impact knowingness which he keeps 122 around which is part of an engram on his goalsterminal chain the engram presents problem because it is not reachable because its in the middle of the goalsterminal chain since the pcs own knowingness has been invalidated he can only go on being validated in his knowingness as circuit but he has to be careful because it knows more than he does superstitious peoples who have very little and have been knocked around badly have catalogs of superstitions which are sort of third dynamic circuits this moves out into secondary state the circuit is now audible it dictates to him gives him orders aloud this is the final result of valence which has been overwhelmed by somatic which has been overwhelmed by another thinkingness etc see fig 4 it is not an endless number of valences but there can be nearly endless number of hidden standards real hidden standard is something the pc consults with each command or each session consults is the clue the hidden standards key in because of problems of magnitude or because of prior confusion the usual course of human events is the individual went through lot of trouble and lot of confusion he couldnt quite figure any part of it out and it left him hung with problem which he up and solved by changing his life in some way he may get the idea when theres change there must have been problem before there isnt always problem otherdetermined changes dont necessarily have problems before them but they wont assess on the meter he solves the problem with hidden standard where does circuit come from theyre different from valences valence answers the question of who to be or how to be right with beingness circuit answers the question without changing beingness how do you know when youre right circuit furnishes information valence furnishes beingness circuit can step up from furnishing information to furnishing orders and then it can step up to furnishing orders below the level of consciousness always expressed faintly at least in somatics most people live in haunted houses they think there are other thetans in their bodies because of the commands of circuits circuit can be set up easily and isnt bad thing unless its out of his control forgotten as to authorship etc controlling the fellow with him taking responsibility for it thetan can do anything circuit can do and more the basic of circuit trouble is setting something up and taking responsibility and leaving it on automatic if hes done this he has some godawful problem just before he did it just before he has the problem he was in fantastic confusion and before the confusion he had fantastic numbers of withholds from the people in the confusion those conditions must all be present to get circuit trouble and you have to pay attention to all of them to unravel the circuits to get into that state hed have to have been pretty active and to have started withholding everything from everybody he was in contact with about everything or about something special hes not free to communicate things start going wrong since his comm is messed up life got very confused eventually became an awful problem then he solved the problem if he had enough overts and withholds hed blow which brought about change the change is now the tag you can use to get back to all the stuff behind it figure 4 dwindling spiral of circuit formation 1 the thetan being as himself 2 he gets invalidatedoverwhelmed as himself 3 he picks up valence 4 the valence gets overwhelmed by somatic 5 the valences knowingness is invalidated 6 the pc as the valence sets up circuit to use the impact knowingness of the somatic as senior source of knowledge so he can go on being validated in his knowingness the circuit now does the observing and knowing 7 the circuit becomes audible 8 the circuit gives orders 9 the circuit gives orders below the level of consciousness always expressed at least faintly in somatics 123 the point of change is withdrawal so is the original ow both key in circuits cf page 47 where lrh points out that circuits are substitute for confront and gives more data about what circuits are used for the whole story is repetitive outofcommunication with periscope that looks for him and tells him thats the hidden standard seen as circuit experience must not approach this person and since auditing is an experience he never allows it to approach you are trying to audit the person not the via thus case gain is slow at best the problems intensive hits all this and knocks the circuits out of the road it can be done with imprecise auditing and it starts with pc assessment which is less accusative to the new pc than sec check assessment he gets familiar with sec checks on gradient dealing with specific people interesting areas to him it makes practically any level of case processable and can be done by the most selfconscious auditor l ron hubbard type 3

to the auditor to know what is going on is the pcs life if you have new pc new to scientology do one even if the pc is just new to you do one it gives the pc some confidence to know that his auditor knows something about him it should be done by the auditor who is going to audit that pc this will relieve the pcs sneaking suspicion that the auditor knows nothing about him if the pc knows about something it isnt aberrative so this is negative assessment since whatever is known there isnt aberrative number of times divorced is an important one especially if it doesnt correlate with number of times married since youve then got big withholds to get off educational level is another area for withholds pcs can be ashamed of how little or how much theyve had jobs accidents illnesses this starts to get into an interesting zone engrams he never mentions watch out for restimulation in these areas if you ask any details about them this can throw the pc right into engrams the auditor gets data while doing this form that tempts him to take things up with the pc but dont do it acknowledge and go on without creating an arc break dont let the pc talk his havingness down in the accidents and illnesses area if the pc is very chatty give him an rfactor beforehand that you only want to know briefly about each thing the some applies to the present physical condition were very interested in whether there are any withheld physical conditions or worries about health they havent told anyone or diseases theyd hate to have anyone know about pump the pc get all the withholds off because this is serious withhold on the case on mental treatment be equally sure to get off any withholds it would be not ok to be getting other treatment physical or mental at the same time as auditing the usual cause of high tone arms on pcs who leave with low ta and come back with high ta is some withhold about their physical condition or concurrent mental treatment or some bug on the subject of the mind get the withholds off on the subject or you wont be his auditor because he wont be willing to talk to you if you do get them off youll be his auditor because you know things about him one else knows

6110c12 shspec66 problems rockslams always take precedence over other needle phenomena rockslam is very badly overrun flow rise on the other hand means nothing because you dont know what turned it off its latent response to something that exceeded the pcs reality so you cant tell where it come from the rise means something it means the pc isnt going to confront something but you cant spot what so its not worth pursuing also the pc wouldnt respond to auditing of it anymore since its beyond his reality sometimes when the pc has an arc break all the needle will do is rise when you get ruds in the needle wont rise much note that on running problems intensive you get the problem before the change it can turn out to be problem hes had for hundreds or millions of years so dont ask for the confusion before the problem you want the confusion before the thislifetime change you must realize that the only reason that people move slowly and get parked on the track or anything else is that problems become timeless the timelessness of problems composed the reactive mind people and organizations are slow he degree that they have problems they cant solve they are inactive to the degree that they have problems they cant solve most of their actions are reactive every new action adds into the old problem to the point of feeling it doesnt matter what we do also the magnitude of the problem can make any other nonconnected thing seem very trivial other peoples reality is viewed apathetically since hes so overwhelmed that he cant look at it matter how immediate it is such people react to everything in life this way its an apparent apathy which is apathy toward life the person being in terrific agony about the problem he cant even articulate what the problem is if you ask him to take his attention off the problem he knows itll eat him up he has attention to spare for you or for auditing you often have pc who is escaping from present time by being in the past you can make mistake by believing hed audit better on his terminals line so you should skip ruds and any thislifetime difficulties and just go back on the line the pc is back on the line because its safer one of the symptoms of that is the pc who never gets picture pictures are dangerous they became dangerous at some time in the past possibly during session getting rudiments in on someone can turn on his pictures rudiments can show someone who has never had auditing that life is solvable at these little finite points its characteristic of pc who is in apathy that he has got to solve it all at once now move the apathy off and youll get the franticness they wont do the available auditing command youve given them theyll take it and make it something to resolve their whole case by one answer why because their whole track is collapsed the fact that problems are timeless and problems join to problems makes it all timeless explosive stratum and anything that explosive about which they worry that much must be solved explosively desperate solution for desperate problem which occurs at one point people look for one 125 command one magic word which will make the pc go clear this becomes what the pc wants when he cant do any of the little things in desperation he will have to do one of the big ones auditing however is done by gradients it depends for success on reaching reality pc can tolerate getting to picture the pc can see at this moment of time in session what the pc really can do are little gradients youve got to find the gradient which is real to the pc something confrontable not the explosive right now effect there are people with frantic desire to have lots of money right now they may have fantastic schemes to get it very unworkable ones if you asked them how much money could you have and sorted it out on the meter youd find that while they said oh millions the amount that would be real to them would be farthing nickel something so small that they dont make that coin its the other side of the circle they think in terms of millions while they get poorer and poorer and poorer the case that has to have total change now and the case that makes change now are almost the same case the case that just sits there apathetically knows that there cant be big enough change or big enough effect right now to solve his problems so hes given up on the idea that anything is going to happen at all he has cancelled all this out he is on lower rung than that he cant have change because theres change tiny enough until you figure out what it is how did he get into this state by having problems that were so overwhelming that he must keep his attention on them all the time and he knows nothing could be done about them but they are terribly important but you have to do something about them but nothing can be done about them so that everything else in life is trivial including your auditing command your command has nothing to do with his problems unless you have his exact problem in which case your commands will have something to do with his case thats actually the only process that will work on him the whole of this problems intensive is to find where the pc is stuck and what problem hes looking at the trick is he doesnt know or he wouldnt be overwhelmed with it the problems he glibly tells you arent it proper assessment will get you the right one not one with lot of figurefigure and musthavebeen the clue to this is that hes figuring from different time band and the real problem is this moment in time the time band of the pc its now if the pc were looking at the problem he is stuck in he wouldnt say person who would have had that problem then because he is in then hes in that problem and other pc who is arc breaking or getting apathetic during goals or terminal assessment is doing it because youre taking his attention off the only thing its safe to keep it on which is the problem hes stuck in if his ruds are very well in and he has lot of confidence in the auditor you can do it and hell feel fine but he still has his attention on the problem now when you try to run his prehav level on the terminal it takes too much attention so he puts that on via so he can keep his attention on the problem he is arc breaky and gets upset or hes apathetic and just grinds if hes lower on the scale in this case hell be running with his attention at monotone because most of his attention is glued to problem so horrendous that if it were solved the whole universe would blow up its even too much effort to say what the problem is so it all operates 126 as withhold every time you have an arc breaky pc you have violated to some degree fixation of attention on problems youve asked him to do something he doesnt consider safe and he is protesting having his attention shifted if someone is in this state you have to work like mad to keep his attention centered where it is centered and not shift it around so its about the hottest thing you can do with case to give problems intensive were getting the backtrack problems which slide up and become pt problems of long duration the problems which underlie the hidden standards and the prior confusions which made the hidden and the problems necessary it works because you are putting his attention where it already is so it goes easily auditors blame themselves because pcs arc break so if you can get certainty as an auditor on exactly why session goes wrong and see the exact mechanism and its magnitude exactly when and why session detours if you can see that the pcs attention is fixated on problem of great importance to degree that any shift of attention causes him to go through this arc break phenomenon you will see that all you have done is to disturb his attention you very often have been running pcs with ptps without recognizing any part of it very often pc has unknowingly to himself stated his problem to you many times and you have never heard it as problem so you go ahead and solve it problem is problem it is what the pc is worried about and feels he has to do something about or that he cant do anything about auditing the problems intensive he may give it to you again and youll suddenly recognize it as problem dont feel silly about it but do recognize that there arent problems which should be solved as opposed to being run as far as ptps of long duration are concerned furthermore the problem you think you see some usual problem may well not be the problem at all eg the instructor who has problem with students that turns out to be the problem of not believing auditors can audit including his present auditor so how could he get auditing problems about scientology are of the order of magnitude of withholds on the subject of scientology in terms of stopping case gain the fact that hes in session acts to restimulate the withhold or the problem and everything you are doing restimulated it dont solve his problem about auditing by giving him more or better auditing the pc has ptp and will behave like case with one matter what you do to solve it l ron hubbard type 3 idate171061 volnum1 issue67 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec67 problems intensives procedure 6110c17 shspec67 problems intensives procedure heroic measures have been used on the time track when lighter efforts to get into communication have failed brutality follows failed communication overts are always to be found in the wake of nocommunication the auditor who gets annoyed with the pc has just failed to audit the pc he has just failed to get the pc to communicate he has had methodology or he hasnt applied it if this were widespread scientology would go the way of all former religions towards ritual and brutality the real overt is not bad auditing its bad dissemination ie bad teaching bad comm of how to apply not insisting that it be done right its your inability to get information from pcs which leads to your not trying to get any which drives 127 you into vicious frame of mind about pcs which drives you into not wanting to audit any at all the auditor who has withholds wont ask for withholds if on top of that he cant get information from the pc and doesnt know how to go about it hell end up not auditing thats why any auditor who is not now auditing isnt auditing hes lost his confidence in his ability to obtain the information necessary to resolve the case as long as you have social mores people will violate them and go out of comm with the group the auditorpc relationship is group and if they are out of comm with group they will tend to be out of comm with all groups youve got to raise their group consciousness before you get an auditorpc relationship so by using the white form you get the withholds off from the sections where they are likely to be concealing anything present physical condition 2d stuff crimes past mental treatment etc all societies set themselves up to be ill because as soon as you have bunch of thoushaltnots you will get the two phenomena of withholds and make guilty so you get people out of comm asising of those conditions so civilizations grow ill and die when mores are your sole method of being civilized youll get destruction scientology is the first civilization not to operate this way as long as you can get people to talk so that they can asis instead of repressing it you can truly handle the ills of civilizations up to now repression was the only available method someone could prove that civilization was made possible only by this mechanism of withholding and making guilty but only as long as his premise was that man is basically evil you have to process somebody and find they are nicer people than you thought previously before you can accept the idea that another basis for civilization is possible otherwise youd think that if you freed man hed become more evil if you audit someone and see him becoming more vital active polite and freer you dont get the impression that hes more evil at all where an individual has withdrawn out of earlier groups he becomes harder to process in the group called auditorpc and harder to get along with in the group called scientology failed group member doesnt make good group member this applies to this lifetime former lives have an effect but the force comes from the thislifetime groups that he has left you could do sec check on each of the groups they had left to get them going into session more easily pay particular attention to this with people who are renegades from groups which intended to help doctors psychiatrists etc run out his ows on that earlier group you have to be clever to do it because you have to find out the mores of the earlier group so do get all you can on his former groups at least as to what hes been in and left only take selfdetermined changes for the problems intensive processing they dont give you anything to handle eg graduation but eg dropping out of school you would be interested in what you want is his solutions to problems he didnt know he had other determined changes arent his solutions youll get reads on them because they are charged but they are not what you want details on running the process stable datum if you have to remedy havingness lot ruds are out 128 never run stop avoid stills unless youve got movement in the command the mechanics of the prior confusion will hang you up in the stillness if you can get the pc to restate it so its got action in it great preventing type action is questionable but it will run perhaps slowly but better than stop

thetans equal some pcs ask all cases are rough but some are rougher than others regardless of equality of thetans however we find that all beings in this area of the universe have the same type of aberration differing only in magnitude of aberration this is contrary to kraepelins index of insanity which points out its many different manifestations the only question answered by such classification is that of how aberrations manifest themselves but all aberrations arise from the same causes having only different manifestations and magnitudes the reason why we are clearing people is that we are taking people out by the same route they went in so you have to parallel what the mind is doing it works like this thetan being and acting in this universe loses confidence in himself in his ability to do and to survive having lost that confidence he then assumes an identity which he considers will stand instead of self he himself goes down into degradation what he is overwhelmed by or what he has overwhelmed consistently is adopted by him as package of behavior and that is valence valence is substitute for self taken on after the fact of lost confidence in self as thetan sinks into degradation and lost confidence in self he goes down into personal oblivion so that he has further memory of self but only memory of valence having taken on this valence he then carries it on as mechanism of survival he does life continuum actually of what he has overwhelmed or what has overwhelmed him at the point of degradation you will find it backtracking this way just before he assumed the valence he has problem concerning his own survival that he himself could not solve as himself just before that problem there was tremendous confusion in which by process of overts and withholds he became enturbulated at himself these overts and withholds were against the various dynamics that was the route by which he went in he missed his way and had overts and withholds against the mores of the group in which he was operating and he lost confidence in himself completely he felt he couldnt go on as himself which gave him tremendous problem relating to survival he felt he couldnt solve this problem so he adopted an identity he thought would stand as solution to this problem then he went on as that identity now that identity was in turn submerged by the same cycle as the identity while member of the group the thetan committed overts and had withholds from members of the group which produced an insoluble problem the thetan usually solved the problem by the acceptance not of another valence but of change to another status the cycle is always the same while member of group having certain goals he commits overts and has withholds from other group members from which arises confusion this confusion summates into problem which he 129 then solves by _______ the _______ is the only variable early on the track the thetan always used valence but the common denominator of all his solutions is change this has always been an element that is equally true of the first assumption of valence and of every new lifetime etc the whole of the buddhist concern was the lifedeath cycle the goal of the buddhist is to escape the cycle hes afraid of change because he could become responsible for wider changes this is almost on the principle that if i shirk enough responsibility ill just float out of my head unfortunately it doesnt work it is true that occasionally accidentally thetan can sit down and go out of his head sproingg the way he does it is that he has set up an escape mechanism to spring him out of dead bodies like fighter pilot ejection seat usually they dont work every now and then one works its actually mocked up heavyenergy guillotine pcs think that if they feel enough pain they wont be able to think so they set this up to be triggered by pain at certain time they get enough pain and the guillotine is supposed to knock off the body so people wind up by now with the belief that you have to kill body to get out of it actually unless you had overts on the body you would practically float out of it people who are going around sick may have triggered the ejection mechanism and had it fail to kill the body or eject them its failed solution one of the mechanisms of the series of truths the buddhists believed was that the world was horrible poverty stricken etc the basic truths they put out were so interlarded with these other exaggerations overts and unkind thoughts criticisms and so on that it operated as selftrapping mechanism if you get guy to be still long enough you will key him in like crazy all the motions of the past will come in and kick him in the head why do you find pc sitting in the middle of problem sitting there with that solution and why is it such still solution its still point on the track and every time the pc has tried to rest hes practically been overwhelmed when you get the problem out of the way and look back for the motion and confusion the motion and confusion run and the still spot disappears the still spot is held there by the pressure and duress of an active spot behind or earlier than the still spot so when the pc tries to rest the motion threatens to overwhelm him as it gets restimulated so its upsetting to him to be still theres nothing to do once one has blown out of ones head so the goal of the buddhist must have been to do nothing that is the defeatist goal people in defeat will say they want to do nothing in some variety of ways of course the nothingness is the point of overwhelm so people who yearn for nothingness inadvertently yearn to be overwhelmed so every great culture strives for peace they get so much peace theres so much peace everywhere that some barbarian comes along and knocks the whole thing off they achieve perfect nomotion which is death so thetans ambitions can often be contrary to his best interests this is not surprising in view of the fact that there are real liabilities to being thetan except the liability of interest inaction nothing to do or have or be nowhere to go when you see people preaching these you see people in the finest possible games condition they are playing game of seeing other players overwhelmed using the mechanisms of the track which would most easily overwhelm the other players it is not really in the best interest of the other to advise rest peace and inaction 130 the proof of this are all over the place eg soldier gets wounded gets frontline first aid result lower death rate for wounds treated there than for similar wounds treated at the base hospital society subscribes to the idea that someone can kill himself with work this is complete red herring how does thetan get sick you know that when you release the still he is stuck in hell get well what has happened to thetan that he doesnt just heal up an injured body on the spot he has been leading too quiet life thats all people in circuses take falls that would kill regular person the only reason an injured body doesnt spring back into shape is that its held out of shape by stills things wrong with people are held wrong with considerable energy the effort it takes to stay crazy must be fantastic the best way to get sudden recoveries is to run withholds because withholds are the motion before the still that was going on while the person was not participating with the motion he was withholding himself from the motion so he was already being slightly still he eventually withdraws so hard from the motion and commits so many overts against the other participants in the motion that he backs out all the way and becomes still when you havent any right to be part of motion any longer you have only one other choice to be still thats the mechanism by which you can get confusion overts and withholds becoming problem problem is the still after the problem comes the solution to the problem of course since the problem is motionless in time the solution becomes continuous in time now the thetan has the problem of how to get some motion although motion is evidently bad for thetan he nevertheless likes to move and insists on doing it if he hadnt done so much motion in the past his present still would be ok but as with car having its bumper up against another cars bumper should do harm unless it was previously traveling at 165 miles per hour its the motion prior to the still that produces the impact theres nothing wrong with still if there hasnt been some motion and motion is fine if still doesnt occur if you can tolerate both motion and stillness you wont have any trouble but there are certain motions and certain stills thetan cannot tolerate you could move insane people up the track just by giving them huge boulder in the middle of the courtyard to look at to familiarize themselves with still if we look at how thetan got aberrated we see that its cycle of action 1 overts against coaction 2 confusion leading to 3 problem which is stop leading to 4 change to solve the problem the cycle keeps repeating itself the thetan keeps picking up new bodies who are somebody else this really makes it complicated since each of them is an identity he doesnt stack up any new valences however because the basic valence is in there so solid that transient valences dont overwhelm it the basic valence motivated by the basic goal is the biggest single change that takes place in lifetime that is available to an auditor it is available on anyone with whom you can communicate if you cant communicate you can still use cchs they arent used otherwise now that the problems intensive can be used to get off hidden standards 131 what other changes besides valences are available one is new body every death is preceded by an unsolvable problem to which death was the solution new body is solution to death which left the thetan in inaction all illness evolves from unsolved problems its always gradient scale of dying people even get sick when they win prize or get new possessions beyond what they feel they should have to survive it can be too much change and too much havingness unsafe because of ones liability to being attacked thetans arent stupid one of their aberrations may be stupidity but according to the computation on which they are living what they are doing is very clever youll always find that the very stupid have great belief in their cunning often too the very bright consider themselves to be stupid how many changes can occur just after problem in terms of mental changes very few they could suppress or enhance certain characteristics get rid of or adopt certain manifestations and thats about all the earliest step is taking on valence valence both limits and exaggerates persons own skills thetan can only set up valence or circuit to do what he can already do thetan can without body walk out on stage pick up 1000 lb weight turn it around and drop it but hes so dedicated to the idea that it takes strong mans body to do it that he only does it when hes in strong mans body then it gets to the point that he can only do it when in condition when hes well when hes employed to do it when he has problems with his manager when he believes in himself and feels powerful these are all vias the basic truth is that he can just do it each of the limitations and vias he puts in there is solution to problem he couldnt otherwise solve the problem got there because he was trying to get something done as part of group and in that motion has overts and withholds and these resolved into problem the whole cycle has to take place every time to wind up with solution like that the problems and changes you are interested in as an auditor are not very many you are not interested in his being in body he has been in and out of bodies before or he wouldnt be here but what is he doing with this body he isnt being the body he is in he is being valence which is in body in other words hes failed thetan being failed valence in body up to this point hed be easy to communicate with but new problems and changes interpose such things as constant somatics then you are auditing him through the problem which is the constant somatic circuit is like subsidiary valence it is mechanism which modifies valence solution to the realization that the valence can often be wrong so it needs to be dictated to or to have things hidden from it so when the thetan as valence runs into problem where the valence has failed he sets up valence that can think and circuit to modify the thinking of the valence after the thetan has failed everything he adopts after that is subject to failure and each one of them becomes barrier to processing circuit modifies the thinkingness and doingness of the valence it is dictational machine circuits slow down or speed up show things or hide things etc if they get too wild and complicated the person can modify the circuit with somatic when you get this much bricabrac somewhere along the line you could get hidden standard which knows more than the valence which knows more than the thetan 132 hidden standard is just something which knows better to which the thetan is paying attention the thetans concentration on this item can be so great the dependency on it so heavy that the thetan only knows if it knows if it tells him its true if it doesnt tell him its not true when you are auditing him he lets it tell him he pays so much attention to it he hardly sees you at all to some degree everyones attention is absorbed in some part of the bank but where total overwhelm exists attention is so absorbed that only it knows people run totally on social circuitry for instance parents often have totally unreal ideas about their children whom they have never observed at all circuits are often so idiotic that when they are activated by what they are set up to produce they criticize as if it werent there eg one has the circuit childs appearance should be very good so if childs appearance in the vicinity of someone with that circuit is very good hes criticized if the childs appearance is very bad hes ignored this confuses children and causes them to feel betrayed most things that person protests against he will do himself we call this hypocrisy its caused by circuits circuitry is an escape from knowing and confront vias used by the thetan to divorce himself from life when you audit him you are part of life and you will hit his interpositions you will thus be auditing circuit which prevents him from being able to go clear on straight routine 3 if you get off his ptps arc breaks objections to the room etc he is less likely to interpose vias and you can then talk to the pc not the circuit but people have problems of such magnitude on the recent backtrack that they set up permanent circuit so you are always auditing away at the circuit and making slow progress the problems intensive directly handles and knocks out circuits so that you can audit the pc out of the valence he is in l ron hubbard type 3 idate191061 volnum1 issue69 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec69 q and period flows 6110c19 shspec69 q and period flows pointers on running problems intensives any auditing command has the potentiality of flows in it if the pc is running command with the flow always from to b the pc could go into an occlusion you could then have him run it the other way few times and it will unocclude all stuck flows give stuck needles you see this in withholds too withhold is nonpermitted flow so anything going in against it sticks nothing can backflow youll see the ta rise and the needle stick the more you make him conscious of it the more tightly he squashes himself with the withhold you finally trigger it this reverses the flow and you get blowdowns in withhold the pc regrets the backflow eg he should not have backflowed the bullet when he killed the king of france he shouldnt have backflowed in the first place so he is withholding it he can receive everything you tell him about the king of france but nothing can come out about the king of france watch the needle go up and stick the more questions you flow in the more he packs it in when he stops withholding the ta goes down from reversing the flow there are lots of directions of flows but five or ten ways seems pretty adequate if you only run pc to another and another to pc you can start getting the other persons flows jamming and you will again get stuck meter this doesnt pose 133 problem if you are running it for short time only you can overrun flow on prehav run or all flows can run out you can run flow too long in one direction and get high ta then it can blow up with blowdown you can overrun it in which case the more you run it the more stuck it is going to get the mind is capable of considerable resurgence by getting in ruds you give the mind the freedom to look at pt with that freedom comes the ability to asis this makes it possible to use fiveway bracket instead of 32way bracket auditing is not an absolute practice fortunately if everything bad that ever happened to the pc had to be audited out youd be at it forever if you pull certain pins enough will blow so that the mind can resurge if the ruds are in problems intensive is run so that the mind can resurge enough to let you run goals easily auditors can have trouble with the idea of flows if they dont realize that the mind is full of particles thoughts get connected with the particles and the particles get connected with solids and masses so the pc tries to think and runs into solids you try to audit him and run into particles theres nothing wrong with the pcs thinkingness per the trouble is that it gets joined up with energy space time and particles so he cant think of time without getting space or of thought without getting particles or masses he cant differentiate amongst these things or amongst the dynamics the preclear identifies the sixth dynamic particularly with with all the dynamics and the seventh dynamic gets identified with the reactive mind thinkingness only goes haywire when person can longer differentiate where he should or associate where he should he identifies even on semantic level eg he road boat you can get some amazing results with semantics like the airline pilot who came in looking for the phrase that gave him compulsion to have accidents while flying his mother has said hes earthly good which reactively made him fly even though he hated it leukemia was once found to be caused by the mothers phrase it would turn your blood to water but auditing by phrases requires very good auditor and it doesnt work on everybody if it worked well and easily wed still be doing it it is mistake to let the pc run only oneway flows the pc has been motivating for years and years not just in session what is holding it pinned is lack of any reverse flow it looks moral to the pc but its not its that he started an outflow along certain tone level making line along which an interchange could occur having done so he can be inflowed on at that level this is all based on the horrible fact that thetan can never be inflowed on until he has outflowed how could he have been located by someone else otherwise this leads to the safe solution of never being anywhere or saying anything of course then youll never do anything or see anything and nothing will ever happen ever the police evidently operate on this since its being there and communicating that are punished someone in apathy has solved life this way and hes easy to inflow on so he gets kicked if hes not careful though he may get reputation for being good listener yet people get taught this be good listener dont be obtrusive be little late but it backfires when making up auditing commands be sure it is understood and that it reads on the meter and that it is explicit and that you get it answered every time and dont set up stuck flow 134 situation even flow of giving punishment to someone will violate games condition because it is giving something to an enemy so it makes one feel degraded and start figuring on it war is degrading because soldiers are always giving things to their enemies this sets up bad games condition an auditor shouldnt run contrarytogamescondition process which is all give or one that violates flows with all receive there are wordings that allow for any flow eg what was happening or what was unknown if the pc cant run unknown you can use forgotten the lower harmonic of unknown use any of the notknow words if necessary dont leave the problem unrun if you start getting into stuck flow on process you can just end the process without too much fuss and add another flow to it eg by saying now we are going to add another side to this if your intention is to get auditing done rather than to follow ritual itll go down just fine anything that goes wrong to pc in session is registered by him on the basis of scarcity of auditing and is best remedied by giving him auditing if you run withholds lot eg unkind thoughts you can wind up with stuck flow unless you run the overt as the outflow in the problems intensive the osection is list of selfdetermined changes the pc has made in this lifetime the list is assessed out by elimination and the item is then handled in the psection the auditor gets the problem that preceded this change he runs it on what is unknown about that problem with the terminal in the problem or some such process later version omits running it then the confusion prior tc the change later prior to the problem is located and the dramatis personae of the confusion are sec checked getting off all the and ws in the area of the confusion until the problem longer reacts then another selfdetermined change is assessed out etc later version of the problems intensive is given in hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion the number of problems person has determines how fast or slow he will audit and his speed of accomplishment in life in general so hell speed up in life when you get his problems out of the way l ron

group mores because there was an agreement agreement is high on the reality scale as an individual agrees to something then disagrees to it he runs contradiction on his own postulates when thetan becomes member of group he agrees to certain things then finds he cant uphold them and disagrees with those things this activity is high on the reality scale having agreed to something then disagreed with it the thetan doesnt normally asis his original agreement thus he finds himself in disagreement with himself since it was originally his own agreement this is apparently the first and foremost invalidation of thetan he invalidates himself by first agreeing then disagreeing with his own agreements in between the agreement and disagreement we get further set of agreements and activities all of which are lesser in value but which bring about complexity 135 so you get an area of mutual motion with the group and even confusion of ownership of motion you get whole series of problems from this this gets us back to something that has been question since 1948 if the thetan was making his pictures why did he create the particular ones hes got why his proclivity for morbidity we find the answer in the fact that he cant differentiate between his own actions and other peoples hes not sure who caused these communication lines and actions all motions are of course caused individually there is such thing as collectively caused motion governments err by thinking that theres some entity called the people when in fact there are just individuals but in his third dynamics the pc got into this confusion of mutual motion he then defends himself by backing out of it he says well it was all bad here i am outside of it at least i am still an identity thetan has gone through this over and over the dynamics give us an excellent picture of the confusion of mutual motion the sixth dynamic is exclusively comotion an undifferentiated one all the collective undifferentiated comotions of the past become matter energy space and time the sixth dynamic nobody can say what he did thetan in this universe can only say that was our activity this is ok until you get failure for instance its we built this bridge until it collapses at which point it becomes they built this bridge when mutual comotion comes cropper people deny their part in it at any given time an individual is member of at least two or three groups he has been on the track for 200 trillion years which makes lot of groups so it is impractical to run out his coaction with all his groups for instance every time he died he left group but we are assisted by automaticity all overts and withholds are preceded by coaction you can straighten out the people involved by running ow or you can free the effect of the ow by differentiating the coaction this is basic discovery that you can knock out the coaction preceding the ow he cant face the coaction sometimes until you get off some of the withholds and overts body of agreement has been violated and thereafter will remain aberrative thats where you get the packaged nowimsupposedtos the packaged postulates valences enforced by group mores someone who is withholding himself from his former group cant even tell you what really went on in it until he his gotten off some of the ow his withholding is not only in the physical universe but in the mind also you could have group whose mutual action is all mutually destructive at first glance when you process the pc you are just asking him to stop withholding himself mentally just because he is withholding himself physically hell resist because it feels like being asked to return to it physically the reason you have to have ruds in in order to find goal or terminal is that you are asking the individual to walk very closely to the fact of an identity from which he is withholding himself while being the identity hes not executing the goal while executing the goal you are asking him to look at something that he is in the middle of when you run groups you are asking him what group comotion are you still in the middle of that youre now having nothing to do with this confuses him but it works out very well you go back through his ows to coaction eventually you could even get the mutual agreements each step asks him to confront little more than he would be comfortable 136 confronting so youll find his goal and find his terminal fine thats oriented towards the future and away from the unpleasant past but then you ask him to go back over the past and suddenly you get all the reasons why he doesnt want to go clear facing all those prior groups and people and activities is something else yesterday should remain buried this is the most critical period of processing for one thing if you have the wrong goal and the wrong terminal you will throw the pc in over his head and it will take experts to bail him out its not light thing to attempt the pc doesnt want to face what he has left so you had better be prepared for evasions ducks and dodges arc breaks etc even if hes aberrated now he knows hes alive hes not so sure he will be alive if he confronts this he died last time didnt he pc can also slide out from under the terminal up into degradation this is an alarming fact of running terminals the pc looks very pitiful as he comes through the degradation and may not feel at all like going on but all his escape mechanisms are reactive by keeping rudiments in and carrying on straight ahead you will succeed because the pc himself is really with you all the way the objections are all reactive you may have smooth trip through it too not all pcs go through degradation degradation is lower harmonic of apathy and is the first emotion the pc encounters on the road up even if hes below it he goes through the band of death on the way to apathy then on up the tone scale theres sort of hurdygurdy that goes on theres the pc and the valence and the pc is as overwhelmed as the valence is high toned during processing the positions reverse at one point they are level at this point the nowimsupposedtos dont work well and the pc still doesnt decide well what to do then the valence goes down and the pc up the pc andor the valence may hit the boredom band it is important not to leave it there but to continue see fig 5 figure 5 tone level of valence and pc graphics inserted 137 l ron

heretics the catholic church has had trouble with were produced by the mechanism of incomplete confessions this is poetic justice since the church buried most of the earlier knowledge that had been around so sec check the very thing which is supposed to prevent dissension upsets and slowed cases if badly done restimulates heresy of some sort which eventually brings about an overthrow of the group sooner or later the cycle is that this overt not being pulled but restimulated causes the pc to lessen it by running down the target of the overt this is new overt which then makes him also run down the group that failed to pull the withhold if you fail to pull the withhold you will get the effect of the succeeding overts as the pc makes nothing of the people who might find out this is part of lessening the missed overt it also serves to make it such that one would ever believe those people if the overt ever does come out the amazing thing is that the withhold as its pulled transmutes from smoking volcano before it is pulled to limp dead fish as its gotten off so if you start to release it but dont carry through youve left the pc with live head of steam which will frequently explode the way to have accidents with dangerous object is to know its dangerous and not know how to handle it weve tended to tell students that you cant do anything wrong with auditing in order to inspire confidence and to degree its true but now that we have accomplished speedup of getting rid of the basic core of reactivity weve paid for it with loss of the safety mechanisms of older processes like conceptual processes objectives etc now we have to run things that make people pretty uncomfortable when it is done wrong this is not permanent but it can be quite uncomfortable at the time part of the trouble too is that the auditor can be looking very pleasant doing his best though he has make gaes so that the pc when he finds himself looking awful blames himself for it and feels it couldnt be the auditors fault when in fact it is his fault the common denominator of gaes is some degree of auditing done where there have been errors it is mostly incomprehension of auditing directions examples are leaving withhold question unflat doing wrong assessment or using wrong assessment running prehav level until the ta is moving and leaving it failing to continue to sec check pc

present time have greater influence on the pc than the whole track in his estimation so you have pc who is convinced that anything wrong with him must have happened in this lifetime this is one of the things wrong with him that he thinks he can get this aberrated in fifty years or less as far as the basic seat of aberration is concerned it is all way prior to this lifetime to the pc what has happened in the last twentyfour hours is more important than what has happened in the past month but it isnt really from the pcs viewpoint what has happened in the session is more important than what has happened in this day hence the violence 138 of session arc breaks because of this evaluation of importances you cant audit over the arc break as it recedes into the past it loses importance the analytical mind fixes its attention closest to all of the havingness which is in present time so theres always the disagreement in the session that whats really wrong with the pc is in the yesterlives but the pc thinks its something wrong right now if you treat what is wrong with him now with heavy actions as if it were tremendous barrier the pc will think so too thus you can validate the pc into outruds an auditor has to adjudicate whether it will do more damage to get the rudiments in or to audit with them out goals run is very difficult with the ruds out but you can attack ruds with such ferocity that the pc gets convinced that they must be really out so they go more out if the ta starts going up while you are getting ruds in lock very pleased as if youd just gotten ruds really in wind up the ruds and get back on the goals terminal line ruds bit out is better than ruds way out details on goals running you will sometimes find the pc planting his heels in examine the case from the aspect of its goal examine the goal from the aspect of what dynamic it is an overt against and you will find out how pc got goal in this solid he had this goal as perfectly honest goal perhaps and nobody wanted this goal because it didnt fit in with certain dynamics they invalidated it and he reasserted it etc etc to the point where he pretty much dropped it when you first pick it up you find it behaves like an overt you can run it as an overt which is why the twoway flow run on it works you can ask what would the goal _______ do to group and find how it could be lots of overts against groups this means it has been invalidated lot which is why it goes out so easily any goal that isnt an axiom is out of agreement to some degree with groups the pc has been associated with thus it has been invalidated on other dynamics and so becomes source of invalidation he uses it to invalidate and others invalidate it so if you as the auditor invalidate it even slightly out it goes the terminal being an outgrowth of the goal is similarly fragile not accepting the pcs handwritten list resulted in the goal getting lost the pc didnt mention when the auditor got new goals list with the meter dont run any processes eg sec checks on any specific terminals other that the goals terminal line terminals except ow and when the pc runs out of ow against the terminal dont force it on the terminal anymore the pc will arc break as his attention is newly forced on the terminal l ron hubbard type 3 idate11161 volnum1 issue74 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec74 formation of commands 6111c01 shspec74 formation of commands details on formulating commands for goals processing you can have difficulty with some standard command like think of _______ in about 50 of cases the pc wont make sense out of think and it wont read you could clear the word very carefully get all his considerations process the condition etc or better yet find substitute the pc can understand often get the idea will work but if the second part of the command has it in another form then what well square it around so it makes sense cure for inability to think look around and find something thats not thinking be sure its clear to the pc dont find that you are having trouble with it after you have run it for three hours but dont go to the extreme of clearing the 139 same command every session either just clear it when you first use it even if it looks fine to you see if it makes sense and is answerable to the pc mental concepts can exist in the absence of words when you are forming commands its concepts you want to communicate words express the form and character of the think thetan in order to communicate goes through mest and to hear takes the communication out of mest thats how he keeps off other thetans the whole business of forming commands uses that mechanism the command should of course always be duplicated thats havingness factor as well as not attracting the pcs attention and it makes him think repetitive thought which will eventually asis his circuits dont get pedantic about it process in the language he speaks including dialects and colloquialisms if you are trying to compose commands without knowledge of the basics of scientology youd do better to go hang yourself one of the basics is to make sense remember that if word was something the pc was quite rational about it wouldnt read in the first place and its not up to you to run language school for pc often he will cognite on what it means as you run it but if you have to change wordings to make the command grammatical or sensible be sure to get one that reads and has the same sense to the pc your commands are always being formed and cleared up against the raw stuff of which aberration is concocted as result it becomes tricky and vast subject the fundamentals of the mind are simple and not very many the difficulties of clearing and forming commands can cause the auditor to give up and just take commands lrh has given even if you do this try at least to understand the thought behind the command which is meant to be transmitted to the pc if it doesnt transmit because of some weirdness fix it up so it fits and transmits lrh expects that you would make sure its answerable dont change any commands that you are already running matter how much better you now see you could make it realize that commands are communication not semantics l ron hubbard type 3 idate21161 volnum1 issue75 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec75 how to security check 6111c02 shspec75 how to security check the answer to why the bank beefs up when nongoalsterminals are run is this when you run the terminal which is not the goals terminal his attention is too bound up in his own terminal and goal to asis the collapsing mass so the mass the auditor pushes in on the pc connected to the new terminal doesnt get asised the pc doesnt have enough attention units to asis anything except the goals terminal so the bank beefs up similarly your emeter starts up the ta rises to the degree that the pc is not asising what you are throwing in on him the worst thing about emeters is tr0 tr0 goes out and the meter doesnt work an emeter is deadly weapon you can slaughter pc if the emeter is not used correctly you do this by missing instant reads if in addition you took up latent reads and let the pc get off other peoples overts the session itself would be an overt and the pc would feel worse afterwards more dangerous mistake is missing an instant read and leaving the question live which can often result in the pc nattering criticizing you and the organization etc very funny if you miss the question he doubts you your ability the tech etc when you clean it up by pulling the withhold the natter stops latent read has comm lag of 05 sec or more 140 you could sec check person into high ta by making sure all the ruds were out so his attention would be dispersed audit what the pc is stuck in when pcs attention is too bound up in one area the pc cannot asis anything else so the ta goes high and sticks its not that the tas going high should be utterly avoided but the ta goes high because more is being thrown in on the pc than the pc can handle or asis if during run the pc hits an engram he may not be able to asis it if you start directing his attention to all the details etc and start running the engram so just acknowledge it and carry on with the goals or terminals run you were doing the auditor can push mass circuits pictures etc in on the pc and can move his track more easily than the pc hard though it may be for auditors to recognize this so your interrogation of the pc can pin his attention on the track its ok to be curious enough to find out what he is looking at or doing but not to start running it of course you can move him out of it by asking for earlier or later incidents the reactive mind is always keyed to otherdeterminism and never to selfdeterminism so the auditor can always move it around high ta is often cured by getting off withhold even small one getting off any withhold will make the ta go down data on sec checking by dynamics the trouble with the sec check is usually that the auditor is working from his own viewpoint and not from the pcs thetan is not natively member of any culture thetans have come down the track accumulating various mores and civilizations and group ideas some have come down the track without finding out that groups exist theyve collected various things but their mores register on the dynamics rather than relative to groups make sure you sec check what the pc considers an overt even if to you it seems trivial people are different men are so busy being ordinary that they dont recognize that every one of them is slightly somewhere extraordinary this professional ordinariness is great repressor it notises the differences unless you can reestablish difference you cant reestablish differentiation the easy way out the easy solution is to say that its all the same they are all alike all bad so now im warned and safe if miserable thats such stupid reasoning that its wonder countries go down the drain of all people are equal but some people are more equal than others perhaps thetans were all equal at the beginning of the track then became unequal and masked it with pretended equality details on problems intensives and sec check procedures it is interesting that you can sec check out of existence every outrudiment the room ptps the auditor arc breaks just get the prior confusion rudiment cant hang up unless theres an unknown and an unknown cant exist unless theres withhold here we have class of things that all go together unknowingness forgettingness stupidity and withholds they are like r and c in the arc triangle they go up and down together you are not likely to get factual answer to the question have you ever made someone guilty of something the thing that is wrong with the pc is that he has never successfully made anybody guilty and he is still trying the basis of his aberration is the effort to made someone guilty not the accomplished fact you should ask have you ever attempted to make anybody guilty of _______ the only reason anyone has victimish motivatorish attitude is in an effort to make someone guilty it may have even been successful effort but the person making the effort doesnt know about it 141 it is debatable point whether you should ever take an unkind thought as an overt sometimes it does seem to be the only available overt and the person does feel friendlier and better for having gotten it off but there appears to be evidence that person with body of unkind thoughts against someone or something has an actual overt which is being withheld the unkind thoughts are evidently just evidence that overts exist so if you dont get the overts you are leaving them with unflat sec check questions critical thoughts dont aberrate people but the pc may not be able to reach the underlying overt so if he cant make note so that you can return to it l ron hubbard type 3 idate81161 volnum1 issue77 rev0

climb as much as two divisions dont develop nice calloused death mask in lieu of tr0 process the pc in front of you just get brave the way to get your ruds in as an auditor is to just relax look over the situation even if it takes bit of time find out what is going on by asking what is going on you ask him thats different from ritual do you know that with one single question that is heartfelt and meant by you you can put all the ruds in just like that how do you run sec check on tough pc with lots of withholds when the meter is broken you dont you run some havingness and confront and end session and get new meter but never distract pcs attention from the session you can be as interesting or as interested as you please as long as its relevant to the session and to what the pc is doing what upsets the pc is an irrelevancy to his case its not what you do its how relevant your actions are you must have your attention on the pc the auditor could dance jig as long as it is relevant to the pcs case youll drop some of your shackles and death masks when you learn this differentiate between what you can get away with and what you cant all the pc demands is that the auditor be effective and his attention relevant to the pcs case thats what the auditor violates when he gets in trouble with the pc the whole pattern of arc breaks is that the pc ceases to believe that the auditors attention is relevant to his case per the philadelphia doctorate lectures the highest level of reality is conviction this is above agreement communication above mechanics its belief the pc must stay convinced that the auditor is interested in auditing him and interested in auditing his case and doing it effectively with attention on the pc this conviction takes something to achieve it can be accomplished if you know enough about the mind and have enough reality on its mechanics knowing these things you are never debarred by the mystery of it all the pc looks like something that can be resolved if you know the mechanics of how he operates and if you know all the parts of his mind you understand enough of what he is doing to form arc with the pc now your interest and attention is on the particularities the specifics of his difficulties if you are comfortable with the basics and the mechanics youll be able to handle peoples upsets effectively somebody who understands life can talk about life and other people know he understands life even if they dont know what he is saying oddly enough so if you who could be looking and interested arent doing it with the pc he has been out its upsetting that you dont do what you could be doing people do not forgive auditing or being ineffective so audit the pc and be effective the pc 144 wants your attention cn his case if you start to tell him about your case forget it matter how kindly your motives are just be sure you are effective and that your attention is on his case details on modifiers the arc the pc forms with the auditor is not just from sweetness and kindness its from auditor control interest and effectiveness student auditing can well be slow because the pc can feel the student is auditing in order to learn about it not because of interest in his case if an auditor goes and carelessly sleeps with the pc hell get auditing done thereafter hes longer interested in the pcs case hes interested in the pcs body being complimentary to your pc goes only so far then it becomes interest in the pcs body not in his case so it is longer effective out of session compliments may be fine every skill you have in auditing routines sec checks model session problems intensive has certain form which rather guarantees interest in the pcs case dont let it ride on automatic however or it compounds the felony you get the situation where the ritual is interested in the pcs case but the auditor isnt the pc gets weird unreality about the whole thing the auditor has to be interested in the pcs case and determined to do something effective about it then through the media of emeter and procedure he gives the auditing commands the commands are vital but secondary they do nothing by themselves in sec checking if the auditor does not become visible and real to the pc withholds will read you get reads on the meter in direct ratio to your reality to the pc this is true in assessment too your presence is as poor in the pcs opinion as you have to keep the rudiments in the auditor is as real and has as much presence to the pc as the ruds stay in interest must be present to get reads and restimulate the pc the more presence you have the more you can get out of the pc it can disturb pc to have some overt or partly known thing and to hear from some nonpresent and nonlocated terminal question about it that doesnt restimulate it when its thetan to thetan question theres live interest and communication and you get reads and answers the bank is responsive to your presence you can handle it better than he can if

they arent as good as cans for can squeeze the meter was first used for dating incidents on the track ron found that the onthebeach incidents gave 16dial drops at that point he still thought that the higher the ta went the clearer the person was for the first five months lrh had reality on the meter and would take his own judgment instead of the meters every time for the next three years lrh had to get used to every new meter they were variable that is why they are made standard now so you dont have to learn each ones idiosyncracies 145 one reason why emeters werent used in the mid 50s was that they got too complicated don breeding joe wallace and jim pinkham eventually in the late 50s designed one for lrh in washington with simple basic circuit design they were transportable unlike the volney matthison models which were mains meters with high current that could if malfunctioning deliver potent electric shock some pcs now can feel current from battery meter they are just

know that in checking ruds stop on the rise is read and that its got to be an instant read it registers the moment the sense gets to the pc if the pc is trying to sell you on something the read will be latent because the pc takes an instant to get it and respond but the reactive mind doesnt it has time in it and reads instantly you have to be satisfied that the meter works get to where it is an unimportant albeit vital part of the session and you can have your attention on the pc instead of the meter l ron hubbard type 3 idate231161 volnum1 issue84 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

lrh decided well if thats what it takes to break this barrier and push this thing through for big win for all of us well that what it takes quote it isnt question of being bright or being extraordinary i do know where i came from you see i used to tell my grandfather to explain my red hair to him i fell off mars and got into bucket of red paint was two when i was telling him that and he thought i was joking it wasnt question of what i could do or what my ability was it was question of what would it take to get it done all im asking you to do is do the impossibility of do it i couldnt possibly have done it you cant possibly audit it i did it you do it is that good bargain thats what it takes 146 if you dont know how to read meter of course you dont have much confidence in your ability to run one and after someone has thrown the meter at you or youve thrown the meter and someone has missed your withholds few times of course your ability to read meter deteriorates like mad what you are really beaten by is not the meter but the operator of the meter einstein had the concept of the observer he even wrote paper on the subject entitled the viewpoint of the observer an observer is somebody who without the introduction of an opinion can look exactly and directly at needle or registering item and say exactly what it did without further introduction of an opinion psychologists and psychiatrists do not observe they are so interested in doing something that they never notice what they are doing it to thus these disciplines not knowing what an observer is have denied us data because they introduced opinion and evaluation the ability to observe as single action is what is required to run an emeter if you take that as separate action of the auditor you will get the whole problem compartmented properly and only when you do that action do you do anything else we dont sit there and worry about what we will do if the needle does something why should the observation of the needle assault reality its just an observation keep the observer independent of the doer and you are all set the needle acted in certain way what it means and what you will do about it are utterly separate from the observation that it acted in certain way try just observing tree sometime with opinion or think youll find it very interesting now look at the tree when the wind is blowing if you can hold this as an observation independent of an emotional reaction opinion doingness summation or prediction fine it is characteristic of the human race that they predict without bothering to see as far as the emeter is concerned an auditor must be purely an observer who can look and see exactly what the needle is doing it may take only one tenth of his attention but it must be pure attention the analysis of what the pcs mind is doing is another activity perfectly valid one but one which follows the observation one must not be so fond of ones theories that one slants the observation to prove the theory right the fact that lrh is willing to observe and very seldom goes to sleep and keeps his mind on what hes doing as an auditor is what gets him good auditing results to observe for one second is skill of sorts thats what metering takes what happens is what happens with alteris connected with the observation where you have bad assessment its because hopefulness or pessimism has entered in you need the willingness to put something to the pure reliable test an observer neednt know anything about scientology or the mind all he needs to know is whether something happened or not and what pure observation is nice trick if you get pc who talks during an assessment just get him to shut up so you can assess he wont arc break as long as he sees hes getting your attention you dont care what he does as long as he holds the cans and lets you assess the mechanics of it is thus it doesnt matter whether he is thinking about it or not youre assessing his bank and power on earth could prevent his bank from reading on the right level for that terminal many systems may be followed but they would all share the principle of getting the maximum number of 147 levels in minimum time with minimum restimulation of the pc if you jar someones attention onto his terminal itll stay there awhile for several levels you can take advantage of that by assessing several levels without repeating the terminal l ron hubbard type 3 idate281161 volnum1 issue85 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec85 havingness 6111c28 shspec85 havingness havingness doesnt have to go with confront if you are running subjective process on pc that is the confront part havingness is an adjunct to any subjective process it goes out about every six months and comes in again six months or so later why does the meter get stuck one reason is that arc breaks get so furious that nothing reads everything has gone out hes in games condition and wont let anything have any command over him one else is permitted to have anything you can fix it by running havingness the two hundred lie detector operators who can make it operate do so because they can get into arc with the person on the lie detector the emeter likewise wont register in the presence of an operator who has faintest command value over the person on the meter you can err by thinking that if it doesnt read on the meter it doesnt exist this can make one invalidate the meter at that moment you must be able to obnose the pc and see whether he has an arc break the arc broken pc wont confront the auditor looks glum gives short answers gets ta or rising ta that sticks the latter indicator is not diagnostic in itself the ta stays up because the meter is inoperative so you must look at the pc and see his indicators an auditor can make another error lot of people have the idea they can tell better than the emeter what persons terminal is because there is something they can know better than the emeter thats because they do know that the pc is not with the session have asked the pc for an arc break and have gotten read that is the situation where they know more than the meter this doesnt mean they know better which is the pcs terminal so be relaxed but not careless what could stand between you and rapid assessment is an arc broken pc who is not registering on the meter someone who is nattering about how scientology is fraud etc etc can be shut off by asking them why cant you talk to anyone about your difficulties new rudiments question then is could you talk to about your case which combines the elements of insessionness if hes got an arc break he wont answer it positively then youve got another series of questions to get him in session see hcob 30nov61 arc process 1961 the arc break process is the best havingness chewerupper there is next to routine 3d hence the importance of havingness in the first place the thetan doesnt want this mass he has but it is mass and thetans motto is anything is better than nothing but this mass is an introversion mass and the more you run the mass the less hes got the physical universe so even if the mass didnt increase it is introverting him and the more pc introverts the less universe he has so he would get the feeling of losing havingness just by contacting some introverting thing something that introverted him badly would give him the feeling of havingness it has always been there whenever he has gotten sick this mass you are running out caved in on him 148 dont be amazed to find the pc running fever while running 3d just keep on smoothly handling him the formula for getting rid of havingness is whatever the persons attention is on put it on something else for everything he has at the moment tell him hes got to have something else this is more effective than brainwashing its the suddenness of the shift that is unsettling when you are running persons arc break and hes out of arc with you he wants to go out of the session he starts by feeling hes not getting auditing then that he should be thinking about something else then that he will physically leave the session catch him one step back run havingness you will get command value as hes looking around the room and you will heal the arc break almost any pc run long enough on havingness will get all his rudiments in the earliest rudiments process was is it all right to be audited in this room is it all right for to audit you were just about back there havingness is that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pcs attention dont underrun it once started of all processes the right havingness process is the safest process to run on anyone at any time it cannot be overrun if the pc comes into session with bounteous ptps arc breaks ruds wildly out and you are going to straighten them all out wouldnt it be nice to get them all out of the road ask the room question first consult your humanness and decide whether he is in any kind of shape to be audited if not start by running havingness this will start to extrovert him and make it easier for him to run ruds and to audit him on what you want to run dont collide with the ptp at all the terminal is wrong havingness isnt run against can squeeze its run against the pcs ability to have large objects in the room its tested on can squeeze you always run havingness until the pc can have large objects in the room the old rules of havingness applied to running it paired with confront the can squeeze check neednt be done more than two or three times week and the test of enough havingness is when he can have large objects in the room the havingnessconfront system ran large sections of case but havingness isnt residual in this system it was loaned to it pc with reduced havingness is picky and choosey about room objects hes cautious with havingness up the pc is relaxed and unconcerned he is bangy if havingness is working the ta goes up and blows down havingness runs the bank if you run very much of it the reason you dont run lot of havingness along with confront is that the confront runs the bank faster the havingness was to keep the pcs attention flexible havingness processes from the thirtysix presessions are run by themselves you dont need confront when running sec checks terminals 3d etc the depth of reach of the processing is accompanied by reduction of havingness in the extreme so run lot of havingness dont be upset when the pc goes into and out of pt thats the havingness running the bank its signalized by the pc apparently doping off but he isnt actually the pc can see but not look dont stop the process when he has gone blah run the process until he is back amongst us thats the second rule along with the large objects rule keep giving him the command at the same rate even though hes all blah hes still doing the command matter what he is doing with his eyeballs the pc does not have to tell you that he has executed the auditing command 149 the pc can get into trouble with havingness by having things he cant see with his eyes if he looks too much without looking he could be having bank in which case his havingness goes down instead of up become wary pcs do this person can be going around in life his whole lifetime without ever having seen any part of the physical universe its shock to get reality on it the pc puts up picture of the shelf and looks at that he sometimes discovers while running havingness that he is doing this the reason you have different havingness processes is that people have different degrees of perception someone with poor sight ability would do better on some other perceptic if there are thirtysix havingness processes you can be sure that there are more even thirtysix is more than is usually needed however you can run havingness process five times test it then if it loosened the needle run it twelve commands test again to be sure if the needle is looser ok if not look for another one if the needle was tighter dont put in any randomity go immediately to another process dont look dismayed if the needle does tighten in the interest of having standard posture from which to do the can squeeze get the pc to put his hands in his lap having found the pcs havingness process start the session run havingness to the large object rule especially if you had trouble finding the havingness process now run ruds youll have minimized the number of arc breaks you will get the pc is in games condition with you because his havingness is down get his havingness up and the games condition will vanish and his ruds will tend to be in and can easily be checked because your meter registers better if necessary now you can run the arc process it eats havingness so when he cycles into pt or has good cognition acknowledge the hell out of it and run havingness youll get bd of that tight ta and can go on and run the arc process better and longer and faster running havingness helps the pc give up his old havingness of old pictures you are getting him to realize that there is other havingness the common denominator of all goals terminals is games and the common denominator of all games is cant have keep it remedied or you will get games condition l ron hubbard type 3 idate291161 volnum1 issue86 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec86 emeter

his lonely vigil on cloud 69 where he has been keeping watch against all comers and where he learned never to take any orders then you step up with your emeter and give him an order you get response the symptom of extreme aberration is total unwillingness to receive any help you can be fooled by the fact that people or countries who are very lowtoned will beg for help you are fooled if you dont notice what is done with the help when it is received it is wasted andor used to make the helper wrong they use help as trap to show you how ineffectual you are india is in that condition now you will also find this in insane asylums you will see person on post somewhere who has to do everything himself he is proving that he must not be helped when you are auditing pc who can be helped things go pretty smoothly when you are auditing someone who is being an onlyone he is out of communication very suspicious and possibly unwilling to be helped even if hes ok on help you still have the communication barrier until that is knocked apart you wont find your meter reading on the pc he will be hard to assess if his communication level is going in and out during the assessment the average wog is highly suspicious he is highly alert his ability to be hurt is so enormous that he thinks he has to protect himself with all sorts of barricades and amongst these is help the more aberrated person is the more onlyone he is take someone who is not even vaguely in comm we are going to assess him to discover something about him if he feels that anything about him will be used against him you will get only total defense so your first effort in clearing anyone is to get that person into communication not only willing to talk to you but when you talk to him it means little something so that when you talk to him he can receive it you could sec check person whose help factor was way down if you got the exact right questions but you couldnt assess him remember theres charge on assessment hes not trying to withhold anything from you hes not trying to give you anything hes just meat the only place meter has hole in it is with arc breaks and you can repair that with an arc break process but that isnt good enough for assessment the person has to be in good communication with the auditor to get an accurate rapid assessment or the auditor has to have fantastic altitude in which case hell get reads the rudiments can be found to be in for one auditor yet hed be unable to get reads on assessment that just means the meter isnt registering for that person another auditor could find ruds out and be able to assess the pc so the meter is registering for him this is not spooky the onlyone pc who is not part of the human race wont let anyone have command value over him the first barrier you have to cross with him is getting him into communication speed of assessment depends on degree on willingness to communicate with the auditor altitude is the command value you have over the pc an auditor has to have confidence in his tools and what he is doing if he lacks it the pc can tell and assigns him lower altitude accordingly an inexpert auditor who is not in comm with the emeter and hostile pc who is not in comm with the human race will 151 give you debacle it is much more economical to sec check someone for seventyfive hours and put them in communication with the human race than to assess them for seventyfive hours the assessment will go nowhere but the sec check will make him feel better details on goals running and assessments unburdening is the mechanism of the way we are handling the gpm were taking the solutions off the top of it and it deintensified as problem because these terminals are as much problem as they have been solved the trick is to solve it without solving it again in way that pulls it in on the person you do it by taking off the solutions which is how it should have been solved in the first place the other barrier in your road is that the pc at the outset is uncertain that anything can be solved find out what in life he is having most trouble with find out who had that trouble briefly sec check that terminal hell feel different and gain awareness that change is possible you can even q and with his feeling that nothing works find someone else who felt that way and run ow on the person you can always count on whatever the pcs complaining about being present in another person keyed in by his ow on the person its also always on his own goals line so you are unburdening him with it try to handle something for the pc it will make your meter read better you can always find something the person will remember that will key out that was the procedure in 1950 the only trouble was that it only worked for 20 30 of cases and people tended to key it right back in because ow was run on the person who had it you can always run terminal for little while you could find eventually that you were the pcs opposition terminal sitting right there going in the teeth of his worst aberration auditing will nevertheless work over the top of this your job in handling pc is to get the pc to sit down and have some confidence and read on meter it could take up to seventyfive hours to get the pc into that state of mind but it is necessary to do so dont be in such hurry he has been crazy for the past 100 trillion years as far as auditor training is concerned its obviously better for the auditor to have degree of confidence and expertness and to know what he has been doing because the pcs confidence will go up at once so you will get something like 3d it all works itself out for us the pc is being run on security checks and the auditor is gaining confidence in his metering at the same time we trust the auditor wont miss too many sec check questions if the auditor isnt too familiar with the meter have him spend half an hour on end ruds so he can get what sec check question has been missed cleaned up well this keeps pcs from being upset pcs will also be upset by not being asked for the withhold behind the critical thought asking for critical thoughts is just trap for the pc to get in on the overt

with an ad like you can always talk to scientologist about your difficulties having someone doing admin is always security that the people you help will pay you for the service it is not really too bad that it takes some skill to apply routine 3d if you let loose powerful technology which anyone at all could apply youd be in trouble technology that doesnt require skilled applicator is what this world mainly suffers from for instance any government official can push the button on an atomic bomb if tech requires skill you cant build an ethic into it the broad program on which we are operating is concise and broad we have central organizations and offices all over earth which suffer mainly from lack of technology that they will now have the policy is to build in selfreliance within fixed pattern in the central orgs field auditors have been attempting to put up standard and having it collapse they generally dont get as consistently good results as hgcs which is why hgcs got started in the first place the basic reason for success in the hgcs is the stiffer discipline there the central organization as long as it is impoverished and feeling bad tends to go into games conditions with other orgs or field auditors this is simply because of lack of success when theres scarcity and 153 havingness is low theres games condition scarcity is repaired by technical excellence the briefing course was instituted for only one reason to get the highest possible level of technology step 6 would work today but in fact it didnt work because it was never done in running step 6 before you had the pc make the object bigger smaller etc you had to find null object on the emeter wherever it beefed up banks null object wasnt found relate it to the gpm if you found an object which quivered on the meter you would be onto the gpm and you wouldnt dare to do anything with it but you could take something not related to the gpm and exercise the pc on creating and mocking it up without antagonizing or messing up particularly the gpm the pc with some of the automaticities of mocking things up off could theoretically have the gpm evaporate details on running routine 3d q and puts the withhold in to stay when the pc gives you the withhold that is all you need if it still registers theres another withhold its not more on the withhold he has given you the reason you vary the question in sec checking is just to get more withholds to help the pc out but you always end up by asking the original question to see if it is cleared if you add any new sec check questions make them pertinent to what you are doing if burst of misemotion occurs on sec check or class ii activity it is turned off by what turned it on that is true of all secondaries particularly of an assessment running havingness or sec check question if withhold turned it on some withhold is keeping it powered up so get the withhold if misemotion is turned on by havingness you can find out what is happening if you like but continue the process that turned it on its cruelty to do otherwise matter how kind it may seem any other process you may switch to is so much less powerful than what you have been running that it wont handle the misemotion it takes more of the same the greatest cruelty is being kind to the pc it will not help pc to omit sec checking him or to rush him into an assessment he will never get through routine 3d levels if you do if you left sec check question unflat in one session dont spend the session getting ruds in flatten the question if the ta has soared meanwhile find out what has been going on if bypassing ptp upsets the pc go back to the earlier withhold that preceded it it could be some undelivered comm if the session looks confused to the auditor the pc will get upset the pc is trying to make session out of it so he is harder to audit if the auditor is confused because the pc reacts to the confusion of the auditor an unskilled auditor has much tougher pcs than anybody else then because it is all so complicated the unskilled auditor sees nothing wrong with adding more complications so he puts in additives the job is to teach people not to put in lots of useless stuff keep it very simple and they will win 154 l ron hubbard type 3 idate141261 volnum1 issue93 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec93 anatomy of problems 6112c14 shspec93 anatomy of problems problem is postulate counterpostulate force counterforce idea versus idea solution versus solution you have two people in collision in trouble with each other to be in trouble with each other they have to be in the same time stream and they have to be able to communicate do you realize that you with your problems are on separate time stream from the physical universe and thats why you are not in present time so even in an individual you have two time streams how do you suppose pc got out of pt he must have started off in some instant of time that went on this same timestream but he went off on spur line during the middle of say race he finds his watch missing its an important thing to him and he loses it while he is at the racetrack in timestream called the race he tries to go back to the time he lost the watch and therefore on the subject of the watch he has departure in time from the timestream he starts running on backtimetrack while time goes forward on the agreedupon time track he is trying to find out what happened not to stop time he just wants to see what happened thetan has the facility of running on another time stream so he goes off sideways worrying about it he has problem now and because he hasnt solved it very well he gets stuck in it but then he really gets stuck by solving it he becomes the foe of all pickpockets so he wont lose his watch but hes already on slightly different timestream and he remains on it because he started it you normally refer to this sort of thing as game rather downgraded one he isnt really hung up in moment of this timestream but in moment of departure the rest of the time he sort of makes time himself it becomes an endless affair that can float along forever so you are running along in session and he suddenly has picture of racetrack that picture exists in another timestream which he can slip into how about the fellow who didnt enter this universe at all you never met him he isnt on the timestream can you have problem with him when you have never met him and never will youve never had anything in common with him youve never communicated with him youve never gotten any ows on him so how can you have problem with him you cant so all problems have their own timestream between the two beingnesses ideas forces or whatever they must also have means of communication two armies will maneuver forward until someone fires shot thats communication which everybody can understand now the communication enlarges and they can really have an agreement not disagreement to have war now they can have problems with logistics mechanics propaganda and how to have motivators big enough to justify the overts where you see an argument there must have been prior agreement even light one cf the idea that there can be arc break without prior abc this is why the goriest wars are civil wars the defeated in civil war are treated like criminals not just losers this is because there has been tremendous amount of agreement so the arc break is very severe similarly with serious 2d upsets there couldnt be wild disagreement resulting in problem unless there was some prior agreement the problem is as large as there has been agreement france and germany have common blood going back to the conquest of gaul by the franks 155 there might be road out on the solution of problem in the recognition that 3d is based on onetime total agreement remember about games pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism person gets on one side of game to the degree that he has reduced his pandeterminism accepted otherdeterminism and considers himself to be operating on selfdeterminism there are always these factors there must be an outside disinterested arbitrator to resolve the problem thats where the auditor comes in routine 3d is one of the roughest ones to figure out even lrh had to have outside help to the degree of someone else reading the emeter to figure it out it was so involved that it was all selfdetermined or otherdetermined with pandetermined factors at all it looks at first to the pc like there are at least forty or fifty vital factors it takes the auditor to shake it all down to five the auditor does it by listing and assessing down to one item which will either be totally right or utterly wrong oppterm that is it will be either totally selfdetermined terminal or totally otherdetermined oppterm notice that any item you choose will get one of three reactions from the pc 1 he doesnt know if it is right and doesnt care this is rare it could be wrong item or he could be arc broken or groggy 2 it could be selfdetermined or otherdetermined 3 the pc could do flipflop between self and otherdeterminism this phenomenon is lower scale mockery of pan self and otherdeterminism the three factors present in all problems the pc just dramatizes these as he gets into the gpm hell be on one side for few days then go into dont know then go pandetermined for bit i can have both viewpoints im really something else so just run the side you can chip at best and if you are not making progress you have chosen side he cant confront there are levels of confront to consider if we were going to run only one side it would be vital to get the right one you could just run the right side of the right levels and hed go clear but you cant always expect it to happen the harder he is enmeshed in the gpm the less distinct it is to him that either side is real or he is liable to be very fixed in one side and not at all in the other as you run him he has hard time of it if you pick the wrong side for him he will run long time the gpm is problem before it was problem it was an agreement and after it was an agreement it was game there was time continuum and these two elements beingnesses and ideas which make up the 3d 3rd dynamic existed once in their nuclear form as total agreement 1 they were in the same timestream 2 they were in perfect communication 3 they had tremendous agreement and goals on what they were doing they had all these things in common and then they started to depart one from the other and got into game which got very thorough the game deteriorated into problem and stuck ie 1 there was long period of total agreement 2 then there was agreement on the game they got into 3 then it got to be very deadly and got beyond game into being problem 156 but having originated with its own timecontinuum the problem continues up into present time as gpm the easiest way to approach it for most pcs is to find that side they can most easily fight that will give them big case gains and will take big solutions off the top of the problem but recognize that we have long way to go after having taken the solutions off the top of the problem the end of the auditing is not just reaching the end of the prehav levels but could be expected to go on further you now have the selfdeterminism otherdeterminism softened up bit you still have to attain selfdeterminism for the other side for the pc and pandeterminism the pc is really on neither side the pc has been waterbucks he has been tigers before there were waterbucks and tigers as enemies the pc couldnt have told the difference between them they would have had the same goal they werent very solidly waterbucks or tigers yet their nowimsupposedtos werent yet congealed to that extent then they started separating out distinct characteristics which were only waterbucks or only tigers then they solved problems different ways and the game deteriorated into some very standard nowimsupposedtos those were specialized forms of selfdetermined survival that had nothing to do with pandeterminism but great deal to do with otherdeterminism the truth of the matter however is that the pc is neither side tiger or waterbuck and is capable of being either the pc shifts from one side to the other just because you have audited him lot just because you have done listing and nulling of his items thats tremendous amount of auditing his nowimsupposedtos are shook up like dice in box now he will dramatize both sides while before you started auditing he was fixed in one side and dramatized it on stimulusresponse basis so the pc is assessed youve got the routine 3d package and now you want to find the right side for the pc the only thing that makes it the right side is that the pc can run it with benefit tis the side he can run best to run out somatics and break up the gpm its not that the pc is that side because the pc is equally the other side and is neither side in truth and is capable of being both both sides are equally otherdetermined to him but one side is higher than the other on the tone scale so it is easier to view as the ally and harder to buck in auditing but the pc has used both sides down through the ages until he has so many overts on himself as waterbuck that these overbalanced and he became tiger you are trying to establish the pandeterminism of thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad action because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he has some game running that has resulted in an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos all nowimsupposedtos were part of some old problem and earlier than that some old game and earlier than that some old agreement the pcs pandeterminism has been submerged and he is being obsessively selfdetermined which pins him thoroughly on dynamic and he is longer loose on the dynamics 157 your first attack on routine 3d package is just to find the onlyonlyness of it does the pc think of himself mostly as waterbuck at this moment the easiest side to run is usually the lower toned side if you run the pc as it because of the trick of the commands you get more attack against the weakest side of the gpm so it runs more mass and more flows and it is easier for the pc to handle the other side may either totally slay him or have reality at all he is not capable of attacking tigers because they are too much for him they dont exist for him if you run this one watch out the pc may get so overwhumped that before the pc realizes it he is down the tubes even so if you kept attacking something would happen it would be uncomfortable for the pc he would arc break easily but hell try it but he doesnt get reality out of it thats the basic liability could you just blow one of these things up in the early stages of the run if you ask the pc what he would think of blowing it up or wiping it all out at one fell swoop hed go into an awful confusion he hasnt got it differentiated enough to do much about it he couldnt attack one side of the problem because it was too big for him to find it real what will be his reaction to wiping out the whole thing thats about seven times as unreal the idea of this game ever having an end or beginning is preposterous in view of the fact that there are confusions on down the line that tend to bang the pc up into the problem as you audit the thing you keep on hitting confusions of one kind or another it keeps banging the pc up towards pt so the track to him looks shorter and shorter he thinks maybe he was only waterbuck for one lifetime then it broadens out again and hell feel he was waterbuck for very long time what remains to be sorted out is the easiest way to beat the gpm over month or two you might be able to take pieces of it the pc can find conflicts and date them on the meter and get the whole track plotted on the subject that would soften up the gpm just by getting it aligned and assigned correctly on the track during that time you wouldnt have to figure out which side the pc was on this is feasible method of clearing somebody it would mean teaching people to date on the emeter which is quite skill but it could be done and its quite tool or you could find every confusion that might precede any stuck picture the pc has on the subject of waterbucks vs tigers find what the person was at the time and what they did it would be an interesting gimmick to make list of the number of goals the terminal and oppterm have in common or of the points on which they would be in agreement or you could ask what game would waterbuck play with tiger and vice verse it would all run out the center of the problem once the prehav runs have straightened it out somewhat all you are trying to do it to establish the pandeterminism of the thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad one because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he had some game going which has become an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos you are trying to establish the pcs pandeterminism so he can breaths before auditing the pc is being solution solution solution the next thing you see with auditing is problem problem problem when this is peeled off he is game game game 158 the ta goes up on the pc because he is breaking the mores of the terminal not necessarily those of society or his present group guy whose terminal is cat burglar will get high ta

upgrading of auditors 6112c20 shspec95 upgrading of auditors most people are diffident about tampering with other peoples minds better mechanism could be devised to keep race enslaved it means take responsibility for anyones thinking but your own and not even for that and you will stay in every implant you have ever been handed this ensures that revolt will ever come out of any planet this is the principle of the boxer if your opponent is knocked out hes safe but there is game this is galactic council thinking ie the thought of supergovernments which are slaverule governments these governments are in bottomscale nogames condition when they know all about it and nothing ever happens they go for this kind of concentration camp populations where everybody is out of the running and giving trouble the first thing you do to create this condition is never to let anyone tamper with anyones mind or thinking it guarantees that one will ever asis anything its put over as the principle that the right to privacy is paramount some auditors are more affected by this than others these are auditors who are withholding their terminals they have terminal and an oppterm and they are withholding both of them because they have been thoroughly punished for having been it so they know thats the safe thing to do to withhold the terminal first one has the right to privacy of minds it is accident that in 50000 years one on this planet has come close to even the edge of scientology the right to freedom is one thing the right to privacy is something else galactic thinking approves of the second not the first lrhs opinion is the opposite the trouble with the galactic thinking that would make criminal into mest by implanting him is that its unsuccessful you cant guarantee that he will stay mest just as you cant guarantee that planet wont revolt you cant guarantee that wisdom wont get abroad all you can guarantee is that thetans are basically good but get all mixed up but when you unmix them they revert to being good this is unpopular in galactic councils because it makes people so active and unpredictable these truths may or may not be known to galactic rulers case advance results in greater controlled motion motion in the vicinity of insanity is uncontrolled random motion directed controlled motion is preferable but dont try to sell the rulers of the universe on this because it would mean their losing power you will observe that people who arent totally spun in are willing to inquire into others minds because they havent accepted the idea that everything will be all right if you just be quiet auditors fall into three categories 1 the fairly free individual who hasnt taken his terminal too heavily he hasnt quite subscribed to the philosophy that hes slave hell charge in 2 the individual who can recognize intellectually that it would be all right to invade the privacy of others and that the only way he could set them free is if this sort of thing occurred but who has terminal so worded that he withholds it violently 159 its hard to get this kind of auditor up to class ii because his terminal gets in his road his terminal seems dangerous so he will hold it out of action which makes it go into action withholding of the terminal is the key to the 3d package thats what makes it go out of sight its fantastic that you can get to it at all the degree that the pc withholds pt overts is the degree to which he is withholding his terminal if he is doing it hard he will have trouble getting other people to give up their withholds as he will have trouble doing good sec checks even though he knows intellectually what he should be doing he can be educated into doing it right 3 the third category of individual is too mixed in to be able to audit at all he forms large percentage of the human race he is often found in government where his galactic thinking is the norm he wont even try to get off withholds conduct in session is monitored by the terminal package it shows up as unwillingness to get off withholds plus doubt about it which also comes from the pulledin mass of the terminal the modifier modifies their conduct whenever ruds are out theyll dramatize it when ruds go out oddly enough auditors dont have cases the modifier doesnt much influence their auditing what influences the auditor is the amount of withhold on the terminal there is another factor in the plan of auditing every withhold the pc has is stacked up on top of withholdingness of the terminal since present time has greater value than past time presentlife overts and withholds have the terminal so glued down that it is virtually unassessable at first sec checking gets the withholds off so the terminal can come to view this gives us an estimate of how long it will take to get pc ready to be assessed and how long it will take given auditor to get assessed for his terminal its not necessarily the more violent or secret types of terminals that get the most withheld but the persons reaction to sec checks and ability to sec check is what alerts you to how quickly or easily they will be assessed one is only worried or concerned about subject when theres notknow on the subject therefore you can handle pc to the degree that you understand pcs because you can see whats happening with the pc someone who has never had bad auditing wont necessarily audit well because he has reality on what it is like to audit poorly getting some bad auditing would really make citizen out of him and give him an appreciation of perfectionist attitude toward training which prevents the technology from getting lost there is value in having been aberrated it gives you wealth of experience that you can gain in other way even if at present its unavailable to you it is the experience of knucklehead of course and few trillion years of such experience should be enough its time now to get experience in other lines than that of your terminal when life follows pattern from an aberrated to sane state the best way to accumulate experience in that direction is to take someone who is aberrated and teach them something and improve them at the same time misadventure can be teacher it is the only teacher if you have to learn solely by experience clearing would have value whatsoever if it was matter of just taking pill or having some magic formula to get it one ever appreciates his freedom unless he has had to work for 160 it if person doesnt have to work for his freedom he never finds out that he is free you could even clear someone who doesnt realize that anything has happened that anything was improved or that they are going anyplace he has purpose to which to put his new breadth of skill and its more than he needs on this cottonpicking planet the net

sec checks withholds 6201c10 shspec98 sec checks withholds the process 2010 is used to handle psychosomatic difficulties using class ii skills and sec checking 2010 is process where ten minutes of havingness is run for every twenty minutes of sec checking this is run for 75 to 200 hours before attacking routine 3dxx see hcob 11jan62 security checking twentyten theory there is danger in sec checking by ritual you should do it by fundamentals heres what happens because you dont quite grasp the fundamental someone stiffens up the ritual then it stiffens again and you become ritualist and can depart from effective auditing the thing to do is to get the job done auditing is what you can get away with with the pc because you cant get away with everything ritual gets set down circumscribing what you should try to get away with model session is good thing to use except with few pcs who would never get past the third question see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised7 you can imagine case that is so critically poised that you have to find out what the mind is doing in order to parallel it if you tried to do model session to find out you would be in culdesac because the case doesnt have that much attention concentrated for instance take madman who could still be handled with basic sec checking he is insane because he keyed in an insane valence by withholding its not this lifetime that aberrated anyone people say that you cant understand the mind because this lifetime doesnt explain why people are aberrated someone who is insane got that way by keying in implants that he gave to drive enemy troops insane to prevent them from coming back plus some similar overts which developed an insane valence insane people can go in and out of valences very easily it is the notknow they have run on other people that results in the withhold on themselves so what basic question could you ask this fellow which he could answer to start keying out the insanity you could ask what dont people know about you he would answer it it is so fundamental that he couldnt help answering it case could be so attentive to its difficulties that it is already in session to try to fly ruds would be to distract the pcs attention from his case with deranged person the dont know question works well it crosscuts the ow questions when case does not consider something an overt he will still answer up to notknow and will come up to recognizing his withholds you can use such questions as what dont i know about you what dont you know about your condition what dont others know about you your condition what you are doing 161 auditing by fundamental would be to restore the pcs communication with society or the group with which he is connected you would expect person who is having hard time with the social structure he is in to have withholds from that social structure you see this in vignette all the time you missed withhold and the pc got upset with you its reversed comm line he has ptps because he has withholds from people withhold is withhold whether the pc considers them withholds or not for instance if the pc withholds losing his temper with people its laudable but it is still withhold if in finding withholds you dont look for such withholds or for simple withheld communications you will have devil of time keeping ruds in the pc is busy little beaver sitting there thinking and withholding critical thoughts etc withholds are not confined to crimes the magnitude of the crime does not establish the magnitude of the withhold it is the force with which he is withholding so anything the pc is withholding is withhold anything he is not communicating is withhold when you realize this you will get ruds in with clank and be able to assess just fine and sec checking will go fine sec checking will fail if you expect the magnitude of the withhold to give you the magnitude of the recovery it is the magnitude of the restraint of the withholding that does it the way to find what the case is withholding is to get what any part of the eight dynamics doesnt know about him the way you have gravity is by withholding self from space most of your sec checking will be on the third dynamic since it is the most complicated and there have been so many groups on the track but you might do well to look at the others too the second dynamic is of course loaded with mores to violate withhold is restraining self from communicating the corresponding overt is restraining another from communicating when someone is withholding some action he gets into the valence of someone who would do the action moral codes are patterns of behavior on all eight dynamics that means you are triggering those moments when the pc was not communicating perforce he should have been talking and he wasnt thats what it amounts to the ability of thetan in this universe is expressed along the lines of reach and withdraw in various directions when person should be reaching and is withdrawing that is withhold then there are overts of omission he should be reaching and he is not for instance there may be times when soldier should have attacked and he ran these are overts of omission if they are the reverse of nowimsupposedto it all amounts to failure to communicate with the environment or restrained communication with the environment which ends up as not being here in the environment which ends up with the environment pulled in on oneself you could ask what should you have communicated and get some marvellous results where should you have been gets off effort withholds withholding is worse than just not reaching very withholdy pc will stack up withholds on subject the tiniest impulses to withhold will remain as withholds if the pc has set of withholds on subject this pc will have loads of critical thoughts if you are not sec checking its valid to ask pc what are you withholding and if you dont get fall dont press it but dont think he is not withholding because he is you dont have missed withhold to contend with 162 but the pc has at least some laudable withholds thats ok he can be in session but he still has withhold you only have to do something about it if he gets upset and goes out of session then you will have to find it ruds in merely means in condition to be audited you can always find the ruds out if it is your purpose to audit the case by rudiments when you sec check you try to restimulate the withholds so you can clean them up this has an opposite purpose from ruds the auditors mission in sec checking is to stir up things the pc doesnt feel ok about communicating so that the withholds can be gotten off because that is what aberration is made of so be suggestive knowing fundamentals use eg what doesnt _______ know about you what have you done that _______ wouldnt like and dont miss withholds the fourth dynamic is whole species not just mankind l ron hubbard type 3 idate11162 volnum1 issue99 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec99 how to audit 6201c11 shspec99 how to audit if thetan can communicate directly and straightly with things he begins to communicate more directly with his body since the eyes are the most direct comm route from thetan when youve done something with thetan you will notice the eyes changing color if i cant make pcs eyes change color i dont think ive done anything making somebody well is not much of trick bodies are ok but to fixate on one totally is silly if you are dealing with technology that can restore the comm lines of thetan you are going to find psychosomatics knocked out with 2010 you may also find pcs getting whole new set of psychosomatics body responds in direct ratio to the communication level of the thetan running it body will also run on complete automatic so body can be in good shape when the thetan is nowhere around and because the thetan is nowhere around you will see some people hollywood starlet types for instance who are simply operating bodies these are people who are so irresponsible that they dont have enough thetan horsepower to make body sick similarly with the dead thetan case which reads at clear but with stuck needle aberration on help etc if you process such pc hs will come uh into some degree of density if you dont get some physical changes you are doing something different from what lrh is trying to teach you with current technologies lot of you think you are doing fine i dont think so yet because i havent seen you changing the color of anybodys eyes i can so why cant you ill audit pc until their eyecolor changes maybe its just very faint change and maybe its from brown to blue but its change because thats the most direct channel of communication from the thetan to you and to the outside world and if you can improve that channel of communication from the thetan outward it cant help but do something to his eyes theyll at least sparkle or glisten differently im asking you to audit the pc who is sitting in front of you and not somebody else and not some synthetic person that you dreamed up audit the guy who is there please to produce disaster miss withhold and you have had it the next time the pc has an arc break just follow it back to the withhold you can always hold pc in session with technical tricks but dont stop with tricks audit the person in front or you that person he is mystery as far as fundamentals are concerned he is nevertheless an individual peculiar handmade mud pie you have 163 got to be able to put your finger on any button that is in there to be pressed and produce considerable reaction in the pc you have to be able to advance the pcs communication and that is all you are trying to produce all that is wrong with the pc is that he has shortened the reach of his communication as his ability to reach which is to say to communicate decreases he considers that he is aberrated when you audit this person all you have got to do is to extend his communication reach workable processes have all done this the pcs inability to reach can come about from two things 1 he is restraining himself from reaching in some fashion 2 he doesnt know what to reach into or at auditing the second button gives you the biggest gains for instance routine 3d straightens out the messedup condition inside his mind on the first button the auditor has to figure out what the restraint of reach is about we call this withholds how is he restraining himself from reaching he has overtly reached at some point then he has decided that was bad thing to do so he withholds the reach next time this gives you confusion followed by rest point the withhold which locks it on the track and makes it float rather timelessly this is not as bad as problem but it is similar now that the thetan has decided he must never exercise that type of reach again he has forgotten what type of reach he was exercising that he mustnt reach again so he is now in total confusion as to what he is withholding so how are you going to get off this persons particular and peculiar withholds not by virtue of any form lrh has made to get at his withholds he is after all unique an auditor can get so lost in the infinite variety of the pcs 3d package and the complexity and idiocy of the pcs withholds that the auditor believes he cant reach but thats the auditors belief that he cant reach the reason the pc wont reach into black masses or valences is that they are enturbulative after all they did kill him many times so he knows better than to touch them they give him somatics even in session colds etc when he forgets himself and takes direct and instantly forgotten look at them people complain about scientologists lack of sympathy but once you have learned to handle something to the degree that we have confound it you just cant bring yourself to worship it anymore you know too much about the cause and effect of it all what are persons basic withholds they could be anything but he knows he will be punished for getting them off because hes made people guilty for doing such things this is great mechanism he really knows his withholds have nothing to do with his state of health or his brightness person cant improve his reach and communication while simultaneously restraining his communication so an auditor has two zones of action in dianetics he has pictures which are shallow look compared to valences which are whole packages of pictures each valence represents at least one lifetime so what things are keeping the pc from communicating he is impeding his own reach by having things he feels he cannot communicate now it is up to the auditor to get these off by whatever means are effective he has to be able to get that pcs withholds all you are trying to do is release the comm lines that the pc has pulled in on himself so he can widen the zones into which he can again reach 164 all you have to do to get withholds off is to find where the pc isnt how come he blew from some elsewhere he is at least withholding himself from all the places he is not that is not aberrative in itself but you could say to the pc where havent you liked to be the pc says i never liked to be at the seashore ok hes not at the seashore and doesnt want to be all sorts of withholds could be developed from this ask him what have they done to you at the seashore and who was it who did it then rave you thought any critical thoughts about the person then what have you done to the person so the procedure is 1 where havent you liked to be 2 what have they done to you at location get details 3 who did it to you 4 get any critical thoughts about the person 5 what have you done to that person in running 2010 running havingness will get the pc to give you more withholds if the pc considers that he doesnt have any withholds you can run what the person about whom he is critical doesnt know about him and he will eventually come up to seeing his withholds and overts the trick is to audit with the ruds in and run the ruds so they stay in and then throw the pc around stir up the pcs bank and get the withholds dont muddy the still waters of the rudiments so that the pc never dreams of being anywhere but in session then churn up the pcs bank in the body of the session the pc has been careful not to do this for trillenia so it is the auditor who has got to make something happen so when you get something reading on the meter get the pc talking about it get his critical thoughts and let him get off the motivators and finally go on to the trap get the overts and withholds technique of running hidden standards etc with routine 3d l ron hubbard type 3 idate16162 volnum1 issue100 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec100 nature of withholds 6201c16 shspec100 nature of withholds we are not trying to teach you not to have withholds it is ok not to do everything that occurs to you good or bad we are trying to get you out of the tangle you got yourself into what do you mean having such terrible impulses why does the pc have these impulses that he now has to withhold the withhold is that area of motionlessness following that area of doingness which you shouldnt have done this classifies actions into things you should have done and things you shouldnt have done of course there are laudable withholds eg not to have gotten angry or done some overt laudable withhold is something society expects of you providing you have these other impulses to do things you shouldnt according to society so all actions divide into laudable and undesirable laudable withhold goes with an undesirable action withholding self from doing it and the laudable action goes along with an undesirable withhold so society can always enforce mores by making some actions and some withholds laudable but since there are so many groups whose mores conflict one can get rather confused the same action in different times or places can be good or bad there is action that is good in all times and places and there is withhold that should be withheld at all times and places it all depends on viewpoint 165 when sec checking we must then be dealing with another factor people compute that good people withhold more than bad people so the gooder you are the less you communicate so the goodest people are in cemeteries we must be doing something other than pulling withholds we are we are remedying the compulsion or obsession to commit actions that have to be withheld sec checking is to remedy unreasonable action thats all what you want to rehabilitate is his ability to determine his own actions this also rehabilitates his communication as well as covering whatever mores he will wind up with control of communication downgrades into mest as control of reach communication is the ability to control an outflow or inflow or stop it this downgrades into control of reach where you have person who is unable to leave his house the trouble is not the house but picadilly circus the pc is afraid that someday he will be in picadilly circus and take off all his clothes but he has forgotten this all he knows is that he mustnt leave home he has occluded the overt and the withhold the mechanism is that the pc can be so worried about taking his clothes off in picadilly circus that he will think of nothing but withholding this this circumscribes his life considerably this is the mechanism of phobias having to remember to do some desirable action is similar attention trap eg the superstitions that kids get into if we educated the same man never to outflow and never to withhold either both equally balanced we would have an insane ridge he would get stuck in an inaction because he would forget what he wasnt supposed to do and what he was withholding he would have covered overt and covered withhold and be motionless in some sphere he would not be free to communicate because he couldnt find out what the desirable action was the average person is in this condition he doesnt know what he must reach and what he must withhold but the habit pattern of caution stays with him all psychoanalysis trained people to be was cautious someone with an enforced outflow has similar problem he must go or do or whatever without knowing why in order to restore control over ones reach not reach be reached not be reached one must get these unknowingnesses out of the road or the person will sometimes be nervous to the point of collapse when you ask them to do something or other in order to aberrate somebody establish compulsion to reach or to withdraw withhold as an absolute necessity then shift them in time and place to produce necessity for this so they forget it make an unknowingness out of it all do this several hundred thousand times and the person will start to feel he didnt know what he should be doing when person gets very bad off any decision to act causes him to withhold and vice versa government programs are good examples of this some people are totally susceptible to any inflowing action of any kind anything that happens to them in society causes them to have an instant reaction to have that with them in assessing such pcs if the auditor suggests some item they will take it even if they are assessed by an auditor with degree of altitude they will hold like briars to whatever is found right or wrong you can test such an item by getting in suppress inval and eval on the item and see if it is still in the average person is on gradient scale of this sort of thing he sees few things which restimulate him and put him on total effect basis 166 the only thing wrong with that total effect basis is that person has command over his reach and withdraw so he is not master of his actions and cant be sensible about what he does iq is ones ability to govern ones environment scientology is almost alone in considering that man should have any selfdeterminism because others falling short of this have looked on the fact that criminal has compulsion to commit crimes being unable to do anything for criminal they think the only answer is to make the criminal withhold his crimes harder that philosophy doesnt work you can compel someone not to do something to the point where he can do nothing else he withholds so far that the withhold fails and it becomes compulsion that is the danger of the philosophy that the more good withholds we have the better off we are the basis of action in human beings is 1 he doesnt know what his compulsive actions are so he doesnt know what he is withholding notknowingness is the common denominator of all ows that are operative on the individual 2 the halfknowns that arise in sec checking where the pc knows and you dont are also source of trouble withholds are half know if the pc knows something that is not enough the auditor has to know it too the pc will get upset if you go on notknowing about it when he knows the halfknow is very uncomfortable it wont duplicate so it wont blow so it is an upsetting thing to have the withholds dont have to be serious in session they can be very trivial bits of noncommunication which multiply they are relatively unknown to the pc as they drift by an invalidation often betokens withhold so check for inval and withhold to keep the ruds in and the needle clean during sec checks and assessments withhold is the common denominator of every out rudiment the only exception is where you are running the session for forms sake and not for the pc where you are not auditing the pc who is in front of you where you have disobeyed the auditors code through not being in communication with the pc and have set up an unintentional withhold for the pc throughout the whole session the pc who cannot talk to the auditor because the auditor is not really there is on an unintentional withhold which still causes an arc break you must run the session for the pc the pc owns the session almost all breakage amongst children is due to their being put on an unintentional withhold all withholds must contain an intention to communicate the intention to reach must exist before withhold can occur there must have been an intention to communicate before there is an arc break therefore pc being audited by someone who is out of comm with him will arc break remember that every session you run is for that pc and by the auditor and for one else in training you could get auditors to make long list of all the reasons why they were running session you are liable to get fabulous things not including that it is for the pc it is the pc who owns the session not the auditor if you master that point you will overcome most of your difficulties with auditing and any distaste you might have for it if pc feels that he cant comm to the auditor this equates to the fact that he must be withholding this restimulates other withholds of undesirable action the restimulated withhold may be failed withhold which brings about obsessive action at once and 167 the pc finds himself in the godawful position of engaging in actions he knows are reprehensible and incapable of stopping himself from acting he wonders how he got in this position as he berates the auditor he feels bad about the fact that he is doing these actions while he is doing them so you by letting him have session withhold are likely to get him into this weird action which amazes him most of all tr0 and tr4 are the most important trs from the standpoint of getting and keeping the pc in session tr0 is important from the auditors viewpoint tr4 from the pcs the way to handle tr4 is to be sure that it is the pcs session just give him the session in sec checking you are trying to discover the actions that are considered undesirable by the pc and the withholds that restrain them you get off the withhold by blowing the prior confusion when you are sec checking you are on the business of the prior confusion and the motionless point the prior confusion is the overt the stable datum is the withhold the anatomy of withhold is 1 done undesirable action 2 stop undesirable action 3 natter the guy cant reach and he cant withhold but he can natter when you have the withhold you have the motionless point but you must get the prior confusion you must get what the flowed since this pc is the one who is there being audited this is why you must get the done in pulling withhold use the critical statement to find the overt but dont pull the unkind thought pull the overt underlying it this overt is what gives you sort of motor action natter is not necessarily motivatorish to get the charge off step 2 above you can ask the pc have you ever done that since the pc will think you are asking for more overts but in fact you are getting him to spot whether he has been withholding himself from doing it ever since he will be relieved when that withhold is off because the stress of maintaining the withhold is relieved he can feel uncomfortable just getting off the fact of having done some undesirable action because you have unstrapped some of the restraint against doing it again he wont feel relief from the session because the full extent of the withhold isnt off yet so ask the above question the pc may not be entirely happy about giving up the withhold doing this may trigger off ways he was restraining himself without getting the overt he may be afraid to get all the withhold off because he might do the action so make it rule always to find the overt also ask for other times he did it and didnt do it get all l ron hubbard
