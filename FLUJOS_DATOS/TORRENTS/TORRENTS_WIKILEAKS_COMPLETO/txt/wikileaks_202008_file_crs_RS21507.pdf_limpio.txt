questions remain regarding the imp act barda will have on countermeasure development the continuing implementat ion of project bioshield and whether additional legislation w ould further encourage c ountermeasure development introduction following the terrorist attacks of 2001 the federal government determined that it would need additional medical countermeasures eg diagnos tic tests drugs vaccines and other treatments to respond to an attack using che mical biological radiological or nuclear cbrn agents1 the paucity of cbrn agent count ermeasures is attributed to the lack of significant commercial market2 because these diseas and conditions occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507crs2 2 continued the us house of representatives select committee on homeland security may 15 2003

treatments to market project bioshield to encourage the development of new cbrn countermeasures president bush proposed project bioshield in his 2003 st ate of the union address the 108th congress considered this proposal and passed the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 signed into w july 21 20043 this act has three main provisions it provides the department of health and human services hhs expedited procedures for cbrn terrorismrelated spending in cluding procuring products hi ring experts and awarding research grants the act creates governmentmarket guarantee by allowing the hhs secretary to obligate funds to purchase counter measures while they still have several more years of development however companie s only receive payment when development is complete and the product is livered the act also aut horizes the hhs secretary to temporarily allow the emergency use of countermeasures that lack food and drug administration fda approval expedited procedures the act relaxes procedures under the federal acquisition regulation for pr ocuring property or services used in performing administering or supporting cbrn counterm easure research and development rd this decreases both the amount of paperwor k required for these expenditures and the potential for oversight the act increases the maximum from 100000 to 25 million for contracts awarded under s implified acquisition procedures it also allows these purchases using other than full and open co mpetition another provision increases the micropurchase maximum fro m 2500 to 15000 these increases are similar to but greater than changes granted to the depar tment of homeland secu rity dhs and other departments and agencies in the homeland security act pl 107 296 and the national defense authorization act 2004 pl 108136 the act authorizes the hhs secretary to us an expedited award process rather than the normal peer review process for grants contracts and cooperativ agreements related to cbrn countermeasure rd activity if the secretary deems there is pressing need for an expedited award this power is limited to awards of 15 million or less some scientists have expressed concerns that an expedited peer review process will reduce the research quality4 the normal peer review process is designed to provide proposals with greater scientific merit hi gher probability of receiving funding congress allowed hhs to establish the details of this new alternative expedited award process market guarantee the act is designed to guarantee companies that the government will buy new successfully

bioshieldannualreportstrategic national stockpile sns5 the act allows the hhs secretary with the concurrence of the dhs secret ary and upon the approval of th president to promise to buy product up to eight years before it is reasonably expected to be delivered company is paid only on the delivery of substantial portion of the countermeasure therefore this guarantee reduces the market risk for the company but does not affect its exposure to development risk ie the risk that the countermeasure will fail during testing and be undeliverable th pandemic and allhazard preparedness act pl 109417 modified the project bioshield act to allow for milestonebased payments of up to half of the total award before delivery the project bioshield act allows th purchase of unapproved and unlicenced countermeasures it requires the hhs secr etary to determine that sufficient and satisfactory clinical experien ce or research data support s reasonable conclusion that the product will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years6 the approval and licensing processes are designed to precl ude the marketing of in effective or dangerous treatments because most drugs that be gin this process fail to become approved treatments critics of this provision suggest that the government will end up purchasing countermeasures that may neve r be approved to reduce the governments financial risk associated with this provision the act allows contracts to be wr itten so that unapproved products may be purchased at lowe r cost than approved products emergency use of unapproved products the act also allows the hhs secretary to authorize the emer gency use of medical products that are not approved by the fda or hhs to exercise this authority the hhs secretary must conclude 1 the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or lif ethreatening disease 2 the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting diagnosing treating or preventing the disease 3 th known and potential be nefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks 4 adequate alterna tive to the product is approved and available and 5 any other criteria prescribed in regulation are met although this provision would permit the secr etary to circumvent the normal approval process its use appears to be intended to be limited to dire circumstances reporting requirements the project bioshield act of 2004 requires annual reports from the hhs secretary about the exercise of the au thorities granted in this bill7 this act also requires the government ccountability office gao to produce report four years after enactment to assess actions taken under aut horities granted by the act to determine the effectiveness of the act and to recommend additional measures to address deficiencies this report is due in 2008 appropriations this act did not appropriate any money instead it authorized the appropriation of up to total of 5593 billion for

allow dod to use the hhs vaccine s in its active troop vaccination program before expiration12 dod would reimburse hhs for the vaccine allowing hhs to replenish the stockpile vaccine however th is solution would not address the expiration problems of countermeasures lacking other highvolume users such countermeasures may require additional periodic purchases to replenish the stockpile to maintain consistent readiness level congress may consider whether such purchases should be funded through the advance appropriated project bioshiel d account or through annual sns budget authorities broad spectrum countermeasures many experts believe that broad spectrum countermeasures those that ddress multiple cbrn agents would be the most valuable additions to the sns such nonspecific c ountermeasures might be the best defense against currently unknown threats such as em erging diseases or genetically engineered pathogens furthermore such counterme asures are more likely to have other nonbiodefenserelated applica tions pl 108276 does not exclude procuring such countermeasures however it does require that the presence of another commercial market be factored into the hhs s ecretarys decision to purchase the countermeasure hhs has stated its interest in using project bioshield to acquire new broad spectrum countermeasures13 however all the project bioshield contracts to date have been specifically targeted at individual threat agents strategy commonly described as one bug one drug congress may decide that hhs needs further guidance or authorities to encourage the development and acquisition of new broad spectrum countermeasures increasing basic research following the anthrax attacks congress increased the national institutes of health budget for cbrn countermeasure research to approximately 15 billion per year it is di fficult to determine th optimal funding level for basic research but eventually the law of diminishing returns will apply some scientists have suggested that this has ready occurred and inevitably leads to funding unworthy projects14 additionally some scientists argue that the increases in bioterrorism research have come at the expense of ot her important infecti ous disease research15 although others dispute this assertion16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21507crs6 17 see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological advancement debate over government policy by wendy schachtthe biomedical advanced research and development authority since the passage of the project bioshield act congress has scrutinized its implementation and effectiveness such evaluation is likely to continue through the 110th congress and beyond as part of the pandemic and allha zards preparedness act pl 109417 congress created the biodefense advanced research and development authority barda in hhs to increase the effectiveness of the governments ability to acquire cbrn countermeasures some experts suggested that project bioshield would more effectively encourage countermeasure development if modeled after the defense advanced research projects agency darpa darpa funds many project s with potential high risk of failure these contracts often last few years and can be renewed if specified milestones are met companies are allowed to make defined profit during the development phase although the direct funding of risky development pr ojects implies that the government will fund many products that never make it to market the government might also structure the contracts so that this assump tion of development risk transl ates into lower procurement costs the pandemic and llhazards preparedness act pl 109417 allows hhs to use similar contracting mechanisms through ba rda these transac tions are not funded through project bioshield appropriations but rather through separate account the biodefense medical counter measure development fund another area that some experts thoug ht required improve ment was how the government helped transition promising leads from basic research to the product development stage this period in developm ent is often referred to as the valley of death for pharmaceuticals since some seemingly promising drugs are not developed past this point due to lack of f unding several federa l programs exist to encourage research development and commercia lization of new products such programs include cooperative research and development ag reements cradas between government laboratories and unive rsities or industry the cent ral intelligence agencyfunded nonprofit venture capital corporation inqt the small business technology transfer program and the small busine ss innovation research program in contrast to project bioshields market guarantee at the end of potentially long and risky development process each of these programs offers dir ect help during the development process and provides incentives for commercialization of the results in barda congress created dedicated infrastructure to manage and fund advanced development and commercialization of cbrn countermeasures in theory barda funding will take those promising drugs from the basic research through the advanced development stage which may include clinical tria ls critics of such programs suggest that because of the high product failure rate in advanced development the g overnment will inevitably fund unusable products in addition to removing the development risks traditionally borne by industry it inserts government decision ma kers into the counter measure development process role critics argue is better ited to industry expert s and entrepreneurs17 some critics would prefer to have the government set product re quirements and have industry determine how best to meet them it will likely take several years to determine the effect barda has on us civilian biodefense preparedness
