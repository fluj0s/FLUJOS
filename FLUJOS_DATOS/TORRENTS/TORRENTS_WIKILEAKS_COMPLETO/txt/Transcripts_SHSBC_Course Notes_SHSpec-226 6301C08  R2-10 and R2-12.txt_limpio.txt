6301c08 shspec226 r210 and r212 part of the data in this lecture is also found in hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance in august i wrote jerk named kennedy this latest adornment of the russian victory parade was offered help in the space race straightening up iq etc this lighthouse has twice asked for presentations of scientology weve granted them and they have done weird things like fire the guy who asked for them time rolled along the fda started sniffing around the government organized smear campaign in the press and they raided church seized philosophic texts and emeters how did they do this they lied to the court they didnt tell the court who the warrant was for and they didnt mention books the warrant was signed by the president so ads are being placed in newspapers in the bible belt and there will be delay in the court hearing i frankly was getting worried wed been ignored too long we neednt waste time fighting the government it is its own oppterm what should happen when you find an item if you give the pc the wrong item he will have markedly more mass than he had minute before if the list is incomplete the pc will also arc break in the next few minutes and you will be unable to get him out of it except by completing the list with right item mass diminishes pc knows whether or not it is his item you are only auditing up to the pcs knowingness so if he doesnt know whether it is his item you know it isnt he has to be certain that it is right also when you package the item the pc must know that it is package if there is any queasiness about it it is out the pcs knowingness is paramount in getting the right item well done listing should produce an item that brings in vvvgis not just agreement routine 2 has little miracle to offer done this way the masses go pffft against each other the rock slams cancel out wrongly done r2 delivers more mass done right the pc has less mass it is question of havingness the wrong item has mass because 1 though it does have its own mass it is not the fundamental mass 2 you have told lie about it by saying that it is the fundamental mass more data on running routine 2 some day on routine 2 you will have the bad luck to have very suppressed pc he will suppress the item as he puts it on the list you will miss the rock slam and you will know you goofed and have to do something extraordinary the pc may arc break very thoroughly and auditing with ruds missed withholds etc wont handle it only routine 2 will fix it get him to extend the list get the item and the arc break will be gone the more unnecessary arbitraries you introduce into how something is done the more trouble you will have with it r212 began to handle rockslamming r212 can be done at several levels there are lot of results to be had even doing it wrong auditors have had more trouble with it than lrh expected there are three sources for the first list in r212 1 the pcs immediate session environment 2 the environment the pc lives in more generally 3 the various parts of existence if you already have the pcs goal you can ask who or what in pt would your goal influence to get rockslamming item you could get life and livingness sources by asking what is part of your life and livingness in pt and what is not part of it each could be complete list if one doesnt rockslam the other will often both will we have to find something that isnt rockslamming to get list when you are after part or consist of list because you only oppose rockslamming items if the pc rockslams on your life dont list in pt ww does your life consist of test the source of list to make sure that it doesnt rockslam you can even tiger drill sources to be sure if source does rockslam skip it for represent list also dont oppose some outoftheblue rockslamming item rockslamming source for list is always out of context of another incomplete list that you dont necessarily know the heading of rockslamming item is therefore not necessarily an ri it is not totally destructive to oppose such an item just dicey sometimes the lists you get when you do this wont complete or you will get lots of coterms if you found scientology rockslamming you could just oppose it as security measure but there is liability to doing this so avoid the sourceless rock slam as something to list from if scientology rockslams find something else to list from that gets at the same thing you cant do represent you have to find some way of saying scientology so you are not representing scientology eg rons work or mental activities or some such say four dynamics rockslammed therefore the source is an incomplete list you have to complete it but how you find something about scientology or the dynamics that is broad and embracive like mental activity or what isisnt part of existence then you get an item and oppose it your success is monitored by this do routine 2 right and repair it with routine 2 little routine 2 and lot of general auditing wont give much result r2 is more powerful because it is hitting at the pcs ptp and hidden standard he doesnt know what they are until you direct his attention to them you could ask what would some healing process have to do to you in order for you to know you were better the pc will consult with circuit and give you his hidden standard if you tried to list this pcs goals all you would get would be the goals of those circuits this is another reason why you cannot get the pc clear with these circuits and hidden standards in the way after routine 2 you will begin to get the pcs goals instead of circuits goals get few packages off and out of the way and the pc will give you his goal then you can run him on goals process and clear him but you have to clear up the pt environment first
