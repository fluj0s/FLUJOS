in the house recent use in historical context summary the discharge rule of the house of re presentatives affords way for members to bring to the floor measure not reported from committee it may also be used to bring to the floor special rule for consideration of measure either reported or unreported if the committee on rules declines to do so before motion to discharge may be made 218 members must sign petition for that purpose since the present form of discharge rule was adopted in 1931 563 discharge petitions have been filed of which 47 obtained the required signatures the house voted for discharge 26 times and passed 19 of the measures involved but only two became law and two others changed house rules discharge attempts however may also lead indirectly to legislative success the house considered 10 of the measures on which petitions were comple ted under other procedures and eight of these became law it also took up under other procedures 32 measures on which petitions were still pending of these all but three passed the house and 17 received final approval overall either the petition was comple ted or the measure received floor action by some means in about 16 of disc harge attempts during the past 35 years 19672002 discharge petitions on 12 measures obtained the required signatures the house voted for discharge six times and considered the other six measures under other procedures six of the 12 measures were rejected all of them proposed constitutional amendm ents which require two thirds majority for passage the house dopted one amendment to the discharge rule itself one proposed constitutional amendment which failed in th senate and four measures that became law during this period it also used other procedures such as special rule reported by the committee on rules to consider 10 additional measures on which discharge was attempted of which six became law increasingly often in recent year s the committee on rules has responded to discharge efforts by reporting its own sp ecial rules for considering the measures involved it often does so even when th petition is not completed especially for petitions filed on special rules rather th an on the measures themselves since 1967 measures on which this form of petition was filed have had over twice as much chance of reaching the floor especially unde r alternative procedures as when the petition was filed on the measure itself perhaps as result this form of discharge has become more popular amounting to almo st 70 of petitions filed during the past decade 19932002 only since the 103rd congress has the number of members signing each discharge petition been public information during that period four petitions were signed by more members than the number belonging to the minority party thirtysix were signed by fewer than this number of members but more than 90 thirteen were signed by 3060 members eight by 730 and nine by three or fewer httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856contents

to the floor for consideration measure that has not been reported from committee to initiate action under this rule member files di scharge petition either 1 on the measure or 2 on special rule providing that the measure be extracted from committee and considered if majority of the membership then signs the petition it enables the house to entertain on specified days motion that the pertinent committee be discharged from considering the measure or the special rule if the house adopts this motion it then may entertain motion to consider the measure or it takes up the special rule for considering the measure finally if the house adopts the motion to consider or the special rule the meas ure comes to the floor for consideration2 the house first adopted the discharge ru in essentially this form in 1931 from then through 2002 discharge petitions were filed on 563 measures most of these never led to any floor action duri ng these years the house adopted only 26 discharge motions3 however an additional 42 of the measures involved or alternatives on the same subject reached the floor through other procedures available under house rules such as pursuant to special rule reported from the committee on rules often these alternative floor proceedings may have occurred because the leadership or the pertinent committees we re acting in response to the discharge attempts

presented here addr ess only the period since 19314 elements introduced into the rule in 1931 include the establishment of three different forms in which discharge may be attempted and the present requirements for offering discharge motion on the fl oor the 1931 revisions also established mechanisms to 1 ensure the ability of the house to consider measure once petition receives the required 218 signatures nd 2 prevent dilatory use of the rule although the discharge rule has remained unchanged in its basic structure since 1931 the house has altered its specific f eatures on four occasions in 1935 it increased the number of signatures re quired on the petition from 145 onethird of the house to 218 onehalf of the house further changes occurred until the 1990s when the house eliminated provision that had the effect of preventing debate on or amendment of special rule reaching the floor through discharge 1991 provided that the names of members signing discharge petitions be publicly available 1993 and made the procedure inapplicable to any special rule that would have the effect of permitting nongerm ane amendments or that would provide for the consideration of more than one measure 1997 data presented the data presented herein on use of the discharge procedure are of three kinds 1 overall figures on use of the disc harge procedure in each congress 1931 2002 72nd107th

archived crs report 9084 pp 93108 reprinted in subcommittee on rules of the house discharge petition disclosure pp 274 289 the overall figures cover the entire peri od since the house adopted its current discharge rule these data include the number of discharge petitions filed broken down according to which of the three met hods available under the rule was used the overall figures also indicate the success of these discharge efforts how many of the petitions obtained the full 218 signatur required how many of the measures received floor consideration nd how many of them passed5 these data on success cover action both under the discharge proce dure itself and under other procedures this coverage permits comp rehensive assessment of the likelihood that measure on which members attempt di scharge will receive favor able legislative action data on the number of members sign ing each discharge petition cover the period only from the 103rd congress forward 19932002 for earlier years before the rule was changed to require disclosing the names of members signing these data are not available the summaries of action on individual m easures begin with 1967 so that they cover roughly the period during which the committee on rules has consistently operated as an organ of the leadersh ip in managing the floor agenda6 as with the overall data by congress these summari include every measure on which discharge petition was filed if any action beyond the committee stage of the process occurred either pursuant to the discharge ru or under other pro cedures this broad coverage offers concrete in formation on the variety of courses of action that have occurred on measures subjected to discharge efforts use of the discharge procedure frequency of discharge attempts table 1 shows the frequency with which house members have initiated discharge attempts and how the frequency has fluctuated after the present form of the rule was established in 1931 its use remained relatively common throughout the new deal and world war ii periods prior to 1950 ie from the 72nd through 82nd congresses more than 20 petitions were typically filed in each congress andsometimes more than 30 thereafter how ever numbers declined swiftly more than seven petitions being filed in any congress from the 84 th through 90th 1955 1968 this period of fewer discharge petitions began towa rd the end of the epoch in which the committee on rules did not always act as an arm of the leadership but continued into the early part of the subsequent era in which the committee has operated as leadership organhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs4 7 the committee on rules could render petition to discharge special rule ineffective by reporting the rule but in that case any member of the committee on rules may call up the continuedsince about 1970 the number of disc harge petitions has stabilized at intermediate levels in 11 of the 17 congresses included in this period 91st107th congresses 10 to 15 petitions were filed this level was exceeded only in the 97th and 103rd congresses 19811982 and 19931994 and was not ttained only in the 100th through 102nd 19871992 and 105th 19971998 congresses this period of stability has continued through the heavy democratic majoritie s of the 1970s the increasingly assertive republican minori ties that began in the 1980s and the republican majorities that began in the mid1990s the high use in the 97th congress appears associated with attempts by the minority to develop new means of agenda access the steep declines in the 100th through 102nd congresses may reflect developing sense that discharge offered promising avenue of agenda access becau successful discharge effort requires support from majority of the house members may have f ound the procedure ill adapted to measures favored chiefly in the minority party the high levels of the 103rd congress suggest that the rule change making petition signatures public rekindled hopes of using the procedure as floor access tool the subsequent return to and temporary decline below more usual levels may reflect not only the continued scarcity of successf ul results but also the 1995 change in party control of the house 104th congress use of the three for ms of discharge one of the most significant innovations of the 1931 rule was the establishment of three alternate forms for initiating discharge ac tion since 1931 it has been possible to file discharge petition either directly on an unreported measure on special rule providing that an unreported measure be extracted from committee and considered or on special rule for considering measure already reported from committee but never called up for fl oor consideration or still on the calendar the first two methods of discharg both provide means for securing consideration of measure on which the committee of referral seems unlikely to act the second method has two advantages firs t it permits proponents to draft special rule that sets terms they consider appropriate for considering and amending the measure second if discharge petition is filed directly on measure in committee the committee can render the petition moot by reporting the measure if the petition is filed on special rule for considering the measure however then even if the committee reports the measure it remains in order to discharge the committee on rules from the special rule7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs5 7 continued special rule after seven legislative days and with one days notice house rule xiii clause 6d in house manual sec 861 8 beth control of the floor agenda pp 1314 2023the rule was drafted with the idea th at the second method would become its normal use8 as table 1 shows however in most congresses since 1931 most members attempting to use the discharge pr ocedure to bring an unreported measure to the floor appear to have been either unaware of this thod of discharge or unattracted by its potential advantages in earlier times the number of discharge petitions on special rules for unreported measures did not even approach those directly on unreported measures except in 19371940 75th76th congresses and 19591968 86th90th congresses discharge of special rules for unreported measures reemerged as common form however in the 98th congress 19851986 and has continued to be so from the 104th congress 19941995 onward in fact this form of discharge attempt s usually been the most common one the third method of discharge by st offers the possibility of bringing to the floor measure that the committee has reported but which the leadership and committee on rules do not schedule for floor action discharge attempts of this kind on special rules for the consideration of reported measures were most common during the period of conservative coalition control of the committee on rules roughly 19371960 during this pe riod the committee on rules recurrently declined to respond to committee and leadersh ip requests to report special rules for considering measures reported by co mmittees supporters of such measures sometimes sought to overcome this obstacle by attempting to discharge the committee on rules from special rule for considering the reported measure the data in table 1 suggest that because this situation made members focus on the possibility of discharge on special rules for reported measures it may have led them to overlook that the discharge procedur could also be used on special rules for unreported measures this form of discha rge attempt has become uncommon in recent years but it was used in the 107th congress after the house rejected proposed special rule for considering campaign finance reform bill and the leadership declined to make anothe r attempt to call it up httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs6 table 1 discharge petitions filed 19312002 congress and yearsdischarge petitions filed on unreported measures other than special ruleson special rules for

petition the number of withdrawals is noted in footnote the figures in the table do not include these members as signers examination of table 2 shows that the levels of support discharge petitions obtain fall into groupings fairly clearly parated in size although assurance can be given that future cong resses may display similar groupi ngs the consistency with which these have continued to appear may suggest the presence of general pattern first grouping includes only four petitions all but one in the 103rd congress that gained more signatures than the streng th of the minority party three of these attained the full 218 signatures the fourth fell short of this level after an active countercampaign by the leadership12 petitions that reach this level of support evidently must draw at least some suppor t from the majority party and therefore presumably will appear on legi slation supported either by bipartisan coalition or by the rank and file of the majority party in opposition to its own leadership second grouping of 36 petitions was signed by fewer members than the strength of the minority party but more than half this number usually by more than 100 in some congresses petitions with this level of support have been the predominant form in the 106th and 107th congresses 19992002 especially almost all petitions have falle n into this grouping house records do not identify the party of signers but this leve l of support may often indicat discharge effort favoredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs9 principally by the minority sometimes by an essentially united party and at least by majority thereof during the five congresses covered onl two petitions received between 60 and 95 signatures thirteen by contrast received between 30 and 60 signatures whether or not the signers drew princi pally from single party in the house petitions in this third grouping cannot be ssociated with party in the same sense as can those in the previous one inas much as their level of support could not constitute majority of either party this level of s upport nevertheless represents potentially significant segment of the house so that it may often be appropriate to view these petitions as representing factional discharge efforts fourth grouping includes the nine petiti ons that obtained three signatures or fewer these appear to be understandabl essentially as indi vidualistic discharge efforts the remaining eight petitions obtained between seven and 30 signatures arrayed more loosely between the third and fourth groups some of these might also be considered

attempts the success of discharge effort can be assessed in various ways the simplest measure is whether the petition attains the 218 signatures requisite to permit supporters to offer the discharge motion known as entering the motion on the discharge calendar in more basic sense however the ultimate goal of discharge petition is presumably not the offering of discharge motion in itself but securing floor consideration for the measure in question in more extended sense the objective is presumably to see the m easure not only considered but also passed by the house and ultimately enacted into law the data in tables 3 through 5 permit assessing the succe ss of discharge efforts in all three senses in particular the obj ective of securing floor consideration can be accomplished either 1 if the discharge mo tion once offered is agreed to by the house or 2 if the prospect of discha rge impels the house to take up the measure under some other procedures table 3 shows the extent to which discharge efforts have been successful at bringing about action through the discharge process itself table 4 addresses the success of discharge effo rts at bringing about action through other procedures table 5 aggregates both classes of data action under discharge procedure bringing the measure to the floor as table 3 shows only rarely since 1947 has more than one pe tition in the same congress r eceived the full 218 signatures needed for entry on the discharge calendar on average throughout the entire period fewer than 10 of petitions have been entered the petition entered on the campaign finance reform bill in the 107th congress 20012002 was the first since the republicans obtained the majority in the house in the 104th congress 19941995 between 1939 and 1972 however when discharge petition was entered the motion was almost always offered on the floor and almost always approved if supporters of measure could secure 218 sign atures they could be confident that the discharge procedure would enable them to secure floor consideration for their measure before and after that period on the other hand entry of petition did not guarantee that discharge motion would ev er actually be offered on the floor much less adopted instead the committees of referral the leadership and the committee on rules commonly used variety of devices to preempt further proceedings under the discharge rule from the 1980s onward th have often involved bringing up the measure or an alternative proposal unde r terms of an alternative special rule reported from the committee on rules when this course of action occurs proponents of the discharge effort succeed in bringing about consideration of legislation on the subject but not necessarily of their preferred measure and not on their own terms events of this kind ar considered further in the next section table 3 proceedings under the house discharge rule 19312002httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs15 congress and yearsdischarge

resolution changing house rules i includes one petition entered with respect to special rule on measure and another entered on the same measure directly j includes one petition filed on special rule for considering two measuresk includes one measure in the 102 nd congress and two measures in the 103rd from which the committee was discharged and which were brought to the floor after the discharge petition was entered by unanimous consent passage even when measure does come to the floor pursuant to the discharge procedure the house has not alwa ys chosen to pass it this finding might be thought surprising for measure can reach the floor through discharge only if majority of members 1 sign the petition 2 vote for the discharge motion and also 3 vote for the special rule or considerati on of the measure measure that can pass these tests would seem to have manife st capacity to command majority support in the house especially between 1969 and 1994 91st104th congresses however many of the measures reaching the floor through discharge were proposed constitutional amendments such propos als may possess the majority support required for discharge yet lack the two thirds support required for their adoption recent examples noted below in table 8 begin with the equal rights amendment in the 91st congress and continue through the balanced budget amendment on several occasions in the 97th through 103rd congresses enactment finally only two measures have become law after being considered pursuant to discharge federal pay act in the 86th congress and the wages and hours act in the 75th the first minimum wage law measures facing sufficient opposition to block their cons ideration in the house under regular procedures often suffer strong opposition at ot her stages of the legislative process as well the house also adopted two change s in rules after cons ideration pursuant to discharge these actions occurred in the 78th and 103rd congresses the latter action being the amendment that made di scharge petition signatures public action under other procedures after petition has been entered in practice when discharge petition obt ains its 218 signatures and is entered on the discharge calendar the result almost guarantees that supporters will have an opportunity to bring the measure to the floor sometimes however the action that occurs at this point is not pursuant to the discharge rule itself but under other procedures action of this kind presumably represents an attempt by the committee of jurisdiction the leadership or the co mmittee on rules to recover control of the floor by taking action to preempt the opportun ity that the discharge rule affords the lefthand portion of table 4 shows how frequently measures received floor action under other procedures after discharg petition received 218 signatures and was entered on the discharge calendar from 1951 through 1978 such action never occurred previously and thereafter it occurred seldom the most recent example on campaign finance reform in the 107th congress was the first in over decade yet every measure that has reachedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs18 the floor under other procedures after discharge petition was entered has been passed by the house and gone on to fina l approval except proposed constitutional amendments the balanced budget amendment in the 97th and 101st congresses this record of success is substantially more favorable than that for measures considered pursuant to the discharge procedure itself before 1951 when alternative floor acti on occurred after petition was entered it was typically because the committee of referral reported the measure and had it called up under usual procedures since 1979 by contrast the committee usually did not report the measure instead the alte rnative action usually involved house floor consideration of an alternative special rule or alternative measure on the same subject alternative actions of this sort are included in table 4 when identifiable on some recent occasions however suppor ters of discharge have not permitted these attempted alternative actions to forestall further proceedings by discharge for example the last two times petition was entered on balanced budget amendment 102nd and 103rd congresses see table 8 supporters arranged for the committee to be discharged and for the measure to be considered by unanimous consent action under other procedures while petition was pending the righthand side of table 4 shows that alternative action has occurred more frequently on measures for which discharge petitions had not achieved the requisite 218 signatures approximate ly half the measures considered under such circumstances proceeded to final approva l proportion intermediate between that for measures considered pursuant to disc harge and for measures considered under alternative procedures after petition was entered again action on alternative measures on the same subject or pursuant to alternative special rules is included in table 4 where it could be identified action on measures with petitions pending was especially common before the mid1960s then disappeared entirely until th 1980s the alternative action in these cases may represent attempts by the committee of referral or the leadership to preempt discharge effort that either perceives as likely to succeed for petitions that attract few signers however the force of discharge as threat is presumably minimal so that the alternative action may have occurred simply in the normal course of committee and leadership activity some of these discharge efforts may have occurred in part because supporters of the measures underestimated the likelihood of success through normal procedures for congresses prior to the 103rd of course there is usually way of knowing defi nitely whether petition obtained few or many signatures table 4 measures on which discharge petitions were filed but that received action under

on which discharge was sought were repor ted but not taken up for consideration table 8 lists all 33 of these measures thereby including all cases during the period covered for which either 1 use of the disc harge rule could have helped to promote further action or 2 the leadership or committee on rules rather than the committee of jurisdiction might have formed the chief obstacle to consideration forms of discharge and conditions of floor action although house action on these 33 measures took wide variety of forms some patterns are discernible firs t each of the three methods of discharge provided by the rule was represented in similar numbers relative to how often each method was attempted however the frequency with which further action occurred varied markedly nine measures were reported after petitions were filed on the measures themselves eight of these received floor consideration 6 of the 138 unreported measures on which petitions were filed thirteen measures were reported after petitions were filed on special rules for their consideration nine of these received floor consideration 13 of the 72 unreported measures for which petitions on special rules were filed13 eleven measures had already been reported before petitions were filed on special rules for their consideration only four of these received floor consideration but these made up 36 of the 11 reported measures for which petitions on special rules were filed14httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs27 the 33 measures also were distribut ed roughly equally among the various courses of events through which they might or might not reach the floor petitions on 12 of the measures were entered on the discharge calendar just six of these measures however reached the floor through the discharge procedure its elf the other six were called up through other procedures ten other measures reached the floor by procedures other than discharge even though the petitions remained pending in the remaining 11 cases the discharge petitions remained pending and the measures were reported but never actually considered as table 6 shows however the different cour ses of subsequent action were not evenly distributed among the three forms of discharge attempt overall measures on which discharge was sought reached the fl oor more often under other procedures than under the discharge rule itself this pa ttern however did not appear among petitions that were filed directly on measures but only among thos filed on special rules for considering measures and especially on ru for measures already reported among measures that were subjected to discharge attempts and reached the floor the proportions that did so under procedur other than discharge itself were 50 when the petitions were filed directly on unreported measures 80 when they were filed on speci rules for unreported measures and 100 when they were was file d on special rules for reported measures among the same measures the proportions that r eached the floor even though the discharge petitions remained pending were 25 when the petitions were filed directly on unreported measures 50 when they were filed on speci rules for unreported measures and 75 when they were filed on speci rules for reported measures these figures indicate that measures became increasingly likely to reach the floor under alternative procedur rather than pursuant to the discharge rule itself the more directly the form of the discharge effort represented challenge to the normal control of the floor agenda by the leadership and the committee on rules in other words the relationships shown in table 6 suggest that the committee on rules has tended to respond vigo rously to potential direct infringements of its special role in regulating the floor agenda but s not always found it necessary to forestallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs28 15 on this point i am indebted to discu ssions with my colleague elizabeth rybickipotential infringements

remaining four however were reported after the discharge petitions were filed and in these cases the reports may have been intended to counter the discharge attempt on of these petitions was filed directly on the measure so that reporting the measure rendered the discharge attempt moot two others were filed on special rules for considering measures so that reporting the measures did not

discharge motion being ffered on the floor the following two columns note key events in floor action on the measure under the discharge rule itself or under other procedures respectively these events include actions taken on related special rules and alternative measures the last column notes the final status of the measure throughout the table pr ovides the numbers of any related measures and the dates of key actions the followi ng paragraphs detail the significance and use of each of these items form of discharge action table 8 indicates whether discharge petition was filed 1 directly on an unreported measure 2 on sp ecial rule for considering an unreported measure or 3 on special rule for considering reported measure it also gives the date the petition was f iled and where applicable the resolution number of the special rule17 number of signatures table 8 notes which petitions obtained the full 218 signatures required before motion to di scharge may be offered on the house floor also from the 103rd congress forward it notes the num ber of signatures obtained by each other pe tition before the house amended the rule in that congress to make signatures to pending discharge petitions publicly available they were treated as confidential except when the full 218 were obtained action on discharge motion once the 218 signatures are obtained motion to discharge is entered on special discharge calendar beginning seven legislative days thereafter the motion may be offered on the second or fourth monday of each month except during th last six days of session table 8 notes whether and when this motion was offered on several occasions during the period examined after discharge motion was entered the house instead accepted unanimous consent request that the committee be discharged and the measure be considered at specific time table 8 treats the acceptance of such request as equivalent to the adoption of discha rge motion when petition does not obtain 218 signatures of course discharge mo tion can be offered on the floor and discharge vote can occur httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs31 floor action table 8 reports action pursuant to the discharge rule itself in one column and that pursuant to other pro cedures in separate column in either case the pertinent column notes whet her the measure was 1 reported from committee after the petition was filed 2 taken up on the floor and 3 passed or rejected if the measure was considered under the terms of special rule the table also records floor action on the rule for measures not considered in committee of the whole the table identifies the pro cedure under which consideration took place sometimes although floor ac tion does not take place on the measure that is the subject of the discharge procedure it doe s occur on some other measure on the same subject this action may occur because the committee of referral reports the other measure the leadership schedules it for floor consideration or the committee on rules reports special rule for considering it if discharge is sought on special rule another possibility is that the committee on rules may report different special rule providing for consideration of the same measure or an alternative measure actions of these kinds may represent attempts to forestall or preempt consideration of the measure on which the petition was filed or at least to forestall its consideration under the terms of the original special rule table 8 identifies cases in which such actions occurred noting the numbers of the alternative measures and special rules occasionally discharge petition is file d on special rule for considering measure after it has already received some floor consideration the campaign finance legislation of the 107th congress is an example as already mentioned in the column on alternative floor action tabl 8 notes any floor consideration that occurred on measure before discharge petition was filed but distinguishes this action with an asterisk similarly when measure was reported from committee after petition was filed although the measure then received actual floor consideration table 8 also notes this event in the column for alternative floor action but in italics final status discharge attempt may succeed in bringing the measure in question or an alternative to the floor under either the discharge procedure itself or some other procedure yet the measure considered may still fail to achieve enactment the house may consider the measure and reject it or the measure may fail at later stage of the legislative process table 8 notes whether each measure listed became law or for concurrent or simple resolu tions and for joint resolutions proposing constitutional amendments otherwise attained final congressional approval for measures that did not reach final approval the table notes the last point in the legislative process the measure reached this information indicates whether measure failed or succeeded through the discharge effort itself or because of conditions occurring at other some point in the process timing of action table 8 does not supply date for every legislative action it lists it does however identify dates on which measures were referred or where pertinent reported discharge petitions were filed the required number of sign atures was obtained and key floor actions took place httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856crs32 the rule requires petition to be filed at least 30 legislative days after the date of referral the interval between referral and filing may suggest how urgent the measures supporters felt the matter to be or how much confidence they had in the committee of referral similarly the interv from filing to obtaining 218 signatures as well as the number of signatures obtai ned may indicate the breadth and intensity of support for measure finally the interval between the filing or entering of the discharge petition and floor action on the measure may suggest whether the committee of jurisdiction the house leadership or the committee on rules was attempting to supersede or forestall action pursuant to the discharge procedure this information accordingly helps to suggest the effectiveness of the discharge procedure in eliciting responsive action by these organs such an effect might be inferred for example if after discharge petition is entered but before the discharge motion can be offered on the floor the committee reports the measure or the committee on rules reports special rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97856 crs33 table 8 measures on which
