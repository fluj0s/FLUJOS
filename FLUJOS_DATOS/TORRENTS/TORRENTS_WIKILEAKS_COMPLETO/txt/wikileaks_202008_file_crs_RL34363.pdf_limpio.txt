elections and the implement ation of the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107252 two surveys of leos we re performed in 2004 and 2006 by texas am university the surveys were sponsor ed and coordinated by crs although care needs to be taken in interpreting the results they may have implications for several policy issues such as how election officials are chosen and trained the best ways to ensure that voting systems and election procedures are sufficiently effective secure and voterfriendly and whethe r adjustments should be made to hava requirements major resu lts include the following the demographic characteristics of leos differ from those of other government officials almost threequarters are women and 5 are minorities most do not have college degree and most were elected some results suggest areas of potential improvement such as in training and par ticipation in professi onal associations leos believed that the fede ral government has too great an influence on the acquisition of voting systems and that local elected officials have too little their concerns increased from 2004 to 2006 about the influence of the media political parties advocacy groups and vendors leos were highly satisfied with whatever voting system they used but were less supportive of other kinds however th eir satisfaction declined from 2004 to 2006 for all systems except lever machines they also rated their primary voting systems as very accurate secure reliable and voter and pollworkerfriendly matter what system they used however the most common incident repor ted by respondents in the 2006 election was malfunction of direct recording dre or optical scan electronic voting system th incidence of long lines at polling places was highest in jurisdictions using dres most dre users did not believe that voterverified paper audit trails vvpat should be required but nonuser s believed they should be however the percentage of dre user s who supported vvpat increased in 2006 and most vvpat users were satisfied with them on average leos mildly supported requi ring photo identification for all voters even though they strongly believed that it will negatively affect turnout and did not believe that voter fraud is pr oblem in their jurisdictions leos believed that hava is making m oderate improvements in the electoral process but the level of support dec lined from 2004 to 2006 they reported that hava has increased the accessibility of voting but has made elections more complicated and has increased their cost leos spent much more time preparing for the election in 2006 than in 2004 they also believed that the increased complexity of elections is hindering recruitment of pollworkers most f ound the activities of the election assistance commission eac that hava created only moderately beneficial to them they were neut ral on average about the impacts of the requirement for statewide voterregistrati on database httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363contents

fischer and kevin j colemanelection reform and local election officials results of two national surveys us elections are highly decentralize d with much of the responsibility for election administration residing with local election officials leos there are thousands of such officials many of whom are responsible for all aspects of election administration in their local jurisdictions including voter registration recruiting pollworkers running each election nd choosing and purchasing new voting systems these officials are therefore critical not only to the successful administration of federal elections but also to the implementation of the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107252 neverthele ss there has been little objective information on the perceptions and attit udes of leos about election reform this report discusses the results of two scientific opinion rveys of principal local election officials1 that were designed to help fill that gap in knowledge the surveys were performed pursuant to two projects sponsored by the congressional research service crs the projects were developed in collabor ation with and the surveys performed by faculty and students at the george bush school of government and public service at texas am univers ity the bush school team developed and administered the surveys in consultation with crs to sample of leos from all 50 states the responses to each survey from approximately 1400 leos were analyzed by crs for purposes of this repor t methodological tails are described in the appendix the surveys were administered followi ng the 2004 and 2006 federal elections while they were not identical many of the questions were the same and comparisons of the results are disc ussed where appropriate2 the findings may be useful to congress as it considers funding for hava oversight of its implementation and possible revisions the report begins with description of some characteristics of local election officials and their jurisdictions that is followed by discussion of perceptions and attitudes of leos about the different ki nds of voting systems used in different jurisdictions lever machines punchcar d ballots

with the number of registered voters 5 oregon is votebymail state and does not generally use polling placesrecording electronic dre systems such as touchscreens the report then describes how hava has affected local jurisdictions and the opinions leos expressed about the law the section after that discusses three other topics covered in the 2006 survey issues related to the 2006 election characteristics of pollworkers and attitudes bout nonpartisan election ad ministration the final sections discuss caveats to consider in interpreting the results and potential policy implications of the findings who are local election officials there are about 9000 local election ju risdictions in the united states3 in most states they are counties or major cities but in some new england and upper midwest states they are small townships for example more than 1800 townships in wisconsin the number of registered voters and polling places in jurisdiction also varies greatly the average repor ted was 40000 voters ranging from fewer than 100 to more than 1 million and 32 polling places4 ranging from 0 to almost 10005 with 16 of jurisdictions having only one and 14 more than 50 the number of election personnel working in jurisdiction in addition to the local election official also varied greatly from none to more than 10000 given such diversity and other differen ces among states such as wealth population and the role of state ection officials responsibilities and characteristics of leos are likely to vary greatly nevertheless some patterns emerged from the survey the demographic characteristics of leos differ from those of other government officials according to the survey results the typical leo is white woman between 50 and 60 years old who is high school graduate she was elected to her current office works fulltime in election administration has been in the profession for about 10 years and earns under 50000 per year she belongs to statelevel professiona l organization but not national one and she believes that her training as an elec tion official has been good to excellent as with any such description the one above does not capture the diversity within the community surveyed about onequarter of leos are men about 5 belong to minority groups 40 are college graduates and 8 ve graduate degrees see table 1 they range from 21 to more than 80 years of age and have served from 1 to 45 years about onethird were appointed rather than elected to theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs3 6 this result is similar to the figure of 37 reported from an independent study in david c kimball and martha kropf the streetlevel bureaucrats of elec tions selection methods for local election officials p 12571268 7 women make up about 60 of that work force see us census bureau 2000 supplementary survey summary table p068 available at httpfactfindercensusgov 8 about 53 of the managers are men us census bureau census 2000 eeo data tool available at httpwwwcensusgoveeo2000indexhtml 9 ibid 10 ibidposts6 reported salaries range from under 10000 to more than 120000 about threequarters belong to at l east one professional organization the demographic profile of leos is unusual especially for professional group they differ from those of other cal government empl oyees for example according to us census figures while women comprise higher proportion of the local government workforce than men overall7 men comprise higher proportion of local government general and administrative managers8 about 20 of those managers are members of minorities9 the patterns do not appear to be result of the fact that most leos are elected as the demographic characteristics of legislators appear to be largely similar to those for local government managers10 table 1 comparison of selected demographic characteristics of leos from the 2004 and 2006 surveys percentages of leos who 2004 2006 were elected 65 58 worked fulltime 66 76 had served for more than 10 years

studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university note bold type denotes statistically significant differences between the two surveys the average tenure in the current positi on declined by about one year from 2004 to 2006 with the proportion of leos who had served for two years or less in their current positions rising to 15 in 2006 from 11 in 2004 see figure 1 thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs4 11 the cause of this change is not clear ho wever the pattern is consistent with the contention by some observers that the change s in election administ ration brought about by hava could increase turnover there appeared to be small increase in job turnover between the two elections11 however there was significant change in average age figure 2 source

was in the same section of the survey such comparison was necessary because leos were asked only to indicate the organizations to which th ey belong not whether they belong to any organization that question was chosen for the comparison because only 13 leos in the continuedjurisdictions that reform led to incr eased funding for election administration changes in voting systems used by many jurisdictions and an increased workload for election officials for exam ple the survey found that those who reported that they worked fulltime on election administrati on increased from 66 in 2004 to 76 in 2006 while those who reported that they sp ent more than twenty hours per week on election duties increased from 41 to 47 the increasing complexity of elections and the increased federal role after the passage of hava have focuse d more attention on the ro of prof essionalism in election administration given that chan ge it might be expected that election officials who began serving more recently would have more formal education than those who have served for longer periods such pattern could yield statistical association between the highest education level attained and the number of years in service as an election official in fact there was small but significant relationship with leos who did not have college gree averaging 1112 years of service and those with graduate degrees averaging 9 years however there was significant change in the distribution of maximu m education level be tween the 2004 and 2006 surveys figure 3 source analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university fewer than half of leos belonge d to national or international association the survey also examined other factors related to election administration as

answered the question on membership but not the question on gender fewer than for any other question in that section using the other questions in the section on age race education political ideology and salary yields estimates of 2127 for 2006 and 2429 for 2004 using the total number of respondents yields 36 for 2006 and 33 for 2004 but those are almost certainly overestimates 13 the number for state association membership in figure 4 is higher because it includes leos who belong to more than one organization such as state association plus nacrcinternational associa tion with 60 belonging

leos were less satisfied with their training in 2006 than in 2004 this result shown in figure 5 might reflect the impact of hava requirements most of which went into effect in 2006 for example election officials might have felt less well prepared by their traini ng to implement hava in 2006 than in 2004 but the survey did not address that possibility other possible factors includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs8 increasing public attention to problems in election administration and recent controversies about the relia bility and security of voting systems twofifths of

hava also requires that every polling place have at least one fully accessible voting system such as properly equipped dre as result many jurisdictions using other kinds of voting systems also had one dre per polling placethese changes are consistent with results from other sources14 the trends conform with expectations arising from hava re quirements that emphasized improved usability and accessibility of voting systems for voters15 jurisdictions appeared reluctant to change the kinds of voting systems they use the average length of time jurisdictions have been using particular kind of

processthe pattern of use shown in figure 8 suggests that jurisdictions do not readily change the kinds of voting systems they use on the one hand such reluctance to change creates stability that may be beneficial to voters and administrators on the other hand it may mean that particular kind of technolog is used far longer than it should be with increasing risks of nega tive consequences for example many of the problems associated with the 2000 pres idential election were attributed to the continued use of outmoded or flawed tec hnology such as the punchcard systems in use at the time the causes of such longterm use patterns are complex and may include factors such as legal and budgetary constraints nd various forms of transaction costs that would be incurred with any change such f actors if they conti nue to be important may impede jurisdictions from taking adva ntage of the kinds of improvements that are likely to occur in voting t echnology over the next decade influence of stakeholders on the acquisition of voting systems most leos play role in decisions on what voting systems to use in their jurisdictions see table 2 above many other stakehol ders may also influence those decisions to help provide an understanding of how leos assess the appropriateness of the roles other stakeholders play the rvey asked respondents to what extent they agreed or disagreed with st atements about the influence of those stakeholders on the decisionmaking process two examples are the federal government has too great an influence and local vel elected officials should have greater influence leos believed that the federal government has too great an influence on the acquisition of voting systems and local elected officials have too little the results are presented in figure 9 on average in fact leos felt more strongly about the role of local elected offi cials than any other stakeholder leos were largely neutral bout the level of influence of state election officials and the public and did not believe that nonelected offi cials professional associations and independent experts should have greater influence than they do now leos have become more concer ned about the influence of the media political parties advocacy groups and vendors s m f t h differences between the 2004 and 2006 resu lts are notable in 2004 leos were largely neutral about the influence of the media political parties and various advocacy groups16 in 2006 they thought those groups had too much influence they also agreed more strongly than in 2004 that elected local officials should have more influence also in 2006 more leos believed that vendor s have too great an influence than in 2004 and fe wer believed that the public and independent experts should have greater influence their views did not change on the roles of the federal government elected state fficials professional associ ations and nonelected state and local officials httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs12 17 many respondents commented that they s hould not have been required by the federal government to change voting systems or to add accessible ones 18 several questions in the 2004 survey were omitted in 2006 to make room for additional questions about election administration and th impacts of hava nevertheless the 2006 continuedsource analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university overall the observed patte rns of response are not surprising leos generally either report to elected local officials or are elected themselves the concerns of local officials about the in fluence of the federal gove rnment are wellknown in many areas not just election administration and many may have resented the hava requirements that led to changes in longused voting systems17 also it is not surprising that leos have become more concerned about the ro of stakeholders such as the media advocates and political partisans who are closely associated with the recent controversies about the reliability and security of voting systems there has also been debate and uncerta inty specifically about the role and influence of voting system manufacturers and vendors in the selection of voting systems by local jurisdictions some obs ervers have argued that vendors have undue influence in what voting systems jurisdic tions choose others believe that such concerns are unwarranted but little has been known previously of how leos view vendors and their relationships with them the results of the 2004 survey were mixed with respect to the importance of vendors these questions were not included in the 2006 survey18 leos in 2004federal government media advocates political parties vendors elected local officials elected state officials the public professional associations

more than twice as many questions as the 2004 instrument 19 not surprisingly the lowest interaction 13 of leos was in paperballot jurisdictions and the highest was in optical scan and dre jurisdictions about 85 20 however in the 2006 survey about one in ei ght reported that vendors did not provide the expected level of support on election day discussed later in this report 21 this question explored the views of leos about the concern that some observers have raised that the range of services vendors provide in some jurisdictions may amount to kind of privatization of election administration 22 for this question leos were also asked to rate their own influence which received the highest average score the question also as ked about the influence of some other actors such as courts and voters and it listed elec ted and nonelected state and local officials but not election officials specifically except the respondents themselves and the eac appeared to have high trust and confidence in vendors but did not rate them as being especially influential with respect to d ecisions about voting systems fewer than 10 believed that there was insufficien t oversight of vendors by the federal government and states but about one in six believed that local governments did not exercise enough oversight most jurisdictions using computerassisted voting reported in 2004 that they had interacted with their votingsystem vendors within the last four years19 more than 90 of leos considered their voting sy stem vendors responsive and the quality of their goods and services to be high20 they felt equally strongly that the recommendations of those ve ndors could be trusted ho wever about fifth of respondents thought that vendor s were willing to sacrifice security for greater profit although 60 disagreed also quarter fe lt that vendors provide too many elements of election administration21 when leos were asked in 2004 what sour ces of information they relied on with respect to voting systems state election officials received the highest average rating with about threequarters of leos indicating that they re ly on state officials great deal next most important were other ection officials followed by the eac and advocates for the disabled about onethi rd of leos stated that they relied on vendors great deal level similar to that for professional associations only 2 of leos rated vendors higher than any other source whereas 20 rated state officials highest interest groups were rated lower than vendors and political parties and media received the lowest ratings when leos were asked in 2004 about th amount of influen ce different actors had on decisions about voting systems th overall pattern of response was similar to that for information sources once again state local and federal officials were judged the most influential22 and political parties and the media the least with vendors in between an exception was that local nonelect ed officials were considered less influential on average than vendors both voters and advocates for the disabled were rated as more influential on average th an vendors leos rated vendors as more influential than any other source httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs14 23 for this question leos were asked to rank how they felt about the use of different types of voting systems for elections in the united states on scale of 1 strongly oppose to 7 strongly support the types of voting systems listed were lever machines punchcard systems handcounted paper ballots centralc ount optical scan precinctcount optical scan dre internet and other only 10 of leos supported internet voting and since this type of system has not been used in public electi ons in the united states except experimentally on occasion it is not discussed further in this re port the category other is not discussed because the response rate was very low 5 those results contrast with the views of leos described above about whether the levels of influence of stakeholders are too little or too great figure 9 of the three actors considered most influential leos believed that local elected officials should have more influence and the federa l government has too much and they were neutral about state officials they did not believe on av erage that those considered least influential should have more congre ss may find it useful to take these attitudes into account in conducting oversight of hava implementation nd in considering additional electionreform legislation attitudes toward voting systems leos were highly satisfied with whatever voting system they were using but were less supportive of other kinds of systems leos had strong opinions about the different kinds of voting systems used in the united states those whose jurisdiction used particular kind of system whatever it was supported its use more strongly than any other system see figure 10 23 thus users of lever machines strongly pported th eir use showed some support for the use of dres were neutral about optical scan systems and were opposed to the use of punchcard and handcounted paper ballot systems in general except for those using them leos opposed the use of lever machines punchcard systems and paper ballots those views changed little across the two surveys however there was slight but significant decrease in the level of s upport for dres among users of optical scan and dre systems dres were the only voting system for which support of users dropped be tween 2004 and 2006 although it still remained very high it was not possible to determine if the change in support for users of dres resulted from changes in the views of longtime user s or from lower initial support among those who used dres for the first time in the 2006 election satisfaction with the voting systems leos used declined from 2004 to 2006 overall and consistent with the bove results leos re ported high level of satisfaction with their voting systems and assessed that they performed very well during the most recent election on scale of 110 average ratings were 8 or higher for each of those questions in both surveys figure 11 however ratings for satisfaction with and performance of optical scan and dre systems were significantly lower in 2006 ratings for performance were also lower for paper systems there was difference in ratings between years for lever machines

surprising that dres received the highest ratings of any system for accessibility and ability for use in multiple languages or that handcounted paper ballots were rated lowest for counting speed some of the comparisons among voting systems however did yield surprising results the ratings for reliability security accuracy and ease of use by voters were ve ry high and were similar for all voting systems given media reports about problems w ith the reliability and security of electronic voting somewhat different outcomes might have been expected namely that dres would have been rated lower in reliability and security also given that modern dres are often described as more voterfriendly than other systems and certainly have the capability of providing higher levels of usability than other types the lack of difference in ratings for usability is somewhat surprising with respect to accuracy lower rating mig ht have been expected for punchcards given the difficulties with recounts that were prominent during the 2000 presidential election it is possible that such confid ence exists because few jurisdictions use punch cards now and those that do have th em declined to replace them after 2000 those jurisdictions kept the system spite intense negative media coverage of system limitations and opted not to take part in the punchcard buyout program offered through the help america vote act the relative lack of difference in ratings of optical scan and dre systems for acquisition and maintenance cost s and size and storage re quirements appears to run counter to widely held views many obser vers regard dres as the most expensive voting systems given that several mach ines may be needed for each polling place whereas optical scan systems usually re quire one machine per polling place pcos or none ccos these differences from expectation suggest that leos perceptions of how their voting systems perform may differ substantially in some ways from public perceptions about those systems if the pe rceptions of election officials are accurate then several of the criticisms leveled at specific voting systems could lead if acted upon to unnecessary and even counterproduc tive regulation and expenditure for example if in fact there is little difference in security between an optical scan system and dre then requirements for paper trails may be unnecessary if however leos perceptions are inaccurate then unde rstanding and addressing the causes of those inaccuracies may be beneficial electronic voting much of the recent controversy about ection reform has focused on electronic voting systems questions about the secu rity and reliability of those systems were relatively minor issue until 2003 two f actors led to sharp increase in public concerns about them 1

that controversy when asked whether current federal and state guidelines and standards about electronic voting syst ems both optical scan and dre systems are strict enough most leos about 60 rep lied in the affirmative those who did not were fairly evenly split among officials who believed that the current standards are too strict and those who believed th ey are not strict enough there was significant difference in average assessment between users and nonusers of electronic voting systems but nonusers were slightly mo re likely to believe that the standards are either too strict or not strict enough figure 14 source analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university note leos were asked do you believe that the state and federal standards

voting systems we re precinctcount optical scan were more neutral about dres than we re users of other voting systems28 users of dres in contrast generally agreed that they had sufficient knowledge about the voting system that certification procedures were adequate that dres are not vulnerable to tampering and security concerns can be addressed with good pr ocedures that the public should have

voting sy stems were dres we re less neutral about systems than users of other voting systems29 the controversy about the security and re liability of dres s led to widespread calls for the adoption of paper trail of the ballot choices that voter can verify before casting the ballot these paper trails printed as separate ballot records that the voter can examine are usually called vot erverified paper aud it trails or vvpat leos whose primary voting system is dr were asked severa l questions in both surveys about vvpat the percentage who used them doubled to 36 in 2006 from 18 in 2004 about onethird of leos whose jurisdictions used dres as their primary voting system stated that voters who did not wish to use dre had the option of using paper ballot instead ho wever it was not po ssible to determine which of those jurisdictions permitted that choice in the polling place rather than through the use of excuse absentee balloting30 most dre users did not believe that vvpat should be required but nonusers believed they should be in the 2006 survey only dre users were asked if vvpat should be required howe ver in the 2004 survey both users and nonusers were asked among dre users

local jurisdictions are in compliance with federal law most leos found the activities of the eac only moderately beneficial to them the results are presented in figure 26 leos regarded guidance to

source analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university the discrepancy in the ratings for eac guidance have several possible explanations for example it could reflect frustration with the delays in startup of the eac and consequently in the issuance of guidance it could reflect difficulties in understanding the guidance that was issued it might reflect the fact that the purpose of the guidance is to assist states not local jurisdictions in meeting the title iii requirements 311a or it could simply be an expression of opposition to or uncertainty about the requirements them selves individual comments from leos suggest diversity of views clear and concise plan needs to be formulated as to what the eac must do and definite timelines attached to the responsibilities rating this committee is somewhat unfai r once finally appointed funding was delayed they really havent had an opportunity to function in the capacity anticipated all

believe that views about voter identification are also influenced by nonpolicy considerations such as perspectives relating to partisan advantage from different kinds of requirements that some kinds of requirement may be thought to suppress turnout disproportionately with respect to the political party affiliation of voters the responses to the statements figure 30 however appear to conflict with the responses to the question on security in that most leos agreed that an unauthorized person could rem ove the register from the polling station and access the database alt hough they were ne utral about the risk of identity theft leos also expressed concerns about ma tching drivers licenses nd social security numbers and the difficulty of updating records in the new system but they did not believe that the system places heavy burden on local governments overall they were neutral about whether the new systems w ould improve the election process voter identification issues relating to voter identification have been controversial33 hava requires that firsttime voters who register by mail must present specified form of identification either when registering or when voting it does not require photo identification although few states have ch requirements and many states require some form of identification document34 the kinds of identification accepted for all voters to register and to vote as reported by respondents is shown in table 6 about one quarter of leos reported identification requirement whatsoever nd about onethird stat ed that signature comparison or personal information was sufficient leos supported requiri ng photo identification for all voters even though they believed it will negatively affect turnout and did not believe that voter fraud is serious problem in their jurisdictions one of the principal policy35 arguments for tightening vote ridentification requirements is concern about the risk of sign ificant levels of voting by ineligible voters opponents counter that those risks are small and that requiring identification especially photo ids would effectively dise nfranchise eligible voter s who would have difficulty obtaining such documents to help deter mine the views of leos about this issue the 2006 survey asked several additional questions about voter identification as local election offi cial how supportive are you of requiring all voters in your jurisdiction to provide valid photo identification how often do noneligible pers ons attempt to vote in your jurisdiction either in pe rson or by absentee ballot do you agree or disagree that deliberate voter fraud is serious problem in your jurisdictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs39 do you believe that requiring photo identification of all voters would make

purchased with funds made available under title ii after that date 38 the survey asked leos to indicate only wh ether particular event had occurred not how many times so if dre and precinctcount optical scan system have similar failure rates then jurisdiction using 1 dre and 1 unit per polling place will probably have lower incidence of failures than jurisdiction that us 10 dre units per polling place if the rate of failure per unit is 5 the polling place using 1 and 1 dre would have 10 chance that at least one unit would fail and the polling place using 10 dres would have 40 chance election administration issues 2006 election leos spent much more time prep aring for the election in 2006 than the one in 2004 the 2006 election was the first under which all hava requirements were in effect37 consistent with the perception of leos that hava has made elections more complex to administer figure 24 threequarters found that they spent more time preparing fo r the 2006 than the 2004 election with 40 spending much more time this percep tion was supported by comparing the number of hours per week leos reported spendi ng on election duties in the 2004 and 2006 surveys on average the time spent increased 15 from 21 to 24 hours in 2006 leos also stated that th ey worked an additional 20 hours per week in the month before the election this difference may be especially significant given that 2006 was not presidential election year with the additional work required for that contest in addition there were prominent issues of concern in 2006 such as votingsystem malfunctions and problems with pollworkers vendors long lines media coverage and timely nd accurate reporting of results the survey therefore presented list of 16 potential problems and other events and asked leos to indicate which if any had occurred the results are presented in table 7 and figure 32 the most commonly reported incident in the 2006 election was malfunction of dre or optical scan system not surprisingly this was most commonly reported by leos using dres as the primary voting system figure 32 but the differences were relatively sm all among dre users 53 reported that at least one repairable malfunction occurre d and 12 that at least one malfunction occurred that could not be repaired more such machines would be used on av erage in jurisdictions where dres are the primary voting system as opposed to those where only one is used per polling place to meet the hava accessibility requirement therefore the chance of at least one malfunction would be expected to be higher on average than in jurisdictions using another kind of primary system such as precinctcount optical scan where typically only one machine is used in precinct38 however if dres had lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs42 39 for example if the failure rate for dres were 1 and that for 5 polling place using 1 and 1 dre would have 6 chance that at least one unit would fail and the polling place using 10 dres would have 10 chance failure rates per machine than optical scan systems the difference would be correspondingly lower39 table 7 percentage of leos reporting various events

by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university note the percentages in this table are based on the total number of respondents who reported the kind of voting system they used 1360 this base was chosen because it seemed most likely to reflect the number of respondents who considered the question the percentages would have been different if another denominator were used 1 if the number of respondents to this question 1029 was used the percentages would have been higher but those results would be overestimates of the true percentage since leos who had problems at all would not have responded to the question at all the question did not have an option for leos to check if they had problems whatever 2 if the total number of leos responding to the survey was used the percentages would have been lower but those results would have been underestimates since the denominator would likely have included leos who had problems but skipped the question for example under alternative 1 the estimates would be higher by factor of 13 eg 57 rather than 43 for the first event and under 2 lower by factor of 09 39 however the effects of such changes on the significance of the results is negligible in fact the incidence of such occurrences was almost equally as high for users of both precinct and centralcount optical scan systems 47 and 36 respectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs43 for repairable malfunctions and 12 and 15 for unrepaira ble ones as their primary systems in comparison the reported failu re rates in jurisd ictions using lever machines and paper ballots was much lower 9 and 10 for repairable malfunctions and 5 and 6 for unrepaira ble ones about one in seven users of optical scan and dres as their primary systems were disappointed in the level of support provided by vendors those leos we re twice as likely to have experienced unrepairable malfunctions of their vo ting systems as leos who were not disappointed with vendor support source analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university note only one leo reported that an electronic voting system was hacked see text the reports of malfunctions of electronic voting systems by users of lever machines and handcounted paper ballots may seem puzzling however many of those jurisdictions use dres to meet hava

occurrences in their jurisdictions on election day 2006 by primary voting systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs44 40 since many such users also use dres to meet the hava accessibility requirements it was not possible to determine whether it was an optical scan system or dre that the leo assessed as having been hacked the results suggest that current optical scan systems may not be significantly more reliable than dres they also contrast strikingly with the uniformly high ratings all users gave for the reliability of their voting systems see figure 13 above leos did not appear to assess the malfunctions as being the result of tampering in fact only one reported system bein g hacked and that was precinctcount optical scan user40 the incidence of long lines at the polling place was highest in jurisdictions using dres another notable result was the fairly high incidence of leos 12 who reported excessively long lines at the polling place the prevalence was much higher in jurisdictions using dres primarily occurring in about one quarter in those using other ki nds of voting systems long lines occurred in only about 6 figure 32 jurisdictions using dres also reported more unfair media coverage 19 than users of other systems 6 on average the incidence of problems with accurate and timely reporting of election results was low and did not differ among users of the different kinds of voting systems reports of deliberate election fraud of any kind were also few 8 leos one out of every 170 jurisdictions or 075 such w rate might nevert heless be considered unacceptably high depending on such factors as the seriousness of the offense the impact of such attempts at fraud on the election and the degree to which election officials are able to detect all such attempts leos noticed change on average in re sidual votes overvotes plus undervotes plus spoiled ballots from 2004 to 2006 about 60 reported change and about 20 each reported an increase or decrease this result suggests that the decreased confidence leos had in 2006 in the ability of voting systems to reduce voter error was not result of noticeable increase in ch error alternatively the decrease in confidence might have resulted from sources such as changes in media coverage of votingsystem problems the number of provisional ballots used varied greatly among jurisdictions in 2006 about 30 of that variability is expl ainable by the number of voters in the jurisdiction thus jurisdictions with fe wer than 1000 registered voters used about 10 provisional ballots on average and those with more than 100000 voters used 1500 across all jurisdictions one provi sional ballot was used for every 140 registered voters on average about quarter of jurisdictions mostly small used provisional ballots and about 4 used more than 1000 with maximum of 15000 in jurisdiction with about half million voters when asked whether these ballots were easier to use than in 2004 about thr eequarters of leos reported change but more found them easier 16 than harder 9 to use in 2006 threequarters of jurisdictions used optical scan systems for absentee ballots and most of the rest used handcounted paper ballots mo re than half of respondentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs45 41 historically most states have required voters to provide reason such as illness disability or absence from the jurisdiction on ection day as part of an application for an absentee ballot however most states now offer early voting excuse absentee voting or both for specifics see electionlineorg p reelection day and absentee voting by mail rules

early voting about third each of those offering it used optical scan third dres and under 10 handcounted paper ballots the rate of absentee voting has been in creasing nationally over the last several elections as the number of states offering early and excuse absentee voting has increased41 the survey asked leos to provide information on the percentage of all votes cast by absentee voting in 2006 on average respondents reported that about 14 of votes were cast by absentee ballot with 15 being mo st commonly reported figure 33 42 the average rate is very similar to the one reported in the eacs election day survey 14243 some observers have expr essed concerns about early and excuse absentee voting arguing among other things that they do not increase turnout and pose some security risks these concerns we re largely not shared by leos figure 34 threequarters agreed that absentee voting s hould be considered voters right and more than half that early voting should be threequarters also agreed that absentee voting is worth the costs and that verification of authenticity is not difficult for those ballots however they were equivocal bout whether early voting is worth the costs both absentee and early voting reduce the pressures of electi on day administration it is possible that election officials s upport absentee voting over early voting because it is easier to administer in the preelection period problems with pollworkers were common about 10 of jurisdictions experienced one or more instances of pollw orkers not reporting for duty since the average jurisdiction used more than 150 pollworkers the impact may be small on average although not in the affected po lling places nevertheless absenteeism among pollworkers has been cited as significant problem on election day44 factors that might contribute include long hours w pay poor training and age but analysis of pay and training data from the survey did not point to those factors as being significant45

their jobs46 the lowest rate 5 was in jurisdictions using handcounted paper ballots results from leos using ot her kinds of voting systems ranged from 1725 but those differences we re not statistically significant it seems unlikely that the differences between the results for pape r and those for other voting systems arose purely from differences in the roles of t echnology in the different voting systems since the technologyrelated tasks of pollw orkers in jurisdictions using centralcount optical scan are unlikely to be much gr eater than those in jurisdictions using handcounted paper ballots there are several other possi ble factors for example the average total number of pollworkers polling places and registered voters reported by leos is far lower for jurisdic tions using handcounted paper than for any other voting system see figure 35 in the next section use training and experience of pollworkers the 2006 survey included several questions about pollworkers all but 3 of leos reported using one or more pollwor kers with mean number of 164 in jurisdiction47 and maximum of 4000 the num ber of pollworkers in the jurisdictions was strongly correlated with the number of registered voters reported as was the total number of polling places th kind of voting system used also varied with the number of registered voters overall jurisdictions using handcounted paper ballots had the smallest number of registered voters polling places and po llworkers and those us ing dres and lever machines the highest figure 35 on average there were 56 pollworkers per polling place jurisdictions using paper ba llots had the highest average number and those using lever machines the lowest compensation of pollworkers also va ried substantially about 60 of respondents reported paying them lump sum amount for work on election day 100 on average the remainder of res pondents reported an hourly wage of 725 on average very few respondents reported paying nothing to pollworkers and few likewise reported paying more than 200 per day or 12 per hour the results suggest that there is some regional variati on for example the average rate of pay by state varied in new england from 50 to 106 per day and in the west from 70 to 155 while leos who reported problems w ith pollworker performance paid them 510 less per day on average the effect of pay on performance was

performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university there was more variation in the views of leos about the political contentiousness of the election adminis tration environment with about 18 believing it is not contentious at all and 9 that it is extremely contentious nevertheless on average leos rated the level of contentiousness relatively low finally leos were asked whether election

texas am university possible caveats as with any survey care needs to be taken in drawing inferences from the results one question that could arise is whether the sample is representative of leos as whole for example simply drawing the sample at random from the nationwide pool of election administr ators would have resulted in disproportionately large number of juri sdictions from new england and the upper midwest where elections are administere d by townships rather than counties51 steps were taken in the design of the studies to minimize the risk that the sample would not be representative see the appendix on methodology below overall neither the sample design nor the characteristics of th responses suggest that the results are unrepresentative of the views and characteristics of local election officials another potential caution for interpretation relates to the inherent limits of surveys such as these in particular th ere is way to guaran tee that the responses of the election officials corre spond to their actual beliefs in addition there is way to be certain that any par ticular belief corresponds to r eality the question on voting system characteristics see figure 13 provides an illustration of the possibility for disparity for several reasons leos might be reluctant to rate their voting systems0255075 in favor opinion opposed preference of leoselected leos

security despite the anonymity of the results alternatively they might truly believe that their voting systems are highly reliable accurate and secure even if independent evidence does not support that view also some caution is needed in assigning cause and effect the mere existence of an association or correlation between factor and an effect does not necessarily mean that the factor caused the effect for example the survey showed strong association between the kind of voting syst em used in jurisdiction and the number of pollworkers see figure 35 however while the kind of voting system may have some independent effect mo re important factor is the number of registered voters final caution involves how survey resu lts might be used to inform policy decisions on the one hand the results coul d be used to support the shaping of policy in directions expressed by leos in their responses in many cases such policy changes might be appropriate on the othe r hand it is possible that at least some of those desired changes would not in fact yield the most effective or appropriate policies in such cases the results might more constructively be used to help policymakers identify issues for which improvements in communication and understanding are needed potential policy implications the survey results may have policy implications for several issues at the federal state and local levels of government some issues that may be relevant for congressional deliberations are highlighted below election officials many observers have commented favorably on the experience and dedication of the nations local election officials survey results are consistent with that view at the same time other observers including some election officials have called for increased prof essionalism in election administration some survey results suggest areas of potentia l professional improve ment such as in education and in professiona l involvement at the nationa l level congress could address this potential need by several means for example facilitating educational and training programs for leos and promo ting professional certification of election officials by entities accredited through the eac the seemingly unique demographic ch aracteristics of leos as group of government officials may have other polic implications but they are not altogether clear however some observers may ar gue that efforts s hould be undertaken to ensure that leos reflect the diversity of the workforce or voting population as whole especially with respect to minority representation the issue of partisanship among election officials has been controversial for several years most national attention has been on state fficials but given that most leos are elected and only about half the cal jurisdictions in the united states are administered on nonpartisan or bipartisan basis policymakers may wish to consider the influence of partisanship among leos

activities and challenges across the continuedvoting systems since the enactment of hava controversy has arisen over whether dre voting systems are sufficiently secure and reliable the survey revealed that leos who have experience with dres are very confident in them consider them superior for accessibility and do not generally support the addition of voterverified paper audit trail vvpat to address security concerns although those who use vvpat are satisfied with its performance however leos using other systems are much less confident in dres and more supportive of vvpat the strongly dichotomous results suggest that as congress considers whether to require changes in the security mechanisms used in voting systems it might be useful to determine whether dre users are overconfident in the security of their systems and procedures in practice or alternatively whether nonuser s might need to be better educated about the reliability and security of dre systems52 the help america vote act hava the survey results suggest that hava is in the process of achieving several of its policy goals the general support of hava provisions including those such as the creation of the eac and the provisional ballot requirement that have been somewhat controversial implies that leos are in agreement with the goals of the act and are active partners in its implementation the overwhelming choice of new voting systems that assist voters in avoiding errors indicates that the hava goal of reducing avoidable voter error is in the process of being met the areas of cern expressed by leos such as how to meet the costs of ongoing implementati on of hava requirements raise issues that congress may wish to address as it considers hava appropriations and reauthorization in addition the reduction in the levels of support from 2004 for hava and the eac while small and broade r concerns about the effectiveness of the eac may raise concerns for congress the close relationship between leos nd the vendors of their voting systems seems unlikely to change as result of hava however with the codification by hava of the voting system standards and cer tification processes the influence of the federal government in decisions about new voting systems might be expected to increase in relation to that of vendors and others the increased concerns of leos in 2006 that vendors media political par ties and advocacy groups have too much influence on such decisi ons may raise concerns research needs scientific opinion surveys of local election officials are rare53 and additional research may be useful to address some of the matters raised byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs56 53 continued nation gao023 october 2001 that survey focused largely on issues of election management such as the availability of poll wo rkers and the processing of absentee ballots while results of the two surveys are not gene rally comparable because of differences in focus and methodology the gao survey did find that high percentage of local officials expressed satisfaction with the performance of their existing voting systems finding consistent with the results of the current surveythese studies for example survey of state election officials might provide useful information and might additi onally be helpful in asse ssing the most appropriate federal role in promoting the effective implementation of hava goals at all levels of government one common suggestion of leos for imp roving hava was to provide means of adjusting requirements to fit the needs of smaller jurisdictions to determine what if any such adjustments would be ppropriate it may be usef ul to have specific information on how the needs and characteris tics of different jurisdictions vary with size something that was beyond the scope of these surveys it could also be useful to identify how the duties of leos vary with size and other characteristics of the jurisdiction in many jurisdictions electi on administration is only part of the leos job it is not known to what degree thes other responsibilities might affect election administration negatively or positively finally these surveys have provided onl snapshots of leo characteristics and perceptions over twoyear period it might be beneficial to perform similar surveys periodically to identify trends and explore new questions and issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs57 54 the students were jennifer gray marshall gray joshua hodges jeff jewell marcia larson ryan mitchell erin murello steve murello alice reeves and julie

state varies greatly from fewer than 10 to more than 1000 the number varies much more strongly with the way states have chosen to organize their election jurisdictions than it does with variab such as the votingage populations of the states consequently simple random sample of the total number of election officials in the united states would have caused states w ith more decentralized election administration to be disproportionately represented in the t of responses alternative approaches that attempted to weight the data by state votingage population or portion of leos for example would also have had weaknesses in addressing questions of representativeness continuedappendix notes on methodology the results presented and analyzed in this report are from two surveys sponsored by crs as part of its capstone progra m and performed by graduate students and faculty at the george bush school of gove rnment and public service at texas am university the principal investigat ors for the 2004 survey were donald p moynihan and carol silva for the 2004 study and carol silva for 2006 ten graduate students participated in the first survey54 and six in the second55 for both studies the crs project manager was eric fisc her and the project liaison was kevin coleman56 the topics for the two surveys were veloped collaboratively by the crs and texas am participants the major fact or in choosing the topics was potential usefulness of the results for congress the bush school team developed and administered the survey instrument in consultation with crs and provided the authors with the data used in performing the analyses the two surveys were conducted afte r the november 2004 and 2006 federal elections between december and the following march for each survey sample of approximately 3800 leos was dr awn from the roughly 9000 election jurisdictions in the 50 states57 to ensure that leos from all states were included but that states with large numbers of were not dispropor tionately represented see figure 43 modified randomsampling regime was used as follows surveys were sent to all leos in states with 150 or fewer local jurisdictions for the ten states with more than 150 leos sample of 150 was chosen at random from the local jurisdictions and surveys were sent to those leos58 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34363crs58 58 continued there is simple solution to this problem and the sampling strategy used in the two surveys was chosen as way to strike reasonable balance between populational and geographic representation in combination with the unweighted statistical analyses performed for this report the strategy has the effect of increasing the relative influence of the fourfifths of states with fewer than 150 leos while ensuring relatively strong influence of states with large numbers of leos 59 this number is for questions that applied to all leos some questions were targeted to specific groups such as users of dres most surveys were administered elect ronically with respondents visiting website to enter their responses the rema inder were paper surveys sent via the us postal service leos who did not res pond were sent reminders or contacted by telephone source crs analysis of data provided by the election reform information project electionlineorg and other sources note data are from 2004 but the distribution of jurisdictions did not change significantly for 2006 for each survey the overall final response rate was 40 of th sample or about 17 of all jurisdictions in the united states respondents answered 8590 of questions on average59 the response was sufficiently high to permit statistical analysis and comparison of the results betw een the surveys individual response rates per state were between 25 and 50 fo r about threequarters of states see figure 44 the remainder were evenly split be tween those for which under 25 of leos responded and those for which the rate wa s greater than 50 response rates were similar among states across the two surveys and did not vary significantly for either survey with the number of local election jurisdictions in state or its voting age population about 70 of

administered in the other category and almost all of those indi cated their jurisdiction as city the option to write in response did not exist in the 2004 survey and the pattern of response strongly suggests that most leos with city jurisdicti ons chose town or township as the most closely matching category 61 this was only an issue for those few questions where leos provided adlib answers rather than choosing from among range of options 62 for example when asked how many additi onal hours per week leos worked in the four weeks preceding the election the res ponses of five leos presented in the database as impossibly large numbers such as 1015 or 2530 there are 168 hours in week those responses were clearly incorrect given the structure of those responses the intent was interpreted as range 1015 and 2530 in the examples and the number of hours was corrected to the midpoint of the range 125 and 275other was almost certainly result of small change in the structure of the question for the 2006 survey60 source analysis by crs of data from studies performed collaboratively by crs and texas am university all the results presented in this report are from analyses by crs of data provided from the surveys by researchers at texas am university the raw data were first examined for errors and correc tions were made where necessary in few cases such as if leo claimed to work more hours per week than is physically possible61 where the correct answer could be reasonably discerned the response was corrected62 otherwise it was discarded once cleaned the data were analyzed using
