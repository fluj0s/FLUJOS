jurenas specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division exempting food and agriculture products from us economic sanctions status and implementation summary in approving the fy2001 agriculture appropriations act congress codified the lifting of unilateral sanctions on commercial sales of food agricultural commodities medicine and medical products to iran libya north korea and sudan and extended this policy to apply to cuba title ix of hr 5426 as enacted by pl 106 387 trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 or tsra other provisions place financing and licensing conditions on sales to these countries those that apply to cuba though are permanent and more restrictive tsra also gives congress the authority in the future to veto presidents proposal to impose sanction on the sale of agricultural or medical products codifying the food and medical sales exemption for cuba generated much debate exemption proponents argued that prohibiting sales to cuba harmed the us agricultural sector and that opening up limited trade would be one way to pursue constructive engagement policy opponents countered that an exemption would undercut us policy to pressure the castro government to make political and economic reforms though top cuban officials initially stated purchases would be made with tsras conditions in place food stock losses due to hurricane and shift in cuban strategy led to almost 125 billion in cash purchases by cuba of us food and farm commodities from december 2001 to april 2006 agricultural sales to iran libya and sudan under tsra have totaled 313 million congressional opponents of tsras prohibitions on private us financing of agricultural sales public financing of eligible exports and tourist travel to cuba have introduced bills since 2000 to repeal these provisions though several amendments to repeal or relax tsra provisions relative to cuba were adopted by committees or passed during floor debate all were dropped in conference action the bush administrations policy is to allow sales under tsra but not to change any aspect of the embargo until political and economic reforms occur in cuba reflecting this administration officials continually signal to conferees they will advise the president to veto any bill that would change tsras prohibitions against cuba in the 109th congress hr 719s 328 hr 1339s 634 samdt 281 and samdt 282 to s 600 and amendments to appropriations bills seek to change rule issued in early 2005 which defined payment of cash in advance to mean that payment must be received by the us exporter prior to when agricultural products are shipped from us port rather than before title and control is transferred to the cuban buyer fearing lost sales farm groups and some congressional opposition to this rule has led to ongoing debate on this issue responding to congressional pressure the bush administration in july 2005 revised this rule slightly to allow for goods to be shipped from us port once thirdcountry bank receives payment for the us exporter from the cuban purchaser in recent floor action the house on june 14 2006 adopted an amendment to the fy2007

and implementation recent developments on june 22 2006 the senate appropriations committee during markup of its fy2007 agriculture spending measure adopted by voice vote an amendment section 755 of hr 5384 to facilitate travel related to licensed sales of agricultural and medical goods to cuba there is similar provision in the agriculture appropriations bill passed by the house on june 14 2006 the house by voice vote approved an amendment to prohibit the use of appropriated funds to enforce us department of treasury regulation prescribing how sales of us agricultural products to cuba are to be paid this provision is included as section 950 of hr 5576 the transportationtreasury appropriations act for fy2007 this rule as issued in february 2005 by treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac which administers the financial and related rules governing us agricultural export sales to cuba it clarified the meaning of the term payment of cash in advance it requires that payment be received by the exporter or the sellers agent prior to the goods being shipped from the us port rather than before title and control is transferred to the cuban buyer this provision is identical to one that both the house and the senate included in the fy2006 transportationtreasury appropriations bill which was dropped by conferees in response to veto threat for background see legislative developments 109th congress debate over cash in advance payment definition 19992001 changes in us policy allowing agricultural sales to sanctioned countries falling agricultural exports and declining commodity prices in the late 1990s led farm groups and agribusiness firms to urge the executive branch to drop and calls for congress to pass legislation to exempt food from us economic sanctions against certain countries the clinton administration on april 28 1999 announced it would lift prohibitions on us commercial sales of most agricultural commodities and food products to three countries iran libya and sudan moreover it indicated that it would not include these products in announcing future sanctions on other countries the administrations decision reflected its view that food should not be used as foreign policy tool and officials acknowledgment that us sanctions policy had hurt the us farm economy on july 27 1999 the us department of crs2 treasury issued countryspecific export licensing regulations to exempt commercial sales of food and medical products by us companies that meet specified conditions and safeguards to iran libya and sudan licenses are issued by the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac regulations issued june 19 2000 to implement white house decision announced in september 1999 now permit sales of agricultural products to north korea without an export license licensed agricultural sales to cuba under policy announced in may 1999 were restricted only to private and nongovernmental entities but were broadened under statutory change that went into effect in july 2001 for the two years that the clinton administrations policy was in effect treasury approved licenses that resulted in us sales of corn to iran durum wheat to libya and hard red winter wheat to sudan also president clinton in issuing executive orders in 1999 to impose us economic sanctions on serbia and the taliban in afghanistan specifically exempted commercial sales of food and medical products from prohibitions imposed on all us exports to these destinations congressional efforts to expand this policy to also cover sales to cuba and to remove uncertainties in executive branch implementation of us sanctions policy resulted in passage of the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 title ix of hr 5426 as enacted by pl 106387 on october 28 2000 referred to below as tsra tsra codified the lifting of us sanctions on commercial sales of food agricultural commodities and medical products to iran libya north korea and sudan and extended this policy to cuba see below such sales are now subject to export licensing procedures laid out in administrative regulations in significant policy change congress has future veto power on presidents proposal to impose unilateral agricultural or medical sanction debate on agricultural and food exports in us economic sanctions policy farm organizations agricultural commodity associations and agribusiness firms since the 1980 grain embargo on the soviet union have favored changing us policy to exempt export sales of agricultural commodities food products and agricultural inputs from the broad economic sanctions currently imposed on targeted countries they argued that prohibitions hurt only us farmers and business undermine this countrys reputation as reliable supplier and do not change targeted countries behavior in recent years these groups joined with firms in the pharmaceutical and manufacturing sectors to call for comprehensive review of the economic impact of these sanctions and for limits on the executive branchs use of sanctions to restrict trade opposition to exempting sales of agricultural commodities and food products from us sanctions policy has been somewhat more diffuse opponents argued that current law gives the president sufficient flexibility to permit food to be shipped for humanitarian reasons and that us foodstuffs if sold could be misused by foreign governments or not made available to those in need some objected to the loosening of trade restrictions with certain countries such as cuba coming largely from the crs3 foreign policy and defense community they viewed sanctions as legitimate and effective policy tool and drew little distinction between prohibiting sales of food and prohibiting exports of all other products provisions enacted in 2000 to exempt food and medical products from us economic sanctions overview of tsra the most significant policy change made by the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 exempts commercial sales of agricultural and medical products to cuba from the longstanding us trade embargo on that country at the same time tsra made permanent prohibition on cubas access to us private and other public financing to purchase exempted products though press coverage suggested that the debate was solely over cubaspecific measure this act codified an exemption for sales of agricultural and medical products in the conduct of us sanctions policy with respect to five countries and the terms under which this exemption operates it further codified clinton administration policy based on existing law that prohibited making available us government credits credit guarantees and other financial assistance to facilitate agricultural and medical product sales to certain sanctioned countries also tsra made changes to the food and medical products exemptionfromsanctions policy exercised administratively by the executive branch since mid1999 this act 1 broadens the exemption to allow sales of nonfood agricultural commodities and fertilizers and 2 streamlines the process us exporters follow to obtain licenses to sell exempted products to sanctioned countries other tsra provisions require the president to secure future congressional approval before he can impose for foreign policy or national security reasons restriction or prohibition on the sale of agricultural and medical products the act also limits the duration of any such approved sanction to not more than two years unless congress approves an extension status of implementation the tsra provisions that cover agricultural and medical exports to countries subject to us unilateral sanctions took effect on february 25 2001 however interagency differences between the department of commerces bureau of industry and security bis then known as the bureau of export administration bxa and treasurys ofac over how to interpret these provisions were not resolved until considered by the white houses national security council both agencies issued their interim rules to reflect tsras statutory changes on july 12 2001 these took effect on july 26 2001 from august 2001 through april 2006 us exporters sold almost 16 billion in agricultural products to cuba iran libya and sudan under tsra provisions1 the 60 million 1 this total amount excludes commercial agricultural sales made to libya after broad us economic sanctions were lifted in april 2004 crs4 in agricultural exports to north korea and also most shipments to sudan most likely were food donations and not commercial sales extension of food and medical exemption to cuba tsra allows licensed commercial sales of agricultural and medical products to cuba this policy change reflects the laws requirement that the president terminate any unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction 120 days after enactment this provision effectively supersedes statutory provisions in the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 that law codified the thenregulatory prohibitions on all us exportimport and other transactions under the us embargo imposed on cuba in the early 1960s under this embargo commercial sales of usorigin agricultural products and medical products at times to cuba generally were prohibited separately the cuban democracy act of 1992 allows some commercial sales of us medical products to cuba but under tight conditions though the clinton administration announced sanctions policy changes in 1999 and in 2000 to allow sales of agricultural and medical products to iran libya sudan and north korea it did not have legal authority to do the same with respect to cuba this explains why most of the congressional debate leading up to tsras passage revolved around whether this same exemption should be statutorily extended to apply also to cuba as house debate and compromise unfolded in early summer 2000 those opposed to this opening in trade with cuba succeeded in adding number of cubaspecific provisions under tsra agricultural and medical sales to cuba are now subject to various conditions and restrictions that are similar to those already in effect on similar product sales to the other sanctioned countries us exporters must follow an export licensing process before any product can be shipped further permanent prohibition is in place against the use of any us government export program or financing provided by us private banks or state and local governments to facilitate licensed sales cubarelated regulations issued biss interim rules continue the pre 2001 policy that requires medical product exports to cuba be licensed they also establish an expedited process for handling agricultural product sales to cuba and waive the restriction on the direct shipment of eligible products now permitted to be sold to cuba2 codification of foodmedical exemption tsra enacts as us policy the principle that commercial sales of food other agricultural products medicine and other medical products shall not be used as tool to conduct foreign policy or to address national security objectives see 2 published in the federal register july 12 2001 pp 3667536683 available at httpfrwebgateaccessgpogovcgibingetdoccgidbname2001_registerdocidfr12j y0121pdf crs5 definition of products covered by exemption this law stipulates that this principle apply to all countries now subject to us unilateral sanctions and require that president in the future justify to congress why sales of these products to sanctioned country or foreign entity should be limited and obtain congressional approval before taking such action limits on agricultural sales are defined to be any prohibition restriction or condition on carrying out any commercial export sale of agricultural commodities or on using any us department of agriculture usda program authorized under four specified statutes or any us government export financing including credits or credit guarantees to facilitate such sales for medical product sales such limits are defined to be any prohibition restriction or condition on exports of or the provision of assistance consisting of medicine or medical device in immediate and practical terms tsra 1 codified earlier clinton administration decisions to allow agricultural and medical product sales to four countries iran libya north korea and sudan and 2 amended the laws and related regulations authorizing the us embargo on cuba to allow commercial sales of agricultural and medical products exceptions to exemption tsra provides four exceptions to the general principle discussed above these exceptions are relevant when the united states acts against foreign country or entity to impose sanction that includes these products pursuant to 1 its involvement in multilateral sanctions regime or mandatory decision of the united nations security council 2 declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for the use or the imminent or actual involvement in hostilities of us armed forces and 3 its export control to prevent potential military use under the arms export control act the export administration act or other authority president bush tapped this exception authority in issuing executive order 13224 september 23 2001 to prohibit transactions with designated terrorists and their supporters section 4 states the determination that tsra shall not affect the imposition or continuation of any unilateral agricultural or medical sanction on any individual or entity determined to be subject to this order because imminent involvement of us armed forces in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances export licensing requirement under tsras exemption exports of agricultural and medical products to governments and other entities in sanctioned countries are allowed only under an approved export license section 906a1 requires that this export licensing requirement apply to sales to those countries that the secretary of state exercising authority under three cited statutes has determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism in practice this means that sales of eligible products to governments of countries currently so designated cuba iran and sudan or to any other entity in each of these countries must be licensed before any shipment can be made though the secretary of state has determined that the governments of north korea and syria also are sponsors of international terrorism section 906a2 explicitly states that the license requirement does not apply to sales to these two countries the secretary has discretion to drop this licensing requirement for iran libya and sudan if the determination is made that its crs6 government longer supports international terrorism3 such discretion is permitted for cuba meaning this licensing requirement is made permanent for eligible sales to cuba relevant provisions in the act seek to streamline and simplify the type of license an exporter must obtain to sell permitted products to sanctioned countries these address concerns expressed by us agricultural exporters that the treasury regulations governing the licensing of agricultural sales to iran libya and sudan had been cumbersome and time consuming differences between the pre2001 licensing rules and the relevant enacted provisions that modify the earlier rules are described below previous licensing rules for countries covered by the clinton administrations 1999 food and medical exemption policy iran libya and sudan the department of treasurys ofac issued two types of export licenses general and specific the type required and the relevant conditions and procedures that apply to each depended on the nature of the product the exporter wanted to sell the end user of the proposed sale the details of the terms of sales contract the date of contract performance and on how the sale would be paid for see payment and financing terms of exempted sales for important related conditions general license authorizes certain transactions without the need for an exporter to file an application providing all the details of each individual transaction specific license is issued on casebycase basis to an individual or company allowing an activity or transaction to take place ofacs food exemption regulations set up two different procedures for obtaining licenses depending on the product to be sold the conditions that an exporter must meet varied according to which procedure is followed an expedited licensing process applied to prospective sales of specified bulk agricultural commodities specific license authorized an exporter to enter into executory contracts ie respond to requests for bids enter into binding contracts and perform against contract terms and covered transactions over specified time period certain conditions had to be met to obtain this license for sales of all other food products medicines and medical equipment ofac used twostep licensing procedure to review each contract on casebycase basis first an exporter had to obtain general license to enter into an executory contract that made performance contingent upon prior approval by ofac disclose all parties with an interest in the sale and lay out all terms of the sale second the exporter had to apply for specific license permitting performance of the executory contract before the sale can be completed ofac issued these regulations under the authority of the export administration act of 1979 as extended that requires validated license to export any good to country determined to be sponsor of international terrorism 3 in practice the state department under these statutes has rarely changed or reversed sponsor of international terrorism determination made with respect to foreign government with the easing of most us sanctions on libya announced in april 2004 and the bush administrations announcement on may 15 2006 of its intent to rescind listing libya as sponsor of terrorism us exporters of agricultural products longer need to secure licenses to sell to libya crs7 cuba through july 2001 commerces bis administered different licensing rules for cuba applicable to us shipments of eligible food and agricultural commodities farm inputs and medical products though various statutes and regulations prohibited most exports of us origin to cuba these exceptions allowed for the donation and sale of food and agricultural products to individuals eligible nongovernmental entities and private businesses tsra though effectively supersedes these provisions to now allow for the commercial sale of agricultural and medical products to cuba under prescribed terms see below tsras changes to licensing rules section 906a of tsra allows sales of exempted agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries on terms that are less restrictive than under previous policy see above the law stipulates that such exports shall only be made pursuant to oneyear licenses for contracts entered into during the oneyear period of the license and shipped within the 12 month period beginning on the date of the signing of the contract and that such oneyear licenses shall be more restrictive than license exceptions administered by the department of commerce or general licenses administered by the department of treasury the wording appears to require bis and ofac to consider license applications on streamlined and less conditioned basis rather than on the present casebycase and highly regulated basis in other words the apparent aim was to move away from complex and time consuming process that may require an exporter to walk through multiple step process to seek approval for the several transactions involved in completing one sale tsra also removes executive branch discretion in determining the time period that applies to transactions covered by an export license by placing defined time parameter on the period during which an approved license covers eligible product transactions one related provision is intended to ensure that other licensing conditions and procedures cover multiple types of transactions eg an exporter submits one application providing the information required for all of the sales transactions covered by license another requires that regulations must ensure procedures that will deny licenses for exports to any entity or end user within an affected country that promotes international terrorism debate over proposed licensing regulations in early 2001 bxa and ofac had drafted licensing rules to implement the new laws exemption these reportedly differed in some key respects bxa proposed for the countries under its jurisdiction cuba north korea and syria an arrangement to allow companies during oneyear period to export eligible products without the need to secure an individual license for each shipment bxa reportedly would have granted license exception if company agrees to monitor sales of eligible products using prescribed set of parameters under this exception sales would still be subject to government audit ofac proposed for all affected countries cuba iran libya north korea sudan and syria casebycase licensing system that includes end use verification its proposal was similar to rules already in effect for iran libya and sudan this twostep licensing process would involve first approving license to allow an exporter to enter into negotiations to make sales and then issuing another license to cover actual shipments the reported differences in these draft regulations reflected conflicting views on how to interpret tsras provisions as well as language that some observers suggested was unclear and contradictory as these crs8 differences became known during february 2001 members of congress and interest groups weighed in with their views regulations published biss rule allows for the sale of eligible agricultural products to cuba without an export license subject though to review of written contract if other federal agencies do not object within 11 days in other words bis will administer licensing exception with respect to only those products that are covered by the regulations definitions of agricultural and medical products ofacs rule requires an exporter to obtain oneyear export license for sales of agricultural and medical sales to iran and sudan if reviewing agency objects within 11 days the license application is denied if concern is raised ofac has 30 more days to review the license request under the bush administrations libyan sanctions policy change announced april 23 2004 most us exports to libya longer require an export license some agricultural exporters have since expressed concern that the requirement to have ofac check each time that the end user eg buyer in iran and sudan is not involved in promoting international terrorism slows down the licensing process they have urged that ofac change its rules to reflect the more flexible licensing system implemented under clintons 1999 executive order payment and financing terms of exempted sales us policy seeks to ensure that sanctioned countries do not receive any financial benefit from permitted or licensed transactions it also prohibits such countries from accessing bank accounts and other assets that their governments or organizations or firms in these countries hold in the united states tsra did not change current policy meaning that us banks cannot offer trade financing to facilitate export sales of exempted products to such countries with respect to cuba tsra codifies two of the three types of financial transactions that ofac regulations permit to facilitate licensed food and medical product sales to iran and sudan other provisions prohibit us government support of such sales to all sanctioned countries see prohibition on us government assistance for export sales current prohibition and restrictions ofac regulations specifically prohibit us banks from extending financing to countries subject to us unilateral economic sanctions this policy is reflected in the current payment and financing rules that apply to licensed sales of agricultural and medical products to iran and sudan laid out initially by clinton administration policy and to cuba under embargo regulations with respect to the first two countries ofac regulations allow only for payment of cash in advance to be made to the us seller for sanctioned countrys purchase of exempted products the two permitted trade financing or credit terms are 1 sales on open account4 with certain limitations and 2 financing by third 4 sales on open account refers to transaction in which goods are released to buyer prior to payment or promise of payment because the exporter bears all the risk of non payment by the buyer this type of transaction requires high level of established trust between both parties an exporter however may view sales on these terms as providing continued crs9 country banks that are neither an overseas office of us bank nor entities of the governments of these three countries5 us banks are permitted to advise or confirm letters of credit6 issued by third country banks but are prohibited from providing any trade financing an exporter must obtain general license from ofac for each of these payment or credit terms ofac also will consider an application from us banks for specific license to participate in financing sales on casebycase basis where such financing arrangements would not undermine overall compliance with us sanctions prohibition on us financing of agricultural sales to cuba section 908b of tsra prohibits the financing of agricultural sales to cuba or any person in cuba by us banks any state or local government the federal government or any other us private person or entity this prohibition effectively codifies provision in the cuban embargo regulations 31 cfr 515533f that does not allow trade financing for the commercial sale of food or agricultural commodities to non governmental entities in cuba that bis is authorized to license under 1999 policy change tsra language stipulates that licensed sales can occur only if paid in cash in advance or if financed by third country bank in codifying this financing prohibition the executive branch longer has discretion to revise the financing rules should it determine the nature of the uscuban relationship is changing in practical terms this financing policy treats cuba different than other sanctioned countries under pre2001 regulations with respect to licensed sales see also legislative developments 109th congress debate over cash in advance payment definition prohibition on us private financing of licensed exports to other countries the issue of prohibiting any us private financing of agricultural exports to cuba received much attention during the legislative debate however none of tsras provisions require any change in ofac regulations that prohibit us private financing of agricultural and medical product sales to iran and sudan7 with respect to these two countries ofac will continue to implement its current policy prohibiting us private financing of licensed sales though some thought that tsra would allow these countries to take advantage of us private financing despite the statutory prohibition imposed on cuba provision in the act explicitly 4 continued entry to potential market that outweighs such risk such terms allow buyer to delay payment until the imported products have been examined 5 an example of third country financing would be french bank providing trade finance for us exporters sale of wheat to iran this bank must not be an affiliate of us bank nor of any iranian state financial institution 6 letter of credit lc is used when the importerbuyers ability to pay is uncertain or when the exporterseller needs it to obtain financing lc gives the buyer the financial backing of an issuing bank which makes payment within specified time period to the seller via the sellers bank upon presentation of certain documents eg those that reflect the carrying out of sales contracts terms 7 under the bush administrations libyan sanctions policy change announced april 23 2004 tsra requirements longer apply with respect to the financing of sales of agricultural and medical products crs10 addressed this issue in way that would require change to be made to existing regulations members supportive of the financing exemption argued that since congress did not place in the law any restrictions on commercial financing for these countries new administrative regulations should not include restrictions that run counter to the congressional intent to eliminate sanctions on those tools eg credit that can facilitate eligible commercial sales ofacs reported view was that since the thrust of us policy is to restrict currency flows to sanctioned countries it would be burdensome to set up mechanism to allow for the financing of agricultural and medical product sales and thus better not to permit it prohibition on us government assistance for export sales section 908a of tsra prohibits making available any us government assistance including foreign aid credit or guarantees and export assistance for exports to cuba or for commercial exports to iran libya north korea or sudan wording grants the president authority to waive this prohibition for humanitarian reasons or if he determines it is in the national interest to do so with respect to iran libya north korea and sudan this waiver authority does not extend to cuba statutory wording further differentiates among the 5 abovecited countries by applying this prohibition on all exports and not just commercial exports to cuba clarifying language also stipulates that this us government assistance prohibition does not alter modify or otherwise affect certain provisions of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 that authorizes the president to furnish assistance and provide other support for individuals and independent non governmental organizations to support democracybuilding efforts for cuba and that require the president to take all necessary steps to ensure that funds or other assistance is provided to the cuban government in the regulations issued the bush administration chose not to exercise presidential waiver authority on this issue although some members of congress in 1999 and 2000 urged that credit guarantees be made available to facilitate agricultural sales to iran us policy reaffirmed by tsra is to prohibit any government assistance for permitted commercial sales to sanctioned country listed as sponsor of international terrorism this position is primarily based on the statutory prohibition found in section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 22 usc 2371 which tsra reaffirms definition of products covered by exemption compared to ofacs 1999 policy tsra broadens the types of agricultural products covered by the enacted exemption sections 775 and 9021 such products are defined to include any agricultural commodity food feed fiber or livestock and any derived product livestock is defined to include cattle sheep goats swine poultry including eggproducing poultry equine animals used for food or in the production of food fish used for food other animals designated by the secretary of agriculture and insects conferees on october 5 2000 accepted an amendment that added fertilizer and organic fertilizer to the definition of an agricultural commodity exports of these inputs are allowed unless subject to export control under other specified statutes section 9024 and 5 defines medicine and crs11 medical devices referring to terms used in statutes administered by the food and drug administration treasury regulations followed to implement the clinton administrations 1999 policy governing sales to iran libya and sudan listed the bulk agricultural commodities and some food products eligible to be licensed ofacs list encompassed most of the products covered by the 2000enacted definition but did not allow for sales of nonfood commodities like cotton fiber tobacco and wood products treasurys stated rationale for excluding these nonfood commodities was that they could be used for military purposes ofacs regulations did not detail the other food products nor specify any medical product that could be sold and thus required an exporter to apply for license to ascertain whether product could be sold concern about the use of fertilizer and agrichemicals for military purposes was reflected also in ofac regulations which did not allow sales of these items including insecticides and pesticides as agricultural products to sanctioned countries definitions in tsra regulations both commerces bis and treasurys ofac agreed upon common definitions for agricultural and medical products in implementing their respective new export licensing exceptions and requirements based on the statutory language the rules spell out that agricultural commodities include food commodities feed fish shellfish and fish products beer wine and spirits soft drinks livestock fiber including cotton wool and other fibers tobacco and tobacco products wood and wood products including lumber and utility poles seeds for food reproductive materials such as fertilized eggs embryos and semen vitamins and minerals food additives and supplements and bottled drinking water this definition also includes fertilizers and organic fertilizers but excludes furniture made from wood clothing manufactured from plant or animal materials agricultural equipment whether hand tools or motorized equipment pesticides insecticides or herbicides and cosmetics unless derived entirely from plant materials both agencies require sales of three products to meet stringent export control rules fertilizer western red cedar and live horses congressional role in future sanctions on exempted products tsra in effect gives congress veto power over presidents proposal to impose future unilateral agricultural or medical sanction section 903a requires president to first secure congressional approval before he can restrict or prohibit the sale of agricultural and medical products to targeted country for foreign policy or national security reasons it requires the president to report to congress later than 60 days before he plans to impose sanction describing the proposed sanction and the activities by the foreign country or entity that justify the sanction section 904 specifies that the requirement for the president to report to congress on proposed sanction does not apply when the united states is at war or involved militarily against target country when the sanctioned product is controlled under specified export control laws or could be used to facilitate the development or production of chemical biological or nuclear weapon or when it is imposed as part of multilateral sanctions regime or mandatory decision of the united nations security crs12 council section 905 provides that any unilateral agricultural or medical sanction approved by congress described above automatically ends not later than two years after it goes into effect the president may request that congress extend the sanction for another two years the us role in cubas market under tsras policy though sales to iran libya and sudan under the clinton administrations 1999 exemption policy were small relative to their total agricultural imports us farmers commodity groups and agribusiness eyed cuba as promising market calling for broadening of us policy to exempt food from sanctions in cuba they argued that us agriculture had lost out to foreign competitors in making sales to sizable nearby market total cuban agricultural imports averaged about 800 million annually in the 20002002 period according to the food and agriculture organization leading commodities imported in 2002 were rice chicken meat and products wheat and flour whole dry milk lentils and corn food and agricultural imports in recent years have represented 17 of total cuban merchandise imports and have declined as share of total imports since the early 1990s top suppliers in 2002 as cuba took advantage of the us embargo exemption under tsra based on preliminary data were canada the united states france china and brazil in addition cubas tourism industry reportedly imports an additional 100 to 250 million in food products to cover the needs of visiting tourists us agricultural interests argued that exempting agricultural exports from the us embargo on cuba would result in an opening that yields substantial sales various studies projected annual sales could range from 100 million to over 1 billion depending on the time frame looked at and the extent of liberalization that occurred in uscuban trade these interests also held that such policy change will give us exporters particularly of rice and wheat competitive edge if cuba takes advantage of its proximity to buy from its nearest supplier in order to save the cost of transporting commodities and food from its more distant current suppliers france canada argentina cuba reportedly could save up to 100 million in transportation costs if officials decided to buy primarily from us agricultural exporters expectations in 2000 of large immediate us sales to the island were viewed as unrealistic according to other analysts analysts pointed to cubas limited financial resources its reliance on barter and credit transactions to finance agricultural imports its denial of access to us government programs and to all us public and private financing and the possible application of other restrictive rules under current embargo regulations that could hamper such sales they also suggested that it was uncertain that cuba would purchase from the united states pointing out there may be pressure to maintain trade ties with some of its socialist partners supplying such key commodities as rice as well as resistance to relying on just one single supplier some also observed that the cuban government may not have been crs13 prepared for or interested in taking advantage of this possible us trade opening top cuban officials including castro himself initially rejected the enacted measure they strongly criticized its financing travel and other prohibitions as unworkable and insulting they viewed it as tightening rather than an easing of the embargo and stated that cuba will not buy any us product with such conditions in place sales activity to date notwithstanding this position the cuban government on november 13 2001 signaled interest in buying us agricultural commodities to quickly rebuild food reserves damaged or lost due to the devastation caused by hurricane michelle this move followed an earlier us government offer of humanitarian assistance to which cuba responded on november 8 with request that the united states temporarily suspend tsras licensing requirements to purchase foodstuffs and allow cuban vessels to transport them from us ports the state department agreed only to speed up the licensing process and noted some problems might arise if cuban ships were used in late november and early december 2001 negotiations between several us agribusiness firms and alimport cubas food import agency led to the signing of contracts to sell us wheat corn soybeans soymeal soyoil poultry and rice and other food products valued at 35 million the first shipment of corn and poultry arrived in havana on december 13 2001 us farm groups agribusiness firms and antiembargo groups hailed these sales under the new sanctions policy and hoped they would lead to additional sales and represent symbolic beginning of changing relationship respectively though top cuban officials initially stated these cash purchases were one time event this stance changed in the following months additional export sales occurred in spring 2002 and have since continued on regular basis from december 2001 through april 2006 us exporters have shipped to cuba 125 billion in agricultural and food products see legislative developments 109th congress debate over cash in advance payment definition for details on the latest policy developments and congressional debate related to this change in us policy legislative developments 107th congress 20012002 members introduced several bills and amendments in 2001 and 2002 to revise us policy on how food products are handled in sanctions regimes most sought to repeal the export financing and travel prohibitions imposed on cuba by tsra conferees dropped one such provision included in the senates 2002 farm bill the bush administration continued to reiterate that any bills with provisions that relax the cuban trade embargo would be vetoed two bills revisited the broader issue of the parameters and process to be followed to exempt agricultural sales from us sanctions policy bush administration efforts to amend tsra in light of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were reflected in compromise language included in antiterrorism legislation crs14 cubaspecific bills and provisions proposals varied in approach and in scope hr 173 and section 335 of s 1731 the senate agriculture committees farm bill simply would have repealed the prohibition on private us financing of agricultural sales to cuba seven measures section 2h of hr 174 hr 797s 402 section 3f of hr 798s 400 titles i and ii of hr 2138s 1017 section 1f of hr 2662 s 171 and s 239 were broader in their coverage proposing to drop 3 provisions in tsra these are 1 the requirement that eligible exports to cuba be licensed in advance 2 the prohibitions on us government assistancefinancing of food and medical product sales and on private financing of agricultural sales to cuba and 3 the prohibition on tourist travel to cuba some bills would have repealed specific provisions s 239 broadly stated that irrespective of tsra the prohibition or restriction on trade or financial transactions with cuba shall not apply to the export of agricultural and medical products or to travel related to the sale or delivery of these products to cuba additional language found only in hr 797 s 402 hr 798s 400 and s 239 effectively would have repealed the current restriction that ships entering cuba cannot enter us port for six months this would allow such vessels to transport us agricultural and medical shipments to cuba some bills would have retained restrictions or prohibitions on agriculturalmedical product exports to cuba to meet broader export control and national security objectives in most of these bills the referenced provisions were part of broader legislative efforts to modify or terminate some or all aspects of the us embargo on cuba among other recommendations offered to change us policy toward cuba the bipartisan house cuba working group on may 15 2002 proposed 1 allowing the private financing of us agricultural and medical exports and 2 repealing the statutory ban on any ship that visits cuba from calling on an american port for 180 days debate on 2002 farm bill provision the bush administration strongly opposed the senatepassed farm bill provision section 355 of s 1731 that would have repealed the prohibition on private us financing of us sales of agricultural commodities to cuba the administration based its stance on its view that cuba continues to deny basic civil rights to its citizens and rejects global efforts to combat terrorism reflecting this perspective senator bob smith during floor debate offered an amendment to require the president to certify to congress that cubas government is not involved in supporting acts of international terrorism before the cubaspecific prohibition is repealed seconddegree amendment offered by senator torricelli to also require presidential certification that all convicted felons living in cuba have been returned to the united states before the prohibition is removed fell when the senate on december 18 2001 tabled the smith amendment 6133 the senate provision was contentious issue in the subsequent farm bill conference held to resolve differences with the house measure which did not contain comparable provision with reports surfacing that the house leadership would make the final decision on this matter representative dooley one conferee from the house agriculture committee on april 17 2002 offered motion to instruct house conferees to accept the senate position following debate on the motion on april 18 the house on roll call vote of 273143 agreed to this motion to instruct non binding on conferees on april 23 in final action senate conferees receded to the house position leaving the private financing prohibition in place crs15 amendment to fy2003 treasury appropriations bill representative jerry moran on july 23 2002 proposed an indirect approach to relax the prohibitions and stipulations on private commercial agricultural and medical product sales to cuba his amendment section 646 to hr 5120 fy2003 treasury appropriations accepted by voice vote would have effectively cut off funding for one year to treasurys ofac for administering only those tasks involving the private financing prohibition and current shipping restrictions among other cuban embargo regulations that apply to agricultural and medical product sales it would not apply to tsras licensing requirements that cover agricultural sales to cuba because they are administered by commerces bis which is not funded by the treasury appropriations bill final action on this measure did not occur before congress adjourned in the 108th congress house and senate leadership dropped the ofac provision in hjres 2 the omnibus spending bill that also funded treasury operations in fy2003 in sending this measure to the floor for action in january 2003 administrations position on may 20 2002 in major cuba policy speech president bush reiterated his opposition to any repeal of the prohibition on private financing of agricultural sales stating it would just be foreign aid program in disguise which would benefit the current regime bush stated he would veto legislation that relaxes the embargo in any way until the cuban government introduced series of specified reforms secretary of state powell and treasury secretary oneill followed up in july 11 2002 letter to house appropriators to state they would recommend presidential veto of any bill that eased restrictions on trade and travel to cuba bill dealing with other sanctioned countries one measure seeking to amend tsra was broader in the range of countries to be covered s 171 would have repealed the tsras prohibition on us government assistance and financing of sales not just with respect to cuba but also with respect to iran libya north korea and sudan proposed changes to overall food sanctions exemption policy three legislative initiatives to address broad us policy on the issue of exempting agricultural exports from export control or sanctions regimes title iv of s 149 as introduced proposed to exempt agricultural commodities medicine and medical supplies from export controls imposed for foreign policy reasons language specified that this exemption would not apply to any such items subject to national security export controls imposed under title ii of this bill or listed on the us munitions list nor to their export to country against which an embargo is in effect under the trading with the enemy act cuba and north korea second during senate banking committee markup on march 22 2001 all of title iv was deleted concerned the executive branch might exercise the bills broad authorities in ways that undercut tsras intent to exempt food and medical products from unilateral sanctions senator roberts succeeded in including language in managers amendment that addressed this issue third section 603 as adopted by the senate in early september 2001 stated that s 149 does not authorize export controls on food for national security purposes it also stated that such controls cannot be used to restrict food exports for foreign policy reasons unless congress in advance approves such action following tsras provisions and explicitly stated that nothing crs16 in s 149 authorized the exercise of authority to restrict agricultural and medical product exports contrary to any tsra provision amendments to tsra in antiterrorism legislation the package of antiterrorism measures pl 10756 hr 3162 signed into law on october 26 2001 amended some tsra provisions the compromise struck between the bush administration and key senators modified one circumstance under which tsras foodmedical exemption would not apply codified that agricultural and medical product sales to the talibancontrolled area of afghanistan are subject to tsras export licensing requirements that apply to cuba and to governments of other countries determined to be sponsors of international terrorism and expressly allows eligible export sales to be made also to any other entity in syria or north korea without the need for an exporter to secure license other provisions stated that tsra provision limits the application of criminal or civil penalties on those who unlawfully engage in the export of agricultural and medical products to designated foreign organizations groups persons or entities nor affects the statutory prohibitions against providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations 108th congress 20032004 members introduced seven measures and offered amendments to spending bills to relax tsras cubaapplicable provisions in the 20032004 period conferees dropped two provisions in fy2005 spending bills that would have relaxed tsra restrictions cubaspecific bills none of the measures introduced pertinent to cuba were enacted during the 108th congress hr 187 proposed to repeal tsras prohibition on the use of private financing for agricultural and medical product exports to cuba hr 188 and s 403 were broader in scope repealing the private financing prohibition ban on travel and licensing requirement provisions among numerous provisions intended to end the us trade embargo on cuba hr 1698 and hr 3422 would have repealed or superseded all tsra provisions that apply to cuba respectively hr 4457s 2449 proposed to terminate tsras restrictions with respect to cuba among other features of the us embargo on cuba unless congress passes resolution to renew them opponents of liberalizing trade with cuba introduced hr 3670 to penalize us exporters and others who sell products or services to cuba if such trade is explicitly conditioned on their lobbying congress to remove trade and travel restrictions on cuba the bills intent is to address us farm organization reportedly agreeing in memorandum of understanding8 to press congress to engage with cuba and to seek repeal of these restrictions in return for cuban purchases of 15 million worth of agricultural products from indianabased businesses other members indicated their intent to introduce related bills or offer amendments to amend tsra to 1 allow farm machinery sales to cuba on cashonly basis and 2 8 cuba trader house members seek to punish tradeforlobby deals between cuba and us entities december 8 2003 crs17 repeal us travel restrictions viewed by us agricultural groups among others as way for cuba to generate dollar earnings to purchase us food products9 provisions in appropriations bills in midnovember 2003 conferees on the fy2004 agriculture appropriations measure hr 2673 part of the fy2004 omnibus spending package dropped senate amendment section 760 of s 1427 that would have facilitated the process of securing permission to travel to cuba under tsra to promote and sell us agricultural and medical products there the amendment was added by voice vote on july 17 2003 during senate appropriations committee markup of this spending bill senator dorgans intent was to address such situations as ofacs decision in june 2003 to deny the license application of firm seeking to organize food and agribusiness exhibition in havana in january 2004 the white house opposed this provision arguing that it would weaken current sanctions imposed against the cuban government its position laid out in its statement of administration policy on s 1427 is that travel to cuba should be further policed to ensure that those traveling there are doing so for legal purposes and not simply using legal categories to disguise travel for other purposes an identical provision was included in the fy2005 agriculture appropriations bill section 776 of s 2803 introduced by senator dorgan during markup this amendment was adopted by the senate appropriations agriculture subcommittee by voice vote on september 8 language would require the treasurys ofac to give general licenses for us exporters and others seeking to travel there on eligible business current policy requires them to apply for specific license for each prospective trip amendment supporters argued that the bush administration has used the rules to delay or to refuse to issue travel licenses to those seeking to make farm sales in cuba seeking to head off possible similar initiative in the house in june when its agriculture appropriations was considered the administration stated the bill would be vetoed if this provision was included administration officials argued the current licensing process helps to ensure that travel to cuba serves appropriate purposes and that sales to cuba are done within the boundaries of the law just before conferees completed work in november 2004 the director of the white house office of management and budget signaled that including in the omnibus appropriations measure hr 4818 any provision to weaken existing sanctions against cuba such as restrictions on commercial exports of agricultural and medical goods would result in presidential veto in final action appropriators dropped this provision from the bill an amendment to the fy2005 transportationtreasury spending bill section 649 of hr 5025 adopted by the house during floor debate on september 22 2004 would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to implement any usimposed sanction on private commercial sales of agricultural commodities to cuba representative waters its sponsor stated that tsras financing restrictions on these sales make trade unnecessarily expensive bureaucratic and complicated and argued that with their removal small businesses would be in better position to 9 for additional information on legislative efforts to amend tsras restrictions on travel to cuba see crs report rl31139 cuba us restrictions on travel and remittances by mark p sullivan crs18 increase us market share an opponent acknowledged that since us agricultural sales are now legal exporters have indicated they like to be paid under the current policy in place allowing financing for such sales would simply reward the dictatorship he argued conferees also dropped this provision from the same fy2005 omnibus spending package considered during the november 2004 lame duck session 109th congress 20052006 debate over cash in advance payment definition concerned that some reported late payments from cuba constituted form of financing and possibly violated tsras financing prohibition treasurys ofac on november 12 2004 instructed us banks to stop all transfers of cuban payments to us exporters while it investigated recent sales transactions ofac subsequently released some payments on casebycase basis which allowed banks to forward funds to exporters the bush administration also indicated plans to announce new rules on the payment issue by late december 2004 in letters to the secretary of treasury and secretary of state in late november and early december 2004 some members of congress questioned or expressed opposition to the administrations plans they noted that the change being considered to require seller to receive payment before shipment leaves us port would be much more restrictive than current practice and would impede agricultural sales to cuba one senator argued that more restrictive rule would constitute new sanction that in itself would require congressional approval under tsra provisions in order to take effect separately coalition of agricultural groups and businesses in december 8 2004 letter to president bush stated that us exporters have followed explicitly both the letter and spirit of the law in selling food products to cuba they argued the proposed restrictive guideline would run counter to the norms of international trade which simply require payment to be received prior to the shipments release to the buyer eg payment before transfer of title to the buyer even if the ship is docked in havana to signal continued opposition to the administrations intent to change the timing of payment for us agricultural product sales to cuba and to amend certain tsra provisions some members of the house and senate introduced identical measures hr 719s 328 in early february 2005 section 5 would clarify that payment of cash in advance means payment by the purchaser eg the cuban government and the sellers receipt of such payment before the products title and control is transferred and released respectively to the purchaser hr 1339s 634 would only redefine this term using language identical to section 5 in hr 719s 328 with treasurys publication on february 25 2005 of the rule to require payment before shipment from us port with an effective date of march 25 some members responded they would explore all available options to change this policy or to block senate consideration of significant treasury nominees one legislative initiative to accomplish this in samdt 281 and samdt 282 is pending in senate consideration of s 600 foreign affairs authorization act for fy2006 and fy2007 also added as an amendment to the fy2006 transportationtreasury appropriations bill section 945 of hr 3058 as passed by the house and section 721 as passed by the senate was prohibition on using funds to implement ofacs rule with the white house threatening to veto the bill if included conferees dropped this provision crs19 in the enacted measure this occurred after almost 40 house members urged conferees to retain it five of the 23 senate conferees signed the conference report noting their opposition to dropping the cuba trade language on june 14 2006 identical language was added by voice vote as an amendment to the fy2007 transportationtreasury appropriations bill section 950 of hr 5576 farm groups and agribusiness firms in letter to four house members on june 27 2005 called for restoring the option to allow receipt of payment before title is transferred they presented data on the decline in us agricultural sales this year compared to 2004 because of the ofac rule and detailed the loss of sales of rice and other commodities to such other countries as vietnam and china ofacs announcement on july 29 2005 allowing for the shipment of goods once the sellers agent if located in third country receives payment from the cuban buyer this could make it slightly easier for some us sellers to make sales according to some analysts others question whether this clarification will make any difference opponents of the rule have signaled their intent to continue to work with congress to overturn it this slight shift in policy prompted senator baucus to lift his hold on six treasury nominees who were then confirmed by the senate later that day though exports in the first four months after ofacs rule change april to july 2005 were below 2004 levels exports since august 2005 have been higher in all months but one compared to yearearlier levels this may be attributable to ofacs rule modification in late july 2005 and reported willingness by alimport to work with us exporters under these new payment procedures for other versions of this document see
