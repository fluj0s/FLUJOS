leelanau talk blog how to beat the filter november 16th 2008 tags filter fortiguard leelanau school proxies proxy tor leave comment trackback its unfortunate that this guide ever had to be written that we ever had to use proxies in the first place that anybody ever thought we werent smart enough to decide for ourselves what was right and wrong and that somebody ever thought censorship was good idea unfortunately the world we currently live in has found it acceptable to censor internet access to kids because we arent smart or responsible enough to use it this guide will debunk some popular myths about web filters and show you how to get past them id like to take some time to quickly destroy some arguments that people use to install filters on internet 1 filters only block bad sites this is absolutely not true and anybody who has ever been behind filter can tell you that filters block thousands and thousands of legitimate academic sites while i was at leelanau i ran into multiple sites day that i needed for school some of which i was able to get unblocked 2 filters stop kids from seeing bad content this is also absolutely not true as anybody under the age of 35 can tell you filters are easy to get past and only serve as an inconvenience to people trying to use the internet everybodys definition of bad is different so this isnt really good point to argue on 3 there are places out there on the internet that tell kids how to do bad things we have to stop them well the good thing is that you cant if you really think its good idea to censor the internet then you should also stick to your word and censor mail books and all communications between people we dont do that because its incredibly orwellian and an infringement on numerous human rights for some reason people think the internet is an exception laws that have tried to implement web filtering on national scale such as copa have been shot down by courts as unconstitutional there might be things on the internet that you find offensive in fact there are certainly things you would find offensive if you see something offensive you just move on as if you has heard somebody on the street saying offensive things chances are if you find something offensive your kids will find it offensive too i dont think nazi hate sites are cool either but they have their free speech rights one of the main reason that hate groups are able to flourish is that information is so tightly regulated if people were able to look at different sources and see the facts nobody would be duped into those kinds of beliefs 4 theyre my kids i should be able to control what they see online the problem is that your kids are human beings which means they have human rights these rights include the right to free speech if you wont let them see things theyll go and get those things from friends etc and friends arent always the most reliable source of information if you want your kids to be able to say to those bad things on the internet the best course of action is to show your kids why those things are bad if you cant make an argument to prove this maybe you need to reconsider why you think those things are bad 5 if we dont censor myspace my kids will get abducted by pedophiles again youd have to censor mail telephone calls and conversations if you truly believed that the internet is tool just like the written word or any other tool and it can be used responsibly or irresponsibly kids these days are very aware of the risks of giving out their personally identifiable information thanks to lot of education on this topic so there isnt lot to worry about instead of shutting down the site or making your kids turn blind eye to it have conversation with them about how to protect themselves online and why they shouldnt give out their information 6 isnt the school required by law to put filters on the internet there is law that requires them to do that although installing them does earn the school some fancy tax breaks remember as thomas jefferson said freedom requires eternal vigilance 7 isnt it illegal to give out these proxies isnt it illegal to bypass filters not unless your hacking into the school mainframe and elevating your user account to administrator you can do illegal things with proxies like watching porn before you turn 18 or hacking but proxies arent illegal on their own this is like how you could run over somebody with car illegal or go to the grocery store with your car not illegal 8 the blocklists used by filters are reviewed by humans so theyre 100 accurate ok now think about this if human beings really added all those sites to the filter then theres way they could block even half of the bad content on the internet these filters are mainly created by machines which is why you have thousands of false postitives 9 but kids will use facebookmyspace to harass each other ive seen it happen as long as there are stupid people they will do stupid things during the middle ages we probably harassed people with wax tablets now we do it online or in newspapers or by word of mouth for one if they do it online theres clear record that they did it and its easy to get them in trouble if they whispered it to somebody theres way to prove that so consider internet harassment to be blessing in reality though people can harass others with any tool available at their disposal such as their voice their writing their facebook and even their hand signals facebook clearly isnt the culprit here the culprit is the person doing the harassing 10 if filter wrongly blocks something why dont you just tell the school that can sometimes work as ive gotten dozens of sites unblocked but its an incredible inconvenience this thefilterisperfect assumption doesnt work and ends up leaving your network admin with dizzying list of sites to look at and unblock its much easier to just use proxies doing this also allows the school to build profile of the sites your looking at they already do this through logging and in all reality 99 of it isnt their business it only becomes their business when you break the law on their internet connection peacefire group that distributes proxies for students also has wonderful piece on whey we shouldnt censor kids at school at httppeacefireorginfowhyshtml there are three different types of filters that you will encounter called whitelists blacklists and keyword filters whitelist filters have list of sites that the filter provider school fortiguard etc have determined to be acceptable for you to view by design whitelist filters block the majority of the internet as well as all new sites the leelanau school moved from blacklist filter to whitelist filter in 2007 blacklist filters have list of sites that have been deemed bad these like all filters also block tons of academic sites everything that hasnt been blocked is automatically unblocked keyword filters usually have blacklist in them but they operate by inspecting the pages you view for keywords such as proxy pipe bomb porn etc as i said earlier the school uses whitelist filter which is probably the most restrictive type as anybody who has spent five minutes on the school internet can tell you its almost worthless because of the vast number of sites that it blocks beating the filter web proxies this is probably the most common way to beat filters you visit site such as httpwwwstupidcensorshipcom where you type in the name of the site you want to visit such as httpwwwmyspacecom and then it lets you through these work by obscuring your traffic web surfing so the filter cant see whats going on the web filter thinks youre just connecting to httpwwwstupidcensorshipcom instead of httpwwwmyspacecom these can get blocked meaning you have to find new ones all the time which can be really difficult if all of yours get blocked at once if you use this method its good to have one or two backups in case they block one of yours i suggest you subscribe to the mailing list at httpwwwpeacefireorg which will send you new proxies fairly regularly right to your email httpwwwproxyorg also has fairly exhaustive list of proxies available beating the filter tor this is the best way to beat filters tor is program that has huge list of proxies it can send you through it goes through this list until it finds some that are unblocked and then it send you through them automatically some of these proxies are in other countries so you might end up at the german google but youll get used to that fairly quickly it can also be slow at times but it works 99 of the time you can get tor by going to httpswwwtorprojectorg click on the download tab go down to tor browser bundle and download the latest version run the file you downloaded follow the instructions on screen and youre set you can even install it to flash drive and take it with you its important to remember that using these programs or bypassing the filter is usually violation of your schools computer use policy i dont know anybody at leelanau who has gotten in trouble specifically and only for bypassing the filter but i guess theres first time for everything everybody does it so theyd have to get everybody in trouble possibly related postsdecember 8 2008 bread barnovember 19 2008 welcome to the leelanau talk blognovember 14 2008 my prefect resignation letter 75 bucks for thumbtacks
