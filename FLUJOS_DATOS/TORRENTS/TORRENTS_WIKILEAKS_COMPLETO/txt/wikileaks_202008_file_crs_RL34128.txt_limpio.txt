2008 david randall peterman analyst in transportation policy resources science and industry division federal railroad safety programs selected issues in proposed reauthorization legislation summary the federal railroad administration fra is the federal agency primarily responsible for safety in the rail industry fras safety programs were last authorized in 1994 their authorization expired in 1998 most measures of rail safety have improved significantly since fras last authorization including the number of grade crossing collisions and fatalities and the number of employee injuries and deaths these improvements came while the amount of both freight and passenger rail activity on the nations rail infrastructure was increasing however the improvements in safety measures have leveled off in recent years given significant projected continued increases in freight and passenger rail activity in the coming decade there is concern that without additional efforts some of the gains of the past decade may be lost among the issues that have dominated debate thus far are alleged shortcomings in the rail hours of service statute 49 usc 21101 et seq that limit the acts effectiveness in preventing fatigue among train operating crews which may be contributing factor in significant number of train accidents related issue is limbo time time that train operating crews spend on shift but not engaged in safetyrelated duties after they have reached the limit of their shift under the rail hours of service act which also contributes to fatigue unlike the hours of service rules for other transportation modes the rail hours of service rules are set in law and cannot be altered through the regulatory process other prominent issues have included implementation by railroads of automated collisionprevention technology in trains the adequacy of fra track inspections and safety at highwayrail grade crossings the house on october 17 2007 and senate on august 1 2008 passed differing versions of hr 2095 the federal railroad safety improvement act on september 24 2008 the house agreed to the senate amendment with an amendment pursuant to hres 1492 this amended version of hr 2095 incorporated another piece of legislation the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 differing versions of which were previously passed by both the senate and house as s 294 which reauthorizes amtrak and federal passenger rail programs further action is now up to the senate according to press reports and information at the house transportation and infrastructure committees website the amended hr 2095 includes provisions that would increase the length of the minimum rest period under the rail hours of service act and give fra the authority to further increase the minimum rest period through regulation increase the number of fra safety inspectors and mandate implementation of positive train control it would also authorize about 13 billion in funding for amtrak and passenger rail activities and direct the department of transportation dot to solicit bits to develop and operate highspeed rail lines in 11 corridors including the northeast corridor for further

federal agency primarily responsible for promoting and regulating the safety of the railroad industry the fras rail safety programs were last authorized in 1994 pl 103440 that authorization expired at the end of fy1998 fras safety programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriations bills reauthorization of the fra is taking place in context of improvement in most measures of rail safety however there continue to be around 1000 railrelated deaths each year the trend of improvement in some rail safety measures such as train accidents and deaths in gradecrossing collisions has leveled off in recent years and with forecasts of significant growth in rail traffic in the future there is concern over the need to make more progress in rail safety several hearings have been held in the 110th congress in both the house and senate on reauthorization of fra an administration proposal to reauthorize fra has been introduced by request as the federal railroad safety accountability and improvement act hr 1516 and s 918 action has been taken on this legislation in either the house or the senate representative james oberstar chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee has introduced reauthorization proposal the federal railroad safety improvement act of 2007 hr 2095 managers amendment was adopted with amendments and was ordered to be reported out of the transportation and infrastructure committee on june 14 2007 the amended bill was reported by the committee on september 19 2007 and was approved by the house of representatives on october 17 2007 senator frank lautenberg chairman of the senate commerce committees subcommittee on surface transportation and merchant marine infrastructure safety and security has also introduced reauthorization proposal the railroad safety enhancement act of 2007 s 1889 managers amendment was adopted and ordered to be reported out of the commerce committee on september 27 2007 the bill was reported out on march 3 2008 the senate substituted s 1889 with amendments for the text of hr 2095 and passed it by unanimous consent on august 1 2008 this report describes the major issues in the debate over reauthorization of fra in the 110th congress it also describes the major provisions of hr 2095 as passed by the house and as passed by the senate these include changes to the rail hours crs2 of service law including limitations on limbo time imposition of deadline for the implementation of positive train control by railroads and new requirements for highwayrail grade crossings policy context the nations railroad sector consists of both freight rail companies and those passenger rail systems that use the nations intercity rail network ie both amtrak and commuter rail systems the sector consists of roughly 570 freight railroads and 118 passenger commuter and excursion railroads these organizations employ around 235000 people and operate roughly 220000 miles of track the vast majority of the rail sector consists of freight railroad operations the freight railroad industry is divided into three classes based on operating revenues there are only 7 railroads in the top category class i for which the threshold is roughly 320 million in annual revenues but those 7 railroads represent about 70 of freight rail industry employment and own roughly 70 of total us rail mileage the staggers rail act of 1980 pl 96448 largely deregulated the freight rail industry since that time there has been extensive consolidation of the industry employment has been reduced from 480000 1980 to 235000 2006 while freight revenue tonmiles have increased from 918 million 1980 to 196 trillion 2006 the miles of road operated1 in freight service have been reduced from 177000 1980 to 141000 2005 while the number of trainmiles operated has increased from 718 million 1980 to 811 million 2006 the number of passengermiles has increased from 12 billion 1980 to 16 billion 20062 during this period the overall safety record of the industry has shown great improvement between 1980 and 1994 the annual rate of train accidents that is the number of accidents divided by the number of miles traveled by trains declined from almost 12 accidents per million train miles to just under 4 per million train miles however since 1994 the improvement has leveled off and the rate of train accidents has varied from 35 to 44 per million train miles since then3 in addition to this lack of improvement in the train accident rate several recent serious accidents have raised concerns about the need for further improvement in rail safety4 the numbers of 1 the total length of the freight rail network excluding sidings and yard tracks and not counting whether there is more than one set of tracks track miles will exceed miles of road operated 2 association of american railroads yearbook of railroad facts various years 3 federal railroad administration railroad safety statistics annual report various years 4 these accidents included collision between two freight trains in macdona texas in june 2004 resulting in chlorine gas release that killed three people and caused at least forty others to be treated for exposure collision between freight train and parked rail cars in graniteville south carolina in january 2005 that also resulted in chlorine gas release killing 9 people and leading to the evacuation of over 5000 residents and collision between commuter train and parked car in glendale california in january 2005 that resulted in 11 deaths and over 200 injuries crs3 gradecrossing collisions and resulting injuries and deaths declined until 2003 but has shown little improvement since then most railrelated deaths are to pedestrians trespassing on rail lines and motorists colliding with trains at highway rail grade crossings while there are nearly 1000 railrelated deaths each year only around 2030 rail employees are killed while on duty each year and railroads have lower employee injury rates than other modes of transportation and most other major industries fra classifies the causes of train accidents into five categories human factors track and structures equipment signal and train control and miscellaneous of these human factors and track are responsible for the majority of train accidents 5 examples of human factor causes of accidents include improperly positioning the switches that determine which track train will follow the cause of the graniteville sc accident moving rail cars without checking for safe conditions in the vicinity and leaving rail cars in position that blocks track examples of track conditions that lead to accidents include defective joint bars that connect one piece of rail to the next defective or ineffective crossties that maintain the proper alignment of the parallel rails that form the track and broken or worn switches without further reductions in the rate of train accidents the number of train accidents and resulting deaths and injuries is likely to grow due to expected increases in train traffic the department of transportation dot has estimated that between 1998 and 2020 the amount of freight moved by rail measured by weight will increase by roughly 506 also many communities are interested in establishing or expanding already existing commuter rail operations which generally operate on the freight rail network to provide transportation alternatives and manage congestion thus the number of train miles on the nations freight rail network is likely to significantly increase in the coming years if train accident rates do not improve this may lead to increased numbers of accidents injuries and deaths fras role in rail safety fras role in rail safety is threefold to assess the safety of rail operations to promulgate regulations to promote costeffective improvements in safety standards and to enforce compliance with federal rail safety laws and regulations these regulations address such topics as track condition passenger and freight equipment signal and train control systems maintenance of active warning devices at highway rail grade crossings accident reporting alcohol and drug testing operating rules and practices and many others fra also enforces the hazardous materials regulations prescribed by dots pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as they apply to rail transportation 5 for 2006 fra estimated that track conditions were the primary cause of 36 of train accidents and human factors were the primary cause of 35 of train accidents fra safety statistics accidentincident overview 2006 6 federal highway administration freight analysis framework fhwaop03006 february 2002 cited in congressional budget office freight rail transportation long term issues january 2006 pp 56 crs4 fra is relatively small agency in relation to the size of the railroad industry it oversees it has around 800 employees of whom 650 are classified as safety personnel including around 430 inspectors supplemented by 160 state inspectors who work with fra on safety oversight of railroads to oversee an industry with over 235000 employees 220000 miles of track 158000 signals and switches and over 13 million freight cars and other equipment in service although fra and the state investigators conduct some 63000 inspections each year these inspections cover only small fraction of the operations of railroads each year7 to make the most of its resources fra focuses inspections at locations judged as likely to have safety problems based on accident data and results of previous inspections fras annual budget for its core safety responsibilities that is excluding funding for grants to amtrak is roughly 200 million fras new initiatives to promote safety fras traditional approach to safety is to regulate the design of rail structures and the behavior of rail workers then to use inspections to enforce compliance with the specific standards the government accountability office gao has noted that these inspections focus on compliance with minimum standards and are not designed to determine how well railroads are managing safety risks throughout their systems that could lead to accidents8 in response to reviews of its work by the dot inspector general and the office of management and budget fra has begun to adopt new approaches to supplement its traditional safety program these include efforts to target its inspections using more quantitative assessment of risk as well as new initiatives that make use of risk management approaches to improving safety for example fra has implemented confidential close call reporting program pilot project this project allows employees of participating railroads to report close calls that is incidents where an accident could have occurred but didnt the information on the close calls is kept confidential so that both employees and the participating railroads are shielded from punishment for providing the information team composed of representatives of the participating railroads labor organizations fra and the bureau of transportation statistics will review the information to identify safety problems similar program has been in place in the aviation industry for many years and has contributed to improvements in safety there fras national rail safety action plan in response to concerns raised by the accidents experienced in 2004 and early 2005 in may 2005 fra instituted new safety action plan to improve rail safety the rail safety action plan includes initiatives to reduce train accidents caused by human factors 7 fra estimates that its inspectors are able to inspect only about 02 of railroads operations each year based on an estimate of the amount of activity such as train movements on each us railroad government accountability office rail safety the federal railroad administration is taking steps to better target its oversight but assessments of results is needed to determine impact gao07149 january 2007 p 5 8 ibid p 5 crs5 reduce employee fatigue improve track safety improve hazardous materials safety and emergency preparedness strengthen fras safety compliance program and increase highwayrail grade crossing safety according to gao fras rail safety action plan provides reasonable framework for guiding the agencys efforts9 since the plan was introduced relatively recently most of its initiatives have not yet been fully implemented and their overall impact on safety will probably not be known for several years some of the initiatives rely on voluntary actions by railroads such as the adoption of worker fatigue model to help railroads schedule the duty periods of train crews so as to reduce worker fatigue thus their implementation is uncertain gao noted that while fra has goals for its safety efforts eg to reduce train accidents caused by human factors it does not have measures of the direct results of its inspection and enforcement programs that would show their contribution to achieving those goals neither has fra evaluated the effectiveness of its enforcement program in achieving its goals selected reauthorization issues the major issues in the current reauthorization debate include addressing employee fatigue through changes to the federal rail hours of service legislation implementing new train control technology that promotes safety improving the condition of track and improving safety at highwayrail grade crossings train operator fatigue in the rail industry which operates heavy machinery in all conditions around the clock the impact of employee fatigue on safety is an everpresent concern the fra estimates that fatigue is at least contributing factor in 25 of serious train accidents that are caused by human factors the national transportation safety board ntsb has identified fatigue as factor in at least 18 rail accidents since 198410 and notes that given the difficulty of identifying fatigue as cause or contributor to accidents the number of accidents due to fatigue is likely to be underestimated11 ntsb has had operator fatigue on its list of most wanted transportation safety improvements since it began keeping such list in 199012 9 ibid p 4 10 statement of joseph h boardman administrator federal railroad administration us department of

congress enacted legislation in 1907 to limit the amount of time certain rail workers such as train operating personnel and signalmen can work at one stretch and to specify the minimum amount of rest they must be provided before reporting for work again13 these limits are enacted in law14 unlike the hours of service limits for workers in other transportation modes which are set through the regulatory process therefore unlike for other modes the rail hours of service limits cannot be changed by dot through the regulatory process the rail hours of service law has not been substantially changed since 1969 under the current law train operating crews and signalmen can work maximum of 12 hours after which they must be given at least 10 hours rest however if they work less than 12 hours they are only required to be given 8 hours of rest15 under these rules train crew worker can work 432 hours month this compares to maximum work schedule of 100 hours in month for commercial pilot 260 hours in month for commercial truck drivers and 360 hours in month for licensed maritime workers aboard vessels under 100 tons when at sea16 most rail workers do not work anywhere near the theoretical maximum of 432 hours according to association of american railroads aar data from several railroads collected in 19981999 the average work schedule for train engine and yard employees was in the range of 125 to 175 hours month with 17 working more than 200 hours in month17 fewer than 1 worked more than 300 hours in month both fra and the ntsb have testified that the current rail hours of service regime is antiquated and does not reflect current understanding of the causes of and 13 the rail hours of service act regulates the maximum time that can be worked by employees engaged in or connected with the movement of train including locomotive engineers conductors signalmen and dispatchers maintenance of way workers who maintain and repair track and other structures carmen who inspect and repair rail cars other shop crafts and contractors who perform signal duties are not covered by the act and thus are not limited in the amount of time they can work 14 at 49 usc 21101 through 21108 15 in emergencies all of these employees can be required to work up to an additional 4 hours per shift 16 national transportation safety board evaluation of us department of transportation efforts in the 1990s to address operator fatigue ntsbsr9901 1999 p 2 revisions to the hours of service rules for commercial truck drivers in 2005 lowered the maximum to 240 hours in month james brunkenhoefer united transportation union testimony before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials february 13 2007 p 8 17 edward r hamberger president chief executive officer association of american railroads before the united states house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials hearing on fatigue in the rail industry february 13 2007 p 7 aar noted that according to recent analysis the average hours worked per year for train and engine employees increased only slightly between 19981999 and 2005 and thus they believe the percentages cited are still valid crs7 effective countermeasures for fatigue the fra has testified that the limitations in the time that can be worked under the hours of service law although ordinarily observed do not seem adequate to effectively control fatigue18 the ntsb has made several recommendations to dot over the years to change the rail hours of service act but dot has not been able to respond to these recommendations because the rules are set in the statutes among the issues that have been raised regarding the shortcomings of the current hours of service rule are inadequate rest periods and schedules that conflict with circadian rhythms inadequate rest periods while workers are required to have at least eight hours off duty between shifts that means that the worker has eight hours to commute home enjoy any leisure time take care of any personal tasks that need to be done rest then commute back to the work site moreover the employee may not know whether they will have to return to work in 8 hours or whether they will have longer period to rest if they are called to return to work in 8 hours the call to report to work which is required by labor agreements to come early enough to give the employee time to get to work may come as much as 2 hours in advance of the time to report to work which could be only 6 hours after the employee left work at the end of their previous shift thus worker could even under ideal circumstances away from the job have as little as 5 to 6 hours of undisturbed rest before returning to work the difficulties created by the relatively short length of the minimum offduty period set by the hours of service act can be exacerbated by the uncertainty of rail employee work schedules it may be difficult for rail employees to make effective use of their available rest time between shifts because when they leave work at the end of shift train crews do not always know when they will next have to report to work the fra has testified that crews of freight trains rarely have predictable work schedules the united transportation union has testified that the majority of train crews are subject to call with little notice19 this uncertainty makes it difficult for train crews to know how to make the best use of their offduty time this uncertainty of employees work schedules is due in part to labor agreements which affect the work scheduling practices of railroads these agreements prioritize the availability of employees for work based on factors such as seniority employees who are called to report to work when they feel they have not had adequate rest can decline the call but may face disciplinary action if they do so conflict with circadian rhythms researchers have learned that human beings like most mammals sleep and wake in cycle approximately 24 hours in 18 statement of joseph h boardman administrator federal railroad administration us department of transportation before the united states house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials hearing on the reauthorization of the federal rail safety program january 30 2007 p 5 19 testimony of james m brunkenhoefer national legislative director united transportation union before the united states house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials hearing on fatigue in the railroad industry february 13 2007 p 5 crs8 length known as circadian rhythm rapid changes in persons circadian pattern of sleep and wakefulness disrupt many physiological functions and may impair their performance the work schedules permitted under the current hours of service rule may in certain instances conflict with employees circadian rhythms making it more difficult for them to get adequate rest under the current regulations rail workers can work 8 hours and rest 8 hours and maintain that schedule indefinitely thus one day they might be resting from midnight to 8 am the next day from 4 pm to midnight the next day from 8 am to 4 pm and the next day back to midnight to 8 am backwardrotating schedule that never allows the workers to establish circadian rhythm current efforts to address fatigue fra has adapted model developed by researchers working with the us military that can estimate the degree of fatigue likely to be experienced by person based on such factors as the time of day the amount of sleep they last got when that sleep occurred and how long the person has been awake since then fra has tested this model against record of crew work schedules and found that it is useful in predicting when an employee may be fatigued to the point of increased risk of contributing to an accident fra is encouraging rail companies to use this model to inform their crew scheduling practices fra is also encouraging and supporting efforts to address sleep disorders among rail employees railroads and rail labor have cooperated in efforts to address fatigue for example the bnsf railway company provides train crews 14 hours of undisturbed rest after working 8 hours csx transportation provides 10hour period of undisturbed rest as well as fixed workrest schedules in some locations20 however efforts by rail management and rail labor to address fatigue issues have often achieved limited success factors that have constrained the success of the various initiatives include the variability in demand for rail services which can increase the need for rail labor more quickly than employees can be added staffing and retention issues that have affected the supply of rail labor and provisions in collective bargaining agreements which may make fatigue management practice mandatory in one location and optional in another even within the same railroad according to rail labor representatives programs to provide more predictable work schedules are currently covering more than 2 of affected employees21 also even successful voluntary programs are subject to being changed or eliminated as conditions change in the industry more fundamental difficulty facing efforts to address fatigue is that both rail managers and rail workers have incentives to maintain the status quo regarding rail hours of service for managers the current system allows more flexibility in 20 federal railroad administration us department of transportation sectionbysection analysis of the federal railroad safety

transportation union us house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials hearing on reauthorization of the federal rail safety program may 8 2007 p 7 crs9 scheduling employees for work than any likely alternative for workers the current system provides the opportunity to work more hours and thus earn more income than any likely alternative for these reasons voluntary efforts to address fatigue are likely to face much resistance another difficulty in attempting to address fatigue is the degree to which the current hours of service regime has become intertwined with the contractual arrangements that have been negotiated over decades by rail labor and management these labor agreements resulting from collective bargaining often include provisions that affect how often and under what circumstances employees can work changes in the hours of service regime may affect the impact of these provisions and thus upset the balance of interests achieved through long negotiation limbo time limbo time refers to situation where train operating crew has reached the limit of the amount of time it is allowed to work at one stretch under the hours of service law 12 hours but has not yet reached the location where it is to be released from duty in such situation the crew is required to stop the train and not engage in safetyrelated duties but it is not allowed to leave the train until replacement crew arrives at which time the original crew can be transported to final release point the time the crew spends being transported to its final release point is neither onduty time for purposes of the hours of service law and so not violation of the hours of service law nor offduty time and so does not count against the amount of offduty time the crew is required to be given in order to rest after their shift hence limbo time the train crews are generally paid for limbo time but there is concern about its impact on employee fatigue the minimum rest period currently required after 12hour shift may not be sufficient to recover from shift that was more than 12 hours long in some cases much more due to the addition of limbo time limbo time was created in 1969 amendments to the rail hours of service law prior to that change the time the original crew spent being transported to its final release point was considered offduty rest time rail labor requested that the transportation time be considered as onduty time but railroads objected that that change would create increased scheduling difficulties for them since they would have to arrange to stop the trains even further from the prearranged destination and have the original crew spend more time being transported to its release point limbo time was created to ensure that train crews offduty period did not begin until they were truly off duty so that they had the opportunity to rest during their rest period while still providing railroads operational flexibility without endangering safety fra has also interpreted the time the original crew spends waiting with the train for the arrival of transportation to its final release point as limbo time an interpretation that has been upheld by the supreme court fra has expressed concern about employees being held on trains for long periods of time while awaiting the arrival of transportation in the absence of any valid emergency that would justify such long waits22 22 federal railroad administration department of transportation decision of the united continued crs10 changing conditions in the rail industry since 1969 have increased the scale of the limbo time issue in the 1960s the industry consisted of many midsized companies operating in relatively small regions and railroads typically had employees stationed every few dozen miles who could be sent to pick up train crews whose shifts had expired since then there has been significant consolidation in the rail industry which is now dominated by few major companies whose operations span much larger territories the average distance covered by train crew during shift is now much greater and there may be few or even intermediate locations from which transportation can be dispatched to pick up crew whose shift has expired industrywide statistics on limbo time are not available so the full extent of limbo time is not known nor can an increase in the incidence of limbo time be documented industrywide the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet recently presented data on limbo time for train crews at one class i railroad indicating that the incidence of limbo time at that railroad was increasing over the sixyear period 20012006 the number of crews whose work tours exceeded 14 hours indicating at least 2 hours of limbo time increased from between 32000 33000 year in 2001 and 2002 to between 7500080000 in 2005 and 2006 those crews whose work tours exceeded 15 hours rose from around 12000 year in 2001 and 2002 to between 3500038000 year in 2005 and 200623 the blet figures show that on 1003 occasions crews at that class i railroad spent at least 8 hours in limbo resulting in shift lasting at least 20 hours the ntsb investigation of the macdona texas accident found that the engineer on the union pacific train that struck the bnsf train had one shift earlier that month that had lasted 22 hours 10 hours of limbo time after 12hour shift24 positive train control fatigue is not entirely preventable matter the countermeasures researchers have found for example that human performance is impaired during the early morning hours roughly 36 am regardless of how wellrested the worker thus there is interest in technologies that can reduce the opportunities for human error 22

train control positive train control ptc refers to technology that is capable of preventing collisions between trains derailments resulting from trains traveling too fast for conditions and injuries to roadway workers eg maintenanceofway workers bridge workers signal maintainers as well as potentially limiting the consequences of hijackings and runaway trains ptc can serve as backup system able to intervene when train crew operates train improperly or fails to comply with signals examples of ptc systems vary widely in complexity and sophistication based on the level of automation they implement and the degree of control they are capable of assuming ptc has been on the ntsbs most wanted transportation safety improvements list since the list was established in 199025 in its review of the macdona texas accident the ntsb noted that board accident investigations over the past three decades have shown that the most effective way to prevent trainto train collisions is through the use of positive train control ptc system that will automatically assume some control of train when the train crew does not comply with signal indications26 congress has also been interested in ptc since 1992 congress has on several occasions requested information from fra about the costs and benefits of ptc and the status of ptc deployment since 1994 congress has provided approximately 40 million to fra to support development testing and deployment of ptc prototype systems in illinois alaska and among the eastern railroads in 1997 fra asked the rail safety advisory committee to examine ptc the advisory committee concluded that the safety benefit of ptc to railroads did not justify the significant costs of deploying such systems it estimated that ptc deployment on the class i railroads would cost from 12 billion to 78 billion over 20 years depending on the sophistication of the system while over the same period the estimated safety benefit from avoided accidents ranged from around 500 million to 850 million again depending on the sophistication of the system27 fra subsequently issued regulation establishing performance standard for ptc finalized in 2005 but has not required railroads to implement ptc fra noted in its 2005 final rule on ptc standards that ptc systems offer nonsafety benefits including substantial public benefits although the total value of these benefits

implementation of ptc systems could not be justified based on normal costbenefit principles relying on direct railroad safety benefits28 fra encourages railroads to voluntarily deploy ptc in 2006 the ntsb observed that it was encouraged that fra had adopted performance standards for ptc in 2005 and that ptc pilot projects are underway at various railroads but noted that the 2004 macdona texas accident was another in long series of railroad accidents that could have been prevented had there been ptc system in place at the accident location29 track inspections in 2006 defective track was the leading cause of train accidents frequently the defect causes derailment the number of derailments has risen from 1816 1996 to 2138 2006 for example on march 12 2007 csx train derailed in upstate new york there had been several previous derailments in the area and the fra initiated an audit of csx track in new york state the audit found 78 track defects and one serious violation fra has announced

to have problems based on quantitative analysis of risk factors and past inspections some types of track defects are difficult to detect by visual inspection so fra has acquired technology that can improve its track inspections it has recently introduced two new automated track geometry inspection vehicles which measure the width between rails whether the rails are level and whether the shape of

each year may 16 2007 crs13 highwayrail grade crossing safety collisions between trains and highway vehicles are the secondleading cause of railrelated fatalities after trespassing these collisions occur primarily at places where roads cross railroad tracks at the same level or at grade there are some 240000 such crossings of which roughly 150000 are public crossings where the railroad tracks are crossed by public road the remaining 90000 or so crossings are known as private crossings where the railroad tracks are crossed by for example driveways or farm roads the number of collisions and fatalities at grade crossings has been reduced significantly over the past few decades even as the amount of both train and highway traffic has significantly increased since the fra was last authorized train miles traveled have increased by 24 from 655 million miles in 1994 to 810 million miles in 2006 while road vehicle miles traveled have increased by 26 from 23 trillion miles in 1994 to 29 trillion miles on 2006 meanwhile the collisions at grade crossings decreased by 42 from 4979 in 1994 to 2908 in 2006 however the trend of improvement has leveled off in recent years given the progress that has been made in reducing fatalities at grade crossings over the past decade some have questioned whether additional congressional action is needed on the other hand highly visible

by crs all public crossings are required to have warning devices in most cases these are passive devices crossbuck signs and pavement markings that warn motorists that they are approaching railroad crossing but do not indicate to motorists whether train is approaching or not however train operators are required to sound the locomotives horn as they approach any crossing33 32 on january 26 2005

causing it to derail eleven passengers dies in the crash 33 unless community has created quiet zone where the sounding of train horns has been continued crs14 approximately 63000 of the roughly 150000 public crossings have been equipped with automated warning devices such as warning lights and crossbars that warn motorists if train is approaching these devices are installed by state and local transportation agencies once installed railroads are responsible for maintaining these devices and ensuring their proper functioning these devices can be relatively expensive and generally must compete with other transportation improvements for funding the federal highway administration has gradecrossing hazard elimination program that provides 220 million annually to states for safety improvements to grade crossings34 the eligibility of crossings for safety improvement funding is based on their risk with the most dangerous crossings given priority most of the crossings in urban areas have been provided with automated warning devices the provision of automated warning devices to the more than 80000 public railhighway crossings that do not have conventional automated warning devices is constrained by both the costs of the devices and by concern on the part of public authorities that increasing the protection provided to motorists at one crossing could be used in lawsuits to argue the inadequacy of protection provided at other crossings in the area35 another method of reducing grade crossing accidents is to eliminate the grade crossing in some cases this is done by elevating the road or rail crossing but this is very expensive option most often this is done by closing the road where it crosses the railroad tracks in 1994 fra set goal of reducing thethen 280000 public and private grade crossings by 25 to 210000 that goal has not been achieved though some 30000 crossings have been closed since then fra encourages states and communities to close grade crossings based on the safety benefits communities are often reluctant to close grade crossings because of the inconvenience resulting from reducing the number of places where railroad tracks can be crossed fra also supports operation lifesaver national nonprofit railroad safety education program which attempts to reduce gradecrossing accidents by educating the public about the dangers of grade crossings and encouraging safe driving behavior at grade crossings operation lifesaver programs in 49 states and the district of columbia use volunteer trainers to make some 30000 presentations year to the public as well as offering training for groups such as commercial truck drivers school bus drivers and emergency personnel and providing public service announcements 33 continued banned in exchange for grade crossing safety improvements that compensate for the absence of the horns warning 34 authorized in safetealu pl 10959 this formula program is funded from the highway trust account

the federal railroad safety accountability and improvement act p 12 crs15 fewer than 1 of grade crossing collisions are investigated by fra each year36 most of the information fra relies on for analysis of grade crossing collisions comes from accident reports submitted by the railroads according to the reports many of these collisions result from incautious behavior on the part of motorists the dot inspector general has recommended that fra supplement the accident reports submitted by railroads with independent sources of information such as police reports event data recorders and eyewitness accounts in order to better evaluate the causes of collisions and the extent of railroads compliance with safety regulations37 in response to this recommendation fra instituted pilot study to assess the benefits and costs of analyzing information about crossing collisions from independent sources the results of that study had not been made public as of late july 2007 the dots inspector general has recommended several other steps fra could take in order to further reduce grade crossing collisions and fatalities these include ensuring that railroads comply with the requirement to promptly report serious grade crossing collisions so that the collisions can be investigated increasing fras involvement in grade crossing collision investigations38 requiring railroads to clear obstructions such as vegetation near crossings to make it easier for motorists to see oncoming trains39 requiring railroads and states to provide updated information on grade crossings and the types of warning devices installed at each crossing40 and requiring states with the most grade crossings and most accidents to develop plans for identifying and remediating the most dangerous crossings 36

the house or the senate representative james oberstar chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee has introduced reauthorization proposal the federal railroad safety improvement act of 2007 hr 2095 managers amendment was adopted by the full committee with amendments by the transportation and infrastructure committee on june 14 2007 the amended bill was reported on september 19 2007 an amendment in the nature of substitute was adopted by the house on october 17 2007 senator frank lautenberg chairman of the senate commerce committees subcommittee on surface transportation and merchant marine infrastructure safety and security has introduced reauthorization proposal the railroad safety enhancement act of 2007 s 1889 managers amendment was adopted by the full committee and was ordered to be reported out of the commerce committee on september 27 2007 it was reported on march 3 2008 and with some further changes was passed as an amended version of hr 2095 on august 1 2008 summaries of the contents of these bills and an analysis of selected issues follow the federal railroad safety accountability and improvement act hr 1516s 918 the administrations reauthorization proposal hr 1516s 918 included few significant changes to fras safety program it did propose to convert the rail hours of service law to regulation which dot could amend through the regulatory process it also proposed to create safety risk reduction program within fra to augment fras traditional regulatory approach to safety which focuses on catching mistakes on the part of railroads the safety risk reduction program would promote improvements in the processes railroads use in order to eliminate the causes of mistakes the administration asserted that this approach would maximize the safety results obtained with fras limited resources but that to implement the program fra would have to acquire new skills and adopt new ways of thinking the administration also proposed to allow fra to monitor the radio communications of railroads without their consent in order to determine whether safety rules are being followed and for investigating accidents the administration observed that allowing fra to monitor these communications without the knowledge of railroads and their employees would provide more accurate picture of the degree of compliance with safety rules action has been taken on this legislation in either the house or the crs17 senate and it appears likely that congress will focus on other legislation in the fra reauthorization debate the federal railroad safety

federal railroad safety administration frsa it would make several changes to address the issue of employee fatigue it would increase the minimum rest period length under the rail hours of service act from 8 to 10 hours and would authorize frsa to further increase the length of that minimum rest period through regulation it would phase in limit of 10 hours on the amount of limbo time an employee could accrue each month not including any limbo time caused by delays unforeseeable at the time the employee left designated terminal it would require that employees accruing limbo time on shift be given additional rest time after that shift equal to the amount of limbo time accrued and it would require railroads to develop fatigue management plans in consultation with rail labor unions it would also require railroads to set minimum training standards for employees to address concerns that employees are not being provided adequate training the bill would increase the number of safety inspectors from the current level of approximately 430 to 800 it would require class i railroads to implement positive train control by december 2014 though dot could extend that deadline through waivers the bill would require safety improvements at grade crossings such as posting of tollfree telephone numbers to notify railroads of emergency situations at grade crossings and requiring railroads to remove visual obstructions such as vegetation near grade crossings it would also direct fra to provide model legislation to state and local governments regarding safety at grade crossings the bill would establish new civil penalties and increase existing penalties for failure to comply with federal safety regulations the bill would authorize total of 11 billion over four years fy2008 fy2011 for fras safety programs currently fra receives around 200 million annually for its safety operations and research development accounts the bill would also authorize three new grant programs for operation lifesaver 15 million annually for deployment of positive train control systems such sums as may be necessary and for emergency improvements to grade crossings such sums as may be necessary the bill would also authorize 18 million for the construction of tunnel at the transportation technology center in pueblo colorado for safety and crs18 security training it also requires the ntsb to assist the families of passengers involved in rail accidents that result in fatalities the bill also requires dot to issue regulations requiring that in nonsignaled territory ie areas where there are signals along the track to inform train operators of track conditions or the approach of other trains railroads must either install position indicators on track switches on main lines or operate trains at speeds that will allow train employees to observe and stop in advance of misaligned switches41 in october of 2006 fra issued notice of proposed rulemaking on among other issues preventing misaligned switches in nonsignaled territory amendments added during house consideration include 1 provision that mechanical and brake inspections of rail cars that are performed in mexico will not be regarded as satisfying us standards unless the secretary of transportation certifies that the inspection standards and procedures are comparable to us inspections and that fra is allowed to perform onsite inspections to ensure compliance and 2 provision allowing state and local governments to regulate solid waste rail transfer facilities the administration has stated its opposition to several of the provisions of the bill42 these include the hours of service provisions which it terms overly prescriptive several of the mandated fra rulemakings and the mandated adoption of positive train control as passed by the senate hr 2095 as passed by the senate reflects much of the substance of s 1889 the railroad safety enhancement act of 2007 the senate struck the text of hr 2095 as passed by the house and substituted much of s 1889 with some changes this bill was passed by the senate by unanimous consent on august 1 2008 s 1889 was introduced by senator frank lautenberg chairman of the senate commerce committees subcommittee on surface transportation and merchant marine infrastructure safety and security on july 26 2007 the committee approved an amended bill on september 27

deaths and more than 600 people injured due to misaligned switches in nonsignaled territory resulting from rail employees failing to follow proper procedures this led fra to issue an emergency order

policy on hr 2095 october 10 2007 crs19 implement positive train control technology by the end of 2018 it directs fra to issue regulations regarding rail employee training and includes provisions promoting safety at highwayrail grade crossings the bill would increase the minimum amount of uninterrupted rest time and limit the amount of limbo time that can be accrued by rail employees under the rail hours of service statute and would authorize dot to amend the rail hours of service limits through the regulatory process the bill would also allow fra to monitor the radio communications of railroads without their consent in order to determine whether safety rules are being followed and for investigating accidents issues in proposed legislation fatigue and hours of service limits in hr 1516s 918 the administration proposed to give the fra authority to completely revise the rail hours of service laws through the regulatory process in acknowledgment of the variety of working conditions within the rail industry the administration proposed to allow dot to authorize and enforce compliance with fatigue management plans proposed by railroads as an alternative to compliance with an hours of service regulation provided fra judged that those plans provided level of safety equal to or better than that provided by the regulation hr 2095 as passed by the house would increase the minimum offduty period under the rail hours of service law and would give the dot authority to further increase the minimum offduty period or decrease the maximum onduty period by regulation it would also require railroads to submit to dot fatigue management plans designed to reduce employee fatigue and the likelihood of accidents and injuries caused by fatigue the bill would also amend the hours of service law to increase the current minimum offduty period from eight hours to 10 hours with minimum of one 24hour rest period every seven days43 thereby reducing the maximum amount of time that could be worked in week from the current level of 100 hours to 78 hours the bill would also require that an employees minimum rest time be undisturbed that is it would bar rail company from communicating with train employee in any manner that would disturb the employees rest during the minimum rest period except for emergencies hr 2095 as passed by the senate would make similar changes significant differences from the changes proposed by the house include requiring 48 consecutive hours off duty for employees after working six consecutive days unless collective bargaining agreement allows for working seven consecutive days in which case employees must then be given 72 consecutive hours off duty capping the total onduty and limbo time an employee could accrue at 276 hours per month 43 dot would be allowed to waive the requirement of the minimum of one 24hour rest period every seven days if collective bargaining agreement provides an alternative arrangement that is equally safe crs20 giving dot the authority to approve alternate hours of service plans jointly developed by rail labor and management that will not adversely affect rail safety allowing dot to waive the prohibition on communicating with train employee during the minimum rest period for commuter or intercity passenger rail carriers if necessary in order to maintain efficient operations and ontime performance and directing dot to regulate hours of service for commuter rail and intercity passenger rail train employees such requirements may vary from those prescribed in the bill fra testified against the provisions of these bills that would amend the hours of service limits acknowledging the frustrations that the issue has produced and the desires of some members of congress to provide quick relief fra asserted that hours of service issues are complicated and need to be addressed within the overall context of fatigue prevention and management consequently fra urged that it be given the authority to completely revise the hours of service law through regulations based on the current scientific understanding of fatigue44 both the house and senate version of hr 2095 allow fra to regulate hours of service but not to increase the onduty time or reduce the offduty requirements prescribed in the bill except for commuter and intercity passenger rail train employees in statement of administration policy the administration opposed the hours of service provision of the housepassed hr 2095 as being overly prescriptive and expressed concern that the new limits on hours of service in combination with the limits on limbo time also included in the bill would tend to increase railroads need to hire additional operating employees at time when retirements and resignations are making it increasingly difficult for railroads to have full complement of workers thereby aggravating potential service disruptions and the safety problems that can come with large numbers of new relatively inexperienced employees45 aar supported revision of the hours of service law to reflect current scientific understanding of fatigue aar contended that rail companies do not want workers who are too tired to properly perform their duties and are making efforts to address fatigue aar testified that generally speaking railroads do not object to the provision of these bills that increase the minimum rest time from 8 to 10 hours and that bar nonemergency communications from rail companies during the minimum rest period however aar did object to the provision requiring that employees 44 testimony

schedules aar requested that period be extended by one day to require that employees receive 24 consecutive hours off duty every eight days with an exception for signal employees and while not objecting to the requirement that railroads prepare fatigue management plans aar did request some changes to the specifics of that requirement including that the plans should only apply to those employees who are subject to the hours of service law aar supported the limitation of total hours worked by an employee including limbo time to 276 hours per month as proposed in the senatepassed hr 2095 rail labor organizations also support revision of the hours of service regime they support the provisions these bills that would amend the current rail hours of service regime to ensure that an employee was undisturbed during their minimum rest period and to require rail companies to develop fatigue management plans in consultation with employees limbo time the administration bill did not propose any direct change though it is possible that limbo time would be affected as result of the regulatory process of revising the hours of service regime which the administration proposed the housepassed version of hr 2095 which as introduced would have eliminated limbo time limits the amount of limbo time an employee can accrue to 10 hours per month not including limbo time caused by delays that were unforeseeable at the time an employee left designated terminal phased in over period of two years after enactment of the legislation the senatepassed version of hr 2095 would limit limbo time to maximum of three hours per day not including limbo time caused by delays that were unforeseeable when an employee left designated terminal while allowing employees to elect additional offduty time equal to the amount of limbo time incurred during their shift the senate bills overall limit of 276 hours of work by an employee each month includes limbo time in calculating the total hours worked the administration objected to the limbo time provision of the housepassed hr 2095 contending that there is nothing inherently unsafe about crew being left on train so long as the crew is relieved of duties and given adequate rest time46 while the fra is concerned about the impact of limbo time on employee fatigue the fra administrator objected that reclassifying limbo time as onduty time would shift the law from safety frame of reference to fair labor standards frame of reference force carriers to reduce the length of many assignments to avoid the possibility of violations under circumstances where safety could not be seriously compromised and ensure that any further reforms would be very costly indeed47 46 office of management and budget statement of administration policy on hr 2095 october 10 2007 47 testimony of joseph h boardman administrator federal railroad administration us continued crs22 the fra administrator urged instead that given the complications of hours of service issues and the need to consider them within the context of fatigue prevention and management the fra be given the authority to develop hours of service regulations based on scientific understanding of fatigue the aar contends that eliminating limbo time by reclassifying it as onduty time would create intractable scheduling problems for railroads and result in increased costs that would be passed on to rail shippers the railroads propose instead to address the safetyrelated fatigue implications of limbo time by providing additional time off to employees who have accrued at least one hour of limbo time also the railroads propose monthly maximum of 276 onduty hours for train operating employees limbo time would count toward that monthly maximum even though it would not be considered onduty time in any particular instance48 failing that approach the railroads would support providing fra with the authority to deal with the issue through regulating rail hours of service rail labor groups support the elimination of limbo time by reclassifying it as on duty time they argue that the supreme court decision classifying the time the original crew spends waiting for transportation as limbo time promotes the type of abuse failing to get the crews to their final release point as soon as possible that the 1969 amendment to the hours of service act was intended to remedy49 james brunkenhoefer the united transportation unions national legislative director asserted that the limit of 10 hours per month on limbo time would effectively eliminate limbo time because of the difficulty railroads would have in keeping track of the remaining limbo time for two separate members of train crew50 positive train control the administration bill did not address ptc the housepassed hr 2095 would require each class i railroad to submit to dot within 12 months of passage of the bill plan for implementing ptc system by december 31 2014 the secretary would be permitted

of train control technologies the program would be funded at 10 million annually the administration has objected that mandating implementation of ptc by an arbitrary deadline is premature contending that the safety benefits have not yet been shown to justify the costs and that the technology is not yet proven if congress decides to mandate the implementation the administration requested that the secretary of transportation be given greater flexibility to guide implementation to promote safety and avoid disruptions to commerce51 aar has testified that railroads are committed to the deployment of positive train control technology where it makes sense eg on highdensity main lines not lowdensity branch lines and on schedule based on available funds in light of the variety of train control systems and their differing advantages and disadvantages which railroads are still evaluating aar objected to setting fixed deadline for deployment at this stage aar did support having railroads
