parties used section 505 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794a or section 1988 of the civil rights attorneys fees award act 42 usc 1988 to seek fees however the supreme court in smith v

were added in 1986 by the handicapped childrens protection act pl 993724 majority opinion justice alito wrote the majority opinion in arlington central school district v murphy holding that idea does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees they have paid to experts5 his opinion was joined by ch ief justice roberts and justices scalia kennedy and thomas justice ginsbe rg wrote separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment jus tice breyer filed dissenting opinion joined by justices stevens and souter the majority opinion first observed that the holding was guided by the fact that congress enacted the idea pursuant to the spending clause6 t h i s w s s n s significant because if congress attaches c onditions to states acceptance of funds the conditions must be unambiguous and provide clear notice the majority noted that idea must be viewed from the perspective of stat official deciding wh ether idea funds and the obligation attached should be accepted i n other words we must ask whether idea furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case7 to determine whether there is such clear notice justice alito then examined ideas statutory language which states in relevant part in any action or proceeding brought under this section the court in its discretion may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs i to prevailing party who is the parent of child with disability8 although the parents had argued that the term costs would include the costs of experts justice alito found this ar gument flawed because the term costs is term of art that generally does not include expert fees9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22465crs3 10 the general accounting office was renamed the government accountability office by pl 108271 11 548 us__

capped childrens pr otection act of 1986 which added attorneys fees provisions to id ea supported their argument that expert fees were covered because it cont ained provision requiring th general accounting office gao10 to collect data including data for cons ultants this argument was also found to be unconvincing because the language direc ting the collection of data for consultants required the collection of the number of hour s spent not the amount of fees awarded justice alito concluded that the language of idea overwhe lmingly supports the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the costs of experts or consultants and that the terms of idea fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed to attach such condition to states receipt of idea funds11 the majority also rejected the final two arguments made by the parents 1 that allowing expert fees supports the overarching goal of idea to provide free appropriate public education fape to all children with disabilities and 2 that the legislative history of the handicapped childrens pr otection act supports allowing expert fees justice alito found that the goals of fape and of safeguardi ng the rights of parents were too general to provide much support for respondents r eading of the terms of the idea the idea obviously does not seek to promote these goals at the expense of all other considerations including fiscal considerations12 the conference committee report for pl 99372 stated the conferees intend that the term attorneys fees as part of the costs include reasonable expenses and fees of expert w itnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be n ecessary for the preparation of the parent or guardians case in the action or proceeding13 justice alito found that this legislative history to be unconvincing and simply not enough14 he concluded that under these circumstances where everythi ng other than the legislative history overwhelmingly suggests that expert fees ma not be recovered the legislative history is simply not enough in spending clause case the key is not what majority of the members of both houses intend but what the states are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of those funds here in the face of the unambiguous text of the idea and the reasoning in crawford fitting and casey

concurrence justice ginsburg concurred in part with the majority opinion nd concurred in the judgment of the court however she took issue with the majoritys reliance on the clear notice requirement for conditions placed on the receipt of federal funds justice ginsburg distinguished the situation presented in pennhurst state school and hospital v halderman 16 where the court found that clear notice was required from that in arlington central school district the situation in pennhurst was described as imposing new programmatic obligation on the states whereas that in arlington central school district was in lower key and did not cern ideas education programs but the remedies available against school district justice gins burg also emphasized that idea was enacted not only under the spending cl ause but also under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment dissenting opinion justice breyer joined by justices stevens and souter dissented from the majority opinion stating that there are two strong reasons for interpreting the statutory phrase to include the award of expert fees first that is what congress said it intended by the phrase second that interpretation furthers the ideas statutorily defined purposes17 justice breyer examined the legislative history of the handicapped childrens protection act especially emphasizing the language in the conference report stating that the conferees intended to cover th fees of expert witnesses18 the dissent noted that every spending detail in spending clause statut need not be spelled out and concluded that our ultimate judicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statutes purpose only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the substitution of judicial for legislative will only by reading language in its light can we maintain the democratic link between voters legislators statutes and ultimate implementation upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional system rests19 second justice breyer found that ideas basic purpose as illuminated by the fape and due process require ments supported interpreting the provisions language to include expert costs he emphasized the importance of keeping the goals of program as means of assessing language noting that to do otherwise is to risk set of judicialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22465crs5 20 id at 11 21 id at 17interpretations that can prevent the program overall from achieving its basic objectives or that may well reduce program in its details to incoherence20 in conclusion the dissent emphasized the importance of legislative history observing that by disregarding clear st atement in legislative report adopted without opposition in both houses of congress the ma jority has reached result member of congress expected or overtly desired21 the lack of weight given to the overarching purpose of idea was describe d as undercutting the statute s purpose of providing free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities
