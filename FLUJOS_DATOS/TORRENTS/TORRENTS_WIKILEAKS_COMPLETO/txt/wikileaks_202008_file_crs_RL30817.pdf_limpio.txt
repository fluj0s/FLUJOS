tax interdependence an overview summary beyond direct federal government grantsinaid there are indirect federal revenue transfers to state and local governments through variety of tax instruments this report analyzes four such instruments and provides rough estimates of the relative magnitude of each specifically the report focuses on 1 the federal income tax exclusion for bonds issued by subfederal governments taxexempt bonds 2 the federal estate tax credit for state death taxes 3 the itemized deduction for subfederal property taxes and 4 the itemized deduction for subfederal income taxes under the federal income tax economic analysis suggests that the exclusion from federal income taxes of interest income from state and local government taxexempt bonds is an inefficient method of subsidizing public capital formation possible income tax reforms such as lower marginal rates or shift to consumptionbased flat tax would reduce the attractiveness of taxexempt bonds and could increase the borro wing costs of sub federal governments as consequence these tax reforms would also reduce the loss in economic efficiency arising from taxexempt bonds the federal estate tax offers state death tax credit which reduces the effective marginal state death tax rate to zero in most states the federal credit serves as almost direct federal transfer to the states through their estate taxes eliminating or reducing the federal estate tax would significantly reduce and perhaps eliminate the tax transfer to the states under current law taxpayers can deduct subfederal property and income taxes as an itemized deduction on their federal income tax the federal deduction results in the federal government paying part of these state and local taxes through lower federal tax collections in addition there is some evidence that state and local governments rely more on these deductible taxes rather the nondeductible taxes such as sales and use taxes the deduction for income taxes may also increase the progressiveness of state income taxes this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817contents introduction 1 what is the cost of federal fiscal tax transfers

interdependence an overview introduction the vertical structure of government in the united states is typically identified as an example of fiscal federalism the modifier fiscal evokes thoughts of annual budgets and the mechanisms through which governments balance them federalism is the term used to describe the relationship between central government and its subdivisions in the united states the constitution assigns certain powers and authorities to the central government while all other governmen tal powers remain with the states the concept fiscal federalism has logical interpretation which may expand beyond the sum of its parts in the words of economist wallace oates fiscal federalism explores both in normative and positive terms the roles of the different levels of government and the ways in which they relate to one another through such instruments as intergovernmental grants1 in this report the instrument of fiscal federalism examined is taxation rather than intergovernmental grants thus instead of examining explicit transfers from the federal government to state and local governments this report will focus on an indirect tool of fiscal federalism federal tax deductions and credits that affect the budgets of state and local governments the report will examine federalism through federal tax exclusions deductions and credits for the purposes of alerting members and committees of congress and their staff to the potential effects of tax decisions on state and local governments the new administration as well as the 107th congress have both indicated tax relief will be an important part of the legislative agenda some of the tax relief proposals for individuals may affect state and local government budgets in the 106th congress hr 1433 representative baird and the senate counterpart s 1490 senator thompson would have legislated federal deduction for subfederal sales and use taxes for states that do not impose an income tax representative clement has indicated

gpo 1999 p2directly affect state and local government finances after brief discussion of tax expenditures generally four instruments are analyzed in turn the first are taxexempt bondsstate and local government bondsthe interest payments on which are exempt from federal income taxation the second is the federal estate tax credit for state death taxes the third and fourth are federal income tax deductions for state and local taxes on property and income respectively what is the cost of federal fiscal tax transfers the value of federal transfers to states through taxes is difficult to identify and quantify in contrast the value of direct expenditures such as federal grantsinaid is relatively easy to find for example the economic report of the president which is published annually states that the value of federal government grantsinaid to sub federal governments was approximately 224 billion in 1999 estimates of the federal revenue transfers through taxexempt bonds federal deductions for state and local taxes and the credit for state estate taxes are not as readily available for this report estimates of the cost of the federal government transfers are provided where possible the benefits to state and local governments arising from taxexempt bonds and state death taxes which are structured as an income exclusion and tax credits respectively are not directly estimable however in the case of federal income tax deductions for state and local property and income taxes federally estimated tax expenditures are close approximation the tax expenditures estimates provided by the joint committee on taxation were first introduced in the mid1970s tax expenditures were defined by the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 the budget act pl 933443 as revenue losses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow special exclusion or exemption or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit preferential rate of tax or deferral of tax liability an example of one tax instrument of fiscal federalism is federal tax expenditure that benefits state and local government through lowering the taxpayers federal tax burden for example local real estate property taxes are deductible from federal income for taxpayers who itemize the benefit to the local government is equivalent to the taxpayers decreas in federal tax liability arising from the deduction if the local government were to repeal the property tax entirely the residents real estate property tax bill would obviously drop to zero however his federal tax liability would increase because the deduction would longer be available the following sections explain each of the above menti oned tax instruments in more detail beginning with taxexempt bondshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs3 4taxexempt bonds are commonly called municipal bonds 5for more general review of taxexempt bonds see crs report rl30638 taxexempt bonds description of state and local governments debt by steven maguire 6however some municipal bonds are taxable if they do not qualify for taxexempt status or in some cases subnational government will issue taxable bonds to avoid having to comply with federal restrictions on the use of the bond proceeds according to the bond buyer 1999 yearbook in 1998 taxable municipal bonds accounted for just 56 1597 billion of total municipal bond volume 7this is rough and probably understated estimate in 1998 approximately 155 billion of tax exempt interest is reported on returns with agi above 500000 these returns are most likely in the 396 bracket which would yield 61 billion in tax revenue if the remainder were in the 28 bracket another 97 billion would be generated or total 158 for both groupstaxexempt bonds4 explanation one of the most visible components of the federal tax code affecting state and local governments is the tax exemption for interest income generated by most bonds they issue the tax exemption allows the issuers to sell bonds at lower interest rate thus lowering the cost of debt5 the lower interest cost is in fact revenue transfer from the federal government to two entities bond holders and subfederal governments two questions need to be answered to better understand the tax transfer how do bondholders benefit from lower pretax interest rates on taxexempt bonds the holders of state and local taxexempt bonds do not have to include the interest earned on the bonds as federal taxable income6 in equilibrium the aftertax return on taxable and nontaxable bonds should be the same if one type has an aftertax rate of return higher than the other then investors would switch to the bond with the higher return assuming the bonds are otherwise equal over time as the investors bid away the differential the aftertax returns on the two bonds converge the implicit aftertax rate assumes there is one market clearing tax rate although there are several tax brackets in the federal tax system this fundamental incongruity generates windfall gains for taxpayers in tax brackets above the market clearing marginal tax rate based on average annual interest rates on taxexempt bonds and taxable corporate bonds the market clearing marginal tax rate was about 23 thus investors in tax brackets above 23 who held taxexempt bonds received windfall gain theoretically investors in tax brackets below the market clearing rate should not invest in taxexempt bonds for 1998 48 million returns reported total of 50 billion in taxexempt interest if this interest income were taxable at the 28 rate taxability would have generated 14 billion in federal revenue7 how do state and local governments benefit if state and local government bonds were stripped of their taxexempt status they would have to offer an interest rate at least equal to the prevailing taxable corporate bond rate the transfer to subfederal governments is equal to the difference between the interest ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs4 8most taxexempt bonds are considered longterm bonds meaning they have terms of 13 months or more in 1998 almost 90 of municipal bonds were longterm bonds 9the calculations presented here do not include state and local income taxes that may apply to the interest income of the bonds 10the bond buyer decade of municipal note finance june 7 2000 p41 11ronald c fisher state and local public finance 2nd ed chicago irwin publishing 1996 p 256 12us council of economic advisors economic report of the president washington february 2000 table b71on taxexempt bonds and taxable bonds of equal term and risk8 in 1999 the spread between taxable bonds and taxexempt bonds was 161 thus for every 100 in taxexempt bonds issued in 1999 the federal government effectively passed along savings of 161 in interest cost per year to subfederal governments9 according to the bond buyer the total amount of new debt referred to as new money or debt that is not used to payoff existing debt issued in 1999 was almost 158 billion10 thus the total subsidy to state and local governments in 1999 was roughly 26 billion economic analysis there are two main arguments for the tax exclusion first the federal gover nment allows the subsidy because many believe the federal government should not interfere with the financing of subfederal governments however the federal government is not constitutionally bound to the taxexempt status for subfederal debt the supreme court ruled south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988 that the federal government can tax the interest income derived from subfederal debt instruments the second and perhaps more compelling reason for the tax exemption is that policy makers in the federal government are concerned that local public capital investment may be underprovided unless subsidized by the federal government tax exemption is typically justified for reason s similar to those offered for direct expenditures like grantsinaid the efficiency of the subsidy is questionable for every dollar of lost federal tax revenue the subfederal government typically receives less than dollar of interest cost saving11 the following numerical example best illustrates the inefficiency of the federal subsidy through taxexempt bond interest the example uses the 1999 average taxexempt bond interest of 543 and the 1999 average interest rate on high grade corporate bonds of 70412 the interest cost saving to the state and local government is the same regardless of the tax status of the bond purchaser whereas the tax savings to the purchaser and the corresponding revenue loss to the federal government rises with his marginal tax bracket see table 1 for numerical example the federal revenue loss arising from the tax exemption is approximately the tax saving of the investor for example when an investor in the 396 bracket buys taxexempt bond at 543 with face value of 10000 rather than taxable bond of equal face value at 704 the federal government loses 279 of tax revenue but the state and local gover nment onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs5 13holders of municipal debt19852000 the bond buyer friday june 16 2000 p 7receives an interest cost savings of 161 table 1 compares the varying federal revenue loss to the interest cost saving of the state and local government for taxpayers in four different marginal tax brackets in each case the revenue loss to the federal government exceeds the cost saving to the subfederal government more generally the subsidy for taxexempt state and local debt induces hightax rate investors to buy this type of bond rather than taxable corporate bonds in theory the presence of taxexempt bonds decreases the demand for taxable corporate bonds which in turn increases the interest cost for corporate borrowers were taxexempt bonds eliminated the demand for taxable bonds would likely increase and in turn corporate borrowing costs would go down state and local governments voice strong support for taxexempt bonds because the bonds allow these governments to borrow at lower cost according to the bond buyer total outstanding municipal debt for 2000 was 154 trillion most of which was taxexempt13 if all these bonds had to be issued as taxable bonds the additi onal interest cost to subfederal governments in 2000 would have been significant however the additional interest cost to state and local governments would likely be less than the increase in federal tax collections because of the revenue generated by taxable interest income the example in table 1 indicates that the federal government could compensate state and local governments for the lost subsidy and still have excess revenue to reduce other federal taxes table 1 federal cost and local benefit from taxexempt

gift taxes economic issues by jane g gravelle and steven maguire clearing marginal tax rate in turn the demand for and the price of taxexempt bonds would decline the lower price would then lead to higher interest rates on tax exempt bonds generally the higher interest rates on taxexempt bonds would then increase borrowing costs for subfederal governments adopting flat tax or consumption based tax where subfederal bonds lose their taxexempt status entirely would have the same though more pronounced effect as reduction in marginal income tax rates14 in 1999 article economists joel slemrod and timothy greimel investigated the relationship between the probability of electing flat tax advocate president steve forbes and the us taxexempt municipal bond market they found that the indicator of tax reforms prospects the probability of electing steve forbes was correlated with decline in the spread on five and tenyear maturity bonds although not for 30year maturity bonds 15 the spread identifies the difference between taxable corporate bonds and comparable taxexempt bonds though their evidence was not overwhelmingly convincing the existence of the paper attests to the potential relationship between federal tax rates and subfederal government bonds and the cost of issuing those bonds federal credit or deduction for state death taxes16 explanation both federal and state governments maintain estate taxes however 35 states simply pickup the federal credit discussed below as their death tax in these states the state death tax is commonly referred to as pickup tax eliminating the federal estate tax would eliminate the state death tax in these 35 states two additional states connecticut and louisiana will soon join the group of 35 pickup tax states under the pickup tax mechanism the state tax is set equal to the maximum federal credit allowed the federal government credits the decedents federal estate tax bill by the exact amount of the state death taxes paid the credit for state death taxes is theoretically indistinguishable from direct federal transfer to the states economic analysis17 the credit for state death taxes is unusual in some cases the federal government allows taxpayers to deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from their federally defined gross income two examples of allowable deductions are those for state income taxes and property taxes through offering ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs7 18elizabeth c mcnichol iris j lav and daniel tenny repeal of the federal estate tax would cost states billions in revenue center

deduction similar assumption is made when calculating state continuedcredit the federal government is in fact paying the entire state death tax in states with pickup tax for the decedents estate the federal estate tax has been the object of considerable attention in the past and will likely generate interest in the current congress proposals for reforming the estate tax in the 106th congress ranged from complete elimination to expansion of special deductions for family owned and operated farms and businesses as indicated above these reforms could have substantial effect on the revenue structure of state death taxes the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp estimated that if the repeal of the federal estate tax had been in place in 2000 states together would have lost approximately 55 billion in revenue 18 the lost revenue would have to be made up with one of the following cutback in state services increases in other taxes or through bond sales another option would be to reform the state death tax to remove the link to the federal estate tax tax credit versus deduction an alternative reform of the estate tax would change the state credit to deduction absent other reforms changing the credit to deduction would increase the federal estate tax burden and induce behavioral response to the tax at the state level for expository purposes assume there are two options available to mitigate or reduce the state death tax burden policy is based on current law and includes federal tax credit for state death taxes paid alternatively policy b allows general deduction for state death taxes the current rate schedules for both the estate tax generally and the state death tax credit are applied to hypothetical estate in addition the calculation for state death taxes assumes the decedent resided in one of the 35 states that has adopted the federal credit for state death taxes as its estate tax policy current law credit for state death taxes under current law estates are allowed credit for state death taxes paid up to specified maximum consider an estate valued at 1 million after applying the federal estate tax rate schedule the estate has tentative tax liability of 345800 the unified credit in 2001 of 220550 lowers the federal tax liability before the credit for state death taxes to 125250 under current law an estate this size can claim credit of 33200 for state death taxes paid which lowers the federal tax bill to 92050 thus for this estate the state and federal estate taxes combined are 125250 policy b deduction from estate for state death taxes assume the same estate as above however the executor is allowed to deduct state death taxes rather than claim credit under this policy the estate deducts 33200 from the estate leaving 966800 in the taxable estate19 the current federal estate tax schedule thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs8 19continued income taxes based on federal adjusted gross incomesame schedule used above is applied and yields tentative federal estate tax liability of 332852 the same unified credit is available which lowers the federal tax bill to 112302 332852 less 220550 thus the sum of the federal and state estate taxes is 145502 in both cases summarized in table 2 the state receives 33200 from the decedents estate however under current law policy if the state did not have an estate tax the estate would still have total tax liability of 125250 with the state receiving nothing this implies that the existence of the state death tax under current law does not increase tax liability or that the state death taxes under current law in most states have zero marginal tax rate for the estate in contrast policy b would increase the federal burden and introduce positive marginal tax rate for state death taxes the deduction reduces the federal estate tax liability but not by the entire amount of the state death tax as is the case with the credit under current law algebraically the federal tax decrease is equal to the federal marginal rate 39 for the estate in our example multiplied by the state estate tax burden clearly the reduction in combined tax liability is less than state

jargon means the tax is calculated as percentage of value the alternative tax is one levied per unit generally only ad valorem property taxes are deductible 21there are usually two types of property taxes real estate on owneroccupied housing and personal the focus of this report is the real estate property tax for ease of exposition the modifier real estate is not used for the remainder of the report 22a progressive tax is one in which the rate of tax increases with income 23marginal tax rates are sometimes referred to as tax brackets there are currently five individual income tax brackets 15 28 31 36 and 396even though state death taxes are not large part of most states revenue structure the prospect of losing revenue as result of federal action may not be well received deduction for local property taxes explanation under the federal income tax taxpayers can deduct ad valorem20 local property taxes from taxable income21 however taxpayers must itemize deductions rather than use the standard deduction on their income tax return to claim the deduction the tax savings from the deduction is equal to taxpayers marginal tax rate multiplied by the size of the deduction because our income tax rate regime is progressive22 deduction in contrast to tax credit favors taxpayers in higher income tax brackets for example an itemizing individual owning home with an assessed value of 100000 and who pays 1 property tax can deduct 1000 from his or her adjusted gross income if this taxpayer is in the 36 marginal tax bracket taking 1000 out of taxable income saves 360 1000 multiplied by 3623 in most cases both the taxpayers tax bracket and home value increase with income thus taxpayers in higher brackets receive greater tax savings because of the progressive income tax and the assumed positive relationship between home value and income economic analysis the property tax deduction is used by about one quarter of taxpayers though perhaps twice that many pay property taxes on owner occupied housing only those who itemize can take the deduction table 3 provides data for the years 1993 through 1997 on 1 the number of returns that itemize and 2 the number of returns that have property tax deduction the gradual growth in the percentage of itemizers may reflect income growth that has outpaced inflation income growth that exceeds the inflationadjusted expansion of income tax brackets implies higher marginal tax bracket which ultimately increases the tax saving from itemizinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs10 24 d holtzeakin and h rosen federal deductibility and local

favored in the federal tax code the state and local governments may rely more upon that tax source in effect local governments and taxpayers recognize that residents are only paying part of the tax and that the federal government through federal deductibility is paying the remainder holtzeakin and rosen 1990 found that if deductibility were eliminated the mean property tax rate in our sample would fall by 000715 715 per 1000 of assessed value or 211 of the mean tax rate24 analogously deductibility of local property taxes might increase reliance on that tax and lower the reliance on other nondeductible taxes such as the local sales and use tax property taxes are major source of local government revenue and thus the federal transfer through deductibility is also quite large state governments alternatively are less dependen t upon property tax revenue and instead rely more upon income and sales and use taxes common measure of governments reliance on particular tax is the portion of total tax revenue generated by that tax nationally real estate property taxes comprised 737 1995 billion in fy1996 of all local government tax revenue and just 24 98 billion in fy1996 of all state government tax revenue25 the combined 2093 billion collected by state and local governments in 1996 was in many cases deducted by taxpayers who itemized on their federal income tax returns the federal tax expenditure estimated by the joint committee on taxation approximates this tax saving thus the itemizing taxpayer is partially reimbursed by way of federal deduction for state and local property taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs11 26generally in us bureau of census publications state government data are for the calendar year and the local government data is based on the

as with local property taxes the federal deduction is equal to the taxpayers individual tax rate multiplied by the amount of state income tax paid in some states taxpayers may also deduct federal income taxes from their state income taxes however the reciprocal deduction for federal income taxes is only practiced in four states and partial or limited deductibility is available in an additional four states because few states offer the reciprocal deduction for federal income taxes the focus here is limited to the deductibility of state income taxes as federal tax transfer state governments collected 1340 billion in individual income taxes in 1996 and local government collected 132 billion in fy199626 in 1997 state income tax collections were 1446 billion which would probably represent little more than ten times local collections for the same year unfortunately data more recent than fy1996 for local governments are not available federal deductions claimed for both state and local income taxes in 1997 totaled 1370 billion if one assumes the ratio of local income taxes to state income taxes did not change from 1996 to 1997 then approximately 1588 billion in state and local

gpo 1999 in theory the deduction for state and local income taxes is expected to affect the revenue structure of states in two ways this provides an incentive for states to maintain progressive tax system because the tax offset from the federal deduction is greater for the high income taxpayers one the deduction should increase the degree of progressivity in state taxes progressive state income tax levies higher rates as income increases in addition to facing higher federal rates the probability of itemizing on federal returns increases with income states that wish to offset greater percentage of income tax burden should then concentrate the income tax burden in the income ranges characterized by higher probability of itemizing the larger deduction for high rate taxpayers is effectiv ely exported to all federal taxpayers the second effect on state income taxes is similar to the effect described in the analysis of real estate property taxes deduction for state income taxes allows states to collec t revenue that exceeds the state taxpayers net tax cost for this reason deductible tax sources are expected to be favored over nondeductible taxes the following example illustrates the incentive effect if state were to consider tax increase consider an individual who reports 100000 in taxable income is in the 31 federal income tax bracket and is currently in the top state income tax bracket of 575 an increase in the tax rate to 7 increases the state tax on this individual byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30817crs13 27before the tax reform act of 1986 110 stat 2085 sec

multiplied by the change in the amount of the tax deduction 1250 or 38750 the taxpayers combined federal and state tax bill increases only 86250 but the state receives 1250 in additional revenue in essence federal taxpayers are paying part of the tax increase alternatively increasing tax that is not deductible such as the sales and use tax is not offset by federal taxpayers the cumulative effect of the deduction on states without deductible tax source is also important to recognize currently alaska florida nevada south dakota texas washington and wyoming do not impose state personal income taxes tennessee and new hampshire levy taxes only on income earned on capital such as interest and dividends these states do not benefit much from the federal deduction for state income taxes they instead must rely upon taxes which are not deductible such as the sales and use tax this arguably inequitable treatment is the basis of the legislation proposed in the 106th congress hr 1433 and s 1490 that would have reinstated the sales and use tax deduction for states without an individual income tax27 concluding observations the new administration and the incoming 107th congress have both indicated that tax relief is high on their legislative agendas although firm proposals or legislation have been offered many of the proposed changes would likely affect state budgets this report has reviewed and analyzed four tax instruments that link the federal tax code to state and local budgets the four tax items together represent range of tools in the federal tax code that are used intentionally or not to influence subfederal budgets 1 income exclusion for interest earned on qualified taxexempt bonds 2 the tax credit for state death taxes and income tax deductions for 3 local property and 4 income taxes these tools essentially maintain the current tax code and offer exceptions to the code alternatively fundamental tax reform such as changing to consumption based tax or lowering rates across the board would also have significant though perhaps less understood impact on the fiscal relationship between the federal government and state and local governments
