is an abridged version of crs report rl33842 the mcnulty memorandum attorneys fees and waiver of corporate attorneyclient and work product protection without the footnotes and citations to authority found in the longer report attorneyclient privilege and work product protection the attorneyclient privilege and work product prot ection are federal evidentiary privileges the attorney client privilege is one of oldest common law privileges the purpose of the privilege is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22588crs2 of justice it protects confidential communications with an attorney made in order to obtain legal advice or assistance it is availabl to corporations as well as to individuals although disclosure ordinarily waives the privilege the circ uits are divided over whether the privilege may survive disclosure for limited selective purposes selective waiver to government investigat ors or regulators at least since the supreme c ourt announced its decision in hickman v taylor the federal courts have recognized that an ttorneys work product gathered or created in anticipation of litigation enjoys qualified disclosure protection the protection can be waived but here too the circuits are divide d on the question of whether it can survive selective waiver in the form of disclosure to government inves tigator or regulator deputy attorney general memo randa and rela ted matters four deputy attorneys general have issued memoranda to guide the exercise of prosecutorial discretion on the question of whether crimin charges should be brought against corporation each includes provisions concer ning the waiver of attorneyclient and attorney work product protecti on and all but one address em ployee legal costs and joint defense agreements as well signed on june 19 1999 the holder memorandum was designed to provide prosecutors with factors to be considered when determining whether to charge corporation with criminal activity it emphasi zed that these factors are however not outcomedeterminative and are only guidelines the factors consisted of 1 the nature and seriousness of the offense 2 the pe rvasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation 3 the corporations histor of similar conduct 4 the corporations timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate in the investigation of its agents 5 the exis tence and adequacy of the corporations compliance program 6 the corporati ons remedial acti ons 7 collateral consequences and 8 the adequacy of non criminal remedies in the section devoted to cooperation and vol untary disclosure the morandum stated that in gauging the extent of the corporations cooperation the prosecutor may consider the corporations willingness to waive the attorneyclient nd work product privileges the memorandum also addressed the adverse we ight that might be given corporations participation in joint defense agreement with its officers or employees and its agreement to pay their legal fees althoug h several academics and defense c ounsel expressed concern over the possible impact of the wa iver feature of the holder memorandum survey of united states attorneys conducte d in late 2002 indicated that waivers were rarely requested on january 30 2003 the holder memorandum was superseded by the thompson memorandum the thompson memorandum was essentially reissuance of its predecessor little of the text was new that portion of the memoranda devoted to the waiver of attorneyclient and work product protections and cooperation and voluntary disclosure in general part vi was th same in both except for new paragraph added in the thompson memorandum the add ition said nothing bout waivers per but made clear the risks that corporation ran if it failed to be forthcoming early on or continued to support those officers or employ ees that prosecutors thought culpable yet this is one of the few amendments to the holder memorandum to some the whole scale adoption of language from the earlier morandum suggested justice departmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22588crs3 perception that the problem with the hold er memorandum was not its content but its application the policies articulated in the holder and thompson memoranda were at least roughly similar to enforcemen t policies announced by subs tantial number of federal regulatory agencies that call for voluntary corporate disclosure of statutory or regulatory violations some specifically mention the waiv er of the attorneyclient or work product protection while others seem to speak with sufficient generality to justify consideration on enforcement and sanction questions in may of 2004 the united states sent encing commission amended commentary in the sentencing guidelines that some read as an endorsement of this new more aggressive approach the change explicitly described the circumstances under which corporations failure to waiv could have sentencing cons equences although apparently crafted at least in part to ease corporate anxiety it seemed to have the opposite effect the following august the american bar association voted to recommend that the commentary be changed to state that waiver s hould not be considered sentencing factor the commission instead removed from the commentary the language that it had added in 2004 then on october 21 2005 came the mccallu m memorandum it made revision in the thompson memorandum but briefly ddressed the manner in which the thompson memorandums policy on waiver was to be implemented the various united states attorneys were instructed to prepare written guidelines for supervisory approval of requests for corporate waivers the effort did little to assuage critics on may 15 2006 the federal adviso ry committee on evidence reported proposed evidentiary rule amendment crafted to resolve the splits in the circuits over the selective waiver of corporat attorneyclient and work pr oduct protection the selective waiver feature of the rule however proved to be highly contr oversial and was dropped from the proposed rule that the judicial conference recommended to the congress congress ultimately accepted the recommenda tion and enacted rule with only inadvertent waiver and pr otective order components constitutional concerns in summer of 2006 court in the southern district of new york held in united states v stein that implementation of the thompson memorandums policy with regard to corporations reimbursement of the attorneys fees of its employees and pressure on them to make incriminating statements violated the fifth amendment substantive due process rights of the employees th eir fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination as we ll as their sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel the case began with th criminal tax investigation of an accounting firm and its employees after prosecutors issued subject letters to more than twenty of the firms officers and employees they met with the firms attorneys at the meeting the firm indicated that intended to clean house that it had already taken some personnel actions that it meant to coopera fully with the government s investigation and that its objective was to avoid indictment of the firm and the fate of arthur andersen by acting so as to protect the firm and not the employees and officers targeted the firm indicated that it had been its practice to cover the litigation costs of its employees but that it would not pay the fees of employees who refu sed to cooperate with the governments investigation or who invoked their fifth am endment privilege pr osecutors referred tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22588crs4 the thompson memorandum and the sentencing guidelines and indicated they would take into account any instances where the firm was legally obligated to pay attorneys fees they also indicated however that conduct should not be rewarded and that prosecutors would examine under microscop the payment of any fees that were not legally required in consultation with prosecutors the firm sent the subjects of the investigation form letters informing them that attorneys fees would be capped at 400000 and that fees would be cut off for any employee charged with criminal wrongdoing thereafter prosecutors advised the firms attorney when one of the firms employees proved uncooperative the firm then advised the empl oyees that they would be fired and their attorneys fees cut off if they did not coope rate and did so in cases of those employees who remained recalcitrant the firm then entered into deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors for the eventual dismissa l of charges under which it agreed to waive indictment pay 456 million fine accept restric tions on its practice waive all privileges including but not limited to attorneyclient and attorney work pr oduct and provide the government with extensive c ooperation in its investigation and prosecution of the firms former officers and employees the bythen indicted former officers and em ployees moved to have their indictments dismissed on constitutional grounds the court agreed that constitutional violations had occurred but declined at least temporarily to dismiss the indictments under the understanding that the government had agr eed that it would accept without prejudice to the firm in its deferred prosecution agreement or otherwise any fee arrangement that the firm should come to with its former offi cers and employees the court then announced that it would accept ancillary jurisdiction over civil action by the defendants against the firm and in subsequent decision gene rally denied the firms motion for summary judgment the court concluded that criminal defendant has substantive due process right to obtain and use in order to prepare defense resources lawfully available to him or her free of knowing or reckless government interfe rence it also fo und that th thompson memorandum and the pressure the prosecuto rs exerted upon the accounting firm to cut off the payment of attorneys fees for th firms former employees impinged upon the right while the court conceded that the government had compelling interest in investigating and prosecuting crime and in pr eventing obstruction of those efforts it felt the means chosen to serve its interests were insufficiently tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny on the right to counsel issue the govern ment contended that their conduct could not constitute violation of the sixth ame ndment because 1 it had occurred before indictment and thus before the right to c ounsel had attached and 2 the employees had sixth amendment right to pay for their c ounsel of choice with someone elses money attachment was obstacle replied the court when the motive or at least the clearly foreseeable result was to impede the employee s criminal defense after they were indicted as for the supreme courts someoneelse smoney comment it re ferred to defendants using the governments money money to wh ich they had neither right nor expectation by contrast in the case before it the court said the defendants had every reason to expect that the firm would have assumed their legal expenses but for the governments intervention the court resolved the selfi ncrimination issue in separate decision following defendants suppression motions here the government was bit more successful for although the court found viola tion in some instances it declined to do sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22588crs5 in others as general rule statements secured under governmental threat of job termination are inadmissible in subsequent criminal proceedings during the course of the stein case investigation several employees had initially refused to talk to authorities prosecutors then brought the matter to the attention of the firms attorneys and employees were told to cooperate or pa yment of their attorneys fees would be discontinued and if still employed they would be fired in so cases the coercion resulted in involuntary statements in others the employees made voluntary statements for reasons of their own notwithstanding the pressure to the govern ments argument that fifth amendment consequences flowed from the conduct of the firm private nongove rnmental actor the court found the firms conduct ttributable to the government yet in the end only two of the nine challenged st atements were suppressed legislative activity in the 109th congress both the house and senate judiciary committees held hearings on the policy reflected in the thompson memorandum during the 109th congress and in its final days senator specter introduced s 30 which among other things would have prohibited federal authorities from requesting waiver of orga nizational attorneyclient or work product protection or predicating the adverse exercise of prosecutorial discretion of the absence of such waiver or the payment of attorneys fees for their employees or officers mcnulty memorandum the mcnulty memorandum announced december 12 2006 supersedes the thompson and mccallum memoranda while it incorporates great deal of the substance of its pred ecessors the mcnulty memorandum rewrites the principles and commentary that address co rporate attorneyclient and work product protection waivers as well as those covering the payment of employee litigation costs it drops the specific reference to the waivers from the general statement of factors to be weighed when considering whether to charge corporation where earlier memoranda stated that waiver was not an absolute requirement for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion sugges ting to some that it was requirement under most circumstances the mcnulty memora ndum suggests that prosecutors waiver requests are to be considered the exception rather than the rule moreover the mcnulty morandum divi des attorneyclient and work product material into two categories category i c onsists of factual information category ii material is described in mu ch the same manner as opini on work product material the memorandum cautions prosecutors that only in rare circumstances s hould they seek the waiver of category ii material request fo r category i must be approved by the united states attorney in consultation with the head of the departments criminal division request for category ii information requi res prior approval of the deputy attorney general corporations re fusal to waive cannot be cons idered in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion the memorandum so adds an explicit provision concerning attorneys fees declaring that prosecutors generally should not take into account whether corporation is advancing attorn eys fees to employees or agents under investigation and indictment except in extremely rare cases where it can be taken into account with the approval of the deputy atto rney general initia l reaction appears to have been favorable but some critics continue to prefer an absolute ban on justice department corporat waiver requestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22588crs6 legislative activity in the 110th congress senator specter introduced the attorneyclient privilege protection act of 2007 s 186 early in the 110th congress the bill as introduced is identical to s 30 109th cong that the senator introduced at the end of the last congress it is also id entical to hr 3013 introduced in the house by representative scott and virtually identical to the version of that bill passed by the house the bill would have barred the justice department and other federal investigative regulatory or prosecutorial agencies from requesting that an organization 1 waive its attorneyclient privilege or attorney work pr oduct protection 2 decline to pay the legal expenses of an employee 3 avoid joint fense information sharing or common interest agreements with its employees 4 refrain from disclosing information concerning an investigation or enforcement action to employees or 5 terminate or discipline an employee for the employees exercise of legal right or prerogative with respect to governmental inquiry it would have also precluded using such organizational activity as the basis in whole or in part for civil or criminal charge against the organization the bill would have allowed the government to requesting information it believed was beyond the scope of the attorneyclient privilege or the attorney work product protection and it would not have prevented an organization on its own initiative from sharing the results of an internal investigation with authorities hr 3013 as passed by the house include d two subsections in proposed 18 usc 3014 that the senate bill did not one dealt w ith statutory authority elsewhere for federal officials to demand access to material covered by the attorneyclient and attorney work product privileges the second would have permitted federal prosecutors in determining whether to bring criminal charges against corporation to consider the fact the corporation has provided counsel for an employ ee entered into joint defense agreement with an employee or shared information re lating to investigation with an employee but only when those activities are themselves federal crimes the language of the two appeared first when the bill was brought to the house floor under suspension of the rules the brief statements preceding its passage did not explain or even mention the new subsections senator specter later introduced s 3217 which would have carried forward with some modification the features of the h ouse bill s 3217 expressly excluded from its protections certain terrorists organizations illicit drug cartels and crimeforprofit entities where the earlier bar applied to federal criminal and civil matters and investigations alone s 3217 covered adminis trative adjudications and proceedings as well where the earlier bills condemned governmental mands that an organization abandon its privileges s 3217 also remove d any claim of those privileges from the permissible array of prosecutorial considerations where the earlier bills permitted authorities to request information that they might reasonably consider beyond the scope of the privileges s 3217 also permitted them to seek information otherwise within the reach of federal grand jury subpoena privilege considera tions notwithstanding or to seek information whose privilege status was unknown to them congress adjourned before further acti on could be taken
