1989 crackdown in tiananmen square uschina relations have been troubled increasingly so in recent months there has been little agreement among policymakers over the direction of us policy in the posttiananmen era in the wake of tiananmen president george bush first imposed sanctions on china but later sought to protect the relationship in the face of widespread and sometimes heated congressional opposition things did not improve in the clinton administration relations remained uneven in 1993 and 1994 and by 1995 were deterioratin g steadily by mid1995 uschina relations were

clinton administration overview the clinton administration began in 1993 by rejecting what many opponents by then referred to as the failed bush administration approach to china as had bush president clinton renewed chinas mostfavorednation mfn status but clinton announced that he would link chinas eligibility for mfn status in 1994 with its progress on human rights congress supported this move and rejected measure to disapprove mfn extension to china in 1993 us relations with china remained uneven for the rest of the year for instance us officials imposed sanctions against china for missile technology sales to pakistan and searched chinese ship thought to be carrying chemical weapons ingredients none were found congress passed resolution saying that china should be denied in its bid to host the 2000 olympics which according to chinese officials influenced the international olympic committee to reach its negative decision still bilateral trade continued to grow and an intermittent dialogue continued including series of highlevel official visits late in the year relations improved somewhat in 1994 secretary of the treasury lloyd bentsen secretary of state warren christopher secretary of defense william perry and secretary of commerce ron brown all visited china with secretary browns visit came 5 billion worth of contracts with china for us businesses the administration waived the sanctions it had imposed the previous year because of sales to pakistan and china strengthened its commitment to the missile technology control regime mtcr the administration also delinked mfn from human rights and renewed chinas mfn status reversing the policy direction it had begun in 1993 and congress enacted new conditions for mfn but underlying bilateral tensions continued china conducted two nuclear weapons tests over us objections and the administration disclosed that it would modestly increase contacts with taiwan which beijing protested strongly relations eroded steadily in 1995 pivotal event in the downturn was the may decision to allow taiwans president lee tenghui to visit the united states initially opposed to the visit the adminis tration reversed itself under heavy congressional pressure the decision helped make taiwan once again the central contentious issue in uschina relations by midjune beijing had recalled its ambassador to the united states postponed other highlevel visits and suspended talks on range of issues chinese officials charged the united states with violating the 1978 joint communique which established us relations with the peoples republic of china neither chinas human rights image nor its us relations were helped by chinas arrest and subsequent conviction of harry wu us citizen andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97484crs2 activist on charges of spying wu was later deported in october president clinton met with chinas president jiang zemin but without bold breakthroughs in relations chinese leaders were upset because the united states had insisted that the meeting between the two presidents be held in new york rather than as an official summit in washington by early 1996 uschina contacts were accompanied by steady drumbeat of harsh protests and invective from chinese officials and official state media negative developments in the relationship outnumbered positive ones early in the year in january the chinese government expelled us military attache and warned repeatedly of the likelihood of military action in the taiwan strait in early march chinese military forces began conducting ballistic missile tests off the taiwan coast in response the pentagon disclosed it had dispatched two us carrier battle groups to the area in may us federal law enforcement officials ended lengthy sting operation seizing shipment of 2000 chinesemanufactured ak47 assault weapons being smuggled into the country by chinese stateowned armstrading companies although the united states announced in august 1996 that it would sell 420 million in military equipment to taiwan decision the chinese objected to there also were signs by midyear that both countries were trying to repair the relationship us officials made several decisions not to impose sanctions on china for arms sales and intellectual property rights violations and members of congress appeared to have moderated their approach to china by late in the year chinese leaders had muted their past inflammatory rhetoric about the united states and several highlevel visits had occurred chinese officials privately urged us officials to seize the opportunity of the improved atmosphere to move the relationship forward subsequently the improvements in uschina relations have been marred by allegations that the chinese government may have been involved in questionable contributions to the presidential and other campaigns in 1996 in an effort to influence us policy in 1997 us china policy analysts spent much of the first half of the year focusing on hong kongs reversion to china which occurred smoothly on july 1 since then congressional interest in china has increased in intensity by october more than dozen legislative initiatives were pending which either moderate ly or more seriously sanctioned china for things ranging from proliferation of weapons to abuses of human rights and religious liberty to use of prison labor for producing products for export many of the pending measures are strongly opposed by the administration which is preparing for the first official sinous summit of the clinton presidency scheduled for october 2829
