campaign to handle psychosomatic ills lecture given on 28 july 1964 thank you all right this is the what of the what audience twentyeighth of july twentyeight july what year audience ad 14 ad 14 hello audience hello now that youre here welcome all right youre about to hear today not necessarily the opening gun but certainly the first official opening gun on shot thats going to rocket around the world thats for sure and that is the campaign to take over and handle all psychosomatic medical healing in the world the american medical association for some time has been asking for this and so were going to give it to them there will be textbook on this subject popular type small textbook which i have just now begun to design and have it into its writing factors ive got these various points which are extremely germane to the problem at large and exactly how it goes across and exactly how it fits in and how it cant be challenged in the field of physical healing now healing is nobodys monopoly but if it becomes anybodys monopoly it will be he who can heal who will be the authority the person who is able to do this should be the boss of it in other words if you an auditor can heal and jugblug the big bad man from witchdoctorville with all of his sterling knives and his sterilized nursesexcuse thats mental slipand he cant do anything about it why then its yours isnt it its not his you see now that isnt some rule that somebody lays down that happens to be the way the world works all right theres fellow diddling around and monkeybusinessing with piece of carpentry you know hitting his fingers with the hammer and bending the nails and splintering the boards and dulling the chisels and dropping everything and so forth and carpenter comes along and he picks up the hammer and he straightens the nails out and he knocks the boards back together again the way they should be and he fixes up the job and makes it look very very neat and anybody who wants any carpentry done do they call the bum or the carpenter thats obvious that thats the way the world works see he who can do the job does the job and he who can do the job should be the authority for that job right all right i want to make one point very very clear instantly and at once that you know nothing absolutely nothing about osteopathy mending up femoral arteries pushing eyeballs back into the skull chipping bones plastic surgery you dont know anything about these things i want to make that point very clear to you you just couldnt do this if somebody held gun on you its very interesting somebodys lying there with compound fracture of the tibiayou dont know anything about putting compound fracture together you could put splint on it from your firstaid book or something like that but from that point on youd be pretty powerless isnt that correct im not being sarcastic audience yes all right lets keep that point firmly in mind because it means this it means when there is an acute injury or illness acute illnessthis word acute dont hang up on it it means immediate right now you know it doesnt mean exaggerated or something like that medically it simit means simply you know right now and rather temporary acute means temporary really itsit comes up to point and so forth now an acute illness then is one where you get cold and you get well from the cold and while you have the cold that is an acute illness correct when you got broken leg something like that why youre acutely injured dont you see thats not using it in quite the right context but youim trying to show you where the medical thing is because the leg isnt going to be broken foreverthe legs going to be mended see youre going to heal going to get well from it when youve gotwhen youve run into lamppost and so forth and youve got three busted ribs why you are acutely injured dont you see all right now if you have illness of an acute temporary nature or injury of an acute temporary using the same wordacute nature thats the job for medico you see he may do it well he may do it poorly thats not the point but hes the authority in that particular field nobody can do it better than he can see see he mighthe might be stumbling about it but hes stillnobody can do it better than he can youve got femoral artery that is pumping lifeblood and if anybodys going to stop it at all its going to be medico right thats where hes trained so in that field there the medico is the authority and we should actually grant him that beingness somebody comes down with cholera all right hes got cholera who is the authority in this field all right this person is physically sick whistle up the medicos maybe theyve developed something over in the pasteur institute or something of the sort that youthat will check cholera maybe something has happened he certainly will know the nature of the disease and know that its cholera and not bellyache do you see all right grant him that authority now where he errs is trying to take in terrain broader than his sphere of authority and there he makes serious error because hes completely lost dog when you get on to the last two brands of illness there are two other things which happen in illness now im not even trying to give you the medical terms of these things im just trying to give you english words that are very understandable but theres the precipitation of the illness or the cause of the illness whatprecipitationwhat brings it about what precipitates it what causes it or what occurs before the person gets ill that makes them then be ill do you follow that now hes only faintly into that he says if you have too much weight you may sooner or later have heart trouble dont you see so hes just faintly into that but he doesnt even really know that see hes faintly into that field thats the precipitation of an illness actually the medical term for this is predisposition person is predisposed to an illness something predisposes this illness the little kid goes out and gets his feet wet and gets cold well what got his feet wet see the rain see so this predisposes the child to cold but not all children get colds just because they got wet feet but nevertheless its predisposition it doesnt even say that its going to happen it isnt bound to happen after this predisposition but it may occur now the medico is only slightly into that fieldonly slightly he speaks of preventive medicine actually this is really not in the field of medicine at all but is in the field of public health and there are very few public health men that are medical doctors once in while medical doctors get into the field of public health but theyre usually engineers and theyve been to engineering school and theyre public health engineers and theyre the people that see after the water supply and knock off the overpopulation of rats down at the dock and all that kind of thing dont you see theyre trying to handle bits in the society which bring about illness see if youif you dont safeguard the water supply itll get contaminated if you dont safeguard the water supply why its liable to go wrong and nobodys going to know about it until half the city is dead you see if you dont keep the rats down down on the docks and that sort of thing why some ship with bubonic plague infected rat some russian ship in other words ties up alongside the dock whythat by the way is more than just crack at russia or something of the sort its absolutely true that the public health authorities go stark staring mad on the subject of trying to get the russians to deraticize their ships oh man and russian ships are just as determined theyre our rats theyre comrade rats and they tie them up outside the breakwater very often and they wont even land their cargoes or come near and they try to give the whole harborthey wont permit anybody aboard to deraticize them and so on they act like somebodys doing something horrible to them they probably think the public health men are fbi agents in disguise or something like this you know theyre completely mad the breeding area the first waves by the way ofi always think this is amusingthe first waves of rodents in the world came from russia its the steppeswas the genus area of all the rats you notice around i think thats terribly funny and nobodys ever made any capital out of it but the russian today is still trying to hold on to his rats and the public health men are out there and frankly there isnt doctor amongst them theyre just engineers and so forth and they go out and shoot the ship full of cyanide and every once in while try to also deraticize some poor stowaway or refugee that has been trying to escape from the iron curtain just to escape into the hands of some public health service you know crash of course theyre deader than mackerels they bring them out stiff as boards you know stowed away underneath the lifeboats and by the time the cyanide gas hits them thats the end of it pretty grim all right thats predisposition thats handling the predisposing causes of disease there are many of these many of these the reason garbage is collected in the cities and so forth is all under this heading nobody cares that it doesnt look good and nobody cares that it doesnt smell nice what it got down to is they found out if you had garbage in the streets and an epidemic started the population had had it it was of course this very thing im talking about which wiped out 50 percent of the population of england at one fell swoop here few hundred years ago theyve still got pits around where they just buried bodies and when that was over england was longer an agricultural nation and she never has been since she took to herding and she took to wool and it changed her whole economy one bunch of rats walking down the side of ship down mooring line changed the history of england so this of course then is quite important and great deal of attention is paid to this particular thing but its usually in along physical lines its physical you see they have to do with germs and water and climatic conditions and not permitting workers for instance to work on certain projects like radiumradium luminousdial watch painting dont you see and making everybody come in through the society for tuberculosis xrays and various campaigns of this sort youve seen these things they run all the time all the time well thats about as far as the society has gone and that is not the medical doctor actually in operation that is the civic authority trying to prevent epidemics of tuberculosis trying to prevent epidemics of various kinds and illnesses of various kinds you see now lets take after now you see youve got forebefore now theres an after and now what have we got now weve got predisposition and then weve got an acute illness of some kind or another thats twotwo things now weve got third thing and this third thing is prolongation marvelous long word prolongation perpetuation they speak of perpetuating factors they speak of the perpetuation of an illness but thats the area that we will refer to as prolongation the illness is prolonged now what makes prolonged illness prolonged merely that it goes beyond the expected term so any illness that goes beyond the expected termand thats very precise definitionany illness that goes beyond an expected term would fall into this category of prolonged illness and into the general class of prolongation you understand that now all right now therefore what have we summated here what have we summated here before we go on talking about the prolongation lets take look here and here we have over here the situation oflets say this is time plotted forward this way and these are three periods of time indeterminate and we couldnt care less about what period of time this is as long asfor the benefit of man well speak about it as lifetime or something like this you see but in this particular instance it would be the period of illness nowbut that still is not descriptive enough youll see why in minute because the period of illness can vary you see so weve got this period of time here and then weve got this period of time the first one here is predisposition this is the period of predisposition thats predisposition thats the period of it all right now this is the period of illness acute stage and this is the illness you see and this is acute simple as that illness acute acute stage see and by the way that is pretty standard the guys got broken leg they say six weeks see before he cansomething or other you see thats fairly standardized they say if you have cold itll take three or four days to get over it dont you see if youve got the measles itll take certain period of time you see you got the idea so that is well established in the field of medicine because it is their sphere i bring to your attention they couldnt tell you when illness began to generatebeyond them dont you see they couldnt they had means of any kind of establishing the point at which the person began to predispose toward an illness do you see so this period is completelythis period of predisposition is completely indeterminate in the field of medicine they have means of any kind of determining it if they cannot establish it as disease contact he went down to soho youll find them doing this all the time he went down to soho and had some bad fish and that gave him ptomaine poisoning all right thats great but actually their statement he went down to soho does not concern them at all and they dont know if its true and they dont know if its false and they dont know what he might have got this at home and youll hear them going around this point of time of when the illness began to be predisposed you see when was he predisposed to the illness what was the point of disposition well actually they could maunder around about this for some time it actually was predisposed when he got the idea two or three years ago that he ought to go down to soho occasionally and eat fish but this takes it immediately out of the field of medicine its longer in the field of medicine field of medicine begins with imbibing the germ one germ down the hatch see now if they could establish that point theyve got it you see then that becomes predictable they can establish this they can say that if you get yourself lot of staphylococcus why youre going to have an infection do you see this they then predispose their illness from the point of contact and therefore they could be fairly safe in the field of material healing so predisposition in the medical world begins with an indeterminate point where the fellow might have contacted germ or something of that sort for instance an injury the fellow got drunk at pub and drove too fast and had an accident so theyll go back as far as saying well he got drunk at pub and theyll say thatsthats predisposition dont you see thats predisposition of injury see they dont go any further than that because thatsi mean point out whats the common denominator here even germ is physical see the alcohol that he imbibed at the pub is physical thing so theyre only occupied with the physical predispositions of illness and that is the field of medicine in the field of predispositionis physical physical predisposition you understand even germ is physical see it has mass and so forth its physical thing you get enough of them together and they will dance on the head of pin very nicely see the alcohol at the pubsee thats physical it goes glugglug see it has fumes its recognizable you can put your hand on it you can get shortchanged over it see you see that male voice yeah so theyre physical here real physical now in the field of illness of an acute variety this again is physical illness in which the medical doctor is interested physical youre running high temperature see the leg bends in the wrong direction see the skull when fractured left detectable depression the measle bug bit and now in two weeks this person should be out of the woods or something like this see that should be all over but the bug istheyve even gotten it down to where its virus see its different kind of smaller bug but its still physical and all of these things in illness must be reduced in the field of medicineand quite rightly because thats the observable factare reduced down to physical illness from physical causes its not only that its physical illness it also has physical causes thats very important its physical illness with physical causes remember on your predisposition ive just told you that youve hadyouve had thispredisposition was physical in other words that what began it the glugglug in the pub see that began it the bug bit thats what began it the mosquito went bzzzzzzn nnowwboomp malaria see hes got it all figured out see so therefore its physical illness now lets take up this next long line im beating this to death with you because what im actually giving you is not something of interest im giving you something that you going to be using for long time and if you dont understand this right on the ball youre going to be complete patsy in trying to discuss it with medical doctor and thats who youll be discussing it with and you may even occasionally be discussing it with legislative body or judge you understand so get this down see write it down there in small balls of fire just back of the inside of the skull because this is how we make the breakthrough this is our dissemination breakthrough im describing to you and im describing you the elements that make this possible the frame of mind and the belief of the people associated with thisim describing those to you these things are observable these things are believed these things are carried forward very very hard in the society and the laws of the society relating to healing are based on what i am showing you at this minute now prolongation is this next period now this is all very neat the fellow got well and it all stopped here and this is why i amdidnt keep talking about prolongation because you have now run most of the gamut of the medical profession if he had one operation too many if they shouldnt have operated they might have prolonged the illness the improper treatment improper care might have prolonged the illness and their whole idea on the subject of prolonged illness would be whether it was treated soon enough whether it was treated properly and whether or not it developed complications during the period of acute illness thats what they assign any prolongation to see but theyve had it as soon as they get into that field theyve had it if an illness enters this stage its only within very finite limits that they can control it he had measles and developed complications and went blind or something and youll see medical doctors they all sort of stand with their hands in reverent attitude its all in the hands of god now who could have told that that would have happened see thatsthats their attitude toward it this is the area of total apathy what happens after this little boy has had measles for couple of weeks and all the other little boys that have measles are up there bouncing about and theyre all full of snap and ginger and its even got to point where their mother isnt even being nice to them now saying oh willie go out and play you know what happens so this little boyand hes had the measles and he didnt get well hes lethargic hes sleepy hes kind of stupid they put this under the head of aftereffects but in this particular lineup that is unusual and at that moment it steps on the banana peel and goes out from underneath in other words improper treatment or the absence of treatment and so forth would prolong the illness yes yes the doctor has that in the field of prolongation and thats as far as he goes into prolongation he gives further thought to this really hell tell you well you should take rest see he gives it that much attention and he knows these three factors which ive been talking to you about exist he knows these factors exist these factors and he knows best that person becomes predisposed to an illness by let us say contact with infected persons by irrational imbibing of alcohol and running his car into lamppost you understand thats how he gets there injury illness is predisposed by physical contact by physical means thats his educational line and the illness during certain period is called an acute illness he refers to it as acute not meaning that it is desperate but simply meaning that it is atits going over its temporary peak now lets move this over into the field of scientology youd say the cycle of action of an illness according to medical doctor would be from the period of its first physical contact to the expected recovery and any illness that follows that cycle of action is well within the medical doctors controlthat is if he knows what the treatment of it isits well within the medical doctors control he can do something about it this he understands its thatjust that one cycle of action from the moment of physical contact sliding right on over into the point of expected recovery johnny has measles he expects johnny in couple of weeks to be up popping about merry as cricket see now that is his cycle of action now his cycle of action complicates into just one little additional stage sometimes complications occur by reason of absence or poorabsence of or poorhealing in other words he assigns prolongation to healing the fact that an illness is prolonged extended moved out into the futurehe said well it was absence of treatment or it was improperly treated or something occurred or some complication occurred once more physically but at this stage he rather tends to wash his hands of it hes not quite sure what to do about this hell carry on with it youll see every once in while these boys go into desperate fit in hospital i think they did it with macarthurgeneral macarthur the expected recovery was not there see macarthur reached this period and complications set in so youll see them every once in while do this theyll go into hectic fury of new operations and youll see operation following operation following operation and theyve got him back in the operating room carving out the tibia see you understand youve seen instances of this theyat this point when the individual was first ill of whatever it is if it was surgical treatment that they were going to engage upon they said well thats very easy you remove the splene or something and then they normally why its expected the person recovers quite nicely thats expected yeah but they removed the splene and the guy didnt recover in other words theyve arrived at this point theyve mispredicted in some fashion or other and theyve arrived at this point up here without the expected result and they say what i do now well the poor bloke is in desperate state because once youve prescribed the treatment and that has run its course or youve done the operation thats supposed to produce the desired result and that has run its course youve just run out of textbooks now youll see little addenda occasionally in the text and itll say in casein case the patient turns green its because the gallbladder was also infected see youll see once in while little notation in the text but thats about as far as it goes it doesnt tell you how the operation is going to fail so this leaves him up riding on his own and here is his point of experience and his point of hope and that sort of thing itthese things just have to be thrown on the operating table again so he does another operation you see and then that didnt work either his expected point of recovery didnt come about so he now has to do another operation do you see and then he does another operation and unfortunately by this time the patient under that much operative shock kicks the bucket and hes never really noticed that he was fighting shock and mental reaction all the time anyway to him he doesnt even have word for shock except physical thing shock to him is physical thing its something happens to the nerves thats what shock is person is startled or medicallyif youif they try to explain to you what operative shock is what operational or what they call postoperative shock or something of this sort well they try to explain it in terms of well the anesthetic must have been too much or its some physical thing occurred here see but hes out of his element hes gone out of his element he not only cant prevent operative shock he cant do anything much about it the blood lakes in the center of the body all sorts of weird things occur the arteries longer pump blood properly and they leak and everything starts going to pieces like punctured carnival balloon see what is this well he tries to describe it physically now his route then is physical address to the situation from the beginning to the end so when you speak of illness how does this register on the medical doctor to whom you are speaking you say illness and you say healingyou say these two words and the medical doctor at once instantly and at once translates this into physical address thats his basis of understanding well lets give the bloke some credit for this most of them those certainly that have had experience and are not trying to hold public front and trying to shake down government for whole bunch of shekels that they are going to waste know they are up against it when they hit this word psychosomatic now psychosomatic is the most abused misunderstood turnedupsidedown term that anybody ever eared to have anything to do with psychosomatic it means actually purely but not in general usage the psyche experiencing or in pain or the psyche suffering do you see thatwhat theyre trying to say but of course psychology has gotten rid of the psyche very nicely by saying well we dont use the word anymore and as matter of fact we dont even know what it means thats in their own texts calling themselves at the same time psychologists which is quite remarkable because thats based on psyche psyche ismeans thetan its the greek word for thetan stop and think about that its the spirit its the being himself not badly misunderstood in the days of greece but misapplied since so when you say psychosomatic healing this translates in some wild way to the doctor that youre going way out he knows that this sort of thing exists now how he comes to believe that it exists how he comes to believe that there is psychosomatic illness and how he comes to believe that theres psychosomatic healing is more than i know since it has never been proven or demonstrated in the entire history of medicine field of hypnosis yes yes quite weird fellow has headache you hypnotize him say you havent got headache it disappears nobody did anything physical to this man lets look at where we depart see we depart at that exact point where there is physical contact where there is physical contact we depart into realm the medical doctor really knows exists now what fault does he find with this field well he finds the fault with this field only this that it encroaches upon his field he finds the fault that he doesnt understand it and it encroaches upon his field he doesnt know what it is and yet its in his road but i will tell you that the arguments which they use are quite real ill give you an almost verbatim quote from medical doctor explaining that psychosomatic practitioner was very dangerous the chiropractor he says adjusts the spine of course what these things are he explains glibly are slipped disks this is an oversimplification if i ever heard one because theres not just disks in that spine theres about twelve neurones that go down that spine and any one of those can get crowded and perhaps maybe its all slipped disks which are crowding the neurone but in actual fact theres lot of wild things going on you talk about spineof all the complicated pieces of engineering spine has got them all beat see and stress analysis study on the spine makes it impossible for one to exist see its got communication cables running through it and everything else while supporting the body and the head in an erect state its quite interesting but he says the chiropractor fixes up these slipped disks and in six patients this was all right but the seventh patient has tuberculosis of one of the vertebrae and the chiropractor adjusts the spine and the patient becomes paralytic for the remainder of his life therefore chiropractors dangerous this is direct quote now the man who said this was just out of medical school so he had the fresh dope their objection to psychosomatic healing only stems from the fact that the psychosomatic healer very often overreaches himself and enters the field of physical healing in which he is not trained and prohibits treatment of physical illness when it exists and that is the entire argument of the medical doctor against the psychosomatic healer he has real other argument hes got an argument of an economic nature of course the fellows might take some money away from him and so forth but this is histhis is his professional objection in other words the psychosomatic fellow carries too far he carries over too far into this sort of thing and gets out of his own field and gets into the field of medicine and then throws that aside because hes not trained and doesnt recognize anything in that field do you see that thats his sole objection so put that down with an underscore because its the sole objection he has real other objection except the psychosomatic practitioner attempts to handle things and thus inhibit the proper handling of things which would surrender to physical healing and thats his sole argument he hasnt got any other arguments but he recognizes he recognizes something else that when he gets into the field of healing by the psyche he is in nevernever land he knows nothing of and part of his argument in this directionwell british trained doctor for instance has been given six careless hours of instruction in psychiatry thats as close as he ever came to it in some hospital some drafty hospital standing around amongst the insane gibbering and screaming why hes given six long hours of precise instruction on the subject of this and thus parliament gives him the right to treat the insaneon six hours of instruction now thats pretty grim what do you think of some bloke that has been trained in scientology for six hours it would be with contempt wouldnt it but give the medical doctor his duehe recognizes his limitations he knows he doesnt know anything about it but he thinks when you speak of healing that youre speaking of physical things but if you point out to him very carefully that you are speaking of healing by mental means or mental aspects of healing he instantly gets very strange look in his eye because hes somewhere else now youve taken him out of the safe area of he took drink at the pub the drink made him drunk it upset his perceptions he drove his car into lamppost and thats why hes lying here with three cracked vertebrae in his neck see now we have bound him up in plaster and weve given him some sedatives and weve shot him full of b1 and in the course of four or five weeks he will be all rightwe hope thats healing now you have these same things but they are not physical they are not the same physical actions now unfortunately an auditor or fortunately an auditor really cant do anything with somebody whos running temperature of 104 i dont know if youve ever tried to process somebody with temperature of 104 and try to get anyplace with this bloke his present time problem is so howling his ability to asis things is so poor hes so far down the tone scale that you practically cant have process sufficiently simple to undercut his illness its almost impossible to get that far down the tone scale you can make maybe reach and withdraw from the pillow but quite ordinarily because the processing of this person is at much higher grade auditors quite commonly dont ever bother to take it down to these lower grades but try to finish off something or get at the source of the thing or something and they lay terrific egg its something i wont do somebodys running high temperature i will try to put them into communication at some very very low level and if i dont get an immediate and direct response i simply leave it alone in other words if i cant make my emeter howl and sing and needle bang both sides at once and the pc suddenly go oh thats why you know big cognition and so on well if i cant cut in on that at some low level of auditing i just leave it alone good way to fail is to try to process an acutely ill person the reason why is the ptp will inhibit case advance and the other reason why is the person has gone far below his common ordinary or average grade you see that hes way down below his ordinary tone level hes not living now at the same level he was living at hes very hard to reach hes hard to get in communication with youd have to treat him as though he was kid or something to get anything at all and he has hard time asising things and so forth but hes got this howling present time problem if youve ever processed pc for twentyfive hours with present time problem without happily helping out the ptp or straightening out the ptp on the pc then you had stuck graph that graph didnt move it didnt go up one iota and hes more prone to an arc break while being distracted by present time problem so if you also arc broke him the graph went down and that is prognosis of treating people who are acutely ill very bad the word prognosis is just expecting what will happenpredicting what will happen see some guy says i have aiii justi just got thisthisthis awful cold and im coughing and wheezing well ive done something for colds ill try to do something for itat very very light light light level the cold at once doesnt start to clear up why i tell him to go take rest see because i know what im up against now you would be very wise in your pcs to whistle yourself up type of doctor who gives insurance examinations and if somebody wants some auditing from you so forth tell them gogood go on and get physical examination the doctor sends him back and he says this guys got acute lumbosis howling ease of acute lumbosis whats your course of action all right hes got howling case of acute lumbosis you going to get anyplace processing him yes you could probably fool along with it yes you could do something to it and so forth but youreyoure taking the long road this persons actually physically ill you understand it isnt the person has migraine headaches everybody knows this is psychosomatic illness the doctor isnt going to even label that he says hes come back here with acute lumbosis which as you know is peculiarly medical illness what you going to do see this person ought to be in hospital man you say all right doc put him in hospital could id say could you do anything for him well yes wed have to feed him up on sumwhum and we have to do bumsum all right good how long will he be in the hospital oh well have to have him in the hospital couple three weeks you say all right put him in the hospital good very relaxed cooperative attitude not from any fear of you but this bird if anybody can get him over this phase of illness by change of environment by sending him to the hospital or by some other meansfine thats three weeks were not going to have to process pc going uphill the whole way while hes sitting in the chair coughing and sneezing and shivering and shaking and taking his pills every fifteen minutes you follow my reline of reasoning so thats three weeks of auditing you havent wasted and whether you can do something for it or not do something for it the medico says hes got acute lumbosis is there any cure for acute lumbosis oh yes we give himwe give him whizzle sticks to wuffwuff on you know and you say well great great great go ahead by all means give him whizzle sticks to wuffwuff on expected prognosis three weeks good fine thank you doctor im not telling you this because its insidious which it is this is simply very good sense very good sense youll have lot oflot more wins in auditing if somebodys around thatll take over acutely ill patients or something like this why fine fine by all means by all means now that doesnt saythe guy broke his leg it doesnt say that you shouldnt drop up at the hospital and give him the touch assists necessary to have him recover in two weeks instead of six by removing the trauma by giving him the touch assist dont you see that doesnt say you shouldnt do that this medico says hes got acute lumbosis all right you say good you dont have to know what acute lumbosis is beyond this fact has it got any prognosisand thats the question you have to askis there any prediction by which we can get this point this pointthe end point of the illness does this end point he says well he says tuberculosis of the spine he says the fellows had it well what should happen well he should go to sanitarium well whatswhats thewhats the prediction thats what youre looking for see whatswhats this point of recovery see well there isnt any you say well there isnt any particular reason to treat him either is there hell agree with it yeah thats right relatives feel better if you do well i wish youd make it plain to this fellows mother what the score is doctor let them make up their mind what theyre going to do about it but theres point ofnono point of end for this illness dont try to shove it down his throat and give him big sales talk on how youre going to get point of end on that illness because in the first place youre not talking the same language and youre not talking in the same field so its utterly pointless for you to say well i can process this person and get this person over this and well get to talking about this in minute its pointless its stupid of you to do so i dont know why you stand around and yammer at him youre not talking about the same kind of healing hes talking about and you cant help but get into disagreement with the bloke he says youre going to stand over this guy with hot packs and youre going to give him the shot in the gluteus maximus thats going to get him well thatsthis is the way its translating in his head see i just told you that i cant do this and produce result and youre going to stand around there with these hot packs and the mustard baths and youre going to get him well and that well i know its impossible so therefore youre fake youre ayoure dunce you see thats his whole attitude its just the attitude of outrage and your attitude will be outrage what do you meanwhat do you mean i cant process this guy and get aand get few things straightened out in his skull plate and get him up on his feet what the hells wrong with you you silly boob of course i can well youre not talking the same language so of course youre going to get in an awful argument youre talking in the field of psychosomatic healing and hes talking in the field of physical healing thats like martian talking to an earthman about pretty girl i dont know whats pretty girl to martian see and he sure wouldnt know what pretty girl would be to an earthman we just wouldnt be talking the same language hed say what i really like what i really likethose lovely claws and you say claws and you say thethewh and he says these beautiful sweeping antenna you say well i like nice hair too and he says hair oooohh so you dont yammer around like that with one of these boys he says well the guys got tuberculosis and expected physical recovery i would go as far as to correct one if he was being too mean to id say well youre absolutely right there is expected physical means of recoverytheres means of physical recovery you see i might go that far but i wouldnt just play dead dog with my paws waving in the air dont you see but id say well i agree that theres physicalno physical treatment possible for that is there well then it doesnt matter then whether we really hospitalize him or not does it thats right all right i wish youd write the family and write report to that effect would you he will hell give you nice factual report and if youre very clever and youre rather polite and if you get down these points ill be teaching you on the subject of these various aspects of this very broad field of healing and the difference between the physical address to healing andthe difference between that and the mental address to healingif you get these points all down youll be pretty slippy and hed probably write you in medical terms that will break your skull well go write him back when you give him report well write him back report with scientological terms that would break his skull dont give him any idea that these are understandable to him of course his latin wasnt understandable to you either i know ive received some lately the dippajalus went glubla booglegum you talk about terminology man of course these are the names of things with them and theyre the names of significances and so forth with us so that even the field of terminology has this vast difference between them do you get what im talking about the guy says to you then hes going to kick the bucket and we cant do anything for him thats not the time for you to stand and look at him and balefully and say well with processing why i can do something for him he knows very well that youre saying with physical healing i can do something for himthis is the way it translates so youre just calling him nogood practitioner he knows its impossible you say its going to beyoure going to do it so he knows then youre bum see just like youd know he was bum if he was pretending he could do something in the field of psychosomatics id laugh at his face as matter of fact thats why i laugh in his face because he pretends in this field today and he shouldnt pretend but addressed as an individual in straight visàvis and even addressed on an association basis these guys say psychosomatic medicine thats right we dont know very much about it new field but thats what youre into when youre into the field of prolongation now much more subtly youre into the field of psychosomatics why didnt the guy recover and this is where your argument with the medical doctor will take on very interesting note with him why didnt he recover what is this factor of prolongation of the illness what is this factor of prolongation what made this occur and you say well in actual fact that belongs in the field of psychosomatic healing thats where that belongsan unexpected prolongation the old girl had some illness about two years ago and shes never recovered she got cold about two years ago and shes still got cold the doctors just given this up see hes reached this point you got it hes reached that point the expected point of recovery up here where illness acute is ending and the person didnt end cycle bah now what do i do well hes got nothing he can do and theres your wideopen door you say all right the reason you cant do anything of course is this goes off into the field of psychosomatic healing and that doctor is very specialized field you have to be an expert in that field and you have to be terrifically well trained which is all very true you have to know your business theres probably some mental condition which is holding the illness in place and the doctor will say with beautiful oversimplification oh there is some more reason the person doesnt want to get well and i wouldnt put up with that or even be good fellow about it id say well you could put it that way i suppose actually its more complicated than that doctor oh hed agree with that yes oh i see its more complicated hell be giving you all the patients whose illness has gone back and beyond the expected term of recovery the people who have moved through this illness acute part of this band have reached the end of this and have gone right on being sick prolongationright on being sick from there on that he cannot do anything about and thats got him buffaloed because it is something that is running forward that he cant stop it has exceeded his cycle of action so therefore he has become the effect of it his cycle of action didnt end little willie had measles two weeks he should be up and merry as cricket two weeks go by three weeks go by four weeks go by and little willie is not merry as cricket now he has entered this field of prolongation hes up against this problem of prolonged illness not that its merely long illnessdont get that in crosswise its going on too long its going on beyond the time it should have stopped why and of course the answer is in our hands see the answer is directly and immediately in our hands there are psychosomatic elementspsychosomatic elements thats entered into this case he cant do anything about it the immediate response if you could do something about it or even say you could do something about it hed give you about third of his patients theyre the ones that dont worry him and dont pay him hes not doing anything for them man they make him feel like complete fraud its those that make him feel like fraud those he cant do anything for and that drives him right on down tone scale and if he had any help in that direction he would take it that fast and if youre the expert in psychosomatic healing in the severest definition of the wordhealing by the psychemedical doctor will say well why do you suppose this is well ill tell you the reason the broken leg there is going ongoing on doctor is the person for some reason or other has fallen out of communication with the area the circulation is very bad in that area he doesnt want anything to do with the area he actually can inhibit the responses to the area mentally he can inhibit blood flow to the area and if you shift his attention around little bit on that he might cease to do it and hed getthis broken leg would get well doctor dont try to explain it all the way to him of course i am simplyim oversimplifying it its more complicated than that which it is im just trying to give you sort of an idea of what you know you might see wrong just like i cant understand what you did in there with thewith the mallet and so forth well i dont expect you understand what i would be doing with the psyche you see us specialists have our own compartments but its just that he wont have anything to do with the bust where its broken there and we could probably get him to have something to do with that wed go into the matter do an analysis of the thing straighten it out figure out whats wrong and we would get the thing squared around well of course you yourself have come to realize the complications of the touch assist well how many factors are involved in one of these little touch assists that we toss off at level i you see what is this touch assist all involved with man well its involved with gpms in the first place theres root words to reach and root words to withdraw all kinds of things you see involved with this thing we call it very simply touch assist actually one leg will become sympathetic with the other leg and if you put his attention on the opposite memberyou must never give touch assist on just one side of the body you must give it on both sides of the bodyand you find that the opposite side of the body has gotten block up on the right side of the body you find these various things where youre working just in the process of working touch assists on people youll discover something very interesting swelling will reduce reduce reduce and then cease to reduce and then very brightly you say oh well i remember ron says you had to do it to the other hand you know well well do it to the other hand is what well do what the hell it went on reducing see it was somehow or other locked up against the opposing member of the body theon the opposite side and you cant help but observe these things and you say whats goingwhats going on here and you give few of these things and pretty soon youll find out that the bird really didnt have backache he had headache you know and then if you were stupid you shifted off to the headache of course if youd gone on treating the backache he would have gotten the backache back too you have to study things called shock patterns you have to studya person is hit in the leg and the shock of being hit in the leg in the engram actually traveled up to the top of his head and hes still got picture of the shock you see and hes still holding the shock from going up his leg so as you process him naturally you run this engram and he actually isnt actively doing this hes merely got the picture of doing this and the picture starts to discharge and the shock wave that should have gone all the way through and did go all the way throughbut he wouldnt have anything to do with it because hed already decided to stop it you seethat he didnt of course put him into apathy about it hes still got picture of all of this and all his emotional expression youve got the whole pattern of the actual shock wave that went through his body when he was hit in the foot naturally you do touch assist on the foot the guy will sooner or later if this was very bad blow in the foot hell have headache somewhere during that period of the touch assist the pattern of the shock waves and so forth run out because of course they all occurred time didnt stop hes too deep into his gpms just because he said im going to stop that pain right at the ball of my foot well lets look it over did he he didnt but he put stop in the engram thats stopping the pain at the ball of his foot and theres where hes held in the incident so you start doing touch assist you take his attention off of that you discharge that part of the incident naturally the shock wave which actually did occur sometime in the past then traces on through the remainder of its pattern and it goes on and runs out if you run the touch assist too long you put him back at the beginning of the engram again and itll run all the way through again touch assist is very laborious proposition if you were to run everything out all the way with touch assist see and yet its very safe to do but if you knew everything there was to know about touch assist and tried to communicate it to medical doctoris the only point im trying to make to youwhile youre standing on either side of this birds bed i think hed be there for some hours so the best way to do it is just say well of course this is in the field of psychosomatic healing and so forth and just like i dont know what you did on the operating table with that to begin with not that you didnt do it all right of course you wouldnt know what i would be doing to adjust his psyche and these are both specialized areas and theyre very complicated just let simplify it to point of saying the fellows fallen out of communication with that member of his body we maybe have to restore it maybe theres some ancient trauma there there may bemay be something there that doesnt quite meet the eye but were not trying to get you to understand all this doctor because were not treating you were interested in the patient and well see if we cant end this cycle of action on this illness so that it really does reach its end period aw hell if you could do that hed think you were magician see hed look on you with some awe you understand what youre doing now youre going to learn this well because all scientologists are very interested in this particular line and this is line that back in dianetics had more pcs per square inch than you could shake stick at and this is what people at level i are always complaining about and if youre very slippy auditor in this particular direction man youve got it made all the way through so you might as well enter the field of psychosomatic healing and work with it it isnt matter of its good way to get patients or make money and so forthits way that we ourselves have been avoiding id never worked out exactly where we belonged in this particular field well let point out to you that we do not belong here in the field of physical precipitation of the illness see the predisposition physical predisposition of the illnessthat we dont belong in physical see we dont belong in this period of the acute illness definitely not in that period definitely definitely not in that period guys got roaring temperature were going to process himgot rocks in your head man if he didnt respond to little communication and touching the pillow and so forth leave it alone youre just going to make him worse dont try to process very ill pc that goes way back when its very reasonable why it isnt that you could eventually do something for him that isnt the point if you went on on the subject of what has he done for this illness perhaps you would break through but actually every question hes answering he is so distracted if theres any possibility that in two or three days this person will feel better well lets leave it for two or three days till he feels better and then lets straighten it all out see what i mean you dont belong in this period of illness acute and as far as prolongation of the illness is concerned when an illness is prolonged by medical treatment such as insanity commonly is with electric shockthat insanity is being prolonged because there is the medical doctor trying to enter the field of mental treatment which he described more or less as treating the insane we dont care whether were in that field or not but hes again got physical idea that the brain is deranged in some way and hes got to do something physical to meet this physical condition dont you see and he just misreads this across the boards he has right to be in that field at all and the psychiatrist of course is somebody that the medical doctor really doesnt want anything to do with the psychiatrist is in the terrible minority he could even be neglected as factor in the community all the psychiatrists in south africa could behave been gathered in my small office in johannesburg you see what are these mobs of psychiatrists that were all talking about now youd have had to stack them in there kind of tight and theyd have all been standing up but they could have been packed into my office the medical doctors the boy he knows the psychiatrist is failure the psychiatrist is failure because he never solved the problem of prolongation for the medical doctor it isnt that psychiatrists cant cure illnessinsanity or not cure illinsanityan illness he calls insanity its not that the psychiatrist cant handle his own field of insanity thatthe medical doctors ah well that guys raving picking bugs off himself go lock him up in cell someplace just get rid of the problem get it out of sight of the community and so forth the psychiatrist more or less follows this tradition but its that the psychiatrist couldnt come in and take mamie glutz who was sick for five weeks when she should have been sick for two weeks and say now mamie what cooks how come youre sick for these additional three weeks whats worrying you kid the illness is actually now not an acute period its died down it simply didnt end see shes still sort of bedridden shes still lethargic she isnt up and about and at it how come all right the psychiatrist did not solve that point for the medical doctor so therefore the medical doctor has great love for the psychiatrist and would feed him to the lions at the least excuse and actually if you made your position completely clear and if the scientologist and scientology at large made its position completely clear to the medical doctor and if it agreed to this degree that somebodys bleeding from femoral artery is time for psychosomatic healing thats for thethe time for somebody with the tourniquet if its even possible to apply it and that you neednt go around trying to treat an obvious physical damage such as bashed skull with bone sticking out of it with touch assistall you have to do is to agree with that point and then your viewpoint becomes totally real both to you and the medical doctor see do you follow and all youve got to do for the medical doctor as service because this over here has another whole chapter with regard to itpredisposition how do people comebecome predisposed to illnesses you actually know quite bit about that you could even go back here and find the point where the fellow made the postulate to have the illness see you can do all kinds of wild things on this side of it but its help to the medical doctor as matter of fact if you knocked out all the predisposition hed starve to death thats real help and hethat wouldnt be real to him at all but this is real to him he has his hands on this every day there isnt day when hes industriously in the office on taking calls and so forth that he doesnt run into this prolongation in some fashion or another theres this old lady who is still nagging him she came to him to get cured of these lumps and shes still got these lumps and well he operated on the lumps and he did this and he did that and he finally just got sick and tired of her because shes still got lumps see and shes complaining about it and shes yammering and she does show up on his roll books and so forth she even pays him money hed rather not have the money hed rather not have anything to do with this old babe hes starting to get cross with her as matter of fact and hes getting upset with her and so forth because he cant help her and yet hes medical doctor so somehow or another hes got himself into position where he has to listen to all this you see hes supposed to do something about it makes him feel like failure and fake theres certain percentage of the practice of every medical doctor is in that condition im not saying that you should take over that section of the practice i should say you should take over the field and take authority in the field of psychesomatic healing psychosomatic healing psychehealing with the spirit and the mind it by the wayjust as slight historical note on the end of this here before i end this lecturehappens to be the oldest kind of healing there is oddly enough magic and so forth all traces along this line putting thepainting stone with the symptoms of headache or something like this and then busting the stone or something like this and very often the fellows headache would disappear treatment by symbological means and all of this sort of thing its an old old old tradition you actually are the oldtimer in actual fact and the medical doctor is the newcomer when ug was down there alongside the river with busted leg the first thought his companions had around him was that an evil spirit must have struck him down and they all cut and run for the hills and they left him sitting there with his broken leg see and pretty soon some specialist amongst them some specialist amongst them would go downwould develop and he would say well evil spirits all right he must have been struck by an evil spirit all right and he would go down and cast the various spells necessary to knock out the evil spirit or something like that and what do you know sometimes ug didnt die after all somebody had come back to see what happened to him matter how faint in other words their means were and matter how unreal they were matter how effective or ineffective and remember theyve very often been effective actually there are records that show that the healing done by the amur tribes medicine men and the shamans and so forththey got higher rate of healing in certain illnesses and so forth than hasis commonly achieved in the western world you see so theyre not really bum but theyve gone up and down along the line and so on and you are in the oldest tradition youre in the oldest tradition of course naturally its the oldest tradition because its the tradition of the spirit and therefore there is great basic truth sweeping behind your tradition thatthats all there is there and youre saying that can heal see thats what youre saying and the medical doctors saying well he cant do anything there really isnt one there and theres nobody around theres nobody doing anything about it and youve got to shift the parts around if you shift the parts around and youre lucky why theyll go back together again and it will all be all right but you are in the older tradition and theres reason why you should not take over this is just one small section of it and of course you have areas also whereby the individual is predisposed to feeling crazy and feeling pretty batty and downhearted and depressed and then this didnt go away for quite while so you did something about it well dont get your own cycle of this mixed up with the medicos physical cycle of this you see and prolongation is where you belong because thats what worries the world today thatif you want to do any psychosomatic treatment why then the proper course would be to get the individual examined by the medical doctor to find out if hes acutely ill and if anything can be done for that acute illness which is rather easy to do and which comes to positive end do you see and then if youve ruled that out and so forth why you pick it up from therewhether youve ruled it out or ruled it in see at that point you pick up the case and fix him up so that he doesnt keep on getting these spells or something of the sort thats psychosomatic healing you see its very very broad field and we are so broad that we very often fail to realize that there is field we dont have we are too cocky in our total ownership of everything and theres field which we really dont own and that is the field of keeping the artery from pumping when it is severed and that isnt part of our field you see ah yes we can go up along the line and say well all right operating thetan came along he could fix that up well yes he could mock up new body for the guy do you see it couldit can go that extreme but in the field of the workaday world of the little guy going to work and coming back again and that sort of thing when he breaks his leg he wants his leg put back together again fairly straight he hopes and there are some people in the society who do that and we want to know why this guy broke his leg well all right we could inquire why but we are really not vitally interested and the medical doctors not vitally interested until that leg which was broken failed to heal at the expected period of time and when that occurred then that door is wide open to us with crash because we are actually the only hope anybody has from that point on ninety percent of the broken legs heal whirpop and the rest of them the guy just goes on limping and limping and he has pains and he has ghost pains in it and he doesnt know what its all about so now im not talking about the field of general scientology practice in this lecture let make that clean to you too im not talking about the whole field of scientology im talking about just little particularized field of scientology that we could call psychosomatic healing and thats where we belong in the field of psychosomatic healing thats where we could be of service in the field of psychosomatic healing and thats where we would be acceptedin the field of prolongation of the illness thank you very much
