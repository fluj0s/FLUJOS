the imperial county jail as correctional officer as part of his job he had direct contact with female inmates 14 in or about april 2007 plaintiff adriana fernandez was being held at the imperial county jail as pretrial detainee in federal court defendant morris was one of the correctional officers with whom plaintiff came into contact with during her stay at the imperial county jail soon after her arrival defendant morris made small talk with plaintiff saying that he had recognized her from previous term at the imperial county jail the small talk from defendant morris progressed from flirtation to repeated and persistent requests that plaintiff engage in sexual relations with him defendant morris made it clear to plaintiff that her acquiescing to his sexual desires would benefit her during her time in custody while failing to do so would result in harsher treatment after engaging in sexual contact with defendant complaint for damages for personal injuries and violation of civil rights fernandez v county of imperial et 6 morris plaintiff immediately noticed that something had changed but it was not good change 2448 hours after sexual contact with defendant morris plaintiff started suffering the first symptoms of venereal disease she had contracted from defendant morris syphilis there is doubt that plaintiff did not have syphilis at the time she was admitted to the imperial county jail as she tested negative for it at that time 15 around the time that plaintiff first had sexual contact with defendant morris she was placed in solitary confinement the correctional officer in charge of taking plaintiff to recreation her only time out of her solitary confinement was defendant morris defendant morris again propositioned plaintiff for sex and she informed defendant morris that she was symptomatic she was already developing syphilitic sores the health of plaintiff did not wane defendant morris s sexual interest the reason for this is that defendant morris already had syphilis and it was he that had given it to plaintiff prior to their initial sexual contact defendant morris never informed plaintiff that he had syphilis or any other sexually transmitted disease had plaintiff known defendant morris had syphilis she would never have engaged in any sexual activity with him 16 defendant morris continued to try to persuade cajole

believes that there were other icsd and county employees who also sexually abused female inmates during this time period the actions of defendant morris and possibly other icsd and county employees could not have occurred but for the help assistance andor acquiescence of other deputy sheriffs andor county employees who had duty to protect the female inmates from this predatory behavior but did nothing to stop it the conduct of these individuals as well as those charged currently as does show corruption so pervasive that other correctional officers or deputy sheriffs must have assisted this

color of their authority as deputy sheriffs andor law enforcement officers or agents of the county 20 as proximate result of the conduct of defendants and each of them plaintiff was hurt and injured
