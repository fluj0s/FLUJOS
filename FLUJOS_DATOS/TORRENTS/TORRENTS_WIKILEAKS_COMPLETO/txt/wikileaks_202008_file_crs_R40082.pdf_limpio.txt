the standard 2008 premium although costs in the medicare part b program are expected to grow between 2008 and 2009 the standard premium will remain the same because steps taken by cms in recent years have resulted in contingency reserve in the supplementary medical insurance part b trust fund that is more than adequate higherincome beneficiaries subject to premium adjustment will pay larger premiums in 2009 while the standard premium will be 9640 beneficiaries in the four incomerelated premium categories will pay premiums of 13490 19270 25050 or 30830 per month beneficiaries who enroll

12 months of delay in enrollment andor reenrollment under certain conditions select beneficiaries are exempt from the delayed enrollment penalty these include working individuals and their spouses with group coverage some military retirees and so international volunteers the basis for determining the part b premium amount has changed several times since the inception of the medicare program reflecting different views of what share beneficiaries should bear as expenditures increased when the medicare program first went into effect in july 1966 the part b monthly premium was set at level to cover 50 of part b program costs while there have been many changes over the years the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 permanently set the premium at 25 of program costs so that generally speaking premiums rise or fall with part b program costs current issues related to the part b premium that may come before congress include the recent requirement that higherincome beneficiaries pay larger incomerelated premium the programs that assist lowincome beneficiaries with outofpocket medicare costs including the part b premium the amount of the premium and the rate of increase in recent years by 2080 projections by the medicare trustees indicate that medium earner will need 15 of his or her social security benefits to pay the part b premium and modifications to the

growth rate system sgr for calculating the annual update to the conversion factor used to determine payments under the physician fee schedule the sgr formula has called for reduction in the update factor ie lower reimbursement rates for each year since 2003 however congress has overridden the payment cut each year and passed legislation that has either frozen or slightly increased the reimbursement rates these actions have often led to discrepancies between the actual and projected part b costs in calculating the premium for 2008 cms recogn ized the possibility that congress would override the reduction for 2008 thereby significantly increasing part b expenses and provided for the maintenance of somewhat higher contingency reserve than would otherwise be necessary in calculating the 2008 premium because of this action the contingency reserve was sufficiently large that the 2009 premiums did not have to increase despite increases in overall part b expenditures 11

covered part b services removing required beneficiary cost sharing contributions deductibles and coinsurance adjusting for administrative expenses and interest and setting contingency reserve margin12 for 2009 the total monthly benefit costs of 46392 were reduced by 7336 for required beneficiary costsharing 1100 for the deductible and 6236 for coinsurance the resulting amount of 39056 was increased by 640 for administrative expenses and reduced by 526 for interest earnings an additional amount of 628 was removed for the contingency margin adjustment twentyfive percent of the resulting net per capita amount yields 2009 standard premium amount when rounded to the nearest 010 of 9640 13 although the standard premium amount in 2009 is the same as the amount for 2008 the calculations had different underlying figures the estimated total monthly benefit costs beneficiary cost sharing administrative expenses and interest earnings were all lower in calculating the 2008 premium than in the calculation for 2009 however an amount equal to 2370 was added to increase the reserves for the contingency margin adjustment in 200814 this cushion allowed cms to keep premiums from increasing in

place to create strong incentive for all eligible beneficiaries to enroll in part b with most persons over 65 enrolled in part b the costs are spread over the majority of this population and per capita costs are less than would be the case if adverse selection had occurred the delayed enrollment penalty is equal to 10 surcharge for each 12 months of delay in enrollment andor reenrollment thus the length of the period equals 1 the number of months that elapse between the end of the initial enrollment period and the end of the enrollment period in which the individual actually enrolls or 2 for person who reenrolls the months that elapse between the termination of coverage and the close of the enrollment period in which the individual enrolls for example if an individuals first enrollment period ended in september 2005 and the individual subsequently enrolled during the 2008 general enrollment period the surcharge would be 20 although the elapsed time covers total of 30 months of delayed enrollment the episode includes only two full 12month periods there is upper limit on the amount of the surcharge that may apply and the penalty continues to apply for the entire time the individual is enrolled in part b under certain conditions select beneficiaries are exempt from the delayed enrollment penalty beneficiaries who are exempt include working individuals and their spouses with group coverage some military retirees and some international volunteers working individual andor the spouse of working individual may be able to delay enrollment in medicare part b

information than insurers about their own health status and expected health care needs make insurance purchasing decisions based on their expected use of the insurance benefit their decision to purchase insurance is based on comparison of the value of the insurance coverage given their expected use and the cost of the insurance should only or disproportionately persons who turn out to be high health care users enroll in the program per capita costs would increase thereby making the health insurance purchase decision less attractive for healthier and presumably less costly beneficiaries who then might drop out of the program subsequent iterations of this cycle would drive premium costs higher and higher for smaller and smaller subset of ever sicker and costlier beneficiaries 16 persons permitted to delay coverage without penalty are those persons whose medicare benefits are determined under the medicare secondary payer msp program under msp an employer with 20 or more employees is required to offer workers aged 65 and over and workers spouses aged 65 and over the same group health insurance coverage as is made available to other employees the worker has the option of accepting or rejecting the employers coverage if he or she accepts the coverage the employer plan is primary ie pays benefits first for the worker andor spouse over age 65 medicare becomes the secondary payer ie fills in the gaps in the employer plan up to the limits of medicares coverage similarly group health plan offered by an employer with 100 or more employees is the primary payer for employees or their dependents who are on the medicare disability program 17 the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 added an additional exception to the penalty this exception is for disabled persons who at the time they first beco eligible for part b are enrolled in group health plan regardless of size by virtue of their current or former employment and b whose continuous enrollment under the plan is involuntarily terminated at time when their enrollment in the plan is by virtue of their or their spouses former ie not current employment these individuals have speci sixmonth enrollment period beginning on the first day of the month in which the termination occurs individuals who fail to enroll during this period would be considered to have delayed enrollment

several times since the inception of the medicare program reflecting different views of what share beneficiaries should bear as expenditures increased when the medicare program first went into effect in july 1966 the part b monthly premium was set at level to cover 50 of part b program costs legislation enacted in 1972 limited the annual percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage by which social security benefits were adjusted for changes in the costofliving ie colas under this formula revenues from premiums soon dropped from 50 to below 25 of program 18 the secretary of the health and human services was required to rebate any penalties paid for months on or after january 2004 which were longer applicable as result of this provision

as measured by the consumer price index on which the social security cola is based see appendix for yearby year details from the early 1980s congress regularly voted to set part b premiums at level to cover 25 of program costs in effect overriding the cola limitation the 25 provisions first became effective january 1 1984 with general revenues covering the remaining 75 of part b program costs premiums increased in 1989 as result of the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 pl 100360 which added catastrophic coverage premium to the part b premium the act was repealed in november 1989 and the part b premium for 1990 fell as result see figure 1 congress returned to the general approach of having premiums cover 25 of program costs in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 bra 90 pl 101508 however obra 90 set specific dollar figures rather than percentage in law for part b premiums for the years 1991 1995 these dollar figures reflected congressional budget office cbo estimates of what 25 of program costs would be over the fiveyear pe riod however program costs grew more slowly than anticipated in part due to subsequent legislative changes and as result the 1995 premium of 4610 actually represented 315 of medicare part b program costs the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 pl 10366 extended the policy of setting the part b premium at level to cover 25 of program costs for the years 19961998 as was the case prior to 1991 percentage rather than fixed dollar figure was used which meant that the 1996 premium 4250 and the 1997 premium 4380 were lower than the 1995 premium 4610 bba 97 permanently set the pr emium at 25 of program costs so that generally speaking premiums rise or fall with part b program costs 19

expenditures as the two are linked although the precise relationship has changed with modifications to the statute there are instances when the premium has declined or has not changed from year to year and many of the policies discussed above were in response to the impact of part b program expenditure increases on beneficiary premiums in nominal dollar terms not adjusted for inflation the part b premium has risen from 300 in 1966 to 9640 for 2009 see figure 1 over that period the premium has decreased from year to year twice once from 1989 3190 to 1990 2860 as result of the repeal of the catastrophic coverage act as mentioned above and once from 1995 4610 to 1996 4250 as result of the transition from premium as determined by fixed dollar amount under obra 90 to 25 of costs as directed under obra 93 the premium has more than doubled in recent years increasing from 4550 in 2000 to 9640 in 2008 and 2009 19 bba 97 made change that had the effect of increasing the part b premium over time prior to bba 97 both parts and b of medicare covered home health services payments were made under part except for those few persons who had part coverage in order to extend the solvency of the

regardless of their income over time number of proposals have been offered that would increase the share of part b costs borne by higherincome individuals some observers suggested that it might be inappropriate for taxpayers to pay through general revenue financing threequarters of part b costs for these persons as this could result in low income and middle income working persons subsidizing higherincome elderly persons however others have argued that relating premiums to income would relieve some of the financial pressure on the program even though the transition might represent first st ep in moving away from the entitlement nature of the medicare program further some individuals have suggested that higherincome enrollees might be tempted to drop medicare part b coverage as result of the higher premium although as practical matter the number of beneficiaries who have this as an option might be few as there are few alternatives available for the medicareeligible population in the private insurance market 23 the medicare modernization act of 2003 mma increased the part b premium percentage for highincome enrollees beginning in 2007 the mma w ould have phased in the increase

regardless of income the part b premiums for highincome beneficiaries are based on greater beneficiary share of total expenditures that increases with inco beginning in 2007 individuals whose modified adjusted gross income agi exceeded 80000 and couples whose modified agi exceeded 160000 were subject to higher premium amounts when both members of couple are enrolled in part b each pays the

modify the calculation of the income levels currently the income levels are indexed to changes in the consumer price index cpi for urban consumers president george w bush proposed eliminating the annual cpi adjustments in his proposed 2008 budget27 such modification would result in more beneficiaries being subject to the higher premium each year as incomes increased in part due to inflation while the thresholds remained stagnant while this change in policy would yield cost savings to the government b ecause more and more beneficiaries would pay higher premiums it could lead to problems

part b pr emiums has received considerable attention in recent years since beneficiary premiums are currently required to cover 25 of total expenditures the part b premium will increase as total medicare part b expenditures increase thus recent growth in expenditures for physician services led by the increase in imaging and diagnostic services produces pressure for beneficiary premiums to increase proportionately to cover the 25 share of total expenditures the medicare trustees project that premiums for parts b and d will grow at faster rate than social security benefits and consume greater proportion of benefits over time 35 in 2080 under conservative assumptions medium earner is projected to need 15 of his or her benefits to pay the part b premium and 23 of his or her benefits to pay combined parts b and d premiums 36 as noted an individuals social security payment cannot decrease from one year to the next as result of an increase in the part b premium except for those subject to the incomerelated premium however some observers have suggested that beneficiaries should not face the prospect of losing large portion of their costofliving cola increase further the hold harmless provision does not apply to the premiums for the part d prescription drug program individuals enrolled in part d plan with higher premium or newly enrolling in plan in 2009 might see reduction in their social security checks 37 32 in general medicaid payments are shared between the federal government and the states according to matching formula however expenditures under the qi1 program are paid for 100 by the federal government from the part b trust fund up to the states allocation level state is only required to cover the number of persons who would bring its spending on these population groups in year up to its allocation level any expenditures beyond that level are paid by the state 33 pl 110173 section 203 34 pl 110275 section 111 35 the boards of trustees federal

physician payment updates and the recent history of congressional actions to override the statutory formula creates an ongoing dynamic that affects the part b premium typically the premium calculations are based on current law provisions that include formula for calculating the annual update to the physician fee schedule this formula has stipulated reduction in the fee schedule conversion factor for every year since 200338 under current law significant reduction 21 is slated to occur in 2010 and for number of subsequent years39 each change made to avert the scheduled reductions had and continues to have the effect of increasing overall part b costs beyond the current law baseline and by extension the part b premium some proposals before congress have attempted to shield medicare beneficiaries from premium increases by including holdharmless provisions however these approaches would in turn place additional pressure on the treasury and the general revenues that are needed to cover the expenses not offset by premiums g14g138g157g142g561g7g151g155g152g149g149g150g142g151g157g561g18g142g151g138g149g157g162g561 periodically proposals have been offered to modify or eliminate the part b premium penalty either for all enrollees or alternatively for selected population group for example number of persons suggested that the penalty should not apply to certain military retirees who declined part b coverage as noted above these persons now have access to tricare for life provided they enroll in part b mma waived the part b penalty for persons enrolling in both programs by the end of 2004 some have suggested further modifying the penalty provision to limit both the amount and the duration of the surcharge such as is the case for delayed part enrollment while some of the reasons for limiting the part penalties could also be offered for part b there are some significant differences first since almost all aged persons are automatically entitled to part the part delayed enrollment penalty could affect only small number of persons compared to the potential number under part b second persons who voluntarily enroll in part pay the full actuarial cost of part coverage while part b enrollees currently pay only 25 of the actuarial cost with federal general revenues picking up the remainder third the amount of the maximum continued accounted for separately and has effect on the part b premium however beneficiaries enrolled in mapd plans that provide part b and part d services as well as part services may face single premium that could increase at rate different than the standalong part b premium 38 congress overrode the reductions that were slated to occur in 20032009 under the consolidated appropriations resolution car pl 1087
