government and finance division the size and role of government economic issues summary the size and role of the government is one of the most fundamental and enduring debates in american politics economics can be used to analyze the relative merits of government intervention in the economy in specific areas but it cannot answer the question of whether there is too much or too little government activity overall that is not to say that one cannot find many examples of government programs that economists would consider to be highly inefficient if not counterproductive way to achieve policy goals reducing inefficient government spending would benefit the economy however reducing efficient government spending would harm it and reducing the size of government could involve either one government intervention can increase economic efficiency when market failures or externalities exist political choices may lead to secondbest economic outcomes however and some argue that for that reason market failures can be preferable to government intervention in the absence of market failures and externalities there is little economic justification for government intervention which lowers efficiency and probably economic growth but government intervention is often based on the desire to achieve social goals such as income redistribution economics cannot quantitatively value social goals although it can often offer suggestions for how to achieve those goals in the least costly way the government intervenes in the economy in four ways first it produces goods and services such as infrastructure education and national defense measuring the effects of these goods and services is difficult because they are not bought and sold in markets second it transfers income both vertically across income levels and horizontally among groups with similar incomes and different characteristics third it taxes to pay for its outlays which can lower economic efficiency by distorting behavior not all taxes are equally distortionary however so there are ways of reducing the costs of taxation without changing the size of government furthermore deficit spending does not allow the government to escape the burden of taxation since deficits impose their own burden finally government regulation alters economic activity the economic effects of regulation are the most difficult to measure in terms of both costs and benefits yet they cannot be neglected because they can be interchangeable with taxes or government spending there are many different ways to measure the size of the government making its economic effects difficult to evaluate budgeting conventions are partly responsible tax expenditures offsetting receipts and collections and government corporations are all excluded from the budget but some governmental functions like regulation simply cannot be quantified robustly discussions about the overall size of government mask significant changes in the composition of government spending over time spending has shifted from the federal to the state and local level federal production of goods and services has fallen while federal transfers have grown significantly today nearly twothirds of federal spending is devoted to social security medicare medicaid interest payments and national defense thus there is limited scope to alter the size of government without fundamentally altering these programs the share of federal spending devoted to the elderly has burgeoned over time and this trend is forecast to continue contents how does the government affect the

research assistance the size and role of government economic issues the appropriate size and role of the government is one of the most fundamental and enduring debates in american politics what role does the state play in economic activity how is the economy affected by government intervention many of the arguments surrounding the proper size of government are economic in nature and they will be discussed in this report how does the government affect the economy government activity affects the economy in four ways the government produces goods and services including roads and national defense less than half of federal spending is devoted to the production of goods and services the government transfers income through both the tax system and outlays popular perception typically focuses on transfers across income classes through the progressive income tax system and meanstested benefits referred to as vertical redistribution but vertical redistribution is dwarfed by horizontal redistribution transfers unrelated to income class the largest beneficiaries of transfers are the elderly through programs such as social security the government collects taxes and that alters economic behavior for instance taxes on labor change the incentives to work while taxes on specific goods eg gasoline change the incentive to consume and produce those goods the government regulates economic activity for number of reasons including environmental protection workplace safety and consumer protection the economic impact of regulation is probably the hardest and most contentious to measure of the four types of government economic activity1 1 the term regulation is used in this report in the popular sense to encompass laws mandates and government regulations that affect commerce crs2 how large is the government before assessing how the government affects economic activity it is necessary to agree upon how to measure the size of the government for number of reasons this exercise is less straightforward than it may seem the size of government can be expressed in number of different units of measurement should the size of government be measured in dollars on per capita basis by total employees or as percentage of gdp each measurement has its advantages but some measurements have more shortcomings than others if measured in dollars then those dollars should be adjusted for inflation the purpose of measurement is to gauge the resources at the governments disposal and dollar of tax revenue in 1946 would buy 1063 of goods and services in 2007 because of inflation2 measuring the size of government by the number of employees is imprecise because the government can substitute capital for labor over time to accomplish the same tasks with fewer employees for example the governments purchase of computers has rendered many clerical jobs obsolete the federal government can also pay workers in the private labor force through contracts and grants or allow state and local government workers to deliver federal programs in place of federal public servants one estimate puts the number of private and state and local government workers working for the federal government at more than seven times the size of the federal workforce3 comparisons over time that do not incorporate demographic change are arguably misleading because government spending per capita is more meaningful than total government spending 4584 billion in federal spending in 1946 amounted to 3242 per person then but would only finance 1533 per person in 2006 but over long periods of time because of the power of compounding any level of government spending will appear to be insignificant unless it is expressed as fraction of gross domestic product gdp measurement that incorporates inflation and population growth in 1944 at the height of world war ii federal spending was less than half of todays federal budget in constant inflationadjusted dollars yet outlays in 1944 accounted for 437 of gdp whereas the budget in 2007 accounted for only 20 of gdp4 nevertheless some argue that stating the size of government as percentage of gdp understates increases in government spending in the short term particularly in years when growth is high for example those who claim that government spending increased sharply in 2000 point to the fact that it increased by 25 in constant dollars those who claim the increase was modest point to the fact that it fell by 02 percentage points of gdp since this report focuses on longterm trends all measurements are made as percentage of gdp 2 federal reserve bank of minneapolis what is dollar worth httpwwwminneapolisfedorgresearchdatauscalc 3 paul light the true size of the government washington brookings institution press 1999 4 all budget data are measured on fiscal year basis unless otherwise noted crs3 the size of the government can be measured by expenditures outlays or revenues receipts5 at times when the budget deficit is large the difference between the two measures is significant as seen in figure 1 measured by receipts the size of government in the postwar period peaked in 2000 measured by outlays the size of government peaked in 1983 in 2000 the peak year as measured by receipts outlays were at their lowest level since 1966 government has grown since 2000 when measured by outlays and shrunk

considered better measure of the size of government than receipts first receipts are more volatile than outlays and are only indirectly controlled by legislators they are particularly sensitive to economic conditions receipts did not peak in 2000 because of changes in the tax code but because of the interaction between the tax code and the extremely rapid growth in taxable income second outlays and revenues can temporarily diverge because of budget deficits but eventually the budget must be brought back into balance therefore cutting taxes without corresponding spending cuts does not permanently reduce the size of government and measuring the size of government by revenues gives the misleading impression that government is smaller than it is furthermore although people often refer to the burden of high taxes that burden cannot be avoided in the long run through deficits because deficits impose burden that is every bit as real as taxes6 in other words given level of spending requires the resources of individual 5 the data reported in budget documents are net receipts and net outlays and do not include offsetting receipts and collections which are described below this report will follow the standard convention of defining receipts and outlays as net measurements unless otherwise noted 6 see also crs report rl30520 the national debt who bears its burden by marc labonte and gail makinen and crs report rl31775 do budget deficits raise interest rates and is this the relevant question by marc labonte crs4 taxpayers whether deficit financed or tax financed all that changes is the timing of its incidence while it is sometimes argued that deficits hold down the growth in spending for political reasons deficits directly increase the outlays needed to maintain fixed level of government services in the future by increasing interest payments on the national debt in other words if spending is constant over time 1 tax cut today will lead to tax increase of 1 plus compounded interest in the future this raises further question if interest payments are the direct result of deferring payments for past spending to the present should they be included in comparisons of the size of government over time including net interest payments as current practice does makes the government appear to be larger following periods of large deficits relative to the period before the deficits excluding them gives different budget picture for example high interest payments in the 1990s and 2000s obscure the fact that other outlays at the time were as small as they had been in the 1960s since this report focuses on longterm trends it measures the size of government by spending when measured by outlays the size of government followed an upward trend until 1983 and has followed downward trend ever since outlays rose from 147 of gdp in 1947 to 235 in 1983 they then fell to 184 of gdp in 2000 and have increased since outlays were below 20 of gdp from 19471974 with the exception of 1953 and 1968 above 20 of gdp from 1975 1996 and were below 20 of gdp from 1997 to 2002 but reached 20 of gdp again in 2003 and 20052007 look at total spending masks the large compositional changes in spending over the postwar period in nutshell the governments largest activity has gone from national defense in the 1960s to transfers to the elderly today defense spending peaked at 95 of gdp in 1968 it then fell to 47 of gdp in 1978 rose to 62 of gdp in 1986 before beginning sharp decline and stood at 40 of gdp in 2007 at the same time mandatory spending excluding net interest has risen from 49 of gdp in 1962 to 106 in 2007 mandatory spending programs for which the elderly are major beneficiaries make up nearly threequarters of all mandatory spending7 non defense discretionary spending which includes spending on transportation education the environment and numerous other government activities grew from 34 of gdp in 1962 to 52 in 1980 it has been below 4 of gdp since 1984 and stood at 36 of gdp in 2007 net interest on the publicly held national debt grew significantly in the 1980s and 1990s because of the governments budget deficits in the postwar period to the 1980s it had always been below 2 of gdp in the 1980s and early 1990s it exceeded 3 of gdp 7 mandatory spending programs for which the elderly are major beneficiaries include social security medicare supplemental security income veterans benefits and federal civilian and military pensions this calculation does not include medicaid which finances long term care crs5 figure 2 federal

on fiscal year basis this data series not available before 1962 it is useful to remember that federal spending is overwhelmingly devoted to handful of activities defense spending social security medicare medicaid and interest payments on the national debt accounted for nearly twothirds of all federal outlays today thus any proposal to reduce the governments size would be unlikely to make much of dent in overall spending unless it reduced one or more of these programs government transfers and government purchases of goods and services have different and distinct effects on the economy economists draw distinction between government outlays spent on goods and services purchased from the private sector or produced directly by the government and outlays that transfer resources from one set of private individuals taxpayers to another since significant portion of government spending is devoted to government transfers to individuals much of the revenue collected through taxation is ultimately spent by the private sector on private sector goods and services after it is transferred by the government government transfers do not employ us capital and labor except to administer those transfers in the same way as government production of goods and services government transfers basically shift private sector crs6 spending from one group of private individuals to another8 by shifting income from its market allocation government transfers still have an effect on the economy however because the transfers and taxes to finance them alter the incentives to work and save the merits of government transfers cannot typically be evaluated on the basis of economic efficiency alone since they often implement social goals by contrast government production of goods and services falls comfortably within the framework of economic efficiency based on whether or not the spending addresses market failure as explained in the next section figure 3 government purchases and transfers

government historical tables table 142 note data measured on fiscal year basis grants to state and local government not included interest is defined as net interest paid on the national debt subsidies are measured as net outlays to government corporations transfers can result in vertical redistribution transfers among income classes or horizontal redistribution transfers unrelated to income class most transfers on the spending side of the budget result in horizontal redistribution for example the largest portion of government transfers are directed to the elderly notably through social security social security contains an element of vertical redistribution in that the taxbenefit formula is more favorable as income declines but its main function is horizontal redistribution another large category of transfers is devoted to interest on the national debt which represents transfer from taxpayers to bondholders transfers also include net subsidies to government corporations which are discussed below the largest portion of government production is directed to national defense9 8 most transfers are from us taxpayers to other americans some transfers go to foreigners however in 2005 the us government paid 134 billion to foreigners in interest payments on the national debt and 33 billion in other transfers eg foreign aid transfers to foreigners made up 11 of total transfers see bea national income and product accounts table 32 9 data on federal production of goods and services and transfers does not include grants to continued crs7 the distinction between government transfers and government production of goods and services becomes important when making historical comparisons total federal outlays have remained in the range of 20 with slow upward trend for most of the postwar period but this masks large changes in the composition of federal outlays since the 1950s outlays for federal production and transfers have moved in the opposite direction while government production was nearly three times as large as government transfers in the early 1950s production is only half as large as transfers today measuring the size of government by receipts or outlays omits tax expenditures tax expenditures are defined in the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93 344 as revenue losses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow special exclusion exemption or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit preferential rate of tax or deferral of liability they take many forms and cover many policy areas senate budget committee compendium identifies 160 corporate or income tax expenditures in current law10 revenue loss attributable to these tax expenditures totaled 943 billion or 72 of gdp in fy200611 this is almost as large as total discretionary spending defense and non defense in fy2006 yet tax expenditures do not show up directly on the outlay or revenue side of the budget12 table 1 lists the largest tax expenditures as comparison the tax expenditure for the deduction of mortgage interest is more than one and half times as large as the entire fy2006 appropriation for the department of housing and urban development hud 9 continued state and local governments noncomparable data series on grants to state and local governments from omb suggests that grants for transfers are about twice as large as grants for production in recent years 10 us congress senate committee of the budget tax expenditures compendium of background material on individual provisions committee print 10972 109th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2006 11 according to the compendium this is the sum of the estimated revenue gains from repealing each tax expenditure individually it is not the estimated revenue gain from repealing all tax expenditures simultaneously since that would lead to interactions among the repeal of different expenditures 12 generally the refundable portion of tax expenditure is counted as an outlay but very few expenditures are refundable so only small proportion of total tax expenditures is counted as outlays refundable credits are tax credits which are paid when the taxpayer has tax liability crs8

analytical perspectives table 193 note data measured on fiscal year basis crs9 economists would argue that in many ways tax expenditures are equivalent to government spending and which is preferable depends on which is more effective or efficient way of achieving any particular goal for example 1000 child tax credit is equivalent to the government sending check for 1000 to parents who have eligible children and meet the credits income requirements similarly tax deduction for mortgage interest for taxpayer in the 33 marginal income tax bracket is equivalent to the government sending the taxpayer check for 33 cents for every dollar of mortgage interest paid from revenue perspective the equivalence comes from the fact that marginal rates must be raised to the same extent to finance an expenditure whether it is tax expenditure or an outlay because tax provisions are permanent unless they include an expiration date however revenue loss from specific expenditures may rise over time automatically without congressional action unlike appropriated spending if this equivalence argument is correct measures of the size of government that omit tax expenditures drastically underestimate its size measuring the size of government by receipts or outlays omits offsetting receipts and collections the outlay and revenue totals discussed here and in the federal budget are net measures and do not include offsetting receipts and collections these are the income that the government receives primarily from businesslike activities many are user fees mostly the offsetting receipts and collections go directly toward the provision of those activities for which they were collected in some cases without appropriation these include receipts collected directly by the government for health care premiums through medicare part b national park user fees and proceeds from the sale of government resources they also include receipts collected by government corporations defined below such as the postal service the export import bank and the federal deposit insurance corporation the receipts and collections are not included in revenues and the outlays that they fund are subtracted from total outlays omb justifies the exclusion of offsetting receipts and collections from the budget on the grounds that the budget focuses on outlays and receipts that measure governmental activity rather than combination of governmental and market activity13 what should be realized is that even if offsetting collections and receipts are not included in the budget as revenues because they represent choices made in the marketplace ie they are not compulsory like taxes removing them from revenues also causes the activities that they finance to be removed from the outlay side of the budget some budget analysts argue that this keeps many of the financed activities outside the oversight and deliberation of the annual appropriation process regardless of whether offsetting receipts and collections finance public goods or governmentprovided private goods when thinking about the size of the government in relation to private economic activity it may be sensible to include them and they are not an insignificant sum in 2007 offsetting collections and receipts totaled 3207 billion about 117 as large as outlays included in the budget table 2 lists offsetting receipts and collections that exceeded 10 billion in 13 omb analytical perspectives budget of the us government fy2004 ch 21 crs10 2006 to the extent that offsetting collections and receipts have grown over time removing them from the budget arguably underestimates the growth in the size of government14 table 2 offsetting receipts and collections by type fy2006 in billions of dollars postal service 739

measured on fiscal year basis when considering governments influence on the economy it is best to include government spending at the state and local level when state and local government spending is included the decline in the size of the government since 1983 is smaller because of the corresponding increase in the size of state and local government state and local government outlays grew from 71 of gdp in 1950 to 98 in 198315 but unlike the federal government state and local outlays have grown since 1983 reaching 116 of gdp in 2007 the growth in state and local government is larger and the growth in the federal government is smaller if one includes federal grants to state and local governments which have grown from 07 of gdp in 1950 to 27 of gdp in 2007 in contrast to the federal government at the state and local level government purchases significantly exceeds government transfers 14 for example the general accounting office estimates that the user fees it studied increased by 27 in real terms from 19911996 see gao federal user fees budgetary treatment status and emerging management issues aimd9811 december 1997 15 these figures refer to ownsource state outlays and do

measured on fiscal year basis state and local outlays include ownsource outlays only state and local outlays from federal grants are included in federal outlays should government corporations be included in discussions involving the size of government should government sponsored enterprises be included government corporations are government agencies that provide market services and raise revenue that partly or fully cover their expenses the postal service amtrak and the federal deposit insurance corporation are prominent examples for the most part their revenues and expenses occur outside of the budget surpluses are returned to the treasury and the corporation may receive appropriated subsidies or loans from general revenues the activities of these agencies are recorded in the federal budget only insofar as they receive subsidies or federal loans or generate surpluses they do not have shareholders and raise capital through the treasurys federal financing bank some raise capital independently of the government for example the tennessee valley authority issues its own bonds in economic terms business decisions budgets products and so on these corporations may more closely resemble private businesses and have little input from the executive branch or legislature in daytoday decision making nevertheless the organizations are part of the government and not privately owned in that way the major difference between them and the rest of the government is that they provide goods and services that are sold in the market whereas typically the government provides nonmarket goods eg education defense and highways sometimes the government corporations compete with private corporations eg package delivery by the postal service and sometimes they have monopoly eg letter delivery by crs12 the postal service16 government corporations account for about 1 of national income fraction that has stayed relatively constant over time17 in addition there are quasigovernment organizations with more distant ties to the government than government corporations but distinct from the private sector these include rand the smithsonian institution and government sponsored enterprises gses such as fannie mae and freddie mac18 what they have in common are legal characteristics that in some way link them to the government for example the gses were federally chartered by the government and have special borrowing privileges from the us government however they are shareholder owned corporations with management structures independent of the government and do not receive government appropriations although their ties to government increase the firms market value19 the focus on an annual cash flow budget neglects the fact that policy decisions made today can have longrun consequences that are not reflected in todays budget this can occur in number of ways many recent tax cuts and spending programs are being phased in over number of years for example under pl107 16 signed into law in 2001 the estate tax will not be eliminated until 2010 spending on multiyear projects can lead to implicit future spending commitments even if explicit commitments are not made for example once military hardware investment project begins it may be highly impractical to stop funding the project before it has been completed nevertheless defense spending like all discretionary spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation in the budget baseline and future budget totals are not adjusted for multiyear spending projects mandatory spending can increase with change in law when the number of eligible beneficiaries increases the example of this phenomenon that dwarfs all others under current policy is entitlement spending on the aged under current policy the retirement of the baby boomers and the increase in life expectancy are projected to cause spending on social security medicare and medicaid to increase from 74 of gdp in 2000 to 188 of gdp in 208020 while the spending increase will not occur until the future the promises to increase spending are being made today these promises are not reflected in the fy2008 budget and unlike private pension plan the payroll taxes being collected from baby boomers while they work 16 for more information on government corporations see crs report rl30365 federal government corporations an overview by kevin kosar 17 bea national income and product accounts table 113 18 some analysts argue that the primary motivation for the creation of certain gses was to remove their costs from the federal budget for example see roy meyers strategic budgeting ann arbor university of michigan press 1996 pp 7279 19 for more information on the quasigovernment see crs report rl30533 the quasi government

fund the future obligations they have secured under current law in all one recent study estimated that the governments total future unfunded liabilities equaled 442 trillion in present value terms21 some budget analysts have argued that the budget should be measured using different accounting method eg accrual accounting so that liabilities incurred today are recorded in todays budget different accounting methods might tell significantly different story about changes in the size of government over time22 the shortcoming of cash flow budgeting as measure of size of government is best expressed in the question does the more than doubling of elderly entitlement spending as percentage of gdp projected under current policy really imply any growth in the size of government when the benefits each individual receives remain the same spending and tax revenue are not the only ways to think about the size of the government the government can arguably have bigger smaller role in the economy without spending more less government regulation in the form of laws regulations or mandates undoubtedly has an economic impact every bit as real as spending or taxation but the cost of regulation is difficult to quantify and is not measured overall by any official source23 and yet to ignore it in discussions of the size of government could be misleading for example consider government proposal to reduce the consumption of product gasoline cigarettes alcohol and so on the government could reduce consumption by paying people not to use the product or paying them to use an alternative which would be counted as an increase in government outlays the government could tax the product to reduce its use by making it more costly which would be counted as an increase in government revenues or it could pass regulations forbidding or restricting its use which would not show up on either side of the budgets ledger yet all three proposals could be crafted to have the exact same effect on the quantity of the good consumed effect of the government on economic efficiency how can policymakers determine the appropriate role of the government in the economy most economists judge the economic merit of any government program based on its effect on economic efficiency does larger government raise economic efficiency or lower efficiency the only overarching answer that can be offered is it depends economic theory is clear that government intervention has the potential 21 jagdeesh gokhale and kent smetters fiscal and generational imbalances washington american enterprise institute press 2003 22 see mario blejer and adrienne cheasty the measurement of fiscal deficits analytical and methodological issues journal of economic literature vol xxix december 1991 p 1644 23 the most comprehensive official estimate of the costs and benefits of regulation is probably found in office of management and budget draft 2005 report to congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations march 2005 it finds that the 10year cost of regulations reviewed by omb was 348 billion to 394 billion crs14 to improve efficiency when market failures exist but is likely to reduce efficiency when markets are already perfect which is defined below in reality government intervenes both in cases of market failure and in cases where markets are already operating relatively efficiently as result some government policies raise economic efficiency and some lower efficiency by means are all spending decisions made by the government today justified on efficiency grounds if it were possible to isolate and eliminate all actions which lowered efficiency economic welfare could hypothetically be improved by reducing the size of government likewise one could identify areas where government intervention could improve currently uncorrected market failures and larger government would theoretically improve economic efficiency before discussing what constitutes market failure it is useful to define economic efficiency which differs from popular parlance as opposed to its popular usage economic efficiency does not involve economic growth wealth or productivity in fact one can think of examples where efficiency is at loggerheads with these goals generally an outcome is economically efficient if the marginal cost of producing one more unit of good is equivalent to the marginal benefit of consuming one more unit of the good when markets function perfectly which is defined as market with many buyers and sellers barriers to entry perfect information and the costs and benefits of the transaction are completely borne by the buyer and seller an economically efficient outcome will occur and government intervention can only reduce efficiency when there are market failures government intervention has the potential to improve efficiency by moving away from the economically inefficient outcome produced by the market while economic efficiency is easy to define theoretically discord arises when applied to actual government policies typically an efficiencyenhancing measure cannot be produced without being accompanied by efficiencyreducing side effects for example without our criminal justice system markets could not operate but criminal justice system cannot be operated without taxes that are likely to take efficiencyreducing form while there is broad consensus that taxfinanced criminal justice system is efficiencyimproving on net at some level there is likely to be disagreement as to whether the benefit derived from marginal increase in resources devoted to criminal justice from current levels would exceed the costs of marginal increase in taxation to finance it furthermore the democratic process is conducive to compromises that include mixture of efficiencyenhancing and efficiencyreducing measures judging the balance between the two is unlikely to produce wide consensus economic theory can describe the economic benefits and costs of broad policy approach but cannot predict how the compromise that emerges from the legislative process will differ from the policy as originally conceived measuring efficiency gains and losses of any proposal is more difficult when other policies are also distorting market personal differences in opinion on these matters go long way toward explaining the wide ideological diversity within the economics profession crs15 what is market failure to understand when government intervention in the economy can increase economic efficiency it is necessary to define market failure before doing so it is useful to give examples of what is not market failure inequality poverty fraud discrimination bankruptcy layoffs high prices and so on are not market failures as defined by economic theory while they are undesirable phenomena which may be valid targets of public policy they are problems that either are not economic in nature or do not meet the definition of economic inefficiency they do not involve mismatch between marginal cost and marginal benefit in economic theory the following are major types of market failures public goods there are some beneficial goods that will not be provided by the market because they are nonexcludable people cannot be prevented from using the good and they are nonrival one persons use of the good does not diminish anothers use for those two reasons private producer has incentive to supply the good economists refer to goods meeting these two criteria as public goods which are often provided only by the government24 the classic example of public good is national defense while private armies might be capable of defending the country there is incentive to form private army because nobody would voluntarily pay for its services called the free rider problem that is because once an army is in place it has means to defend its customers from attack without also defending noncustomers only government with the power of taxation can raise the funds to finance an army similar public goods include basic knowledge which once discovered can be enjoyed by all and the civil and criminal justice system much of which eg property rights dispute settlement contract enforcement makes market transactions possible25 because public goods are not transacted through the marketplace it is difficult to determine whether government overspends or underspends on their provision the value of any given public good is different for different people and the political process must sort their preferences rather than the marketplace for example could an acceptable level of national defense be attained at lower cost or is the nation not secure enough at current levels of spending during peacetime these questions cannot be definitively answered common resources another type of good that cannot be efficiently provided by the market is common resource such as the environment ocean fishing and certain water supplies unlike public goods these resources are rival fish or glass of water consumed by one person cannot be consumed by another but 24 private producers have found ways to provide some public goods for instance broadcast television and radio is nonrival and nonexcludable but can nevertheless be privately financed by advertising 25 to clarify the economic meaning of public good which may differ from popular usage it is useful to point out one government service that does not meet the economic definition of public good education education is an excludable good school could conceivably close its doors to keep individuals out if it wished education is also rival good book used by one student cannot be used by another crs16 the resources are not excludable because they cannot be assigned property rights for that reason they may be overconsumed and can be depleted or even exhausted over time in the absence of government intervention as result government control or regulation is necessary for an efficient and sustainable use of the resources it is coincidence that some of the common resources in danger of depletion are those such as ocean fishing and the environment that do not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of single national government with single sovereign entity over consumption is harder to prevent although the government has the potential to achieve economic efficiency through the regulation of common resources its intervention may not move the resource closer to efficient use in practice for example many governments have subsidized the fishing industry potentially exacerbating the depletion of ocean fisheries and because common resources also cannot be valued through the marketplace estimating the appropriate level of government intervention is difficult monopoly power one reason perfect competition leads to economically efficient outcomes is because any one producer does not have enough market power to push prices above marginal cost monopoly producers can do so to earn economic rents excess profits by reducing production to an inefficiently low level theoretically there could also be consumers with monopoly power in which case the outcome would be economically inefficient because price would be driven below marginal cost monopoly can occur for many reasons including barriers to entry legal or natural and economies of scale in the narrowest definition of the word market with single producer monopolies tend to exist only when marginal cost is continually declining producing one more good is always less expensive than producing the previous good this special case known as natural monopoly tends to occur in markets where consumption of good is nonrival one persons consumption does not come at the expense of anothers utilities electricity water cable telephone are the most common examples in most markets neither natural monopoly nor perfect competition exists the best description for what does exist is termed monopolistic competition where each company makes product that is distinct but highly substitutable with its rival eg the big mac vs the whopper in the fastfood hamburger market so that each company has some market power in monopolistic competition production is still inefficiently low but closer to the efficient point than in pure monopoly and economic rents do not exist as the number of firms increases and difference between products decreases the monopolistic competition outcome approaches the perfect competition case economic theory suggests that governments can increase economic efficiency by increasing monopolys production to its efficient point through regulation or direct ownership both approaches have been used historically for utilities over the past three decades questions have been raised whether government intervention can truly raise economic efficiency even in the case of natural monopolies given the political intervention complexity lack of profit motive and distorted incentives that crs17 regulation produces for the monopoly26 some economists have argued that even when significant market concentration exists with the exception of the natural monopolies the potential for competition is powerful enough to deter producers from maximizing monopoly rents even when robust competition does not currently exist it is noteworthy that government has rarely attempted to intervene to improve efficiency in monopolistic competition even though theoretical case could be made to do so in cases where it has such as the airline and trucking industries economic regulation has been widely deemed failure and eliminated monopolies are not always less efficient than perfect competition and sometimes they are fostered by the government for that reason for example as required by the constitution the government grants patents and copyrights so that inventors and authors can enjoy monopoly profits for their work without these governmentcreated monopolies there would frequently not be sufficient incentive to undertake those activities externalities in the market for many goods and services all the costs and benefits inherent in the consumption and production of good are borne by the buyer and seller but some goods also create externalities in their consumption or production positive externalities are benefits enjoyed by third parties negative externalities are costs borne by third parties again it is difficult to determine how much government intervention is required to correct an externality since the externality cannot be valued in the marketplace pollution is the classic case of negative externality society as whole bears the cost of environmental degradation and there is incentive for the consumer or producer to take these societal costs into account as result from societal perspective the good is overproduced and overconsumed in the free market outcome if good generates negative externality it does not mean that good should not be consumed it means that to maximize social welfare the consumption of the good should be reduced to the level that reflects its social costs vaccines are an example of positive externality when someone is vaccinated against communicable disease society as whole benefits since that person can longer contract the disease and spread it to others from societal perspective vaccines would be underproduced and underconsumed in the absence of government intervention some social goals are often popularly justified on the grounds that they generate positive externalities but the criteria to qualify as an externality are strict and economists are divided if social goals qualify for example home ownership is often viewed as generating positive externalities because home owners are viewed as having higher incomes having higher rates of civic participation and committing fewer crimes than renters however it is not clear that home ownership causes incomes and civic participation to be higher and crime to be lower or if it just 26 for example see richard posner the social costs of monopoly and regulation journal of political economy vol 83 4 august 1975 p 807 crs18 happens to be correlated with other personal attributes that cause these outcomes27 similar arguments apply to education asymmetric information competitive markets only work efficiently when both buyer and seller are wellinformed in some markets the buyer may be more informed than the seller or vice versa when this happens the market outcome is inefficient for example in insurance markets buyers know more about their riskiness than sellers as result only buyers with higher risks will tend to purchase more insurance because they are more certain that the benefit of the insurance will exceed the cost this pushes up the price of insurance and hampers insurers efforts to pool risk when government is able to provide information to the uninformed party or make participation mandatory it can move the market back to an efficient outcome for auto insurance many state governments make some insurance mandatory to avoid the problem of asymmetric information for employment insurance the government provides the insurance directly the insurance market is also distorted by moral hazard which occurs when the insured party acts more recklessly as result of the insurance for example some drivers may be more likely to speed or run red lights when they become insured pushing up the price of automobile insurance asymmetric information is also used as rationale for financial regulation referred to as the principalagent problem the manager of company or bank may not have the same incentives eg the costs of risktaking as shareholders or depositors information disclosure and accounting laws can increase the information available to monitor the behavior of managers failure to optimize finally the assumption in economic theory that people make rational optimal economic decisions that maximize their wellbeing may be invalid in many cases without this assumption an array of possible government interventions has the potential to improve wellbeing an assumption that individuals do not optimize underlies diverse arguments such as social security is necessary because people do not save enough primary education should be mandatory the federal reserve should prevent stock market bubbles and drug use should be illegal by its nature the failure to optimize in any given market is the hardest to prove or disprove much economic analysis is based on the construction of theoretical models based on optimizing individuals which are then tested against empirical evidence in many cases the models may be good approximation of reality not because everyone is rational but because any individuals making different mistakes nearly cancel each other out failure of the evidence to match the model is not necessarily proof that individuals are not optimizing the model could simply be specified thus far robust testable models in which individuals do not optimize have not attained widespread use 27 see edward leamer and jesse shapiro the benefits of the home mortgage interest deduction nber working paper 9284 october 2002 crs19 how do taxes affect economic efficiency economic theory characterizes taxes as reducing economic efficiency by distorting changing the behavior being taxed relative to all other behavior thus moving behavior away from the efficient market allocation where marginal benefit equals marginal cost this is the case if the behavior being taxed does not result in negative externalities if it does then the market allocation was not efficient to begin with thus sales tax on specific good eg passenger air travel changes the choice between the taxed good and nontaxed goods as well as the relationship between taxed goods and saving likewise wage tax shifts workers allocation of his time between labor and leisure away from an efficient balance the balance that maximizes his welfare28 in the real world there is also the possibility that taxes on labor inefficiently shift behavior from taxable compensation to nontaxable compensation such as nontaxable benefits29 is economic efficiency reduced on balance by taxation that question cannot be answered in isolation of the other side of the government balance sheet taxes finance government and as described above certain government interventions can increase economic efficiency30 whether any given policy increases or decreases economic efficiency depends on whether the efficiency cost of the taxes needed to finance it outweighs the policys benefits furthermore efficiency losses are difficult to estimate particularly in the presence of other policies that change the market outcome this is why broad statement can be made about whether the overall size of government is inefficiently large or small economic theory suggests that the efficiency loss from tax increases geometrically as the tax increases31 this suggests that as government gets larger and tax rates get higher fewer new government programs would generate efficiency gains large enough to offset the efficiency losses caused by their financing32 28 the tax on labor is not inefficient because it reduces labor supply theoretically the tax could result in less labor supply because the reward to work has diminished or more labor supply because more work is needed to reach given income level it is the change in the relationship between consumption and leisure and not the direction of the change that makes the tax economically inefficient these effects are called substitution and income effects respectively and are discussed in detail below in the section on the size of government and economic growth 29 see martin feldstein tax avoidance and the deadweight loss of income taxation nber working paper 5055 march 1995 30 the link between taxes and spending can be temporarily broken through deficit financing deficitfinanced tax cuts do not necessarily raise efficiency however 1 deficitfinanced tax cut in effect is promise that taxes will be raised or spending will be cut by more than 1 in the future because of interest costs unless inefficient spending is cut in the future deficit financing results in net loss in economic efficiency over time 31 see for example n gregory mankiw principles of microeconomics fort worth dryden press 1997 p 167 32 when the government provides private goods goods and services that are exclusive and rival it is more economically efficient for them to be purchased directly by the consumer than financed through taxation many governmentprovided private goods are already continued crs20 and yet the efficiency losses of high taxes should not be overstated that is because not all taxes distort behavior for example capitation tax fixed dollar tax that everyone must pay results in efficiency loss matter how high taxes are set because there is way to avoid the tax short of death or emigration while the example of capitation tax is extreme in general economists assert that the efficiency losses from taxation could be much lower than they are in our current system if the tax base were broadened so that an equivalent amount of revenue could be raised with lower marginal tax rates33 it is exemptions deductions tax credits and the like that narrow the tax base and require marginal tax rates to be as high as they are if the tax base were broadened spending could be judged more on its own merits than on the costs of financing it unlike the case for smaller government where economists are sharply divided the case for broader tax base garners wide consensus among economists this suggests that considering the optimal size of government is best done on the spending side the efficiency case against taxes is more case for tax reform than tax reduction the case for broadening the tax base raises further point putting aside the spending side of the budget not all tax cuts increase economic efficiency from an economic perspective unless they correct for an externality tax expenditures credits exemptions exclusions deductions preferential rates or deferrals reduce efficiency by creating distortions in economic behavior in many ways they are economically equivalent to spending and the economic distortions they create are different than the distortions created by an equivalent spending policy34 1000 child tax credit is different than the government paying every eligible parent 1000 per child likewise the mortgage interest deduction is different than paying every mortgageholder in the 15 tax bracket 015 for every dollar in mortgage interest they pay it is only reductions in marginal rates that increase economic efficiency just like spending tax expenditures increase economic efficiency only if they distort behavior that suffers from market failure and they are not generally better or worse than an equivalent spending provision at doing so if tax expenditures are not aimed at correcting market failure they can divert economic resources from efficient production to the inefficient pursuit of the economic rents that the tax code creates such as tax shelters other tax expenditures cause marginal rates to be higher without any meaningful change in the targeted behavior for example there is little evidence that more children are born as result of the child tax credit if that is the case the credit mainly serves as transfer to parents from taxpayers in economic terms windfall since parents need not change anything to receive the credit 32 continued financed through user fees and are omitted from the budget see the section above on offsetting receipts and collections 33 most economists view the tax reform act of 1986 pl99514 as good example of tax reform that followed this principle 34 tax expenditures raise distributional issues compared to spending unless they are refundable income tax expenditures are only available to entities with taxable income which excludes many lower income households furthermore when tax expenditures take the form of tax deductions they are regressive because the value of the deduction increases as taxable income increases as the taxpayers marginal tax bracket increases crs21 the case for tax simplification is also based on the goals of minimizing administrative cost complexity and evasion all of which create economic costs in addition to the efficiency costs discussed above balancing economic efficiency with other goals it is crucial to remember that any policy also has noneconomic costs and benefits economic efficiency is certainly not the only criterion for public policy equity fairness and justice are just few social goals that economists cannot judge quantitatively there are many social goals that policymakers may wish to pursue and they often consider whether social benefits outweigh the efficiency loss for example civil and criminal justice system is not maintained primarily for its effect on economic efficiency but for its effect on justice equity morality and fairness progressive income tax system is less economically efficient than capitation tax but economics says nothing about whether the capitation tax is more socially desirable because it cannot weigh the efficiency loss against the equity motive for having progressive tax system economist can offer precise estimate of whether the economic costs and benefits of any proposal will outweigh its social costs and benefits35 economists can however evaluate how to achieve social goal in the least economically costly way for example economists generally applauded the governments decision to deal with the social costs of worker displacement from nafta by coupling free trade with worker retraining programs and extended unemployment benefits for displaced workers this was viewed by economists as more economically efficient than preventing working displacement through trade barriers so that the gains from trade to consumers can still be enjoyed36 and in some cases public sector provision of social goal may be more economically efficient than private sector provision for example it may not be possible for the private sector to efficiently provide unemployment insurance because of the asymmetric information problems described above government provision of unemployment insurance can potentially achieve efficiency while simultaneously contributing to the social goal of preventing economic hardship likewise some economists have argued that income redistribution can only be carried out at an efficient level by the state because it is public good prone to underprovision in the marketplace because of the freerider problem37 35 many economists have devised sophisticated theories for achieving optimum income redistribution based on various social principles for example economists have developed different redistribution schemes based on an equal sacrifice principle that tax rates should be set by income status such that taxes reduce the welfare of all taxpayers equally so that high income individuals pay higher taxes but there is way to use economic theory to judge which theory of redistribution is most fair for an introduction and bibliography see richard musgrave fairness in taxation in joseph cordes et the encyclopedia of taxation and tax policy washington urban institute press 1999 p 117 36 see crs report rl32059 trade trade barriers and trade deficits implications for us economic welfare by craig elwell 37 see harold hochman and james rodgers pareto optimal redistribution american continued crs22 effect of the government on economic growth arguments surrounding the size of government are often posed in terms of their effects on economic growth like the section on efficiency this section argues that the effect of government spending on economic growth can only be judged on case bycase basis but more generally the problem with using growth as policy evaluation criterion is that it tells nothing about overall welfare which includes non economic benefits such as quality of life unlike efficiency economists view growth at best as one effect of policy to be considered and not goal in and of itself even in cases where the effect on growth is positive society may be made worse off as thought experiment consider the effects of mandatory 80hour work week it would be expected to increase economic growth but society would be worse off nonetheless since economic efficiency cannot be easily measured growth will often be the best alternative criterion available the question of the relationship between the size of government and economic growth is of longterm nature thus distinction should be made between short term fluctuations in growth due to the business cycle and the longterm sustainable growth rate of the economy for that reason arguments for or against larger government cannot be based on the ability of an increase in the budget deficit to increase aggregate spending in the economy in the short run notice that these short run effects are consistent with certain definitions of both larger government higher spending with constant taxes and smaller government constant spending with lower taxes38 longterm growth increases in output is caused by increases in the labor supply hours worked or number of workers the physical capital stock or productivity when the size of the labor force grows with the population there would be effect on per capita growth however growth in the physical capital stock is made possible by national savings or borrowing from abroad for the size of the government to affect longterm growth it must affect one of these three sources of growth all four types of government behavior spending transfers taxes and regulation have the potential to influence these three sources of growth 37 continued economic review vol 59 4 september 1969 p 542 38 an argument has been made by fatas and mihov that larger governments can more effectively stabilize the business cycle in the short run because they have relatively larger automatic stabilizers automatic stabilizers are changes in spending and revenue that increase the deficit thereby boosting aggregate demand and occur without policy changes the authors offer international evidence supporting this theory this argument can be criticized however on the grounds that there is nothing preventing smaller governments from using discretionary monetary and fiscal policy effectively mitigating the reliance on automatic stabilizers see antonio fatas and ilian mihov government size and automatic stabilizers international and intranational evidence journal of international economics october 2001 crs23 effect of spending portion of gross domestic product gdp is produced by the government like private firm the government purchases inputs from the private sector eg the military purchases tanks and airplanes from private defense contractors and labor eg soldiers to produce final good or service eg national defense but unlike firm most government goods and services like defense are not bought and sold in the private market and so there is way to value them nevertheless these goods and services are part of the nations gdp to prepare the gdp accounts the bureau of economic analysis values government production unlike private production by measuring the inputs rather than the output this makes it difficult to measure the effect of government production on the economy empirically even if there are good empirical reasons for believing it to have an effect there is little reason to believe government spending has any direct effect on increases in the labor force since the number of jobs available expands to accommodate increases in the labor force over the long run but it may affect productivity gains over time some have argued that the lack of competition and the profit incentive in the government sector leads to less innovation and lower productivity gains over time39 empirical tests of the proposition may yield little meaningful information however because of the way that government gdp is recorded in the private sector productivity growth occurs when the same inputs yield higher output than previously since government gdp is based on inputs and output is not measurable because it is not bought and sold in the marketplace there is direct way to tell how much government productivity is growing over time40 there is also the question of magnitude are differences between public and private sector productivity growth rates significant enough to have meaningful effect on economic growth as thought experiment consider that government output including state and local accounted for about 20 of gdp in 2007 if private sector productivity growth is 2 and government productivity growth is only half as high total output growth will only be 02 percentage points lower year than if productivity were the same in both sectors in that case reducing government production by half would only raise productivity growth by 01 percentage points likewise if the governments productivity growth rate were higher than the private sectors the effect would be too small to make much of an impact on the overall productivity rate if anything this calculation may overstate the productivity differential since some government output is produced by private sector contractors who presumably have productivity growth rates similar to the rest of the private sector 39 see for example william niskanen bureaucracy and representative government chicago aldineatherton publishers 1971 40 for description of bls program that attempted to measure government productivity see bureau of labor statistics the federal productivity measurement program monthly labor review may 1997 p 19 by its estimate government productivity rose 11 year from 19671994 compared to 15 nonfarm business productivity growth over that period the article lists several reasons why the government and business productivity are non comparable this program has been discontinued crs24 finally some government goods and services while possibly subject to lower productivity growth in their production alter private sector productivity growth for example government enforcement of property rights may lead to more entrepreneurial activity and new road may reduce the costs of shipping private sector goods to market in these cases reducing government spending could lower total productivity growth by lowering private sector productivity growth even if government productivity growth is lower than private sector productivity growth increasing other government goods and services could lower private sector productivity growth thus far this section has focused on government spending on consumption goods and services but government spending can also finance public capital goods which increases the national capital stock in the same way as private investment government spending on capital investment roads structures ports and so on increases output by increasing the nations capital stock in the same way that private capital investment does annual nondefense capital investment spending has stayed relatively constant in recent decades at less than 05 of gdp at the federal level and 2 of gdp at the state level which is partly financed by federal grants defense capital investment has followed downward trend in peacetime from about 3 of gdp in the 1960s to less than 1 of gdp since the 1990s in war times defense investment has increased above the trend although not in recent years it is less clear that defense investment has the same positive effect on measured gdp growth as nondefense investment since it is an investment in the intangible good security figure 5 public investment spending 19502007 7 state and local 6 investment 5 of gdp 4 federal non 3 defense 2 investment 1 federal

spending on research and development rd should be included in measures of investment spending and some would include spending on education and training because it increases the nations human crs25 capital stock federal spending on rd has trended down from about 2 of gdp in the 1960s to about 1 of gdp today throughout this period it has been split about half and half between defense and nondefense41 whether an additional dollar of spending on government output directly increases or decreases growth depends on what it is replacing to the extent that government capital spending replaces private consumption there will be net increase in economic growth through higher capital stock conversely to the extent that government consumption spending replaces private investment there will be net decrease in growth whether government or private investment yields higher rate of return for the economy will vary on casebycase basis and both are prone to diminishing returns to investment as investment spending is increased42 effect of transfers government spending on transfers to individuals has direct effect on the level of aggregate private output aside from administrative costs transfers only affect the distribution of private output the transfer recipient uses transfer funds to buy goods and services from the private sector or to save rather than the taxpayer who finances the transfers the effect on economic growth of transfers comes from the distortion in incentives caused by the transfer both on the taxpayer as discussed in the next section and the recipient since the largest recipients of transfers are retirees it is useful to consider the effects on that group social security payments and other government pensions and agebased transfers may reduce the private saving rate by replacing private saving for retirement although the offset would not be one for one since some retirees do not save adequately for their retirement since these transfers are financed on payasyougo basis there is arguably public saving to offset the reduction in private saving reducing national saving the programs may also lead to earlier retirement than would otherwise occur reducing output through smaller labor force transfers for the elderly also incorporate number of insurancelike functions protecting the elderly against the risk of disability outliving their assets spousal death and so on these insurancelike functions may reduce the need for private precautionary saving43 41 government also influences private rd spending through the rd tax credit for an introduction to the evidence on rd and economic growth see zvi griliches productivity puzzles and rd another nonexplanation journal of economic perspectives vol 2 no4 autumn 1988 p 9 42 some research suggests that public investment can have higher rate of return than private investment or increase the rate of return on private investment see alicia munnell ed is there shortfall in public capital investment federal reserve bank of boston conference series 34 june 1990 and david aschauer is public expenditure productive journal of monetary economics vol 23 2 p 177 43 for more information see crs report rl31498 social security reform economic issues by jane gravelle and marc labonte crs26 are transfers to the elderly illadvised because they may reduce economic growth this example illustrates why efficiency is better economic criterion for judging programs than growth the relevant question is not whether the insurance like qualities of these transfers reduce private saving but whether the government can provide insurance more efficiently than the private sector because of market failures in the private insurance market adverse selection moral hazard and incomplete markets in other words market failures in the insurance market can lead to individuals saving too much and government intervention has the potential to make them better off by reducing the risky contingencies for which they were previously saving as result of government intervention saving and economic growth would fall but economic efficiency would increase another major category of transfers are meanstested transfers meanstested transfers can potentially reduce growth by creating an incentive for recipients to keep income or wealth or hours worked below the point where benefits are phased out the incentive can be reduced by phasing transfers out more slowly as income increases the effect of meanstested transfers on economic growth are often weighed against their effect on noneconomic goals economists are least fond of transfers that are economically inefficient and do not serve any broad social goal for example subsidies to specific industries or sectors of the economy may reduce economic efficiency by causing overproduction in those industries the introduction of an industrial subsidy would be expected to lead to onetime reduction in gdp as the economys resources are reallocated to less efficient outcome it is less clear if industrial subsidies would reduce economic growth on an ongoing basis they may do so if they reduce competition and the incentive to innovate at the same time the benefits of the subsidy are highly concentrated and generally do not accrue to broad groups on nondiscriminatory basis for example workers in the industry being subsidized are made better off even though their income level and employment situation may be superior to those in other industries that are not being subsidized effect of taxes by changing economic behavior taxes have the potential to affect overall growth taxes on saving could change saving rates and thereby investment rates and taxes on labor could change the labor supply theoretically income tax reduction which affects saving and labor could increase or decrease economic growth that is because tax cut affects behavior in two ways first it increases the rewards to work relative to leisure giving the worker an incentive to work more this is known as the substitution effect second it increases the workers aftertax income such that he must work less to maintain his previous standard of living this gives him an incentive to work less and is known as the income effect theoretically there is way to know whether the substitution or income effect dominates for any given tax it is an empirical question crs27 empirically the evidence is divided on the size and even direction of the effects on saving and labor44 some studies have concluded that labor supply increases in response to tax cuts others that it falls in any case most studies find the response to be small there is evidence that the response of certain demographic groups are greater than others workingaged male adults are overwhelmingly already employed fulltime so there is relatively little scope for them to enter the labor market or greatly increase their hours in response to tax cut on the other hand female employment rates are lower and there is some evidence that there is larger labor supply response to tax cuts among females in highincome households the labor supply of workers near the beginning or end of their career may also be more sensitive to changes in tax rates45 casual observation is consistent with small overall effects on labor the average work week declined through the 1960s and 1970s and has stayed relatively constant since despite the decline in marginal income tax rates since the 1980s the male labor force participation rate has followed downward trend since the 1960s and the female participation rate rose dramatically for much of the postwar period but has been relatively constant since the 1990s the effect of change in taxes on labor supply is likely to be onetime effect once individuals have adjusted their labor supply in response to tax cut they will not continue to increase or decrease it in the future thus change in taxes is expected to have only onetime effect on growth through the labor supply channel the empirical evidence on saving is particularly inconclusive at glance one can see that the household saving rate has been in steady decline over the past few decades and was close to zero in the past several years despite downward trend in marginal income tax rates and taxes on capital and dramatic expansion in taxfavored savings accounts since the 1980s since saving is not motivated solely by tax rates one cannot make simple comparison between the two to explain the empirical behavior of saving requires matching the data to some theoretical notion of why people save because the motives for saving are complex the theoretical models used by economists become very complex even under simple assumptions not only the level of taxes but also the structure of the tax code affects economic growth to the extent that loopholes in the tax code do divert resources from the pursuit of efficient market activity this too lowers economic growth although it is difficult to estimate the size of this effect and whether there is one time reduction in growth when the loophole is introduced or an ongoing reduction in growth evaluating the effects of tax cuts on growth cannot be done in isolation to finance tax cut spending must be reduced other taxes must be raised or the government must borrow if tax cut is financed through lower spending or raising other taxes then the effect of those changes on longrun growth which could be negative or positive depending on the policy change would need to be weighed 44 for more extensive treatment of the issues discussed in this section see crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane gravelle 45 see orley ashenfelter and richard layard handbook of labor economics amsterdam elsevier science publishers 1986 ch 12 crs28 against the tax cut if the tax cut is financed through borrowing its effect on long run growth is likely to be negative since borrowing reduces national saving unless the positive effects on private saving and labor supply are large enough to offset the reduction in national saving effect of regulation estimating the effect of regulation on growth is difficult and can only be done on casebycase basis some regulations reduce output by diverting resources to noneconomic compliance costs undoubtedly other regulations enhance growth such as the positive effects of the rule of law on commerce some regulations may reduce firms output directly such as environmental regulations but be offset partially or wholly by indirect positive economic effects such as through an improvement in public health it is important to distinguish between regulations onetime effect on output and growth and its permanent effect on growth in the longrun most onetime effects are swamped by the compounding of growth for example if environmental regulations raise firms costs reducing the demand for their product their output will fall but after the onetime fall the regulation may have little effect on how much their output grows in the future concluding remarks the government affects economic activity through four primary channels government production of goods and services transfer payments taxation and regulation measuring the size of government is not straightforward exercise relying on annual federal outlays excludes several types of government intervention including state and local outlays tax expenditures government corporations and offsetting receipts and collections as result the government appears to be smaller than it is in reality annual measures of government also neglect future unfunded liabilities implicit in current policy measuring the economic impact of regulation is difficult and is not done comprehensively or consistently government intervention increases economic efficiency when it rectifies market failures and reduces efficiency when it distorts perfectly competitive markets political choices may lead to secondbest outcomes however and some therefore argue that accepting market failures can be preferable to government intervention in some cases to be efficiencyenhancing government spending must have greater benefits than the efficiencyreducing taxes that finance it likewise tax cuts will only increase overall efficiency if they are financed by reductions in relatively less efficient spending or increases in relatively less efficient taxes in general marginal tax reductions tend to be efficiency increasing while many tax expenditures are efficiency decreasing deficitfinanced tax cuts do not increase efficiency if they are financed by larger tax increases in the future crs29 not all government spending is created equally economists universally agree that some government spending on wellfunctioning legal system for example increases economic efficiency and growth agreement is nearly as universal that some government spending on subsidies to industries for example reduces economic efficiency or growth in between are policies that are jumble of efficiencyenhancing and efficiencyreducing provisions for this reason general conclusions can be drawn about the overall size of the governments effect on the economy it is conceivable that very large government could devote all of its spending on efficiencyenhancing policies and very small government could devote all of its spending on efficiencyreducing policies or vice versa many policies that reduce economic efficiency or growth may meet social or noneconomic goals equity fairness and so on that make them worthwhile currently government transfers to individuals are nearly twice as large as government spending on goods and services and the primary goal of most transfers is probably not economic efficiency government intervention increases decreases longterm growth with policies that foster hinder greater work effort capital accumulation and technological innovation economic growth is not clear normative goal such as economic efficiency however some growthenhancing policy measures may reduce economic welfare in any case economic growth has historically been stable over long periods of time suggesting that market forces tend to be stronger than the growth effects of policy changes in sum there is not an economic rationale for either big or small government per it is not so much the size of government as what government does with its spending transfer tax and regulatory policies that affects economic efficiency and growth for other versions of this document see
