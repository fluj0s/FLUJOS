from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to santer1llnlgov subject re our d3 test date thu may 29 151335 2008 ben hopefully the email to francis will help to resolve this quickly it would seem from toms email that the new d3 approaches the expected result for largish n test ought to do this as tom says youll need to change the response little as although you may have misinterpreted francis you may not have rev 1 hope this is out of your hair as soon as feasible climate audit are an odd crowd mcintyre is claiming that he spotted the problem in 1945 in the marine data and refers to blog page from late last year we were already on to it by then and he didnt really know what he was talking about anyway maybe this paper and the various press coverage especially dick reynolds nv as he spelt it out will allow them to realize that what is really robust in all this is the land record i suspect it wont though one day they may finally realize the concept of effective spatial degrees of freedom john christy doesnt understand this cheers phil at 0446 29052008 you wrote dear folks just wanted to let you know that i did not submit our paper to ijoc after some discussions that ive had with tom wigley and peter thorne i applied our d1 d2 and d3 tests to synthetic data in much the same way that we applied the dcps07 d test and our original paired trends test d to synthetic data the results are shown in the appended figure relative to the dcps07 d test our d1 d2 and d3 tests of hypothesis h2 yield rejection rates that are substantially closer to theoretical expectations compare the appended figure with figure 5 in our manuscript as expected all three tests show dependence on n the number of synthetic time series with rejection rates decreasing to nearasymptotic values as n increases this is because the estimate of the modelaverage signal which appears in the numerator of d1 d2 and d3 has dependence on n as does the estimate of sb_m the intermodel standard deviation of trends which appears in the denominator of d2 and d3 the worrying thing about the appended figure is the behavior of d3 this is the test which we thought reviewers 1 and 2 were advocating as you can see d3 produces rejection rates that are consistently lower by factor of two or more than theoretical expectations we do not wish to be accused by douglass et of devising test that makes it very difficult to reject hypothesis h2 even when there is significant difference between the trends in the model average signal and the observational signal so the question is did we misinterpret the intentions of the reviewers were they indeed advocating d3 test of the form which we used i will try to clarify this point tomorrow with francis zwiers our reviewer 2 recall that our current version of d3 is defined as follows d3 bo bm sqrt sbm 2 sbo 2 where bo observed trend bm model average trend sbm intermodel standard deviation of ensemblemean trends sbo standard error of the observed trend adjusted for autocorrelation effects in franciss comments on our paper the first term under the square root sign is referred to as an estimate of the variance of that average ie of bm its possible that francis was referring to sigmase which is an estimate of the variance of bm if one replaces sbm with sigmase in the equation for d3 the performance of the d3 test with synthetic data is at least for large values of n very close to theoretical expectations its actually even closer to theoretical expectations than the d2 test shown in the appended figure which is already pretty close ill produce the revised d3 plot tomorrow the bottom line here is that we need to clarify with francis the exact form of the test he was requesting the new d3 with sigmase as the first term under the square root sign would lead to simpler interpretation of the problems with the dcps07 test it would show that the primary error in dcps07 was in the neglect of the observational uncertainty term it would also simplify interpretation of the results from section 6 im sorry about the delay in submission of our manuscript but this is an important point and id like to understand it fully im still hopeful that well be able to submit the paper in the next few days many thanks to tom and peter for persuading to pay attention to this issue it often took lot of persuasion with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory po box 808 mail stop l103 livermore ca 94550 usa tel 925 4222486 fax 925 4227675 email santer1llnlgov prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
