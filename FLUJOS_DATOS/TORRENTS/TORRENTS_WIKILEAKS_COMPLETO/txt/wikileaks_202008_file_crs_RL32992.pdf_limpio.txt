congressional attention while some critics accuse agencies responsible for impleme nting the of using junk science others counter that decisions that should rest on science are instead being dictated by political concerns under the certain species of plants and animals both vertebrate and invertebrate are listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction once species is listed powerful legal tools are available to protect the species and its hab itat efforts to list protect and recover threatened or endangered species under the can be controvers ial some of this controversy stems from the substantive provisi ons of this law which can affect the use of both federal and nonfed eral lands the scientific underpinnings of decisions under the are especially important give n their importance for species and their possible impacts on land use and development the fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior and the national marine fisheries service in the department of commerce administer the and each agency has policies and requirements to ensure the integrity and objectivity of the science that underlies decisions the information quality act iqa or data quality act also imposes general requirements and has resulted in agency changes to carry out the goals of that act to maximize the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated by the agencies in several situations ec onomic and social disputes have resulted from actions taken to list protect and recover species under the critics in some of these disputes assert that the science supportin g actions is insufficiently rigorous others assert that in some instances decisions were political rather than scientific controversy has arisen over what might be the essential elements of sound science in the process and whether the might benefit from cl arification of how science is to be used in its implementation the courts have had occasion to review the use of science by the agencies which generally must show their decisions were not arbitrary and rest on credible science for some purposes even if that science considered imperfect or incomplete but still the best available it may be used several bills affectin g science as used in the have been introduced in recent congresses but to date none have

act esa2 some accuse agencies of using j unk science while others assert that decisions that should rest on science are in stead being dictated by political concerns legislation to address the use of science was introduced in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses but did not pass similar legislation has been intr oduced in the 110th congress the was enacted to iden tify species at risk of ex tinction to provide means to help such species recover3 and to protect the ecosystems of which declining species are part4 listings and other actions under the may affect land uses and development endangered species are likely to reflect stressed resources or ecosystems with various interests on all sides of the resource issues in some situations such as protecting salmon in th klamath river basin or northern spotted owl habitat in the pacific northwest ec onomic and social dis putes have resulted from actions taken to list protect and r ecover species under the as result the protective posture of the esa5 and the use of science in its implementation have received renewed attention by law decisions must have as sound basis in science as is available but this requirement can mean different things to different people the agencies that administer the the fish and wildlife service fws in the department of the interior and the national marine fish eries service nmfs6 in the

federal actions designating critical habitat and developing recovery plans discussi ons during oversight hearings held on controversies concerni ng the canada lynx7 and klamath river basin suckers and coho salmon8 focused on whether more scientific rigor is necessary in implementing the from the 107th through the 110th congresses bills have been introduced to require empirical or fieldtested data as well as independent scie ntific reviews science review boards and increased public involvement questions have also been raised on how to handle situations when the available science is not extensive some suggest that considerations other than species conservation should prevail others seek to change the current posture of the w by changing the role of science for still others efforts to amend the in these regards are seen as an attempt to undermine the which they assert stru ck reasonable bala nce on these issues and they question whether an amendmen t concerning science is advisable or practical these considerations are complicated by the costs and time required to acquire more extensive data particularly in connec tion with many lesserknown species many rare and endangered speci are little studied b ecause they are hard to find or because it is difficult to locate enough of them to support scientific research in addition restri ctions on activities that might affect listed

nationw ide survey of habitat in 1999 to detect the presence or absence of canada lynx species then under c onsideration for listing this survey annually covered more than 60 sampling areas in several states hair samples were collected and analyz ed for dna characteristics to identify the species that left the hair samples on rubbi ng posts positive result ie hit of lynx hair sample in an area already known to be occupied lynx habitat was used to help calibrate survey effectiveness if hit came from habitat where lynx occupancy was unknown tracking surveys in snow and other investigations were conducted to verify the hit these tracking surveys and associated investigations were intended to help determine the extent and significance of lynx occurrence in the area conclusion that wild resident lynx were present was not automatically made from survey hit information since the hit could also be from feral lynx eg an escapee from lynx fur farm pet lynx or wild but transient lynx controversy arose from media reports of possible irregularities with the collection and testing of lynx survey samples several federal and state researchers had submitted unplanned hair samples for testing which had not been collected naturally from the wild to test the capability of the testing procedures10 some individuals feared that unplanned test sa mples might be used to extend the known range of esaprotected lynx and impose additional restricti ons on land owners concerns were also raised that media coverage may have sensationalized the situation beyond its facts11 for details see

should not have been imposed because of disagreements over the fundamental guidance contained in the 2001 biological opinions for these fish by fws and nmfs for bureau of reclamation water programs in the upper klamath river basin the secretary of the interior sought and s ecured review of the scientific decisions contained in these biological opinions by the national research council nrc13 the nrc released its interim report from the committee on endangered and threatened fishes in the klam ath river basin on february 6 200214 and final report on october 21 200315 the committee concluded there was neither sound scientific basis for maintaining upper klamath lake levels and increased river flows as recommended in the 2001 biological opi nions nor sufficient basis for supporting the lower flows in the bureaus original operations plan for 2001 further the nrc concluded that recovery of endangered suckers and threatened coho salmon in the klamath basin might best be achieved by broadly addressing land and water management concerns including the kl amath dams nrc also concluded that operation of the klamath project as opposed to operation of other basin projects such as that on the trinity river was not the cause of 2002 lower basin fish kill and changes in klamath project operations would not have prevented the fish kill in 2002 using the nrc interim report as basis for overruling previous nmfs and fws opinions the secretary of the inte rior reduced klamath lake levels and klamath river flows to divert water to i rrigation at historic levels the issue intensified in

hatchery salmon agency scientists have distinguished between hatcheryraised and wild salmon to maximize pr oduction of naturally spawned fis h which are believed to be more vigorous and genetically

salmon at the fall creek hatchery in the alsea river basin this effort to euthanize hatchery fish was undertaken as part of an effo rt to reestablish strain of all natural coho salmon in the belief that the hatchery fish could weak the gene pool of esalisted wild coho salmon which had dwindled to about 100 fish19 and to reduce the food supply of predatory seals to the mouth of the alsea river at

creationism 30 in scientific inquiry fact means that the observation has been repeatedly confirmed and is considered true hypothesis provides tentative statement that can be tested law is descriptive generalization about how some aspect of observable reality behaves under stated circumstances theory is wellsubstantiated explanation of some aspect of observable reality that can incorporate fact s laws inferences and tested hypotheses science creationism p12concerning 55 listed species claims concerned primarily fws elimination of designated critical habitat in number of st ates but also decisions to delist or down list some species and not to list others28 pressure cited for the decisions were primarily by ms macdonald but other doi officials were also named in the notice science the interaction with policy science or sound science is held up as desirable by all sides of the debate some studies are seen as suppor ting certain action by one party and as insufficient for decisionmaking by another and at times other studies are held up as supporting opposing sides with these apparent contradicti ons it is useful to examine in an context what is science b wh at is the scientific method and c how do science nd public policy interact what is science the national academy of sciences has give n fairly typical definition of science29 science is particular way of knowing bout the world in science explanations are limited to those based on observations and experiments that can be substantiated by other scientists expl anations that cannot be based on empirical evidence are not part of science science therefore is not simply an aggregation of facts unconnected with each other rather science is way of examining phenomena to produce explanations of the why and how of these phenomena rms used in describing the nature of science include scientific fact scientific hypotheses and scientific laws and theories30 scientific knowledge is dynamic changing as new information becomes available in this sense science does not reveal truth so much as produce the best available or most likely explanation of natural phenomena given the information available at the time in many cases analysis of the data may even give an estimate of the degree of confidence in the explan ation moreover sc ientific conclusions naturally depend on the questions that ar asked for instance the question of whether an action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of species in the next 10 years might have different answer than if the time in question is the next 100 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs9 31 henry w art gen ed the dictionary of ecology and environmental science henry holt reference book new york h holt 1993 p 479 the sequence of events described in the paragraph may be significantly modifi ed where extremely longrange or longterm phenomena do not permit easy experimentation in such instances hypotheses must be tested in other ways astronomy and climatol ogy are fields in which such problems are common but researchers on endangered organism s also face similar challenges when the rarity of their subject precludes many experiments 32 basic tools in science include systematic classification numeric measurements controlled variation of conditions replication of results by different observers experimentation by isolating variables predictions based on the w of cause and effect mathematical analysis and more for more information see mcgrawhill encyclopedia of science technology new york mcgraw hill v 16 1992 115117 note too that there is reason to confine this definition to western science although this form of thinking did arise in european civilizationscientific method the scientific method is the heart of science and has been defined as investigating system by formulating hypotheses educated guesses based on initial observations about the behavior of the system then making predictions based upon these hypotheses and finally designing experiments or making observations to test these predictions after several tests validate different predictions hypothesis becomes scientific theory or law this process is the basis of western science31 scientific methods may vary based on the objective and the nature of the subject matter32 usually the scientific investigation begins after some casual observation about the real world eg dairy maids who have had cowpox rarely contract smallpox and an observer who wonders why it begins then with hypothesis based on observations eg humans who have had cowpox are immune to smallpox testable predictions are ma based on the hypothesis g inoculation with cowpox will prevent smallpox data are systematically collected and classified to test the predictions eg patients we re first inoculated with cowpox and then exposed to smallpox the data are interpreted nd conclusion is drawn based on the outcome of the experiment eg since the patients inoculated with cowpox did not contract smallpox cowpox inoculations will prevent smallpox models eg epidemiological or microbiological may be developed to scribe the phenomenon or help make predictions g the spread of the disease noteworthy results are often published which usually requires scientific peer re view once the hypothesis is considered to be thoroughl tested it is considered or contributes to theory or law and becomes part of the body of sc ientific knowledge even accepted theories and laws remain open to reexamination if new information arises it is through these methods that science gives weight to the viewpoints of one scie ntist versus another the work of scientist that has not survived or even been submitted to this process is given less weight than the work of one that has several of these elements data collec tion models and scien tific peer reviews have become important in legislative discussions scientific peer reviews generally evaluate the analysis interpre tations and conclusions developed from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs10 33 more formally model can be defined as simplified representation of system or structure usually on smaller scale than that of the original theoretical model is mental construct that may be formalized into mathematical equations or verbal descriptions if accurate it may be used to make predictions about the original system models can also be physical flowchart is twodimensiona l model of system and threedimensional models or prototypes are often made of airp lanes and other vehicles in the process of development the dictionary of ecology and environmental science p 7 this definition would probably have been more precise if it had said that models whose predictions prove to be false are inadequate and the models must therefore be modified or discarded 34 scientific history is all but littered with fa mous approaches that were once widely held and later rejected even though considered good science in their heyday geological catastrophism lamarkian evolution the four humors of medicine newtonian physics ptolomaic cosmology etc transparent reexamination of these hypotheses and commitment to updating the information on which they were based led to their replacement with hypotheses which more accurately explained available data doubt some widely continueddata and sometimes review the data observable facts models have long been part of the scientific method models incl ude physical models eg dna strands or various sizes of balls to represent the solar system mathematical formulas computer simulation programs and many more33 models are based on stated or implicit assumptions that can usually be applie d to predict outcomes based on changing different variables as new informa tion becomes available models can be confirmed modified or dis carded with this definiti on models are seamless part of the scientific process and science without models nd modeling would be difficult to imagine the models as well as the facts and scientific theories may in turn be cited by decisionmakers the scientific method is not the only way of knowing traditional knowledge and common sense also play an important role for instance elders among native groups may report that whales have calved in certain lagoon as far back as their own grandparents can remember or that cer tain springs in the desert have never before gone dry until recent decades sc ientists decades of experience with particular species sometimes so falls into this category although such information has often been disregarded in the past greater attention is now paid to it in addition many common sense observa tions eg that salmon cannot jump up rivers that contain long stretches of dr creek bed or that heavy rain across bare slopes produces sediment runoff might rit study to quantify the observation but not to verify it experience and comm on sense especially when supported by scientific analyses tending in the same direction can provide important input for esarelated and other decisions other scientific values transparency and updating the scientific method has at its heart two values that are strongly implied as in the description above but not often stated 1 transpar ent approach in which both new and old data are available to all pa rties and 2 continuing effort to update data and therefore modify and even reject previ ously accepted hypotheses in light of new information34 together transparency and updating are the cleansing mechanism thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs11 34 continued held hypotheses of our own time

sine qua non for scientific advancement logically the n policy decisions based on science would include mechanism providing for transparent policy process and commitment not only to review such decisions but actua lly to gather new information to assure that decisions remain consistent with the be st available science on the one hand the speed of datagathering sometimes may exceed that of the slow regulatory process on the other hand lack of funding may st op datagathering altogether and lack of transparency eg due to fear of lawsu its or to hidden assumptions that may affect decisionmaking can also lead to decisions based on science that does not meet the bestavailable standard35 science and policy scientists and policymakers typically as k different kinds of questions on the one hand scientists deal with facts and observations along with the models and hypotheses to explain them with some of the latter potentially useful for predicting likely future events such as volcanic erup tions solar flares nuclear hazards and rates of extinction on the other decisi onmakers usually seek to affect how the world ought to or should be scien ce provides one source of input for making policy decisions that balance diverse cons iderations the complexity uncertainty and risk associated with many issues and the predictive nature of science with its emphasis on the

the w of biodiversity and ecosystem management minnesota law review v 81 april 1997 869979in the context of such decisions where does science stop and policy begin the indistinct boundary between science and policy can be further obscured by some scientists usually associated with par ticular positions or d ecisionmakers who want science to provide certainty for complex policy decisions38 s result p l i c questions eg how much risk to bear may be cast as science questions and decisionmakers may ask scientists to make what are essentially policy choices at first glance it might appear that science could be completely objective and neutral yet scientists often have pers onal values that influence consciously or unconsciously the questions they ask th models or experiments used the assumptions made and the interpretation of the results of an experiment39 also scientists working for various agencies co mpanies tribes and other interest groups may be influenced by policy positions of thei r employer vigorous debate is part of the essence of science but the result can be difficult for courts and policymakers to assess the influence can be quite subtle and two examples may illustrate the problem in controversy over nationa l forest management policy in wisconsin assumptions were incorporated into diversity indices which were to be used to create baseline against which various alternative forest plans could be measured40 this seemingly simple exercise apparently grounded in science contained an assumption which facilitated an outcome that would produce mode rate to high levels of timber harvest specifically the diversity indices stressed populations of habita t generalists eg ruffed grouse ground squirrels common ye llowthroats bird and pileated woodpeckers

preferred timber harvest was major tool to promote this type of habitat and an alternative featuring fairly high harvest levels and little old growth was chosen as the preferred option an outcome to be expected based on the initial choice of species inclusion of other species dependent on deep forests eg norther n goshawks and barred owls would have resulted in different preferred option second

discovery was searched in part because of the proposed s ubstantial change in the riverine habitat through the construction of large dam41 years later after the dam was completed this species was found in small numbers at nine additional loca tions and in 1984 was reclassified as threatened42 the subtle bias searching that specific area rather than some others produced result major c

8460some have applauded the iqa as likely to result in better procedures and more credible information others have expre ssed concerns that the act may be used to stymy agency action through the correction procedures and that the omb oversight might result in more political input into scientific decisions the omb guidelines set out the entities to which the guidelines apply and define basic terms government information means information that is created collected processed disseminated or disposed of by an agency disseminated means agency initiated or sponsored dist ribution of information to the public as opposed to another agency or in response to freedom of information act request for example the purpose of the guidelines was to develop process for reviewing the quality of information before it is disseminated quality includes the objectivity utility and integrity of information objectivity i nvolves presentation and substance whether information is presented in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner and whether the information is accu rate reliable and unbiased some of the elaboration on objectivity is very significant to the context for example the omb guidelines address peer review as contributing to objectivity stating that if data and analytic results have been subjected to formal independent external peer review the information may generally be presumed to be of acceptable objectivity however this presumption is rebuttable based on persuasive showing by the petitioner in particular instance if agencysponsored peer review is employed to help satisfy the objectivity standard the review process employed shall meet the general criteria for competent and credible peer review recommended by omboira to the presidents management council 9202001 namely that peer re viewers be selected primarily on the basis of necessary technical expertise b peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies prior technicalpolicy positions they may have taken on the issues at hand c peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies their sources of personal and institutional funding private or public sector and d peer reviews be conducted in an open and rigorous manner46 the element of integrity of information is relevant to current issues and accusations in that integrity refers to the security of informationprotection of the information from unauthorized access or revi sion to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification47 although this guideline seems to refer to unauthorized alteration of

informa tion from nonfederal sources48 practical problems in applying science for some obscure groups of organisms eg freshwater clam s small freshwater fish species and many insects it may prove difficult to find sufficient experts to provide peer reviews and these specialis ts often have other duties and may not be available or willing to serve governmental regulators in timely manner also there is the issue of compensating scientists who participate in peer reviews currently academic scientists reviewing documents for their eligibility for grants or for publication receive little if any compensati on reviews are generally accomplished by mail and are by design normally anonymous grafting such system onto contentious area which may require extensive meetings lost time from primary research and teaching activitie s and potentially the polar opposite of academic anonymity could prove difficult or further limit the pool of willing reviewers in addition achieving peer re view by impartial unbiased scientists may also be an issue if the listing or action being reviewed could involve major economic factors in which the scientis ts have an interest eg research funding employment etc in 19981999 the society of conservation biology scb in cooperation with fws performed national review of 135 r ecovery plans covering 181 species listed under the esa49 the national center for ecologi cal analysis and synthesis at the university of california santa barbara reviewed the database resulting from this study50 it found among other things that relatively low proportion 3040 of recovery criteria were clearly based on bi ological information that inclusion of academic scientists on recovery teams led to more explicit use of biological information in recovery plans and that recovery plans developed with federal scientists only were less likely to reflect adequate attention to species biology fws responded to this study with ten action ite ms to strengthen recovery

agencies have all decried at various times the scientific basis of various decisions this seeming consistency is misleading since the reasoning and objectives of the groups may be diametrically opposed to some extent the debate over the pplication of science in is predictable given the scarcity of information on many wild speci and the even higher likelihood of very limited data on rare species some exampl of questions that have surfaced in recent years that turn on matters at the dividing line between science and policy are if species distribution is poorly known as was the case with alabama sturgeon should it be listed if species taxonomic status is matter of dispute as when some argued whether northern goshawks of the rocky mountain area were distinct population segment shoul d it be protected as distinct population segment under if species is wideranging and begins on its own to reappear in anarea it once occupied as with fe w wolves in yellowstone should these animals be regarded as resident population for purposes of should formerly widelydistributed species such as bald eagleswarrant protection in parts of its range when it is still or has again become fairly abundant in other parts of its range should species that is possibl contaminated with genes from other populations as with florid panthers warrant protection more broadly how should the federal government regulate in the inevitable absence of complete information and what is the cu rrent posture of the in this regard precautionary principle the twoedged sword people who face job loss or communities fearing economic in stability would probably respond that the federal government should be quite certain that the species is present as with sturgeons is validly distinct as with nor thern goshawks is protected over wider an area than necessary as with wolves and is delisted as soon as possible as with bald eagles and florida panthers re presentatives of many scientific or environmental organizations would probabl counter that the federal government should provide margin of safety to reco gnize both the irreversibility of extinction and the frequent lack of complete informa tion this can best be achieved they might add by beginning to protect species wh their populations are still sufficient to avoid drastic and expensive measures g the extensive efforts necessary for whooping cranes and florida panthers and by seeking to promote and protect ecological balance wherever possible in effect it is the precautionary principle that is being invoked by these various interests this principle exemplified in the expression better safe than sorry can be loosely defined as applying to situa tions when potential harm is serious andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs17 52 for

dangers of taking precautions without adopting the precautiona ry principle critique of food safety regulation in the united states environmental law reporter v 31 2001 1004010047 significant aspect of the debate on this issu particularly in the regulation of pollution is what level of knowledge is needed about potential harm to justify action 53 note that studies to answer the questions raised by the supporters of the dam could be quite difficult might take several seasons and could even be impossible if the species is sufficiently rare yet fws must within limited time reach biological opinion on whether the dam would jeopardize the species or adversely modify critical habitatirreversible though full scien tific certainty is lacking the precautionary principle would have regulators act to reduce or eliminate the harm while weighing the probable costs and benefits of acting or not acting52 the precautionary principle is not the sole purview of one side of the debate scientists would invoke it in some debates to be certain of protecting species or its habitat while those fearing job loss would invoke it to protect their livelihoods at this philosophical level the scientif ic questions shade into law and policy how should regulations be administered and on which side should the burden of proof lie for protection that is should project be allowed to go ahead because it cannot be proven harmful to listed species or should it be stopped because it cannot be proven to avoid je opardy for example dam may be proposed whose reservoir would replace some miles of rapids with still wa ter thereby substantially altering large portion of some listed species known hab itat all sides may agree that construction of the da m would have this effect fws might issue jeopardy opinion on the dams construction knowing that the listed fish is found only in areas with rapids and that fish rarely to lerate this much change fws would argue that not only is it fulfilling its statutory obligation to ensure that the action would not jeopardize the species but also that it is basing its decision on sound science using the precautionary princi ple because there is not enough information to show that dam construction would be safe for the species supporters of the dam may ask for proof that the listed fish could not surv ive in the new reservoir or argue that this particular fish might not re spond in the same manner as ot her related species that had been studied more extensively53 they may further argue that fwss decision is based on bad science that in the face of such uncertainty the precautionary principle would have the agency construc t the dam and benef it those dependent on the reservoirs water rather than allow the threat to the listed fish to stop construction yet the underlying science is the same in this example the same scientific information is being used to justify opposite positions based on different applications of the precautionary principl and both positions would be based on the usually false hope that scientific certainty is even possible in policy decisions for many of the species facing extinc tion there may be little or information and insufficient personnel or funds available to study th em especially those species with little charisma or know n economic value what should be done in such instances should decisions be weighted in favor of the species or of the users eg irrigators ranchers builders the does not expressly addr ess this balancing act and certainly not quantitatively but considering the strongly protective purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs18 54 see the following section provisions on science 55 national research council science and the endangered species act washington dc national academy press 1995 p15 many of the issues under debate were studied described and discussed in this publi cation hereinafter referred to as science 56 committee report on legislation amending the discussed why listing was to be solely scientific decision and also interpreted commercial data as meaning trade data eg landings of fish skins sold or export statistic s in discussing the addition of the word solely hrept 97567 1982 at pp 1920 states the principal purpose of the amendments to section 4 is to ensure that decisions pertaining to the listing and delisting of species are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological consideratio ns from affecting such decisions to accomplish this and other purposes section 4a is amended in several instances section 4b of the act is amended in several instances by section 1a2 of hr 6133 first the legislation requires that the secretary base his determinations regarding the listing or delisting of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him the addition of the word solely is intended to remove from the process of the listing or delisting of species any factor not related to the biological status of the species th committee strongly believes that economic considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and intends that the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and such statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act not apply the committee notes and specifically rejects the characterization of this language by the department of the interior as maintaining the status quo and continuing to allow the secretary to apply executive order 12291 and other statutes in evaluating alternatives to listing the only alternatives involved in the listing of species are whether the species should be listed as endangered or threatened or not listed at all applying economic criteria to the analysis of these alternatives and to any phase of the species listing process is applying economics to the determinations made under section 4 of the act and is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the word solely in this legislation section 4b of the act as amended provides that listings shall be based solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available the committee did not change this information standard because of its interpretation of the word commercial continuedof the to save and recover sp ecies and considering the statutory requirement to use the best data available 54 arguably the intends that all declining species should be given the bene fit of the doubt and margin of safety provided many scientists f eel this is the appropriate stance that we should apply the precautionary principle to save all th pieces species since we lack the knowledge to pick and choose among species others counter that such protection may prove unnecessary while imposing subs tantial economic injury the national research council concluded that the current balance between these two views in the agencies leans toward less protection the structure of hypothesis testing rela ted to listing and jeopardy decisions can make it more likely for an endangered sp ecies to be denied needed protection than for nonendangered species to be protected unnecessarily55 provisions on science the requires that decisions to list species be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available56 and after reviewing the statushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs19 56 continued to allow the use of trade data retention of the word commercial is not intended in any way to authorize the use of economic consid erations in the process of listing species the conference report on the same legislation confirms that it was the intent of both chambers that economic factors not play role in the designation and listing of species for protection hrept 97835 1982 at p 19 states section 2 of the conference substitute amends section 4 of the act in several ways the principal purpose of these amendments is to ensure that decisions in every phase of the process pertaining to the listing or delisting of species are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological cons iderations from affecting such decisions the committee of conference hereinafter the committee adopted the house language which requires the secretary to base determinations regarding the listing or delisting of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him as noted in the house report economic considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and ch statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act will not apply to any phase of the listing process the standards in the act relating to the designation of critical habitat remain unchanged the requirement that the secretary consider fo r listing those species that states or foreign nations have designated or identified as in need of protection also remains unchanged the committee adopted with modifications the senate amendments which combined and rewrote section 4b and f of the act to streamline the listing process by reducing the time periods for rulemaking consolidating public meeting and hearing requirements and establishing virtually iden tical procedures for the listing and delisting of species and for the designation of critical habitat 57 for example the science of taxonomy and systematics has been revolutionized by experimental tools acquired from both ge netics and computational biology science p vii 58 for example economic impacts and other relevant impacts must be considered when designating critical habitat under 4b2 of the 16 usc 1533b2 and the secretary may modify designati on based on these considerationsof the species and taking into account t hose efforts being may by states political subdivisions of states or foreign nati ons to protect the species the word solely was added in the 1982 amendments to the to clarify that the determination of endangered or threatened status was in tended to be biological decision made without reference to economic or other nonbiological factors which could be considered in fashioning re sponses once species is liste d there is elaboration on the meaning of the phrase elsewhere in the itself or in agency regulations incomplete data different interpretations among scientists and evolving disciplines in science57 can make the consideration of re levant science challenging for the regulatory agencies the decision of whether or not to list species can be compared to diagnosing versus treating cancer whether patient has cancer should be strictly medical decision other factors wh ether the patient can affo rd treatment whether the cancer can be treated effectively etc can be considered in deciding how or even whether to treat the cancer similarly congress provided that scientific data alone should be the basis for listing decisions but other factors are to be considered in other decisions and actions under the act58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs20 59 in very exceptional cases well under 01

species consultation handbook 60 the handbook states that effort s should be made to develop information but if biological opinion must be rendered promptly it should be based on the available information giving the benefit of the doubt to the species with consultation possibly being reinitiated if additional information becomes available this phrase is drawn from the conference report on

effort to develop additional informa tion and that the statutory language continues to give the benefit of the doubt to the species62 in 1994 long before the enactment of the iqa fws and nmfs

especially when other interests are adversely affected courts have elaborated on the use of sc ience in general and on the best data available language holding for exam ple that the statutory phrase does not require and hence court ca nnot order fws or nmfs to conduct additional studies to obtain missing data and that the agen cy must rely on even inconclusive or uncertain information if that is the best available at the time of listing decision77 the relevant agency cannot ignore available biological information78 especially if that information is the most current79 or is scientifically superior to that on which the decisionmaker relied80 federal agency requestin g consultation under 7 of the cannot refuse to provide fws with the most relevant scien tific data available from reputable scientists on the ground that it was not perfect or its methodology could be criticized because doing so would eviscerate th statutory requirement that the best available science be used81 however if there is lack of science the agency cannot rely on data that its own scientists unanim ously agree is inaccurate82 nor can one of the agencies treat one species differently from the way other similarly situated species are treated by relying on previous and inconsistent agency criteria83 the agency may not postpone listing declining species until it is on the brink of extinction in reliance on possibl but uncertain future actions of an agency84 court also has said that the best scientific and commercial data available is not standard of absolute certainty and is fact that reflects congress intent that the fws take conservation meas ures before species is conclusively headed for extinction85 if fws does not base its lis tings on speculation or surmise or disregard superior data the fact that the studies on which it does rely are imperfect does not undermine those author ities as the best scientific data available thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32992crs24 86

so lved one case struck down regulations that totally banned duck hunting in an ar ea to protect one species of duck87 another case stated that low numbers of particular species alone do not necessarily warrant listing the reasons for the low numbers whether the numbers are declining and how experts view the population numbers must be considered88 another court stated that the bar fws has to clear in terms of evidence is very low but it must at least clear it in the context of issuing incidental take permits under 10 of the this means the agency must demonstrate that species is or could be in an area before the agency can regulate it and must establish the causal connection between the land use being regula ted and harm to the species in question mere speculation as to the potential for harm is not sufficient89 fws and nmfs basically must rely on existing regulatory mechanisms in their listing determinations90 and not on future uncertain or voluntary actions to justify decision not to list species91 although cooperative effo rts may be considered92 in one case the court held that if biological opini on lacks meaningful analysis so that the information supportin g determination is not available the opinion is inadequate although not necessarily invali d however in that case too because the biological opinion was not coextensive in scope with the agency action it necessarily failed to consider important aspects of the problem and was therefore arbitrary and capricious93 the opinion in this instance did not analyze the available data on cumulative effects of

ee hearings have been held and some bills have been reported none have been enacted94 below are some of the fundamental issues that have been debated in these bills proponents of sound scien ce legislation believe that amendments are necessary to rein in the perceived extremism of the that allowed federal agencies to use shoddy science eg to prevent klamath basin farmers from receiving the irrigation water they needed95 furthermore supporters believe amendments are needed to help those who have to deal with an unreasonable they claim that private property rights would be helped by these proposals because species would have to actually be enda ngered to be listed and that it would be nearly impossible to use falsified data which they charged was being done by government agencies96 also they see this legislation as improving recreational and commercial access to public lands they claim that access to public lands is improved when decisions use pee rreviewed science to protect truly endangered species97 opponents voice concerns that sound scie nce legislation is misnomer and would substantially weaken the best ava ilable science used to implement the and undermine the precautionary approach to protecting imperiled plants and animals98 they are concerned that such legislation might weaken the by putting in place requirements for studies and processes that are impossible to achieve radically weakening americas ability to protect its threatened and endangered species and wildlands they further belie ve that legislation using the mask of sound scie nce would result in special rights for industry and increase the costs delays and bureaucracy associated with implementing the nations most important wildlife conservation law99 they further claim widesp read

concerns with the structur and budgetary impacts of enacting this legislation we also believe that the department has existing authority to implement improvements that will greatly enhance the science we use we believe that the additional processes adde d by the two bills would be costly to implement we are concerned that th considerable new process required in both bills will impact the fish and wildlife services ability to provide consultations and other decisions in timely manner and in some cases may compromise the fish and wildlife servic ability to meet statutory deadlines in july 2002 letter from more than 300 scientists was nt to members of congress requesting that the current deba over science in the not lead to changes that could weaken the pr ovisions to stem the loss of biological resources101 they were concerned that adding requirements would cause additional delays and increase bureaucratic procedures for crucial decisions that added peer review requirements were unnecessary that new statutory limits on the use of scientific met hods eg analysis of population viability for the collection and analysis of scientific da ta would reduce protection nd that policymakers should follow the precautionary principle and take the most prudent course of action by choosing alternatives that are not likely to harm listed species
