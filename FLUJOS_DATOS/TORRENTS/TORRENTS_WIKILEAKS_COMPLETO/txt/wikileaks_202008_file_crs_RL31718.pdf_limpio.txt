shaikh hamad replaced his father khalifa who had ruled qatar for 23 years at the time khalifa had turned over many routine affairs of state to shaikh hamad then crown prince and commander of qatars small armed forces the ruling thani family rallied behind shaikh hamad who quickly consolidated control in february 1996 supporters of shaikh hamads father unsuccessfully attempted countercoup which prompted shaikh hamad to initiate civil proceedings against his father to retrieve an alleged 312 billion of state assets supposedly in his possession 2 the alleged mastermind of the countercoup attempt shaikh hamads cousin and former minister shaikh hamad bin jassim bin hamad thani was captured outside of qatar and prosecuted he remains on death row saudi arabian mediation facilitated an outofcourt settlement between the shaikh hamad and his father and they have reconciled shaikh hamad at age 54 has been described as representative of an emerging new generation of persian gulf leaders

thani family and other notables to governing council of ministers cabinet which is headed by prime minister and foreign minister hamad bin jassim bin jabr thani the countrys constitution approved in april 2003 and in force as of june 2005 formalized qatari tradition that the rule of the state is hereditary within the thani family in addition to the previously contested principle that future successors to the throne will follow the line of the emirs male offspring4 previous succession decisions have been characterized by rivalry among different branches of the thani family and it is unclear whether future transition to shaikh hamads heir would be contested by other elements of the royal family in august 2003 the emir replaced his third oldest jassem bin hamad thani as heir apparent his fourth oldest tamim bin hamad thani is now the named successor to the qatari monarchy5 the constitution also states that legislative authority will reside in the hands of 45member advisory council majlis shura twothirds of which will be directly elected and onethird appointed by the emir from among ministers or others6 preparations for national elections for the new advisory council are underway and women will have the right to vote in the elections and to run for office the advisory council will have oversight authority over the council of ministers and will be able to propose legislation and review budgets the constitution also empowers the advisory council to issue motions of noconfidence against government ministers noconfidence motions must be approved by twothirds of the advisory council council members will serve fouryear terms g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g138g151g141g561g7g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 shaikh hamad and his advisers have embarked on limited political reform program designed to gradually make qatars government more participatory and accountable although series of national elections have been held see below the government continues to maintain strict limits on freedoms of assembly and association series of new laws allow for individuals to organize political demonstrations and public gatherings but organizers must obtain permit from the government and qatari authorities may impose restrictions on the topics of discussion political parties are not allowed in qatar and all private professional and cultural associations must register with the state and are monitored 4 the constitution was approved in nationwide referendum in which 966 of participating voters 68987 approved the constitution and only 33 opposed it 2145 5 jassem bin hamad replaced his older brother mishaal bin hamad as heir apparent in october 1996 shaikh jassem reportedly was either dissatisfied with his lack of substantive responsibilities or did not have an interest in continuing to serve as crown prince according to some reports the emirs second oldest fahd bin hamad thani closely associated himself with arab volunteers to the antisoviet conflict in afghanistan during the 1980s and is believed to retain close ties to conservative islamic figures see michael knights and anna

assembly qatar had fullyappointed 35member advisory council that could only make recommendations to the council of ministers qatars old provisional constitution provided for modified electoral procedure in choosing members of the council and threeyear term nevertheless the council remained appointive in practice and terms of the council members were extended in three or fouryear increments

components of the countrys gradual transition toward greater democratic participation the elections also have provided trial and error setting for the creation and improvement of qatars national electoral infrastructure in april 1998 3700 business community leaders participated in an election for national chamber of commerce selecting 17 members from slate of 41 candidates in march 1999 central municipal council election occurred in which 248 candidates including 6 women competed for 29 seats and all adult qatari citizens with the exception of members of the police and armed forces

unopposed8 the latest round of elections was held in april 2007 and voter turnout was higher than in previous elections authorities announced that 51 of 28000 eligible qatari voters cast ballotsover 80 of the countrys population of 907000 are ineligible to vote because they are foreign nationals9 although the municipal council functions primarily in an advisory role to the ministry of municipal and agricultural affairs some observe rs view it as steppingstone to the wider political liberalization implied by the creation of the advisory council by the new constitution similarly the national elections for the municipal council are seen by qatari officials as test cases for future advisory council elections special electoral law for the advisory council elections remains under consideration and efforts to prepare candidates are underway controversy has developed in some qatari circles over concern that the draft elections law discriminates against naturalized qatari citizens by establishing certain criteria for their voting eligibility g10g158g150g138g151g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561

network in 1996 with 140 million grant since then the qatari government has provided most of the channels funding as advertising revenue only meets 35 40 of jazeeras annual operating expenses qatari government officials and jazeera executives argue that the stations inability to attract sufficient advertising revenue is function of the channels controversial status across the middle east these officials and executives allege that other arab governments exert pressure on companies based in or operating in their countr ies to refrain from advertising on jazeera because the channel may provide coverage of internal political social and economic developments that are unflattering to ruling regimes or less biased or censored than traditional governmentrun media outlets 16 jazeera devotes less of its air time to coverage of qatari affairs than of the internal affairs of other arab states in 2005 british media reports concerning alleged comments made by president george w bush referring to the possible bombing of jazeera headquarters in doha sparked widespread concern and debate in qatar leading some qataris to question their countrys support for us policy initiatives17 jazeera launched
