edited and indexed by frank gerbode md they are not to be read by anyone else without express permission from one of these persons anyone who reads these notes must do so in the realization that this is not source data and these notes are not to be quoted as source data nor used for technical purposes they contain many personal observations references and cognitions as well as many points of editing and interpretations of lrh data whatever i was aware of as nonlrh data or possibly nonlrh data i put in brackets furthermore all tables and illustrations being to variable extent my own originations or interpretations may be considered to be in brackets however while i have tried to be as careful and accurate as possible in putting together these notes and while they contain errors that are known to there are bound to be many inaccuracies in them simply because alteris has way of seeping into any such endeavor to greater or lesser extent hopefully lesser the notes are mainly intended to give an idea of what was said in the tapes all the actual lrh data must be found in the tapes themselves however this set of notes may be helpful in finding the proper tape in which to look for the source data frank gerbode md 2 nov 76 editors note these transcripts were originally recorded on ibm format in converting the data to macintosh format certain features such as diagrams indexs and page references could not be preserved when ever page reference is given in the text eg see also pp 123 this should be ignored other than to denote that there are other references to that data contained elsewhere 105008c30 lect preventive dianetics schizophrenia is caused by superabundance of control circuitry it is contained in the phrase im all alone paranoia has the phrase theyre all against the repeater phrase i love you gets the pc into sympathy engram prevent aberration by keeping calm around child dont quarrel pull attention units to pt by creating necessity level even if it has to be an artificial one eg person who is drowning and seeing his whole life flashing before him is coming up to pt if you can do this to kid in early life nothing will bother him later cultural patterns such as an extended period of mourning are just cultural patterns in the absence of engrams you dont get long term misemotion it should be made part of the social mores not to talk or even say shh around injured or anaten persons in industry you get the situation where an individual who has worked in one place gets chain of injuries with the same perceptics and lots of words therefore he is out of pt at work and may cause industrial accidents 100 of auto accidents are caused by engramic restimulation whether of the driver mechanic or manufacturers accident proneness is telepathic one finds that engrams are the best telepathic broadcasters this is analogous to an alarm system for the herd thus of two persons who have never met one will act out the other valence in the others engram at high tones affinity is raw cohesiveness at lower tones it is as if there is herd that must be alerted and needs shock eg fear grief anger to be broadcast to cohere the herd into fight or flight you can notice this telepathic alarm system when you enter room where people have been quarreling so when you are in the society of others you run into this all the time similarly in the vicinity of accidents other accidents occur engrams are keyed in and then acted out thus accidents come in threes if you took drivers licenses away from the 8 of people who have been involved in car accidents involving injury you could eliminate 90 of the accidents if you audit grief charges in pregnant women with sobbing or selfbeating etc you may get transmission of engrams to the child then when later you try to audit the child you may get oddities or restimulation from dianetic patter which is part of the childs incident therefore probably dianetic patter will have to be changed in 15 to 20 years so auditing pregnant woman has to be adjudicated you should go ahead if there is threat of attempted abortion or difficult birth also you should observe how the mother behaves during auditing by the way girdles etc cause more or less continuous engrams for the child so watch out for young kids or unwed mothers or anyone who would try to hide pregnancy social aberrations are fragments of old morals whose practical origin is forgotten morals in their turn are socially agreed upon attempt to handle problem for which rational answer exists its juryrigged solution thus some morals may be unethical 5009c231 lect general dianetics part 1 mental therapy is at least as old as the aesculepian school who used hellebore to cause chemically convulsive therapy perception during surgical anesthesia old reference american journal of neurology 1914 the reactive mind and the analytical one are biochemically independent thus it is possible to inhibit one or the other independently by chemical means the reactive mind is the sole source of error cf freud the psychopathology of everyday life society as kind of organism can have engrams 11when cell divides it gives all its progeny its memory this can be proven by conditioning cells so the cell brings hair color instinctive behavior patterns and the genetic personality but along with this comes any moment of injury the cells have held back full power from the analytical mind in moments of danger to enforce fight flight etc there is also somatic mind containing training patterns that can easily be changed by the analytical mind and organic responses which can also be controlled analytically cf yogis but the engram bank can bypass the analytical mind and seize control of the somatic mind the common cold comes from the birth engram 5009c232 lect general dianetics part 2 if you want to test unconscious recall use subject with full sonic recall and inflict little pain to give an anchor point use pentothal and nonsense syllables the best dianetic auditors are writers you can do straightwire from age 3 on and perhaps run grief engrams but nothing heavier generally person can run standard auditing from age 8 on in this tape hubbard gives lot of information on early attempts at objective validation of dianetics by means of psychological testing 5203c03 hcl1 introduction to scientology milestone one wichita hpc1 science has gotten to the point where it is just study of piles of data it has drawn away from being body of knowledge and consists now of unevaluated facts the natural history of science is 1 push out into the unknown 2 collecting data 3 align data around few theories 4 at the end it becomes stultified it is capable of producing an effect in the physical universe but thats about all dianetics was mainly interested in aberration it was not intended to be allembracive scientology is study of knowledge not therapy however we must now get back into the mind again although the goal is not therapy how can you teach knowledge to an imperfect computer the mind would come close to perfection except for certain things which prevent perfection the mind can know without letting itself know the task of the processor is to get better working methods for others then let them help him the blind leading the blind however may fail when the blind are too blind therefore scientology could only be applied by the very sane it is concerned with the able sanity is an absolute perfection in reason that would resolve problems to the optimum good of all those concerned absolutes are not obtainable even if you were absolutely sane you would still lack data milestone 1 is complete ability this is necessary condition to handling the world rehabilitation of the insane will be accomplished as an automatic spinoff from self improvement and improving the able scientology could be defined as knowledge and its application in conquering the physical universe the iron cover is off what we already know we have the complete anatomy of the iron cover fac one everything else is lock you can start any processes off this first engram using the emeter we have very careful map of target one it is boobytrapped but when you know the booby trap you can walk right through it 12scientology is exact there are maybes up to the point of thought creating physical motion there is very little selfdeterminism up to the point of milestone one when you do get there you will be free of lrh and scientology too even what we call clear is not there yet when you have arguments with yourself you have different personalities in yourself arguing these may exist in different areas eg the stomach area anyone will show up on the meter as having at least three different personalities if you see two arguing there is third which is kind of noble its adjudicating or its sound asleep then there may be fourth one these are circuits but they are personalities they are always in the same place in the same people if you shift from the left side to the right to the center you get somatic in the center of the forehead could this be the third eye you as an individual an engram the proper thing to do is to run it the point is to become one person you have to run this thing before you can be you it was done by supersonic waves the engram thus created says not to know basic problem with anyones understanding of scientology is not knowing the words word is just code the semanticists ran off the road by saying that there was such thing as an undefinable this is not the case in the realm of the knowable 5203c03 hcl2 introduction to scientology outline of therapy hpc2 use light tech to get to heavy incident then run it out using thought emotion and effort processing the goal is to be able to run fac one the mind is an entity so is the physical universe thought is beingness it has wavelength it is true static there is limit of capacity limit of time it can record the physical universe and use it against itself it can animate and control the physical universe it is not in the physical universe since it has not the properties of the physical universe it is like mirror in which room is reflected there is real room there thought can pick up energy and matter in space and time and mobilize it thought takes the laws it has learned and turns it against the physical universe like mirror the brain is to translate thought into action the mind looks at this the brain does not contain purpose thus the mind is necessary it stores past recordings of the physical universe it is the purpose or beingness that can exist without body to handle the physical universe it is hard to accomplish things in the physical universe without body the mind stores pictures of energy it can project an image into the physical universe and cause an effect pictures have effort in them in addition to perceptions the mind continuously makes conclusions from old pictures to estimate the future according to its purposes it tells answers and puts them into action it also stores conclusions another bundle of old pictures on top of this is the purpose and beingness of the person that is making him do this steps the mind takes 1 it has thought to be 2 takes pictures 3 combines these 4 records efforts 5 it takes pieces of the physical universe and combines these to make body 6 the body can then do things in the physical universe the minds purposes 1 to be 2 to conquer the physical universe thus we have three echelons 131 the physical universe 2 thought 3 who told you to survive the physical universe is characterized by motion which is matter changing in space this being the definition of time this gives you mest physics has problem with circular definition of space and time in that these are defined against each other physics view of the universe is that it consists mainly of motion this is an incomplete view thought is static of unlimited capabilities that has wavelength space or time it is impinged upon physical universe that has matter energy space and time the mission of thought is survival in the physical universe and in order to do this it is effecting conquest of the physical universe mysticism is in the second echelon the fundamental of physics is not complex but the use of it can be complex similarly with the human mind the mind is neither in nor out of the mest universe at any rate it is not in the physical universe the mind has an effect on the body one reason the body is suboptimal is because of the minds considerations about it the emeter while it does not measure the mind measures the physiological effect of the minds operation the third echelon is anything and everything that might lie north of the above it would answer the question who told you to survive you get into questions like why is nothing nothing if nothing is nothing then its motion in handling these echelons one must go on gradient getting to the top of one problem before starting on the next one we must finish one before two and two before we get into three people effectively commit suicide by starting on echelon three from the bottom of one you have to handle your aberrations first otherwise you lose your marbles in scientology we try to find an effective way to handle facsimiles and memory you can eliminate them or you can file them accurately truly selfdetermined person is unlikely to be affected by facsimiles in fact only one incident was strong enough to do this fac one person is as sane as he can handle memories and plan for the future 5212c01 pdc1 scientology how to understand and study it homo sapiens is four part entity 1 thetan 2 body 3 thetan machinery 4 reactivesomatic mind the pc is what you are working with and he is nondimensional point in space who is an energy production unit definition spacation is process having to do with the rehabilitation of the creation of space second meaning is that spacation is the subject of space this is above the subject of energy it is dirty trick to make person into theta clear without giving him data about it he knows this data potentially but is not aware of it if he knew about it he wouldnt be in the mest universe this subject is the anatomy of universes the construction maintenance and destruction of universes of different kinds and dimensions the study of the basic structure and experience called the mest universe is basic one the laws of the mest universe or natural laws are the inevitable average of agreement starting with the study of natural law we get to the study of that which made natural law that thing capable of making agreements which become natural law in auditing pc you are undoing the agreement that makes him part of the natural law emc squared probably wasnt true 30 or 40 trillion years ago in arslycus where the pc spent 10000 lives working at the same job 14arslycus got bigger and bigger it was just built out in space one day people got the idea of mass agreed to it and got careful about it arslycus blew up and everybody was glad to see it go at this point the law of gravity was widely agreed upon there is natural tendency to push out of the group those individuals who dont agree with the group thus person who thinks that the mest universe is his universe gets sent to the spin bin in scientology we are not trying to disagree with the mest universe we are just taking it and making it appear and disappear at will for any individual every now and then pc in processing gets an uneasy feeling that theres some thought he doesnt dare think hes coming up against agreement and doesnt want the responsibility of undoing it because he cant handle that much energy if you could get him to where he could handle the energy hell face the thought probably all that would happen is that the mest universe would momentarily disappear for him then hed fish around to get an orientation point to get back into it you just have to know how to handle space to get into and out of the mest universe people use the old energy of the mest universe instead of creating stuff from scratch they hang onto being identities using bodies like id cards instead of being individuals this does furnish randomity and provides emotions that one can pretend to be the effect and not the cause of the identification card permits the individual to make living so he can feed the id card the tarot is philosophical machine preserved as playing cards these cards represent concepts of human experience thus for instance the fool could represent person at 45 on the tone scale such person would have passed out of agreement by knowing all agreement the sequence of events relating to agreement with the mest universe is 1 agreement 2 agree or else 3 we dont care if you agree we are going to punish you anyway 4 below agreement notis of agreement mest is in complete confusion of having agreed to everything owning and controlling nothing society builds into people conditioned social tone one has the tone level of ones society as being body combination thats the tone level pcs bank will have the tone of his facsimiles and ridges as being one has different tone level one cannot study scientology from the point of view of any other system one can only study it by looking at you or the other people you know applying the definitions and seeing what is or isnt there scientology consists in the study of 1 progressive examination of the agreements that came to bring about the mest universe 2 the science of how agreements are made 3 what are the beings that make these agreements 5406c04 6acc37 the knowtosex scale the mind and the tone scale theres line breaking existence in half above and below which is know to sex scale the upper of the two scales has something good about each level the lower one has something bad about each level see fig 1 eg person who knows sex is bad is at the bottom next they will know eating then symbols etc is bad the tone scale is logarithmically dwindling scale it has wide spaces at the top and narrow ones at the bottom the know to sex scale has distance factor to it the particles are progressively further apart as you ascend the scale until you reach know where you dont have any particles for instance at emotion the particles are twice as many and half as far apart as at look 15thus according to this gradient scale you cant go straight from bad sex to good sex so you have to go some to convince person who thinks sex is bad that its good or vice versa suppress condense thats why auditing appears to produce gradual results pc is fixed or dispersed about life and life is divisible into these factors before you can get an individual to change his mind about some subject you have to get him to change across lot of categories also all parts of the scale except the knowingness band contain particles as long as the individual is allergic to space and particles hell tend to crossconnect the different bands of the scale as per restimulation whenever he runs into space or particles so our procedure is to get him to change his mind about various kinds of particles gradiently until we can get him to change his mind about all particles below sex is mystery which is like lower level knowingness in his study of dreams freud started with mystery then proceeded to sex if you could reveal to patient that mystery was not unsolvable he would improve but sometimes freud would take too many mysteries from someone who had scarcity and hed go down to lower level looking with most people freud would get them through sex up to eat theorists got stuck trying to figure whether eat or sex was the basis of everything none of them was up to effort themselves they were in awe of anyone who could indulge in sports psychologists with their intelligence tests were at the level of symbols at thinkingness man figurefigures to avoid effort engineering is the study of how to make effort use effort this is very covert and is not confront of effort psychoanalysis never got above the area of stimulusresponse with their theory of association they didnt believe in independent thinking person who reacts to op pro by dup is way down the knowsex scale he will in the course of processing go up and down the scale only hitting prominent points on his way up this is crossing barriers which the individual has put up to protect himself in the business of livingness the names of these barriers are looking emoting etc the barrier of looking is space next comes barrier of barrage of emotional states for instance of serenity or enthusiasm each lower emotion could be considered protection against the upper ones he uses boredom to protect himself from enthusiasm antagonism is barrage of particles used to fend something off anger is ridge fear is defense who wants to close terminals with someone who is in fear eg animals in fear taste bad people in fear smell bad grief goes like this im solid here i cant move take care of its barrier you mustnt do certain things to person in grief the upper edge of apathy is the barrier i dont care the lower edge is eat being sick to ones stomach is an apathy of eating vomiting this is evidence that below the band of emoting you get increasingly deeper emotions connected with each step down hence the apathy of eating vomiting the apathy of effort would be wanting to be less than inert this is what people experience who are having rough time with the mind efforting is observably barrier force used to protect thinkingness is figuring out where he will be when something else is elsewhere or where he will put something when he himself is not there hes placing things in terms of force so at this level you cant carry revolver you have to figure out where money is safe how to keep people from tripping you up predict their intentions etc if you had weapon you could protect yourself at the efforting band and you wouldnt have to think at symbols we get dont look in here it might be dangerous im really not here im elsewhere attack this symbol if you like because it isnt i eating is way of getting attention and admiration from what one eats and as such may be very satisfying sex protects one from the present by providing an escape into the future symbol that cant be in the present can appear on the future track you could process someone with get the idea of putting something there now get the idea of moving out now get the idea of coming back and finding what you have put there that is the action of sex it is very satisfying to the pc sex also says dont eat its something else to do the individual felt unsafe without these barriers when he put something out as barrier to protect him he made it senior to him hence its dwindling spiral so far we have discussed each of these levels as defense against motivators but we can also use each of these barriers as an overt level here we get dispersal manifestations down the line tears as defense are flow but there is an unnamed dispersal at grief that is offensive similarly there is an unnamed dispersal at apathy actually what you have is series of know to sex scales fig 2 you can see this in running op pro by dup someone might start at effort then go to emotion to knowing its silly to sex impulse then figurefigure then new know then eat emote new look etc he is hitting high 16points going upscale through ridges he will linger in the upper ones longer with more manifestations as he differentiates better and better at the bottom everything identifies with everything effort sex the way you look etc one could draw the scale to indicate dropping dominance at the highest level each band has about the same emphasis at the first harmonic down the emphasis will be on knowingness at the next harmonic down what you do with all the levels is look hightones thetan loves to do this at the next harmonic down the whole scale is colored by emotion at the next lower it is colored by effort as in german society as opposed to italian society which is colored by emotion next we get the figurefigure that is characteristic of latin american societies southern california or universities next we get the whole scale colored by symbols here you get erudition eg the idea that mathematicians have done it all for you theres need to think similarly with eating then sex below that level it gets undifferentiated into an identification of everything with everything it all gets very compressed effort is sex if he is below this level he is nuts this scale provides method of predicting how long it will take the pc to recover and how long it will take him to differentiate 5410c20 8acc14 the parts of man this is discussion of the parts of man as understood through r261 and r262 the parts of man are related to overts and motivators this is be cause thetan as such cannot be harmed and therefore cannot receive motivator so he would have to have confusion of identity to receive motivator man consists of four distinct separate though related parts 1 thetan 2 body 3 thetan machinery 4 reactivesomatic mind dianetics covers the first four dynamics even the first dynamic can be split into these four parts when you thought you were treating the first dynamic you were actually treating the third the absolute book 1 clear would be the awareness of awareness unit around the end of 1951 lrh mentions that erasure of all facsimiles would result in demolishment of the body see advanced procedures and axioms in book 1 we were talking about engrams of this lifetime erasing these would give relative clear the only trouble was that the awareness of awareness unit after few years of this research kept insisting on exteriorizing and it turned out to be the person himself if he felt bad when he was out sort of with character he is not stabilized so the first dynamic is the awareness of awareness unit as modified by various things pieces of thetan machinery are his creations hidden and forgotten by him all the energy used by the machines really comes from the thetan though for randomity he may consider that he needs to eat to keep on going he can also understand something from someone else add it to his own machinery and blame someone for giving him machine the thetan invests the body with characteristics then he is afraid of losing these characteristics but this is really problem he can invest himself with these characteristics the thetan can also duplicate himself he can create new different life unit with full determinism power personality etc it could have more power than he if it is set up that way sex is the super condensed manytimesviad activity of creating other life forms it is only more complex because it is considered to be the thetan actually needs system to create living being 17thetan machinery is not intended to have life of its own but sometimes the thetan endows machinery with life in dmsmh lrh talks of the possibility of setting the mind alongside the body this was misinterpreted worst in etherapy one can do this and get himself haunted by living beings he can create them then go off and leave them this is basic life multiplication 1d creating 3d through 2d so mankind could have one common ancestor it would not make that one superior however since the offspring could just as well be the superior ones furthermore an individual could just repostulate himself back into his creative unit and thus disappear especially since in reality there is time all one could lose would be the knowingness that he had done it one would have to shut that off for oneself now do you think you understand valence little better having multiplied himself often an individual had laid aside this ability begun to hang on to the only one computation and is holding his ability to be himself closely to himself he tries hard to maintain an identity as 1d he becomes too involved in his own agreements and thinks he needs sex to create being but even that creates only body which is the granted beingness of many individualities based upon one individuality that started that genetic line the thetan got so complex with all his machinery and so interlocked with so many other individualities he granted so much beingness in all directions that he forgot who and what he was and just knew he was supposed to be this identity and repeat the manufactured creation of this identity this would make him solid and his machinery would have composited at this point he would be body and his machinery would become the reactivesomatic mind the thetan gets so solid as body that he can be taken over and controlled by another thetan and his machines the reactive mind that goes along with body cannot be controlled unless another thetan comes along and takes over the body however the body can control the reactive mind there is difference between the reactive and the somatic mind thetan can create another thetan from this we can get species which implies other species hence 5th dynamic thetans are generally not as anxious to control animal bodies as human bodies since mens affairs are complex enough to be interesting to control so animals are generally body reactive mind condensed thetan machinery by addressing the alterised complexity as in psychotherapy we would never get an asisness but just more mass the auditor thus must address the right part the thetan otherwise he might as well try to process rock as body the rock is more complex being denser therefore it has more vias on the comm lines the distance from cause to effect in rock has so many vias and complexities in it that it loses both cause and effect for the rock the impulse towards religion in most people is to discover basic cause however it leads them to go through vias which gets them lost the way to find cause is to find the highest level of freedom assume it and then know because you will be cause and will therefore be capable of being an effect as processing improves we find that the better we understand something the better we can control it and the less need to process it so that it can be controlled so in modern scientology and dianetics it is only necessary to knock out the factors you dont want to process because you understand them well enough to control them the first of these is the reactive mind there is sense in processing it since we know how to control it also theres use in processing the body medicine will take care of that machinery is interesting but its not necessary so were left with only the thetan to process and we process the thetan just enough so that he can take control of his other parts having recognized them right thought as in christian science would work fine if you had clear to begin with the christian scientists have limits on what right thought is but actually right thought is optimum survival on all dynamics so in processing we can start with be three feet back of your head for those who dont respond to that the overtmotivator sequence is good place to start its the mechanical process by which thetan becomes solid enough to be body surrounded by his machinery which has become the bank behind the overtmotivator sequence lies the consideration that matches the overt and motivator you must be downstairs from pandeterminism to selfdeterminism for this to happen justifier is the mockup or overt act demanded by person guilty of an unmotivated act it is something nonexistent as an effort to justify the unmotivated act its false motivator theres nothing really wrong with the motivatorovert sequence it balances out one gets insane or even hurt by it but the unmotivated act justifier sequence is the villain thus the thetan is doomed because he can never really receive motivator thats the whole reason for the dwindling spiral thetan can never be harmed but he can consider hes been harmed act harmed and dwindle everything the pc tells you is search for justifier his search through his bank quickly asises 18his few true motivators so he has too many overts and must get himself sick downtrodden and betrayed motivator hunger he gives justifiers and pretends theyre motivators the way you could get him into this dwindling spiral is to define harm for him this gets into good and evil r261 and r262 it only requires the consideration that harm can take place to set off the unmotivated actjustifier sequence you just get this consideration from yourself person must have intended harmful destruction and succeeded to define the concept harmful for himself only when someone destroys something hes created does he define harm for the other fellow he had to do it first himself because he had to communicate first to be communicated to since otherwise he couldnt have been located any solidity or departure from the static is lie the way we depart from the absolute truth of static is via the lies of justifiers this is the source of all inabilitys and deficiencies the thetan also has an anxiety about creating an effect another thetan can never get motivator thetan knows he can never receive an effect except as he considers it and agrees so he knows he can never create an effect on another thetan so he must consider life units as solids he gets upset when he considers them thetans hence people turn away from scientology because they are afraid of exterior beings the thetan wants to create an effect but cant without being guilty of an unmotivated act all he had to do to get messed up was to discover he could harm others he then tried to justify his unmotivated acts and got solid and his whole past track would be nearly all hallucination the insane pack along an enormous number of mocked up facsimiles justifiers pictures of things that never occurred good violent fast way to handle this state of affairs is to have the pc mock up things that anything on the seventh dynamic could do to him this remedies his havingness motivator hunger you can actually use all dynamics another process the pc spots all the spots where he or anyone considered that harm could be or had been done r261 and r262 in creation of human ability pp 153 154 5506c03 asmc3 history of research and investigation one good thing about hellfire and brimstone type of religion is that it at least acknowledges the existence of the spirit the scopes trial was turning point in which the theory that man is merely machine became fashionable in past years there was great spiritual awareness and perception even as recently as the sixteenth century duelists used to have an embarrassing thing happen when they killed the opponent hed exteriorize and zap them and pester them afterwards as mechanical knowledge increased spiritual awareness decreased people thought this was progress despite the increase in amount of madness if theres spiritual liability to destroying other people and their possessions one would expect crime to become more prevalent and so it does 5506c06 asmc15 what scientology is doing we need better social order when an organization says its above reproach or an individual claims hes untouchable chaos ensues the control and direction of man depends upon the good will and good state of man not upon iron bars cells shock machines society is as sick as it has sick members the way to make society well however isnt just to cure the sick only if the members of the society were sufficiently well theyd have problem pulling the fallen out of the mud this depends on the condition of man not on few specialists when it becomes specialty man is dead because the best of man comes into being when he can aid his needy fellows when men are made to feel they have right to assist their fellows the society is sick in creating an organization lrh doesnt want to merely replace one despotic system with another one using the existing comm lines this is what happens in revolution nation is ever overthrown they are just substituted for if scientology did this they could probably create an organization powerful enough to overrun all in its path but then this would just have to be overthrown 19scientology possesses great potential for good or evil depending on how it is relayed poorly relayed used just for gain it could be very destructive lrh has already had three offers by persons in places of power to hand over great deal of information and stop talking helping the insane is usually an effort to reverse whatever selfdeterminism they have left person who is psychotic has at one time decided to die he has not subsequently decided to live they abandon the body unable to let go and unwilling to reassume responsibility the longer you stop being that wants to die from dying the worse off he gets the truly insane should not have therapy but space sunlight minimal restraints quiet food this gives the individual chance to change his mind and decide to live again exhaustion and insanity are almost synonymous person who is sane who wants to live who is willing to take responsibility for doing something about his condition can be in much worse shape than an insane person but he will be auditable and will get better because he wants to live insanity is death wish of great magnitude sanity returns when person decides to live psychosomatic illness is overrated being universally present as unwanted sensation or absence of sensation its not illness it comes about when someone is called upon to prove something and fails some processes for this 1 what have you got that would prove it not about anything specific or 1a what will disability get you into b what will disability get you out of then when flat 2 what can you prove with it the disability here we run into the computation that any sensation is better than sensation and that he should have something to get sympathy and avoid guilt but the thetan is to be able to invent whole new category of ills before hell give up one hes got hence invent something worse than illness death was invented on the whole track as substitute for insanity which was being so irresponsible that punishment was pointless you could get anyone to change his mind about wanting to die if you could get into comm with him i want you to come into possession of all that you know and i want you to use that knowledge with security and any mission i have here on this planet at this time will be successful at that time when what i have just said has been accomplished 5510c03 4lacc1 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part one while book one has place close to the top in scientology the most fundamental fundamental was invented later it appears on page 23 of the ability issue called the hca manual the rudiments 1 awareness of the auditor that an auditing room is present and that session is in progress 2 two way comm on casual basis 3 delivery of the question 4 the comm lag 5 the acknowledgment 6 duplication of the exact question by the auditor in order to make any auditing work these fundamentals must be observed if the session is not precisely conducted the processes can fail to work this even explains why one might not have 20practice if the public couldnt find the auditor there would be practice this also explains one difficulty in auditing ones parents you need awareness of an auditor not child to start the session the pc must first find out hes pc and he must find the auditor in the auditing situation students must learn to assume the beingness of auditors and pcs not students if you exist as auditor there will be pcs this depends upon an ability to be the relationship between auditor and pc is not so much one of altitude as one of arc you must keep the r in when you are auditing an auditor for instance it doesnt inspire confidence to have to stop and look up the process theres process that makes pc into pc what are you doing run until he cognites hes being audited pc goes out of comm with an auditor before he observes that theres something wrong with the session like code break an auditors code break only occurs when the pc thinks the auditor has bad intentions and where the auditor does not repair the out comm with little two way comm the auditor may if the out arc is severe have to use another process on lower gradient until arc is restored gradient scale in auditing need not take long time for each type of processing for instance to get the pc to remedy havingness need not take 5 hours if you stay in two way comm and see what is really happening when the pc throws away mockups so as to really get rid of them this could take only 6 to 8 minutes if youve actually got an auditor and pc you must continually be aware of these rudiments since the pc can stop being pc at any time then two way comm gives out whenever two way comm gives out the session stops as far as the pc is concerned what starts this is too little two way comm and too little acknowledgment in the first place the pc will get stuck on the time track at the point where he has not been acknowledged and the session at that point is in fact over its all now in the past for the pc when he gets restuck later on in session hell blow or threaten to sometimes this can be handled merely by the auditors starting all over with the session thus subtly calling the pcs attention to the fact that hes in session pc may blow 28 minutes after failure to ack the auditor must learn to differentiate between pcs dropped willingness and an increased comm lag where willingness is not there auditing can occur the only thing there in the first place is willingness to play the game nations topple if they forget this fact willingness to work if taxed too heavily can become willingness to succumb whip extracts the last atoms of willingness but this can easily be turned around the only thing that any nation can tax that any group can exist on is the willingness to play the game to do to survive to continue if you decrease pcs willingness to play the game of auditing you can hardly expect to increase his willingness to play the game of life he must always audit better than he can live or hell never live better than he can be audited in session he should observably be getting brighter and more alert pcs always sag bit when session is over so dont be disappointed when life seems harder than the session helpful hints you must duplicate the question time and time again without killing the pcs willingness to answer it this can be done by adding some dunnage but dont vary the question the dunnage consists of casual twoway communication before and after the question twoway comm is light airy it has life in it and can be terribly casual and fantastically therapeutic to remedy havingness is to remedy the need to have regret is running the time track backwards 5510c03 4lacc2 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part 2 here are the reasons why the human mind has not been solved 1 i dont know 212 idea to know about something is necessary to notknow it first this was an incomprehensibility to philosophers of all ages to understand the source of ideas you had to understand idea one has to be able to notknow something in order to know something about it dialectical materialism is dramatization of idea idea is workable concept but as long as the dialectical materialists are only dramatizing it and dont know it it is unworkable dialectical materialism says that all new ideas are the result of two old forces hence idea can be really new so there is possibility of getting new idea if someone dramatizes something as with the dialectical materialists it must have existed earlier as postulate that went solid things begin with consideration and end with solidity eg dramatization or solid reality so an idea is senior to all matter and conditions above that is the thetan in his native state if thetan wishes to return to his native state he often bungles it by assuming that he is in native state when he is actually in very bad shape this leads to the idiocy that everything that is true of thetans native state is what continues to be dramatized clear down to the bottom of the barrel and that every aberration is reflection of native state and the first and second postulate theory axioms 36 and 37 native state is having idea the thetan knows all about all he has ideas because he has all the ideas there are now he says that he will have an idea here we get axiom 36 the first postulate gives the second postulate power so the thetan in native state knows all he then makes first postulate that he has idea from here as per axiom 36 he can make the second postulate that he can have an idea this is an harmonic on native state but it is alterised so it persists and we get time the force of having an idea is the statement that he didnt have an idea before an idea is barrier stop on the track even manic idea or win can be stop so we get 0 native state the thetan knows all but has specific idea 1 first postulate idea i dont know 2 second postulate specific idea this is an harmonic on native state i know something 3 third postulate forget 4 fourth postulate remember for the first time in the history of mankind it has become safe for man to know something it was not safe before because youd stick to it because every mystery could then pull you into it the more you knew about it the more you were enveloped by it this gives the manifestations of thetans blackness dropped havingness illness etc things known on second postulate basis are solid and persist studying anything will produce this phenomenon scientology has been safe subject because it has progressed toward simplicity and has never pretended to contain all knowledge theres limited amount of knowingness and unknowingness available what gets scarce is unknowingness we let unknow go on an automatic basis we dont take responsibility for it so it gets pulled in on an unknowing basis youd never get into trouble in processing if you kept on supplying lots of noidea instead of using old noideas when you keep on using old noideas to get new ideas eventually the new ideas jam into the existing noideas which have become so precious that we interiorize into them here weve ignored the first postulate which provided the power for the second postulate one gets stuck in dramatizing noidea and loses the volitional ability to postulate an idea into existence people who get stuck in know about are in the second postulate if they exteriorize its into the blackness of the third postulate which is the harmonic of the first notising the knowingness thus ive forgotten it the fourth postulate is remember an alterisness of notisness this is getting to be very persistent stuff from this sequence we get most solidities and spaces except for directly postulated solids and spaces perhaps the fifth postulate would be occlude all you need to get space is lookingness which is dramatization of knowing in lookingness space is on an automaticity thats why space continues to exist this automatic space because its automatic tends to fold up on people producing condensed spaces and figurefigure at lower levels the above was discovered by the fact of the relative effectiveness of running something you wouldnt mind forgetting compared with the bogginess of something you wouldnt mind remembering notknowingness evidently is the only solution to prevent interiorization into bodies of knowledge or solid objects per axiom 36 if you take out the first postulate you can knock out 22the second one for instance you realize that over there theres bus running it doesnt affect you does it until you knew there was bus over there and then you probably got picture of it or something get the trick probably countertrick would be saying i dont know whats standing right here inventing something to stand here then remembering you said you didnt know what was there so theres automatic i dont know before the knowingness running an i dont know process for two hours gives more gain than 50 hours of i know the unworkability of remember processes shows that psychoanalysis never gave stable gains it gives solid ridges if you keep remembering you can asis it by having him recall all the times he remembered or better still use forgetting to dissolve the ridge take any troublesome engram ask the pc what he doesnt know about it and it will blow in minutes it upsets the pc to have him make perfect duplicate but this way only causes fogginess if you dont acknowledge well and stay in two way comm this also solves the case with the stuck picture its also safe to use what dont you know about it on chronic somatics notknowingness is not the goal of humanity or scientology its just the barrier that has to be crossed 5510c08 lpls1 the goals of dianetics and scientology hubbard concluded that the problem of the mind was soluble in 1938 at this time the ussr offered him 100000 and lab outside of moscow for his manuscripts later the russians stole the manuscript for dmsmh structure can only modify the mind but the mind monitors structure sometimes one decides to die then changes his mind without unmaking the first decision this can produce chronic somatics if the persons decision to die gets restimulated he wont be conscious of the first decision at this point he thinks he wants to live but has to do some irrational thing like be professional invalid succumb postulate the basic datum is the q and of survivedestroy neither fully decided when one gets audited and decides to survive his iq can go up and he can become happy and able its mathematically impossible that accidents could account for evolution darwinian theory suggests that there is reincarnation although it doesnt state this 5702c28 17acc4 the parts of man one can get so wound up in the significance of the study of man that one gets an idea that the subject has breadth exceeding human understanding which it did for 50000 years because people couldnt tolerate that much simplicity the thetan cant be perceived or measured because its the source of perception and measuring but an individual can exteriorize and experience being thetan not being able to perceive other thetans its easy to feel like the only one now for the first time by various manifestations and by reason of what we know we can observe this in others there are many ways of experiencing the idea of someone else exteriorizing in the first place voice tones change another thing hes liable to do is to pull his head back into his neck hes liable to do various things all of which manifest exteriorization hes liable to say lot of things none of which manifest exteriorization but sort of mystic butteredallovertheuniverse the thetan who is over there aint exteriorization is not stable fact it is the phenomenon of being in position or space dependent only on ones consideration able to view from that space the body and the room as it is one can view or control the body from distance if one has trouble controlling the body from close up he wont get out of his head because he for sure cant control it at distance therefore its only necessary for you to assume the abilities of controlling something from distance to be able to exteriorize willingly since all willingness to exteriorize is merely suppressed by this factor of control one of the early methods of exteriorizing someone was getting him to change his considerations by 23running him on i can control this body i cannot control this body people who have never been out of their heads will go out on that one the task in scientology today however is not getting people out of their heads you could exteriorize yourself simply by grabbing your head with your two hands and keeping your head from going away or you could grab your head and your knees and keep each alternatively from going away shifting attention so you wont get too fixated how good your perception would be is another question its matter of your willingness too if you cant see your body there is scarcity of bodies if you cant see the universe there is scarcity of universes any phenomenon which occurs beyond the point of willingness to be out of the head or control the body from distance is regulated by the scarcity and abundance of bodies and universes the earliest trick still works try not to be three feet back of your head about 50 will go out on be three feet back of your head because they have been otherdetermined lot vision depends on scarcity and abundance experience depends on willingness to experience which is monitored by the amount of things available to experience culture is composite of things of which there is neither too much nor too little eg we have lot but not too many automobiles because they can be real mow this country is approaching an indialike idea of human beings the idea that there are too many of them in frontier society there are too few as you get too many people they tend to become invisible on frontier until there are almost enough people they dramatize getting rid of people in between you can have progressive society and the us was such society with 25 to 100 million people now there are too many people to observe them all even important people get overlooked person could just go out of his head without outside help if he has space and universe to get out into he must not have scarcity of spaces as result of being out of comm with them his idea of scarcity of spaces depends on his willingness to view them the auditor must get him to recognize the isness of the room around him his idea that rooms are scarce or too numerous gives him the idea that he cant see this room likewise if he has too few bodies he will be unwilling to get out of the one hes in it is the same with an overabundance of bodies so remedying his havingness on the body he is in is necessary for stable exteriorization scarcity of experience brings about retention of the mental image pictures so the mind gets overcrowded or goes black the pictures can even penetrate the blackness producing the wideopen case where the mind is in control of the thetan this is condition of overwhelm not health when the thetan obeys the records of the mind we have behavior patterns etc the mind is the record but the thetan is the needle scarcity of experience causes manufacture of pictures people that play their minds closer in havent been living an exciting enough life the workings of this mechanism depend on association and differentiation or identification and differentiation when the reactive mind can exert its influence on person better than the thetan himself he has become too associative to conceive differences he can disassociate on an inverted level where he differentiates incorrectly he gets misidentification and disassociation when insane when the mind is working optimally it never identifies but only conceives similarity lack of objects incidents and experience causes the mind to identify rather than associating it is not stress or overwork that causes this that is why problems of comparable magnitude or mock up something to confront will work relieve somatics etc things that happen to you are automatic in that you all too of ten have say in their occurrence when you run problems of comparable magnitude you not only measure up incident and add incident to the bank but you also take over the automaticity of shocking incidents that occurred to you when you have gone all the way up the line the idea of too few becomes the idea of i didnt do it then this runs out and it all becomes pandeterminism of incidents where you become convinced you can create incidents and lose scarcity of incidents in tv screen world youre apt to be in trouble the tv pictures are patterns of light and shadows restimulative mechanism to shove your bank around and give you again some segment of that which youve already experienced it can only give you experience youve already if distantly had people will refuse to read about certain periods in history because of experience in those periods thetan will refuse to look at certain parts of his past and the bank but they can be gotten at if necessary only people who have had heavy problems in past life refuse to look at it but if they had scarcity of horrible incidents they could confront them better 24the restimulated incident is held in place for two reasons it was automatic ie the pc left large sections of it done by somebody else plus there wasnt enough of it those incidents that are most scarce tend to stick hardest anything that stands by itself doesnt get terminal against which to discharge and fly apart any old incident could react physiologically against the pc if the auditor wanted to restimulate it fully not letting the pc ever be cause on it evaluating it invalidating etc you should know how to do this as long as doing something bad to pcs doesnt become habit with you cf gestalt encounter and primal scream therapies that cause an effect so the mind is mechanism for overcoming the lack of incident and experience in present time by storing pictures of the past if you restore the pcs ability to make the pictures solid youve really done something he has some optimum randomity that would be the right amount of pictures so you have to change his idea of how much motion he needs before you can change the pc this is done with scarcity and abundance ie havingness the body is solid appendage that makes person recognizable the mind modifies the body which is mockup to change body you have to change mental structure and also the thetans willingness to have it in its present condition the body surrenders first to its own electronic structure ie the anchor points it is solid only within these spaces and will aberrate its shape in their absence so the easiest way to modify the body is to put the thetan into willingness to handle anchor points then remedy scarcity and abundance of anchor points and put the actual anchor points in optimal position mental image pictures also influence the body by influencing the anchor points facsimile imposes itself by magnetic fields and currents upon the anchor point system causing the body to change shape and size the anchor points are golden balls if person is in good shape hell have his wing anchor points out about 75 feet you can hold one pull it out of line and the person will walk in circle to fix broken arm you have to remedy the havingness of the messed up anchor points you could band an arm in the wrong place by moving its anchor points to influence the mind by influencing the body is only possible by influencing the havingness of thetan you can only influence thetan in this way to the degree that it influences abundances and scarcities of bodies if you keep on taking things away from people theyll eventually die of loss of havingness the being lives in universe which is another monitoring influence on the mind and body not necessarily on the being when an incident happens to persons body he makes picture of it and uses it when similar situation occurs he also uses it when he has scarcity of incidents the thetans ability doesnt change only his willingness to live increases or decreases in direct ratio to the scarcity or abundance of things in which they are interested these scarcities and abundances influence them and their culture the cure for it is to put the individual in communication with the isness of situation or object and let him reacquaint himself with that he is then able to conceive himself able to experience new experiences viewing something directly etc and so his life can be righted we can adjust persons havingness his ability to conceive of an isness and communicate with it by adjusting the number or scarcity of things 5707c15 18acc1 what is scientology scientology is aimed at total know since other know is total it is hard to describe scientology since there is other datum of comparable magnitude only one other organization of knowledge on earth has had similar goal buddhism it squirreled when it went into tibet as lamaism but there was faith in buddhism it was analytical the best refuge to take when asked what scientology is would be refuge into incomprehensibility by saying that it is epistemology buddhism and scientology both try to select out the importances of life and fill mans void of knowledge with accurate observation buddha could be called the first scientist authority has nothing to do with knowledge those things i tell you are true are not true because i tell you they are true and if anything i tell you or have ever told you is discovered to differ from the individual observation be it good observation then it isnt true we have certain positive procedures as valuable as they are if they incline us to lock at them not at what they help us to look at if they lead us to believe that they are thing not means to doing another thing we will be in the same blind condition as presentday religions and social sciences and 25we will have to rediscover our blindness on the way up wherever we develop an area of special knowledge such as trs and processes we must understand that they are means to an end not an end in themselves someone who forgot what trs were could in theory do them all beautifully but be unable to use them in session because he had forgotten what they were for to create the proper communication atmosphere for the session there is an enormous wonderland below blindness this keeps people from seeing their blindness using alice in wonderland in trs is joke based on this imagined knowledge the wonderland is the dispersal that results from the individuals reaction to being kicked in the teeth when he looks at something he wont look again eventually he decides not to look at anything but if he catches sight of something he will go on via and look at something else instead this is how the wonderland of the social sciences was created someone couldnt confront man so he turned around and created myth about man he must have been blind never to have noticed exteriorization or to have recorded the existence of the phenomenon somewhere thetan has the ability to create form to create universes when the ability dims out when he is not doing it very intelligently he begins to see things in the universe that he doesnt want to look at then he disperses and combines his ability to create and to notis the universe he then builds is below the level of the universe he is in you have to bring him up north for him to discover that he is in trap 5707c17 18acc3 theory and definitions of auditing the pc is less than or equal to the bank and the auditor is less than or equal to the bank but the pc auditor is greater than the bank person cannot audit himself because the basic ingredient of all auditing is communication and person cannot really talk to himself especially in pt because talking to oneself puts half the cycle out of pt someone could mock up circuit that talks back or assume valence that feeds the past back to him where he thinks something is feeding him an effect from the past or talking to him when person selfaudits he uses these circuits to feed stuff back to him it gets him nowhere the best he could do would be to handle mental image picture which was seeking to handle him or to handle the environment the only things in the bank that give the pc trouble are the moments he didnt handle the worst moments when he gets pictures of these moments he tends to go out of control and backs off or boils off an auditor would acknowledge get him to confront it only communication got him into his mess only communication can get him out therefore there has to be another terminal for him to communicate to in 1952 we got scientology different approach to the problem of the bank instead of erasing the bank we put the person himself in good enough condition so that he can handle anything thats real clear not someone with blank bank the things that are right with person are the things that are wrong with the person what is wrong with being is what the being can do and what the being is any scale in scientology could be drawn as vactually as flare exponential perhaps distance tolerance is the key to the affinity scales distance narrows as person gets into worse condition he has to be closer and closer to things to know they are real high on the scale tremendous distances can be tolerated here there is also lots of trust at the bottom distance is tolerable persons ability to handle things depends on his ability to handle distance he interiorizes into those things that he cant trust until he is the thing he distrusts person can control at distance with comm as control diminishes he loses reach cant project intention cant trust etc tone goes down with competence going down auditing is an expansion of distance pc starts with inverted distance trying to escape or with close distance solid comm line as in cch1 however running away from things tends to make them stay with them body of soldiers running away from the enemy goes to pieces they dont reform regroup cant sustain discipline when you run away part of you stays there also when running away or being unable to tolerate proximity being has concept of distance theres place to hide anyhow the part that stay there is the mip if one cant occupy some part of the universe the only recourse is dispersal which closes actual distance the thetan never gives up running what part of that incident could you confront loosens it up unsticks the person from it people never have trouble with situations they have confronted only with those from which they ran away this is an example of that which you resist you become the subzero tone scale shows the distance going inverted as one tries to run 26one thing establishes distance communication but it has to be real communication not inval and eval it has to be to the person space is viewpoint of dimension ie lookingness ie communication communication can have closure factor if it is just looking but two thetans in real two way communication can hold their distance and go upscale if you find that when two people talk the longer they talk the closer they get smashed together then one of them isnt communicating when people dont know what something is they have trouble communicating with it when someone tries to communicate with the bank it kicks back and thus gives the thetan the idea that he is punished for communicating but his facsimiles arent real in dianetics we thought person somehow took and stored all these pictures but there is not really mechanism like the file clerk of taking and storing these pictures the object is still there grown thin thats picture every consecutive moment of the universe from its beginning until now is potentially as solid as it was then the only reason it isnt as solid is that you dont to confront it so you thinned it down the only serious reactive pictures are the thinnies one made before or as one way from something unconfrontable this sounds complex but its only problem in change of space you dont carry the pictures you left viewpoint there when you didnt totally confront something and it is still looking all you need to do is to get someone to be willing to confront old universes he wouldnt confront before and you will have clear summary auditing is to raise the ability of another person so that he can handle the bank the body others etc it is communication process 5901c22 21acc1 how process works the auditor has to find out what the pc did with the auditing command and what he did when he executed the command in the absence of communication nothing ever happens which is why people who are out the bottom dont communicate hoping to be safe this doesnt work if you are trying to do other things you must get the process communicated across to the pc and you must get the pc to communicate the first thing to know about pictures is that anything the pc is looking at is picture bank doesnt do anything except be there and whatever strange thing is happening in the bank is picture of whatever strange thing is happening in the bank thats all you have to know to unocclude an occluded case black fives look sane sometimes because they havent got anything to dramatize except looking at blackness not that they wouldnt dramatize if they were looking at something else when pc is stuck in too heavy picture it is impossible to turn on other pictures on the track the basic process for occlusion is come up to present time if that doesnt work there are seven other processes 1 there are several things person can do with pictures he may use notisness to make them disappear as soon as they show up other obsessive doingnesses can be used to get rid of ones pictures solution to pictures this case can be approached using ow selected people because if hes notising pictures hes notising people too in so doing he finds himself surrounded by ghosts first run what have you done to withheld from _______ using the person youve selected 2 then run general ow to catch some more of the automaticity of this outflow 3 arc break straightwire is used to knock out the cause of notisness all locks on the rock are arc breaks 4 next we would use notis straightwire recall time you thought something was unimportant recall time someone else thought something was important if you run it reversewise it takes away the pcs havingness and spins him in this works on notising others importances ie it asises times he did this 5 factual havingness also called third rail the vanish command of this this also handles not isness 276 what can you confront this because at this stage the person doesnt wipe something out before he looks at it 7 you make mockup for which you can be totally responsible this is top of the line process any of these processes turn on pictures these processes plus cchs handle all occluded cases 5911c26 1macc27 the constancy and fundamentals of dianetics and scientology what could you confront is one of the first principles of dianetics as expounded in 1938 foreshadowing of the 1952 principle of dichotomies is in the 1950 treatment of survivesuccumb as far as the thetan is concerned surviving is bound up with confronting in that if something is surviving he can confront it if it doesnt survive he cant confront it and sometimes something survives too damn well and he sits there confronting it for thousands of years saying i am black case youre right in the middle of the cycle of action the dynamic principle of existence of scientology is create this is the common denominator of all thetans even if they dont know it create counter creation destruction survive is continuous confronting your license to survive is license to confront you have the right to look at the environment in which you are and if you dont survive you dont have the right and if someone destroys your possessions so you cant confront them so theyre not surviving so you feel youre not surviving the word survive cant be translated smoothly into several languages suicidal races like the russians and the japanese have such languages they do confront however confronting is the action survive is the state of mind so confront gives an action process you can run confront on small children as what would you like to look at its better to run the action kids are always trying to make people confront things showing you things you can run the process nonverbally just point questioningly this lets you out of the symbol band nicely the communication process kicks in axiom 10 it vividly takes in cause and effect its best to run an assist with from where could you communicate to _______ if mass is present in the room that helps his havingness if hes too injured you could have him look at confront the injured part using touch assist you could also run what body part could you confront would you dislike confronting you could also use from where could you confront _______ confront not confront reach withdraw make comm lines break comm lines the confront process produces different engram chain than the communication process communication intends to produce an effect confront lets anything happen to finish off persons victim button use what victim could you confront would you rather not confront use rather not instead of dislike because for instance the phrase dislike confronting could implant the person with dislike of confronting you could also use what part of victim could you confront for furthersouth case these victim processes tend to put person continually in winning valence it may throw him out of his normal valence if he is stuck aberratedly in losing valence but then it eases him back into his own valence what could you confront runs the pc into valence probably the lowest level thinkingness process there is recall communication or recall communicating on psychotic it is best to mimic his orderly actions only not his disorderly ones anyone who can successfully do thinkingness process is not psychotic if person can at least be responsible for himself and his own environment he is not crazy these people are out of the realm of psychiatry normal people are not sane on all dynamics and cannot be trusted with all of them the idea of total responsibility as expounded in advanced procedures and axioms was not and is not popular one although it formed the basis of many axioms the idea of being irresponsible as in book 1 where people were all victims was what was popular person who is not responsible on dynamic has choice but to be victim on that dynamic absolute irresponsibility and 28absolute insanity could be defined as inability to take responsibility on any dynamic such person would be victim on all dynamics survive succumb willing to look at not willing to look at it you had someone who was willing to look at anything on all the dynamics who could escape from looking at them if he didnt want to youd have sane man it would have nothing to do with whether he was intelligent about it hes helping to put the dynamics there so he has some control over them since he is willing to look he would be intelligent about them as well intelligence is nonrestimulated stupidity one can restimulate notknowingness by educating kids to only look at things and never to take their attention off them thus you get mystery restimulated its an unbalanced thing it makes them wonder and go into mystery for instance keep your shirt clean repeated at him is the same as confront your shirt so as to prevent something this locks him into confronting his shirt fixed and unfixed attention as mentioned in elizabeth new jersey can be run with what would you like to confront rather not confront this is not as good as what could you confront etc so the fundamentals of dianetics and scientology do not change the only thing that changes is relative importances people believe they are obsessively separate so they believe that if they ran this out they would be obsessively the same person and wed get obsessive togetherness as in communism but actually obsessive togetherness comes about from terror of the separateness that comes about from committing overts and becoming more and more individuated person becomes more and more individuated until he finds himself doing flip and getting drawn into mass which for him doesnt exist so you get back and forth movements between these two points thus obsessive individuation and obsessive togetherness are much the same thing the world is in these conditions so much that its become almost impossible to prove that everyone is separate individual this is scientologys unsolved question is everyone separate or all one we suspect that people are separate but theres proof experimental attempts to prove this are obscured by the obsessive states people are in 6012c31 ahmc1 the genus of dianetics and scientology the genus of scientology and dianetics was in the 20s when lrh was kid in the orient seeing all kinds of oddities while george washington university he conducted tests and found that poetry gives the same wavelengths in all languages he went to the psychology department with this discovery got rebuffed and found that none of them understood the mind he calculated that there cannot be enough bits of information carried on the protein molecules in the brain to store all the memories that men have in austria this got published as this is how man remembers lrh was well known at the explorers club for his ethnological studies in 1938 he got to survival as the common denominator to all races and possibly all life at this point in his studies he met commissar golinski from amtorg diplomatic trade channel with russia he offered lrh job in pavlovs lab 200000 plus expenses for research etc lrh refused about two years later they broke into my quarters or some unknown people did and stole the original manuscripts i have flimsy copy of the research but its not complete in 1946 and 1947 lrh did the research that culminated in dmsmh at this time highranking naval officer offered him job with the office of naval research he was to find ways to use his knowledge of the mind to make people more suggestible when he was refused he was threatened with being pulled back into military service he figured out way to resign from the service this was the end of beautiful friendship with the american government they didnt make up their minds that we were men until lrh said any government is interested in how the mind works but against anyone that knows more about it than they do this has left us the only free organization on the earth 6012c31 ahmc2 the things of scientology scientology has succeeded in bringing the predictability of the natural sciences into the humanities practically every natural scientist before lrh has attempted this but none has succeeded before now 29there are 20 separate items in scientology and dianetics that are as solid as one of these test tubes this has nothing to do with ivory tower figure figure scientology is practical subject that has nothing to do with anyones beliefs policing of behavior is the rule today it is based on what one knows about people become slaves to their ignorance of right and wrong in such time one needs practical wisdom whole countries have gone by the boards because their wisdom wasnt practical for instance india and china their wisdom always went with poverty and degradation peoples woes difficulties and failures stem from their ignorance their darkness about the mind they had knowledge of the rules the world needs practical science the parts of which are clearly visible having this one can see into mens hearts know them and live one of the twenty things is the brain it is shock absorber which prevents electronic currents from injuring the beingness of the person it has less to do with controlling motor actions than commonly believed people with brain damage have had function restored with dianetics another of the things is the human nervous system the nervous system also serves for warning control and arrest of pain or absorption of pain another couple of things are the human body and the physical universe also lock secondary and engram real things another thing is the overtmotivator sequence it is very loworder sequence this falls out when person ceases to be reactive because it is based on and is q and with newtons law of interaction second law of motion it is more serious than if you do something to joe he will do something to you it is used by people who are into big q and with mest it justifies stockpiling abombs etc theres more to the overtmotivator sequence than newtons law if joe hits bill he will believe he should be or has been hit by bill and gets somatic to prove it so if someone does an overt he will get or believe he has already gotten the motivator the scales and cycles of dianetics and scientology are things not figurefigure theres the cycle of action create survive and destroy in its most crude form it is an apparency but demonstrable the human mind is the bag of tricks the thetan invented to keep himself from getting bored to death in this universe and has then considered too complex to understand and has gotten himself into serious trouble with 6102c14 3saacc14 fundamentals of auditing joburg the fundamentals of auditing are designed to handle fixations and changes of attention attention is fixated or in constant state of flux to the degree that person is creating and countercreating thats what thetans attention gets fixed on the creates or the countercreates all other things ruds havingness processes etc fall into line on that understanding the case is fixed on or fluctuating amongst the masses and energies it has created the things that put them out of existence or make them unreal are of course created by the case the person is at war with himself thats why an attack process works its countercreate most cases especially downscale are more dedicated to countercreation than creation the case is in state of unreality about the fact that hes doing it mocking up things on which he is then fixing his attention sometimes person may know hes doing it or not doing it but often thetans dont know that they are creating what they are fighting so you could have level of processing of doingness on creating eg what wouldnt you mind creating would you rather not create were dealing strongly with havingness these days with success the axiom of aberration is all doingness harms self doingness processes address this fact you could ask what liability would there be to doing something or what could you do which wouldnt be harmful to you this could fall flat because the person is doing so many more complicated things that he has to come up to these basics this process is too high for most cases beingness processes are relatively easy to run you could run an engram with what in that incident would you be willing to be the pc must have the ability to be something before this would be workable process some people cant be anything so you have to test for this with look around here and find something you could be you could develop the whole rationale of processing at the level of beingness or doingness or havingness though they must eventually merge all three are needed 30if pc doesnt move just with elementary rudiments ta change of case its probable that the pc is withholding some big recent overt or the pc may have some unusual or secret goal not imparted to the auditor or the trouble may be big ptp so in going over case on the basis of rudiments one takes it easy until one finds out that the havingness scale as you have been taught to use it doesnt move the ta why ask for trouble before youve got it you go over the ruds pretty well wild drops go on in search of the prehav level find where the pc lives get one of his principal goals aligned convert it into terminal which drops as well as the goal dropped assess the prehav scale with that terminal then run anything that fits that level the commands are what was _______ for positive and what _______ failed for negative for terminal its eg what terminal was _______ and what terminal failed to _______ or what terminal was not these are the allbracket commands they could be repeated for each level you could run 15 brackets against the prehav scale when has terminalactionterminal there are possibilities of 32way brackets but fiveway is enough more details on prehav running if pc isnt interested in the process the ruds are out as its an interesting process so beat the ruds to death if you cant solve it with ruds run cchs the pc needs this when he cant control attention and your command isnt reaching him noeffect case on whom command has anything to do with him etc totally on automatic etc so use cchs to give them an example that control and duplication can exist and to increase their alertness havingness and effectiveness ten to twenty five hours of cchs must be done with good auditor control and presence if the auditor cant impinge on the pc however and has auditor presence even cchs wont work since they depend on impingement lrh impinges more than most auditors because of his certainty that something will happen and his not being scared to confront the pc to lrh its personal affront if the pc isnt moving he can even get bad research results because even when using process that shouldnt work his postulate that the case should change and his wanting to do something for the pc will cause the process to work so he depends on hgc results etc to test processes just asking the pc questions can do tremendous amount for the pc dont underestimate what auditor presence confidence and interest can do cchs depend on auditor presence more than any other process maybe 6 percent wont get gains because of needing cchs the rest have ruds out if they dont win on goals and prehav more data on goals and prehav running the havingness processes are arranged in order of their frequency of effectiveness command that works on cases that have relatively uncontrolled banks and cant run engrams is where is _______ frequently person with low havingness is in universe of objects that are mad at him etc as you run what is the emotion of that object the object goes downscale and the pc cuts in across the bottom and goes upscale when hes upscale about the object the process is flat this havingness process can change when emotion disappears out of the physical universe to what is the condition of that object if the havingness process stops loosening the needle first check to see if there is an arcb about the command and then if not find new havingness process other processes are tr10 notice that indicated object what arent you putting into it good outside process is what is the condition of that person when you get rise on can squeeze the pc may have heavy withholds maybe inverted interest and wont liecheck perhaps the havingness test would be how much less does the needle rise in this case if the case arcbs all the time you can run who would i have to be to audit you the prehav scale running runs subjective havingness the hav processes run objective havingness the objective havingness determines his havingness of the physical universe the prehav scale determines his havingness of the subjective universe you only run enough objective havingness to keep the pc in pt and loosen his needle end of preshsbc tapes the saint hill special briefing course tapes 316105c07 shspec1 emeter talk and demo sop goals running assess for all the goals the pc ever had when all are out and longer give fall on the meter the list is complete when the list is complete the meter longer registers reassess the list until only one goal continues to read now list all the terminals for the goal all the terminals which would represent that goal until the meter goes flat null the list until only one terminal reads falls on the meter sop goals is the entirety of data needed to clear all cases this is unlike the situation earlier when lrh would develop regimen to handle one pcs case then develop the theory which matched it sometimes this was picked up by others and whole school of therapy was based on it for instance the dianetic tech used to handle one individual altman later became gestalt therapy the emeter is tension machine the more tense the individual the more offbeat is the read clearing is taking the tension off the meter at the lowest level of tension theres point in doing anything about anything youve got dead thetan totally incapable of influencing the machine he reads as clear but this kind of case can still be detected because the needle is tense it doesnt react favorably at all the person cannot answer to his satisfaction or yours any questions about help the needle also shows reaction to anything even kick the sensitivity has to be way up to get third of dial drop on can squeeze the guy can be machinemotivated feels he had bad luck doesnt believe anything can be done so he can get help etc hes very obvious cant do case doingness is the common denominator of the prehav scale someone who cant do isnt even on the scale the best case detector is the sensitivity knob not the ta or needle the worst case is where person is super tense but doesnt know it this guy would be long job to sec check rock slam is stronger indication than fall it shows that you are on the chain of the first time the person ever decided to be another valence the theta bop is diagnostic it has to do with leaving and death the thetan moving in and out like yoyo it can be dial wide or small it can be repetitive or even at an extreme one cycle this is not very useful returning will also give you theta bop the rise means the pc isnt confronting we used to be concerned about what stopped the rise which was what was producing it or rather the pcs nonconfront of that thing caused it stage four needle is an indicator of total noeffect case it can be very tiny it always has stick at the top of the rise unlike the theta bop the bottom of it is very relaxed it just means lousy case shape sometimes you see the needle vibrate this means that the pc has an alternating current ridge 45 means crowd if hes stuck there hes afraid of people or stuck with people stuck at 25 means robot machine theres seven on the ta dial that cant be read on the meter as person develops responsibility say hes dead thetan at 20 hell go down to 15 then go out the bottom through 7 to 65 5 4 etc to in range pc can have consistent pattern he can even repeat the same fall in this case change of characteristic is diagnostic when the pc has charged question in his level of reality you get change of pattern the meter that would be used above clear would be an oscilloscope meter an ometer or theta meter which registers flows this is not comfortable to audit with the meter has to be very sensitive someone could be clear and still have bugs because hes still using body the emeter measures the games condition called the physical universe you need something which shades the tiniest things from 200 up we have theoretically transcended mest weapons as someone goes theta clear his tolerance of motion is so great that he wouldnt be hurt by bullet he probably couldnt even be hit by it 6105c12 shspec2 assessment you in trying to equate relatively simple fundamental in scientology are of course picking up fundamental which sits right in the middle of anyones case and you tend to blow off little confusion in trying to get hold of it it would be easy to teach you to run diesel engine but the data were teaching goes straight into the middle of reactive computation sop goals does this exact 32thing exactly reversing how the mind got aberrated the most hidden factors of mind were the things that aberrated mind because ones ever freed mind before so they must have been the most concealed or they would have asised sop goals undoes all the things that plowed someone in it consists of all the solutions person adopted to fix all the oddball circumstances he got into ever that longer apply who wouldnt want to have the kind of mind that could be happy doing something simple basically what youre afraid of is getting bored this happens because what you are doing is somehow inadequate to the demands of the environment if ones simple game gets invalidated one looks for more complicated one this could only happen if one had invalidated someone else already to get kicked in the butt you must have kicked someone in the butt and postulated that its bad to get kicked in the butt if the way to do perfect assessment were put on paper theres high probability that it wouldnt be followed because were dealing with the basic stuff of which the reactive mind is composed and on this subject more than any other youll find more confusion more silly questions the datum restimulates the whole confounded bank what happens is that the guy does something which eventually recoils on him in way which gives him new problem he gets his motivator and gets new beingness to have new game but hes now not being himself hes being solution to the problem of livingness the solution eventually ends him up with new problem which he solves with some new beingness some new game every time he gets overwhelmed in some game he shifts beingness to the new game which solves the old one if you clear someone without clearing up his bedohave condition hell realize he has game and hell recreate his old condition or be bored or worried hell go unclear he thinks its less dangerous to be aberrated than to have game if you clear erase his games conditions across the boards hell do this the essence of all games is beingness and doingness towards havingness the problem is that they get jammed into cant have must have situation in games condition the person has to be something but he cant be it there is something wrong with being what he is being so he cant be it and he dare not be it and yet he must be it and this emerges when you are auditing sop goals game or goal is abandoned because it was invalidated too many times guy goes into new game and valence and ends up not being himself in assessment you are backtracking these valences expressed as goals since by this time the pcs comm with the world is very poor you have to handle whats real to the pc so thats what you handle whats odd is that theres only one valence thats real to the pc at one time in life as the valence goes up the pc comes down this ends up with serene valence and the pc out the bottom so the individual goes around acting psychotic in serene valence this is the theetie weetie case as you audit the person the valence comes down and the pc starts taking over handling the game and the environment on his own determinism as the pc gets out of fixed games he can look around and find hes got more games if hes got more games hell go more clear if less hell go unclear the act of finishing off clearing doing more and more sop goals is what stabilizes the clear having to play the game is what prevents one from playing the game one can play the game as long as one doesnt have to details on running of sop goals any goal which is to put up mockup is liable to be false one and is dangerous one to audit it is perishable because the result of failure is to create mockup so that you get into an arts goal always be suspicious of an arts goal because theres always the thing you can do when all else fails and thats usually the arts when actual masses dont work to overwhelm the opposition they turn to aesthetic masses which are closer to the thought band if you go just little further with assessment the case will likely get into better goals channel you can ask what did you want to do before you went into the arts this also applies to professions in the thought band like philosophy and law featherweight goal denotes hell of failure just ahead of it 6105c19 shspec3 emeter when the emeter is reading sporadically on something chances are what you are talking about is quite close to what its reading on when you ask just the right question it reads hard and consistently you must then get an answer to every auditing question or the read will persist forever if you dont audit the hidden standard the pc will seem to progress in the session and then say he didnt make any of his goals for the session hell be putting via on every command answer to slant it through the hidden standard you can ask the pc if theres some goal there he hasnt told you its 33necessary to getting case progress to get it out of the way the emeter wont be reading well either as its not the question if you dont ask for the hidden standard pc will not improve if he has withholds or undisclosed overts on his auditor or scientology in fact hell pull in motivators and get case gain you cant accept help from quarters you have overts on because it seems like betrayal since youve betrayed and the overt motivator sequence is in force person who has specialized in teaching by implant dawn the track will develop an identity which gives themselves implants they amount to perhaps 5 of the human race 6105c26 shspec4 on auditing before you can change people you have to increase their tolerance for change change is pain because its fundamental is shift of location in space on mechanical level change is time time is temperature the hotter the faster this is discovery in physics it goes along with the discovery that the speed of light is not constant but depends on the velocity of emission and that zero is variable not an absolute zero time is change on mechanical level rate of change is measured by rate of change not by time but one pretends that it is measured by time if you find the right temperature you can speed time up or make something timeless for instance after the atomic bomb exploded nothing moved for twenty minutes not even the twenty minutes temperature alteration caused this there is zero there is nothing but nothing of what this is variable society at present doesnt know that it doesnt know this is dangerous scientology points this out to society which is painful to society the best approach to study is always to find out what you dont know and then to remedy the situation one should not start out study by finding out something new the gradient approach is 1 not knowing that one doesnt know 2 knowing one doesnt know but not knowing what one doesnt know 3 finding out what one doesnt know 4 remedying the situation the only thing wrong with ones case is the vast area of ones beingness that one doesnt know one doesnt know about things you do reactively produce the opposite result from what you intend gradient of states of case 1 release release is person who knows he wont get any worse he has low state of case but he is better than nonrelease since he knows he isnt there yet on meter he would give whole dial drop on lowsensitivity can squeeze and the ta would be fairly near clear read he would also have reality on scientology as way to improve the communication help and control buttons are in good shape he can asis certain things by inspection 2 stable release this is tested release he has adverse needle reactions on help communication or control life can still mess him up but he will come through better 3 mest clear this individual has an fn at sensitivity one and doesnt react to routine questions he reads at the clear read for his sex 4 stable clear this is mest clear who has run lots more sop goals where they start blowing by inspection for this individual engrams have persistence he can erase engrams or mock them up at will his healing rate is fantastic thinkingness can have an effect on the bank before clear but clear has more effect on the bank in all case states up to clear thinkingness has varied effect on the bank the lower the case state the less effect ones thought has on the bank psycho is total effect of the bank and can produce effect on the bank then we go up to more and more effect of person on the bank up to bank memory trouble is withholdingness withholding from people results in withholding from self the pc lessens the overt and pushes it out of sight if you increase his responsibility he becomes aware 34of more overts the overts unlessen and one starts to feel bad for instance when you discover that you have been committing overts against the org that has been so nice to you this is what happens when you process person towards greater responsibility without pulling withholds the person will cave in again therefore you must pull these overts and withholds and get the charge off them as they become available this is the rationale behind interspersing sec checks with other auditing otherwise the pc becomes unwilling to make case gain and is likely to blow 6106c01 shspec5 flattening process and emeter on running prehav level be sure that you run the process long enough to get it to bite when the pc needs high sensitivity for third of dial drop you may not get much ta in the first three hours this can happen on sticky level at any time it is not flat or it wouldnt read in the first place so run the ta in then out if it is getting little ta and never did get much you are getting some ta and you want to continue to increase it the goal becomes less intense when you find the terminal this is because the goal is the significance that surrounds the terminal and the pcs attention has been yanked off the goal over to the terminal where it was fixed anyway so the goal after you have found the terminal will read less than the terminal theres nothing in the goal for his attention to be fixed on since the goal is just something he achieved reactively to solve problem given him by terminal that overwhelmed him the goal is the tag hanging out from the bank and can be used to get in there and handle the bank this phenomenon of tags was first noticed in 1949 with engrams for instance with boy who is always worried about red caps it turns out that red caps were in an engram about which he knows nothing goals work the same way the goal that wont null is the toughest one the one attached to the terminal that most overwhelmed the pc that he can still confront 6106c02 shspec6 flows prehav scale primary scale person that has flowed in one direction too long eg writer who has written too much shipping clerk who keeps shipping etc one day he will want to stop it is an electrical phenomenon people who are affected by gravity are affected to degree by newtons laws of motion action and reaction when thetan pushes particle out theres recoil effect the law really only applies to masses of comparable magnitude the stuck flow occurs when one neglects the return flows one is in fact receiving one fails to asis it and creates ridge from the resistance if theres been too much inflow ridge may be formed from notised outpushes newtons second law is thus the reason for solidification of flows the facsimiles of back pushes are neglected therefore they stick the stuck flow is reacted to with unconsciousness which is dopeoff if you have someone run flow in one direction in mockup he can either get field in front of his face going black or an avalanche will be triggered where all the things come at him at once or reverse flow avalanche an avalanche of resistance an inversion flow too long in one direction produces reverse flow not just stuck flow this reverse flow is 1 not asised because not noticed 2 resisted then you get flow in the original direction but on an inversion on running ow we can only do this when the pc is below the ability to tolerate change ow is reach and withdraw but only from one terminal and it doesnt account for all the possible motions as long as the individual is below change ow only runs well on f2 see ow limited theory hcob 5jan61 ow is 100 effective below change but not effective above it cf the later order of the grades below the level of tolerating change the individuals inflow and outflow get locked up and change produces ridges on various flow lines therefore the person is individuated cant change his viewpoint resisting change he gets left on some individuated point of the bracket eg he has stuck outflow so he cant relate to people if he was so bad off as to be psycho hed maybe get upset with flow three and maybe get up to obsessive cause if one is fluid on change and doesnt resist it he wont resist the flows and therefore he wont create the ridge when he sets up newtons second law of motion he knows therell be consequence of every thing he does so he knows better than to cause or experience much the consequences of change is change when he cant stand change hell go into ow thats why running brackets is safety factor when ridge is set up it has to be taken apart on both sides alternately if person goes unconscious on running 35bracket it may be that one flow is overloaded or maybe he isnt really doing one leg of the bracket so you have to check and see about that by asking once on each leg did you answer that to your satisfaction the flow three on brackets is to handle his dispersal in connection with stuck flows the concept of god is interesting what kind of shape would you think god would be in if hed just been creating things and causing everything you could never reach him or say anything to him what kind of duress must he be under to propitiate to us all that much he must be quite spun in anyone whos on such an obsessive cause must be practically nuts we should have society for the resurrection of god he ploughed himself in for us so we should help him out the prehav scale is reactive bank scale when person is eventually able to have he doesnt have to have bank so the bank disappears at the point of have the bank wouldnt be there to measure on an analytical scale the best description of the analytical have scale would be axioms one and two all other truths are the result of postulates agreements and considerations so the scale would depend on what bunch of thetans agreed on it could change the prehav scale is fixed nowimsupposedto this is it why were here scale its the order of the value of postulates that are fixed and not changeable in the absence of scientology at some time early on the time track this scale must have been dreamed up recovering it is quite trick all levels may not be there also some levels repeat in changed wording and there are harmonics 6106c05 shspec8 routine one two and three an auditing result is determined by 1 the adequacy of the tool being applied modified by 2 what auditors will use which is modified by 3 what they can use good process is one that can be widely applied good procedure is to ask an auditor what hes had gain on himself let him run that until he gets reality with training on something else hell get result where he himself believes he can get result if you increase persons potential responsibility without letting them be responsible for what theyve done it is vicious the person will feel miserable which is better than being irresponsible but theyll stop getting case gain because they feel its not deserved or safe as pc gets processed his reality level on his life and overts comes up thats why sec check reads change as the person gets new auditing the point of doing ow is to bring responsibility up but this is only possible where there is some responsibility the dead thetan case wont read on ow he has total irresponsibility but person cant take responsibility for his acts unless you let him do it and communicate them 6106c06 shspec7 routine one two and three always check for what happened between sessions if the pc has different ta read from the end of one to the beginning of the next session even after just break the definition of rudiments is whats needed to get the pc in session they are nothing more than that dont use ruds to waste auditing ruds processes are weak let the pc asis it by telling you about it but dont two way comm it if the pc is still dramatizing something its too deepseated for ruds anyway if needed you can ask in several ways to find what it is this is not the same as two way comm you can run rudiments process if it doesnt clean up when he spots it 36with cchs you are auditing out valence end bringing the pc up the valence will fight for survival you will get comm lags etc the cchs are not run in model session you dont pick up arc breaks etc because the person doesnt easily blow them and can get quite involved in them routine one cchs and sec checks routine two general run of the prehav scale joburg and havingness all in model session ptps of ld are assessed for the terminal which is run on the prehav scale routine three sop goals assessment assess for terminals run flat on prehav with joburgs interspersed 6106c07 shspec9 points in assessing the problem with communicating scientology is that there are agreedupon realities readymade in words if you give person one of these concepts and its name and definition he will recognize the truth of it but it will take awhile for him to really grasp it and he has to get the concept first this is almost like processing people read dmsmh and got an understanding that changed their physical condition but the ideas of dianetics and scientology havent been familiar to man so it takes awhile or it takes familiarity with them to grasp them you could teach someone the principles of scientology by teaching him the vocabulary youve got to get the ptp of long duration off the pcs case if he has one before you can go on with goals processing because the ptp ld is more real to the pc than anything else on his case his attention is fixed on it if the pc has his attention fixed on the hidden standard youve practically got computation right there it has to be gotten out of the way to get case gain it is always right on the goals chain or it wouldnt be ptp of long duration so when you get it out of the way youve got the case flying it has been mistake not to assess the hidden standard finding out who had it when and what this is presession 38 dianetic assist see hcob 23feb61 pt problem and goals or more certain method would be to run the hidden standard with terminals assessment by elimination whose might it be what might it be etc this line of questioning is interesting both to the pc and casewise because the hidden standard is the primary source of individuation for the pc it is what makes him different from everyone else it is the least well duplicated part of the bank so it will fire off as an automaticity because it is the area that is most out of communication and most out of control the pc could get lots of terminals from this the hidden standard is substitute for the case of the pc it is more real to him than any case or life difficulties the pc may have it is form of individuation the pc is the one with the earache this distinguishes him from others 6106c08 shspec10 q and period and ending an intensive lot of specific data about running sop goals 6106c09 shspec11 reading emeter reactions auditing latent reads is auditing the analytical mind it is the reactive mind that we are interested in auditing the reactive mind is mind that acts without inspection on the basis of stimulus it puts into action solutions to problems it fancies must exist which may never have existed or which havent existed for billions of years put in any part of the problem and the reactive mind goes into forming the solution thetan is trying to survive who has necessity for trying to survive at all which is the first idiocy so the mind is trying to solve nonexistent problem then it addresses itself to the survival of form the perpetuation of an existing state which would take out all the mest in sensible state and garbleize it the reactive mind is the individuals accumulated goals for the survival of forms the reason it destroys is to get something to survive it creates to get form to survive the reactive mind is the part of the cycle of action that will never move because its keynote is survival of form so it is trying to make something survive that is already dead old bodies identities etc 37you could remember it if you werent trying so hard to make it survive but because of the survival effort when you try to remember it you get restimulation as if you were still in the period because all the impulse to survive has been trapped and rides up to pt all of these forms have nothing to do with pt but here they are so the reactive mind has starvation for the other parts of his old games eg the opponents and it acts without inspection and very fast to get form to survive you cant take time for inspection this leads to such idiocies as people attacking their own planes or ships in war when theyd gotten used to attacking enemy ones the safe thing to do is not to inspect under battle conditions the jam of the time not taking time to inspect results in noinspection when you speed up things in the physical universe to too great degree on the false basis that you are prone to nonsurvival but in the interest of keeping something surviving youll run into the timeless reactivity of action without inspection so therefore what you are after is instant reads your auditing target is the reactive mind not the pc the only thing wrong with the pc is the reactive mind and there is inspection involved there so he cant see what is wrong with him if he could see it it wouldnt be wrong this is also why the reactive mind is more in control of the auditor than the pc the noinspection factor he cant think on the reactive subjects you can so if you take his instructions on what to do or handle youll always do the wrong things one of the pcs goals is to make his reactive mind survive so he wont let you near any part that should be audited it dictates to you that it must survive it throws you red herrings when you turn around and look when youre running from battle that youre losing you normally get speared therefore its very very bad to look at the things that are pursuing you so you mustnt so you had better prevent the auditor from looking at the things that are pursuing you there is another obscuring element withholdingness is the comm bridge between the pc and the reactive mind when withhold comes out of the reactive mind the pc will do what the reactive mind tells him to do which is to withhold it withholdingness is part and parcel of survival it is protection of forms from attacks and destruction its nonduplication too you withhold your form from duplicating the form of someone youve killed this sets the mechanics going for survival its actually prior to the actual idea of survival so the pc gets into withholding thought the withholding of form is superbasic to all sorts of other things eg individuating the pc also withholds his body from destruction when the pc gives up withhold hes conquered dictate of the reactive mind by being controlled by being the auditor rather than by his bank this is the mechanics by which he feels better when he gets the withholds off because withholds add up to keeping him separated from the human race he can always be counted upon to dramatize the withhold when it comes up on the meter theres first tick then fall as the pc spots it the secondary action is not to get the withhold off the pc but to keep the pc from dramatizing his reactive bank so we say what was that when withholding the pc is reactive he is dramatizing otherwise hes talking to you analytically or at the dictates of the reactive mind early in the case auditing the pc is like auditing the light bulb to fix the generators in the power plant the emeter helps you locate all the parts in the generator if the pc is left with withhold in session hell arc break half an hour later what youre trying to do is to keep the pc from being fooled about himself if you avoid the reactive mind youre just doing q and with the pc 6106c12 shspec12 emeter actions errors in auditing the emeter only reacts on those things that the pc is aware of or capable of becoming responsible for this responsibility factor becomes reality factor so you can audit what appears on the meter things that dont appear are beyond the pcs zone of responsibility getting new reads on sec checks is thus test of the pcs advance in responsibility if change there is some gross outness countering the auditing dont get trapped by all the little minor errors these gross efforts come from the impulse to make nothing out of something which goes back to productivity the effort to produce is one half of the dichotomy all strikes are on the other half the effort not to produce many people are dedicated to nonproduction nosurvival this comes about as reaction to stuck flow on must survive many operations would go better if just left alone todays planned balanced economies reminiscent of markab which specialized in this generally result in unbalanced messed up economics produce and nonproduce should be on the secondary prehav scale the goal could also be results 38here we are talking about continually recurring gross errors not just occasional errors anyone will do that dont attempt total perfection or youll never complete or accomplish anything people get so tense about doing it right that theyll never get anything done good exercise to cure perfectionism is to deliberately decide something is finished without the finishing touches when you can do perfect trs metering etc you can relax and just audit with anxiety communicating to the pc you must exude confidence in order to give people hope which is fundamental necessity to making someone well or better mainly it has to appear that you are trying to do something for the pc not that you are trying to be perfect using instant reads one gets at all the held down fives in the bank using latent reads one is handling all the pcs concerns about why the fives were held down this is longer road to clear 6106c13 shspec13 seminar q and period there are people with stuck valence serenity who arent clear like the buddhist definition effect types clears are in fact responsive and active volatile alive responsible and not thatall serene they want things to happen and make them happen note that there is single button one shot thought process which produces clear the fellow has to walk out of the labyrinth the same way he got in which is by overwhelming and being overwhelmed scientology is the first mechanism which allows someone to erase the effects of having overwhelmed others if there were any such oneshot process lrh would have found it but the fact that flows exist defeats the single button people have thought that what would you be pleased to accept would be clearing process its been run to its ragged bottom in 1954 but didnt clear anyone the flows at least would stick it could produce rapid result for few minutes another rapid result getter is look around here and find something you could go out of arc with it makes him feel great for awhile then spins him you could find button for every cult theyre formed on monomania on single button and if you make reverse process on that button you could make that kind of person out of the pc you find what the button is that _______ would be monomaniac about and run it as out of arc with stuck flow and the guy will become that _______ cf est processing this has been done on the whole track universities do it for instance they tell engineering students that engineers arent wanted anymore then the student will try very hard to be good engineer to be wanted in churches they use the blasphemy button to make people feel unsafe communicating with god this makes them religious fanatics you can restimulate whole track fixations selectively and produce momentary resurgences in certain goals directions when person can longer be beingness he may introvert into and permanently permeate some object or familiar thing around the old beingness eg headsman gets hanged then becomes the headsmans axe on case that has trouble with sop goals trouble finding terminal be sure the listing question is who or what to include 5th and 6th dynamic terminals repeater technique is repeated inspection 6106c14 shspec14 seminar withholds you dont destroy records when you are pulling withholds and you dont agree with the pc to do this if you do it is as much as if you were telling him youll withhold for him and he wont get much gain the only liability to getting the pc to where he cant be influenced by the reactive mind is that in sense you are auditing him towards state of noeffect total serenity total noeffect the way the lamaist did it the individual must be able to experience to live it is possible to plough someone in on level and make them look good but not clear this is education by fixation see p 37 one should be able to do anything on the prehav scale repairing his ethics will eradicate his impulse to do hasty things and get action on rational basis as result of inspection not based on inhibition this is new thing on earth in human behavior theres nothing wrong in theory with native state processing as practiced in 1957 and 1958 knowingness deteriorating by postulate to notknow to must know to cant know forget to remember this processing was too simple and of too much generality to be functional an ot 39process tell an intention that failed tell an intention that succeeded would be one button clear process if that could be run since its axiom 10 factor 2 but its too simple to plumb the reactive mind with certain level of complexity is necessary to resolve cases the worse off person is or the clearer they are the more you need to run the secondary scale greater complexity how many buttons are there there are all the beingnesses ever all the doingnesses ever all the things anyone ever had or could have you cant force person to grasp reactively things which are analytically obvious because its reactive and nutty process must have some complexity to be effective at reactive level and some simplicity to make it easy to administer if one invalidates the basic agreements and identifications of the mest universe mest changes characteristics for instance if you stop agreeing that water runs downhill and challenge that itll go all gelatinous and globby security check is running all the notknow off the case that it has run on everyone and everything for god knows how long you are actually running the native state cycle of sequences not withholds at all overts consist of putting notknows into the third dynamic for instance someone robs store the storekeeper comes in and doesnt know who did it or when or when it might happen again also notknowing where the stuff is that was taken then the storekeeper runs the notknow on the police now the area has notknow that accumulates in the society until people cant trust each other and cant produce and the society is aberrated someone feels better when he gets off the overt of creating ignorance eventually hell realize that this overt worried people thats another overt then eventually he cognites on the notknow overt and hell notice his memory improving his iq going up as he runs out overts of making people notknow or be stupid in other words sometimes case will recover totally by getting off one big overt auditors dont effectively run presession what question shouldnt i ask you etc see hcob 15dec60 because they arent imaginative enough about all the evil in the world it also requires the auditor to create notknows about the pc it works better to give the auditor list of mean nasty vicious notknows someone might have run on the world this doesnt run notknow on the auditor this is the sec check different sec checks should be devised for different routines routine three cases need wholetrack lists otherwise their whole track memory will get occluded whole track memory depends on some kind of whole track sec check this also answers the question of why pcs feel better after giving up same withholds but not others and what is withhold its running dont know or cant know on self or others when the overt is on someone else it gives big resurge when it comes off messing up time by lying is different breed of cat its creating for one thing all of life is an invented episode writing fiction is done with the intention to amuse and inform the only notknow in it is to keep the reader from knowing the end before he gets there the only aberrating thing about it for the writer is that its creative effort which can wind someone up in the soup cf the effect on some people of step six if you tell lie to obscure your own guilt thats another notknow or false knowingness which eventually makes the person feel that all life is pretense cf the sociopath auditing then becomes just literary criticism of life as romantic episode 6106c15 shspec15x notknow theres mechanical side and thought side of boiloff one is prone to worry when the pc boils off but it is only matter of concern if the auditor ceases to audit because of it the mechanical definition of boiloff is stuck flow lot of stuck flows got parked on the track and when the pc hits them he boils off most of the time when the pc goes unconscious if you kept giving the auditing command the pc would keep on doing it at about the same speed or bit slower as when he was awake because the pc isnt really unconscious if he didnt hear you theres harm done it s not an implant situation he comes right through it the thought definition of boil off is that it is the accumulated notknow the pc has run on everybody unconsciousness is merely the intensification of notknowingness you could even run notknow in the course of being kind by not telling people that theyre upsetting or bugging people they will make enemies who eventually hit them surprising them because one told them they were messing people up immanuel kant introduced notknow into philosophy with his transcendentalism this killed philosophy until scientology came around the greek philosophies amounted to this if you couldnt lick them confuse them with entertainment and philosophy this outcreation with philosophy and entertainment was very effective means of conquest many philosophies have been mere dramatizations of prehav levels relying for their force on bank agreement by observing what people underline in books you can see that what people go for is what agrees with their banks 40one gets into this frame of mind as result of thinking truth is merely subjective there is broad truth this is the philosophy of the only one solipsism also general semantics then theres dale carnegies 11ism which tries to communicate with an unreality they run notknow on people by being nice and the people sense it too where reality is not present notknow is substituted for it an unreality is created whenever you substitute an unknown for known communism does this well with the iron curtain or take someone who always says im fine when you ask how are you theyre substituting nonfact for an observable fact giving you an unreality that eventually makes then disappear curious phenomena will occur around someone who is doing this they eventually do disappear but if theres terrific notknow about someone he persists like mad for instance the monk dharma who lived 10000 years ago in india formed the basis for most indian religions but nothing is known about him or what he said the leastknown philosopher is someone whose name we dont even know hes influential in the background of lao tse confucius and buddha he is held in place by the notknow this is dharma who is not even thought of now as person but as fate on personal level notknow shows up as boiloff an extreme manifestation is unconsciousness at lesser level its death notknow at its most extreme is when person cannot go unconscious we call that insanity death is state of beingness not an action unconsciousness is lower well below death one can get knocked off and go on knowing what is happening insanity is where person cannot notknow the fifteenth substitute for reality delusory state they worry about these things laying in wait for them theyre in state of combat with the unknowable this can go on the tone scale on level of notknow from serenity about the unknowable on down they may seem fairly sane at the top but they dont know what it is they dont know about and are looking for they get down to grief about not having found out what it is they dont know about the guy will also be utterly fixed on the track if you know what you are unhappy or bugged about you are not insane merely wondering the fact that you can wonder why demonstrates that you are not insane knowing this one wont be baffled about insanity for bafflement is just q and with not knowingness the reason one gets worried about the insane case is q and of trying to find out what the case doesnt know what he doesnt know is notknow if you can speculate about what you dont know you will be ok you can introduce some sanity into someone who is spinning by getting him to think of one person who doesnt think he is insane because you have introduced knowingness into his unknowingness or you could use one command look around here and find something which is really real to you 6106c16 shspec16x confront and havingness havingness gets eaten up by valences and consumption circuits until the pc is clear or nearly so then it orients him and stays with him stably as long as he has dominant valence or dominant machinery havingness gets eaten up any gain it gives is in ten to twelve commands any more than that is waste of time arc straightwire does lot for havingness at first also havingness works by shifting attention but doesnt asis the banks masses it just moves them around details on running routines one and two and havingness and confront processes if case with lot of auditing hasnt had significant change the policy is that regardless of graph meter read or anyones opinion you run routine one cchs and sec checks this is the most rapid way to make the case change its just the effective thing to do this prevents you from making mistake on the case the only reason someone gets upset about being run on cchs is that pride enters into processing which is in itself sign of some nuttiness 6106c19 shspec15 q and period auditing slowdowns test for release the person should not be reading weirdly on meter the sensitivity knob should be down you should get good drop with sensitivity zero you should get reaction on the questions do you think youll get any worse does scientology work for you how do you feel about help how do you feel about control every time you find something in the pc struggling for survival it isnt the pc because he cant do anything but survive its valence every valence fights for survival it can be such clever valence that it can fool the auditor the auditors code is there so the valence wont feel challenged 41so it wont kick back before you can jump it the pc gets most upset by the auditors failure to handle his case the valence says see the red herring if the auditor complies the pc will get unmanageable because hes lost confidence in the auditors control the auditor neednt apologize for positive certain control thats how to make valences lose and pcs win kindness validates valences not pcs valences arent hard to handle if you are certain and let it come across auditing weakly gives power to the pcs circuits and valences auditing with certainty validates the pc instant read is within tenth of second the death of the ego is the death of the valence 6106c20 shspec16 sec check questions mutual rudiments the perfect answer to any question is the exact question when it is correctly asked it is answered say you are trying to lay out serving equipment in hotel kitchen when you finally spot exactly what youre doing you perceive that you are not arranging machinery but trying to accomplish some exact result like trying to get food from to b in asking the person whos going to use it what he needs you are getting more precise phrasing of the real question you wanted to ask when you have all the data to define the exact question you will have the answer the borderline between the reactive mind and the analytical mind is the broad savannah of i dont know things get foggy on it the pc knows something is there but sees nothing very clearly the auditors action in compartmenting and clarifying the question helps to pinpoint the source of fog for the pc the exact answer to problem is the exact problem when correctly phrased or asised this is why repetitive look at problem and rephrasing of it will cause resolution we have made recent discovery of magnitude weve known that coaudit teams tended to make less progress than hgc auditing but not why the answer is now known the first clue was the d of ps finding auditors ruds on pcs out even when the auditor found them in it turns out that the ruds werent out with the auditor it was mutual ruds of the team that were out with others but not the team for instance the pair agree the pcs family are swine so it wont read on ruds but someone else who isnt in on the agreement will find the pcs out ruds the meter registers on disagreements one way to solve it is formula 13 failed help and ow on terminals alternated see hcob 1dec60 cleaning up all the people who read or on ruds substituting we for you even cchs can do it 6106c21 shspec17 seminar at saint hill details on running prehav 13 its process which combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets relative to list of charged terminals at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness and doingness is higher than havingness to do can squeeze get hands relaxedly in your lap then squeeze them gently with the hand itself not clear on up to the shoulders 6106c22 shspec18 running cchs the way the cchs are run is 1 2 3 4 over and over and over it is breach of the auditors code clause 13 to run process beyond the point where it is producing change or to stop running one which is producing change the words in the process have very little to do with the process theyre run with meat and motion they are all done by compulsion if necessary the pc never has an opportunity not to execute the command the consequences of letting pc out of doing the command are grave the cchs run out surgery shock etc as the pc dramatizes you should run the process flat which means the pc has the same aspect for twenty minutes matter what the aspect 42is and matter how nutty or unconscious as long as the pc is doing the command change means such things as somatics etc it may be necessary to run cchs for few hours before they bite you dont pay attention to what the pc says its what he does though if he communicates to you that something is happening thats change running cchs permissively will also screw up the pc you must apply control to get communication and communication to get control irresponsibility denies havingness so sec checks also raise havingness all ow running since it raises responsibility results in havingness prehav really means prevent havingness scale it consists of those things that prevent havingness this is gotten off in routine 2 see p 34 or hcob 5jun61 the fixed reactive buttons that prevent the pc from having things are gotten out of the road on routine 3 the pc gets out of the road all those unrealized goals each of which has been defeat hence denial of havingness so havingness is the end product of all this ow raises havingness because the individual individuates from things because he cant have them so he develops overts only on those things he cant have so when you get the overts off he can have if you could have the whole universe it gives you trouble its only the things you cant have that you have trouble with next time you have ptp see whats in it and what prevents you from having them individuation from the thing the dynamic the universe is what brings trouble because you get into an obsessive games condition which adds up to you cant have it and it cant have anything to do with you the cchs knock out individuation from the physical beingness which has been caused from the pc to his body and apparently his body to him thats why they run out electric shocks etc and you have to let him take more responsibility or he wont improve his havingness you have to maintain control or youll show him the body cant be controlled so it can continue to overwhelm the pc also the pc will become practically unauditable misguided kindness is all that could let you allow the pc to control the session its actually vicious thing to do even if the pc is right in his advice dont follow it hell gain more from being run wrong but under your control than right under his own if youre going to err err on the side of control and toughness not sweetness and light its better to end the process wrongly on the auditors determinism than to end it rightly on the pcs if you let the pc take control youre very liable to get an arc break half hour later you may not notice that its because you lost control because of the lag but the way to handle it is to spot the point where you lost control and reassert it if the auditor is in control of the session auditing takes place if the auditor is not in control of the session reactivity takes place if you flinch from auditing its from those times when you didnt control the session and came under attack as result 6106c23 shspec19 q and period cchs auditing many people dont see objects theyve been looking at facsimiles of the objects when the facsimile asises the wall looks bright such people tend to have bad depth perception because they never see anything they are easily invalidated because the reason hes making and looking at facsimiles is that the physical universe isnt safe for him the auditor begins to be real as the pc sees that he can duplicate him so if the auditor indicates eg on cchs 3 or 4 you didnt do it the auditor ceases to be real and the pc will put pictures of him up instead overrunning the process tells the pc that he was wrong to think hed got it this makes auditing unsafe the purpose of the cchs is to make the auditor the physical universe and present time real to the pc to show him he can observe the auditor the room and pt his havingness on otherdeterminism is very low the cchs remedy it he sees somebody else exists and the universe is here you can run cchs wrong by making the pc aware that the auditor and the room are real but dangerous when running child take account of the childs shorter attention span if its biting run it at least an hour before youd expect it to flatten exteriorization as done in 19525 was unstable lrh found that before thetan could get along without body he had to be able to have body and people who exteriorize easily generally want nothing to do with one philosophies that strive for peace are covert operation towards making people succumb spots of sudden change of pace are spots which brake persons life theyve got upsets in them and advice to take it easy and from then on it goes wrong they were asked to confront motionlessness which is most difficult to do medicine and psychiatry gave drugs etc to make person be quiet unless person can confront motion hes dead he cant confront life cant work and will become criminal the natural consequence of adopting motionless philosophy is to get religion peaceful one if you enforce nomotion on someone and make him think motion is bad hell get buddhistic road 43safety campaigns make sense because they emphasize going slowly less motion not keeping unsafe drivers off the roads or putting freight on trains the more you make population motionless the higher the crime rate tv corrupts the youth because it pins child motionless not because of the tv material the theory that people get seasick because of motion led lrh to think one should have pictures of very still scenes to counteract this he chose some thought about it and started to feel seasick he realized that whats needed is pictures of motion to accustom them to motion not motionlessness the cure for motion is motion not stillness philosophies of motion dont necessarily mean criminality eg space opera if you could keep it up with rest you might manage to be ok when you become incapable of handling the motion of life you can then start to experience pain the experience of pain comes about because of intolerance of motion you can run motion or nomotion to handle this situation predictable motion is better from the pcs viewpoint than unpredictable motion because with unpredictable motion he doesnt know what to confront when he gets the idea that its bad not to be able to confront everything at once he starts to butter all over the universe stick on the track etc also whenever person gets hit hard by life or as soon as he begins program to coerce people into working harder that person will obsessively start producing production follows defeat as in germany japan etc someone whos been defeated will produce more bank than someone whos doing well so in eradicating on the one hand persons intolerance of motion and on the other hand his failures or defeats you are causing his bank to disappear the first can be done by cchs the second by goals running everything becomes cure for past failures every goal is consequence of not having done we dont erase the bank the person gets accustomed to not needing one the person himself takes over the automaticities of beingness identities doingness creation and havingness most havingness is the result of defeat and the whole cure sequence where nearly everything in the universe is cure for past failures every goal also is the result of not having done so we get intolerance of motion feelings of defeat ability to have without having defeated anything if you can remedy those things for someone youve produced new being who is not the same as an old being whos never had the experience his knowingness of whats happened doesnt leave him but his knowledge of the consequences of what hes done lets him emerge as veteran of campaigns unscarred by his battles tough and capable that which strips all games from the universe would normally result in motionlessness but how about ending certain games for somebody who doesnt have the consequence of ending in motionlessness youve broadened the persons view of games he can play this gives him more games not less play is delusory motion about which youre not supposed to be serious so youre not supposed to asis it so person gets trapped in it because its not real play is dishonest doingness work is not serious activity person can work at sport and have fun as his job also if you dont just do what you are doing but put an i should be doing something else in youll stick in it if one just did what he did when he did it he wouldnt get stuck in it morality is nowimsupposedto which makes people not willing to do what theyre doing when they do wrong so they never asis their wrong acts so they continue to do them its certainty then that one gets persistence of the things he doesnt want or tanglement of the things he does want then he wonders why he feels odd so auditing is straightening someone out so he has tolerance for motion and motionlessness and can have what he should have or not as the case might be as he wishes to do that you have to erase all the oddities of doingness all the pain and boredom of motion or nomotion the prehav scale disentangles all the doingnesses but if you make the pc intolerant of motion or be motionless when he cant or give him failures in auditing or dont make it duplicative so he cant have then you reverse the process goals are to large extent do something else or nowimsupposedto if the individual isnt doing anything he simply isnt doing anything there should be nowimsupposedto superimposed upon the situation 6106c26 shspec20 dealing with attacks on scientology 44scientology doesnt have an achilles heel so its in good position to defend itself people do get upset when confronted with new idea but new theories get accepted fairly quickly eg harvey on blood circulation socrates on the nature of man proponents of new theories dont necessarily get martyred the ones that do generally are getting motivators for their overts as tyrants also if one continually fails to advance an idea one may get suicidal and die for it eg christ and socrates lrh believes in making an idea effective not to fail at it and make everybody feel guilty because they kill you its not necessary to sacrifice oneself for new idea thats just way to protect old ideas man is great believer in nochange while he obsessively changes everything so new ideas are rejected scientology is over the top but it is still being fought because to the degree that one is right to that degree he is dangerous we threaten to upset lot of beliefs and customs its only safe for us to do it because we can undo what we do for instance we can run out bad auditing the reason there is question on sec checks about overts on lrh is that if one had lot of overts on ron and scientology one could acquire forceful overwhelming valence called scientology so this is the first time anyone has said try it and see in the early days people said we should go big on aesthetics lrh said you can always overwhelm thetan with aesthetics but its not desirable to overwhelm thetan if its true far you its true not because weve overwhelmed you were attacked because we have evil motives people get frantic because they cant figure out whats the ditch if you can make thetan commit overts against you or set him up where he can commit the overts and remove any possibility of running the overts you can overwhelm him and get him so stamped dawn with valence that he cant even wiggle in other words you set person up where he cant receive an overt from you you wont commit one and on the other hand you set him up where he can commit overts on you and cannot get them run out then youve done him in good and proper former efforts at this were entrapments it isnt really an effort towards total freedom either since it allows for games man becomes alarmed at the fact of there being this selfless philosophy that doesnt demand that one become subjugated and enslaved by it and that it doesnt say that the originator of it must be carried on an imperishable valence that everyone should bow down to when attacked all one needs to do is to take effective actions not get frantic just keep up effective pressure investigate loudly and dont feel rushed about it let it coast when people are in terror they make mistakes so let them make the mistakes for instance man called ettleman had been hired by the ama and the apa to attack scientology in this case which went on for three years when it finally came to trial his attorney didnt show so the case was dismissed all that can be zone to an organization or person is to harass them to the point where theyre too worried to do their job so keep the reaction to attack to the minimal effective actions dont waste time and keep the show on the road the more you worry about the attacks the more motion you waste and the less scientology you get done so all the enemy can do is to get negative gain by reducing your effect see if its your game before playing it nothing wastes as much time as the law because the law has overts against time if one anywhere fought scientology it would be as nothing unimportant think of all the philosophies that must have been developed in the past eleven years none of them have been fought sure sign that we have ignorance and aberration on the run is that there are attacks and fights the process is biting start worrying when there are more attacks also note that our comm lines are far more rapid and effective than the enemys and must be kept up this alone discourages the enemy 6106c27 shspec21 cchs circuits the way to bust up machinery on cch1 is to vary the pace hell jump the command if machine is doing it one effect of the cchs is to help the pc find the auditor if he goes on automatic he doesnt have an auditor just running the cchs will run it out varying ones pace will prevent it from starting if you just use intention on the pc and verbal commands your intention may be good but the pcs command circuits may be goofed up and you may not get the response you expected he may not be hooked up the way he should you can have fun with meter talking to the entities in body you could start talking to the pcs circuit but it hooks in harder and harder it hooks in on drop of 45havingness and you are making comm line talk across to his circuit youre validating the circuit and lowering the pcs havingness if the pc has problem and you try to run think of solution repetitively the pc caves in you are running off the core of an area of motion leaving the motion on automatic the pc is not confronting the actuality of the thing hes not confronting whats going on at all hes confronting solution to it that is hes trying to notis what it is and the problem mass moves in on him if you get him to spot the mass connected with the problem then describe the problem then spot the mass it moves further away if you get him to think of solutions the mass will move in problems of comparable magnitude will also move the problem out this occurs because of confront if the pc avoids it it moves in you can also move the mass out with havingness solution is stable motion datum amidst confusion circuits can be used to get data to verify answers to calculations confirm if they are right or wrong or to give you tomorrows weather the latter takes the increment of time that is tomorrow and inspects it this is possible if you can look with equanimity at tomorrow at least its insignificant aspects you can predict to the degree that you can confront people who cant confront pt obsessively try to confront tomorrow or yesterday but its not real tomorrow and probably not real yesterday either the way you go nuts on circuits is to ask yourself who put that there or who else put that there and what does it mean this gives you mystery pcs who dont control their circuits and havent inspected them for many years or eons have things popping up all the time when you audit them some get auditing answers from their circuits the circuits were put up as substitute for confronting and are so old and forgotten that now nothing about them is confronted when the pc nears one of them it tells him what to do or say since circuit is just noconfront running havingness and confront improves circuits the pc may have originally put circuit there for convenience and then come to believe that it was unconfrontable because there was circuit there you could say to the pc were going to handle your primary aberration so make picture of it and look at it tell what you see youd get amazing answers the action of taking picture of it then looking is of course an alteris of confront in auditing you want people to look directly at things circuits encourage them not to because they think they cant confront something as you audit pc these things go live as havingness drops the pc gets anxious keys in circuits to predict or confront drops or as the pc improves and circuits can be activated as the pc comes up through them so everything goes on via auditing walks him up to less and less vias more and more confidence the reason confront isnt on the prehav scale is that it isnt doingness its an ability cf p 22 where confront is described as an action also cf p 40 where confront is defined as subjective havingness or at least the process is defined as subjective havingness process that explains oddities you get running cchs youre activating and knocking out circuits because direct control and communication brings about continuous shift of circuitry in terms of havingness then since hes been gotten to pt confronting the auditor this brings his havingness up if you talked to those circuits they might well say anything which is also true of the pc on cchs so the less attention you day to what the pc is saying or thinking the better dope off and comm lag indicate things happening to the pcs confront and havingness circuits go haywire when they contain the postulate that the thetan is unable to confront apart from that they can be useful 6106c28 shspec22 raw meat troubleshooting cases details on handling raw meat cases tests etc if pc has persistent out ruds check for continuous pt overts at least at the level of unkind thoughts on automatic this is very common you can handle this with prehav 13 6106c29 shspec23 wrong target sec check herbie parkhouse telexes from london auditors arent getting sec checks done because it takes two to three hours to get ruds in he wants to scrap model session for processing checks this is an unusual solution people are now in the same position about auditing that ron was in when he started 46researching life theres been so much alteris and countercreate the truth is obscured naturally in relaying comm about the simplicities of life these things get restimulated and people start looking around corners when the cop is right on the sidewalk there is secret about life it is just surrounded by alteris and obfuscations people arent doing their jobs because they are so busy doing other things for instance government is so busy doing the work or charitable organizations that it has time to administer justice protect citizens from criminals etc in good government production rises people prosper welfare state government attacks producers with taxes its all off post everything is trying to make you wear its hat so in scientology the person who is on the ground observes parkhouse by not observing caused ron to interiorize into his hat the analytical mind isnt really computing machine it is the pc when he or the analytical mind is attacked by the auditor youll get auditing done your target in the reactive mind this is why lrh can do in 5 hours what it took other auditors 25 hours to do the difference isnt that lrh is good and others are lousy it is that the other auditors reactive minds were apparently choosing the pc as their randomity attacking the pc because he was aberrated the target is the reactive mind you sit down you take the emeter you say have you ever stolen anything what you really want is for him to recall ventilate air the reactive mind you shouldnt assume he already knows and purposely wont tell you when you do sec check because of the specific question he remembers it and will ordinarily tell you if you get heavy reads and he says have him keep looking let him know theres something there but maintain arc the proper attitude is you couldnt possibly remember this and not tell lets just get the show on the road when they look hunted use light touch to get them to tell you if youre suspicious and accusative youre cutting comm with the pc and encouraging him to withhold assume that if he remembers it hell tell it at once it puts him in session that way the meter check is just to make sure we got all of it its up to the auditor to create an atmosphere of communication you can use some dunnage to do it this approach gets the pc comfortable relaxed confident his knowingness comes up he gets relief after all you are the auditor not the emeter the guy gets to where he feels safe his anxieties come from feeling unsafe in life so your attitude alone can produce great change in the pc if youre using the meter and he says you dont assume he knows and wont tell you but that he hasnt overwhumped the reactive mind youre disappointed but you assume he can remember this builds his confidence and gets him in hopeful frame of mind doing it this way speeds it up enormously gives faster gains its not that hes getting more confident in you its that hes getting more confident in his ability to overwhump his bank you get far more off the case faster by this method youll slow it down by making sure he wont want to tell you and has to be trapped and beaten into telling you dont ever assume games condition in auditing this will also keep the rudiments in since ruds go out with rough auditing set yourself up as someone who can be confided in rather than as cop sniffing out the crime never assume games condition in auditing or not if you dont want one 6106c30 shspec24 training on trs talk on auditing details on running trs cchs and prehav 13 and routine 2 6107c03 shspec26x routine 1a problems routine 1a is problems processing alternated with sec checks it is to handle cases that are too tied up with out ruds to run cchs what is it that makes problem so deadly in processing problem is postulatecounterpostulate an indecisional proposition because the two sides are in balance one can hardly confront the two data at once the pc doesnt see the amount of confusion on it and the confusion mounts up around each side of it thus you get two separate zones of confusion each side with its stable datum because each side has yes and about it so you dont asis the problem and it persists thats its most basic characteristic people get impatient with problems so they solve them but problem solved has been notised not asised the solution of problem is of course an overt against problem 47everything in the universe is cure for something else solution this is one reason the universe persists cures deteriorate and solutions become new problems alcohol century ago was curing things even diseases once cured something cf sickle cell disease the bacteria that caused disease once cured something take an organization that is hammer and tongs on the subject of creativeness the catholic church they have the hatchet out on the 2d they dont think creation should be done that can be prevented they oppose vd campaigns because they think vd is good thing as cure for sex if you get vd sex stops so if sex stops you get vd sex vd because vd sex prostitution is also nosex proposition so it gives nosex disease sex is cure for bodies and bodies is cure for sex you dont get pc whose idea is horses sleep in bed who wasnt curing something with that idea every aberration hes got was cure for something his motionlessness is cure for having killed so many people if you pick up withholds on killing he will be able to move again killing too was cure for something maybe for hating people hate in its turn was cure for associating with people whom you might damage and damaging people was cure for people being people etc an aberration is cure that doesnt cure that you dont understand this all goes back to confusions and stable data if you have two confusions and two stable data opposed to each other which you dont confront you get an endurance because you never asis the thing you solve it pcs who go through vias continually on an auditing command have some problem theyve never looked at as problem when you run problems of comparable magnitude youve taken the via of curing the problem off automatic and sneakily gotten the pc to take look at the problem certain conditions that are designed to cure other conditions actually create them eg snakes venom makes snake antipathetic and snakes have venom because people and other animals dont like them the willingness to solve problems but not to asis them is the basis for q and people dont like getting the question fully duplicated as the answer this is because they are trying to solve some very fundamental confusion they have an effective method of teaching is to try to find the source of the question if you try to cure confusion it continues duress and punishment are the results of despairing of solving someones problems jails and mental hospitals are the cure for confusions about people this seems awfully drastic but it is born out of despair the effect of jails is to merely educate criminals more into hating people there is way to make correct and frontal attack on these confusions they often stem from withholds so joburg will help you may note that pc may look bit confused as he tries to find the problem he was solving problem remember is multiple confusion there are two solutions or ideas involved each with its own confusion an encysted confusion so one tries to back off from it which only pulls the problem along this is why thinking of solution makes the problem mass move in you cant really escape your own ideas thought mass is basically composed of problems it endures because its not confronted given enough of this the pc will be overwhelmed and will dramatize being problem one which is insoluble so you keep worrying about the pc because the pc is problem pc who says he has had gain is saying im problem solve your chances of doing it are poor hes got two confusions and cant confront either pcs whose needles keep rising are notconfronting problem you ask how are you doing the pc says fine the needle rises you ask what happened the pc says nothing its discouraging they cant tell you what it is because they cant confront it cchs will saw through this but slowly slowgain case is heavy on comm lag or not quite on the subject when hes talking the comm lag stems from noconfront so does the alteris which is dissociation from the confusion you ask the pc if hes got problem he gets upset because he cant confront it and knows he cant and he wants to avoid it altogether phenomena observed in the field stem from problems on noconfront or inverted basis in fields of stress or duress religious cults make their finest harvest they offer an escape from problems the reason alcoholics anonymous doesnt cooperate with scientology is that they have for their very existence contrary datum alcoholism cant be cured you cant do anything about it so you might as well join aa 48no matter where you go you can never get away from yourself if you try to pretend you are not where you are you get dispersal of location youll be buttered all aver the universe the guy who permeates everything without being anywhere is trying to escape his problems which all carry confront you put motion and action into thought process and they become inextricably tangled up inextricably that is short of scientology processing all this is prelude to very simple killer process for the pc for whom all life is problem the difficulty for the pc is series of ridged problems the ridges people have trouble with surrender on this one command which is horrendous to run because it moves very slowly at first and turns on fierce somatics recall problem you must be very careful to get the question answered on recall problem you should ask what problem was that and make sure he is not giving you generality instead of specific problem the pc will come up with some interesting solutions which will suddenly turn awful hell discover hes been both sides of various conflicts each side to solve losing on the other if the pc does locational on some object hes used to solve problem of boredom hell come uptone to interest this is another reason touch assists work more details on running routine 1a 6107c04 shspec27x problems and solutions only lrh could get simplicity on auditing problems usually when one tries to look at them he just gets confused the only mistake psychiatry made about psychosis was to try to understand it since its basically incomprehensible thats its whale character then they have to use heroic measures which fail and leave them place to turn the common denominator of psychosis is problems of course when the problems cant be associated with the solutions any longer you get solutions to noproblems which is psychosis when psychosis has been objectively described theres missing datum what problems is this behavior solution to cf rd laing and j haley the lack of this datum makes the psychosis incomprehensible you cannot cure psychosis by addressing the psychosis or more generally you cant cure an aberration by addressing the aberration this is because in so doing you are running the still in the middle of the motion the stable datum in the middle of the confusion the solution youre trying to cure the solution and not looking at the confusion you are looking at the cure which wont move out unless you get the motion off it the whirlpool wouldnt whirl without the motionless center but the center is motionless only because it has motion around it you should take the whirlpool off the motionless piece not the other way around here you have confusion and the stable datum motion and motion sound and silence absolute location and change if you try to get the motionless points out all you get is new motionless points all that is wrong with thetan is what is wrong at the lower and of the scale at the highest level thetan can be motionless at the lowest level he has to be its matter of determinism at the lower levels motionlessness is not determined by postulate but by the mechanics of motion if you want to see someone stiffen and go still stand fellow up shake your hands in front of his face produce lot of motion and say theres the motion at this point the fellow will sort of freeze as he becomes stable datum but this doesnt work well as demonstration because the observers will also all go still in sort of stupidity they wont confront the motion theyll put barrier up against it and become still so the motion will duplicate them and they will butter themselves all over the universe and become agitated auditing motionlessness just makes more motionlessness in the bank stillnesses identify more rapidly than motion in psychosis the person is being stillness the worst example of this is catatonia there cant be such thing as anaverage individual there can only be someone who is trying to be lot of other individuals and is therefore buttered all over the universe in terms of beingness hell be obsessively still the next step down is going round the bend the operations this universe uses to try to make one assume the average are so numerous that one accents then as normal insanity is the adoption of solution to the exclusion of all other solutions in the absence of problem if person confronts problems takes responsibility for them and goes into being solution all problems go on automatic they just go on all around him there can be million problems but theres only one solution him psychiatrist is being an obsessive solution also he never really cures anything he just persists with his ineffective solutions which just hold the problem in place he isnt aware that psychosis is problem hes handling people who are being obsessive solutions so he becomes one too the psychiatrist is the societys solution just as his solution is shock treatment psychotics dont realize others have problems or that theyre being problems to others psychiatrys research has been search for solutions but they hate solutions and they dont recognize the problem 49man has made the mistake all along the track of not realizing that if theres solution there must have been problem look at the ten commandments actually theres 162 pages of them these are moral codes and moral codes are series of solutions to problems which are neither confronted nor analyzed almost all the bibles commandments are prompted by the obsessive crimes of the time several are solutions to vd that was problem that descended on them that they knew nothing about so they looked for solutions they already had various areas of nosex they had already prevented true ethicality by inventing immorality with bunch of new morals lot of religions also encourage facing motionlessness eg by getting you to turn inward contemplate the stillness within meditate face mecca etc this is the basic operation of the track i believe its perfectly all right to do anything you want to to people as long as you dont say its something else or try to convince people youre doing something else as long as other people are not completely ploughed under by it the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics gives lot of lattitude the main crime is the entering in of notknow thats the only real evil there is when person reaches stage of being an obsessive solution with total notknow on what hes being solution to or when one is to being terribly still he doesnt know what motion hes being still to counteract obsessive stillness enters the bug factor here is the notknow in all this where you have someone solving problems you dont have an evil its ok to solve problems but an individual who has put all problems on automatic cant solve problems except with some fantastic liability of cavein terror stomach etc he doesnt dare solve problem there are gradients of this there are people who can salve minor problem but not major one theyll try to protect you from problem by preventing you from solving problem by feeding you extraneous data this is not to confuse you its to protect you eg the pedant who doesnt want to make mistake and doesnt want you to make mistake either when you see someone sitting in the middle of catastrophe one of two things is happening either the stuff is avalanching in faster than he can cope with it but hes trying to cope or he doesnt even know its catastrophe he doesnt even see all the papers all over the floor and the account book being used far doormat thats the condition of the thetan sitting in his bank he feels hes got it all straight and the trouble is all over there since you cant see the clutter you say well hes behaving oddly but thats not the situation hes confronting noly it is all notised when you run something in an orderly fashion you will at once get something done in the first place youre giving the pc an orderliness to confront and he finds out theres some motion that can be confronted where you have individuals who are totally insane you have confront of problems so routine 1a wont work it doesnt go as far south as the cchs but it works on most people including the guy who thinks hes is such good shape that he doesnt need any auditing if you run problems on him hell go hm ridges where did this come from the bank starts going solid somatics turn on hell see there were some problems around their masses start showing up this is the first time weve had good cure for this type of mass it bypasses the liability of curing it were enough on top of the mechanisms of existence to pull the overtmotivator sequence without falling athwart of its consequences similarly with the problemsolution sequence you can thus solve all the pcs problems without squashing him unlike psychiatry which also tried to solve all of his problems 6107c05 shspec25 q and period procedures in auditing the meter may fall on question but it might not be the question you asked it might be protest or something else find what the meter did fall on and clean that up notice that when you run description processing on problem the problem keeps changing thats one reason we dont do any fancy problems process on rudiments we just keep the pc on the one he brought up otherwise we start to get into all this alteris change as level in the prehav scale was developed to cure alteris it turns out that this was stopgap what cures alteris is problems pcs who obsessively alteris will run problems like rocket since the solution is an alteris of the problem you can check every once in while with the pc how did you get that answer what are you doing on running problems you have to strongly do this you have to be sure he really did 50recall problem and didnt just get notion of foggy confusion you dont have to check every command just every few randomly you have to use tr4 if he repeats the command after you hes set up circuit so you repeat the command dont do it if the pc has had cognition since in that case it can seem invalidative let the pc stay in communication dont be robotic about using the repeat statement but stay in pt and dont put the command on circuit the acks are halfacks not full stops to the cycle and you can put little insistence on the command when you repeat it this keeps it from sounding like new command always get the command you asked answered you can ask him if he still has the command if hes commlagging and drifting use this rarely and sparingly since it does distract the pc thats the common denominator of pcs arc breaks with auditors sudden change of attention is associated in all minds with accidents pain etc so the auditor shifting the pcs attention suddenly makes the pc feel hit you should wait until he looks vaguely in your direction dont jump on him the meter action will also tell you if the pc is doing the command if it stops registering you can suspect hes lost the command the auditing command is what it is and doesnt have any understood additional agreements in it so if you say recall problem it doesnt include tell about it or dont tell about it and you cant make agreements with the pc that he should tell you and let it be understood for the rest of the process other arc breakers are the auditor giving you five commands without letting you answer any of them or the auditor saying nothing giving new command when the pc is waiting for it you cannot tell the pc how to do the command in addition to giving the command he must understand the command but to give advice on how to do it is evaluation also if the pc makes contract with the auditor for session length that can get tacitly into every command the pc will get stuck in the first command of the session if you start with some agreement that wasnt repeated the auditing track will bunch the only understanding you have with the pc is the command given at the moment given the auditors control of the pc extends to one command at time the auditor does control the session and not with kindness or social niceties you can tell the pc youre answering things i havent asked you recall problem theres polite way of telling pc to shut up good solid nice acknowledgement as soon as the pc starts to diverge the mistake is not to control the pc but note that when youve announced yourself as control unit youd better stay one since the valence will immediately test you to see if you will if you chicken out youll get an arc broken pc arc breaks proceed from lack of control ie from lack of auditing what you can get away with is what impingement you can make on the pc but it must not be misemotional impingement or youll bolster up the valence the pc is dramatizing which is always misemotional entity under the surface youll cave the pc in so exert tone 40 control with arc theres difference between overwhelming the pc and controlling the pc if you dont shoot misemotion at the pc you can say anything to him its mistake to make any comment on anything the pc said or did even if the pc asks for evaluation its not up to the auditor to comment just to acknowledge the auditors opinion otherwise becomes stable datum to the pc and you are going to have to audit out the stable data you put in dont even imply by your acknowledgements that you agree youre not in or out of agreement with them just in control 6107c06 shspec26 routine 1a problems the cure for step 6 phenomena or creative processing ill effects is six way confront bracket on the pictures and responsibility on pictures people who go solid on step 6 type processes have an automaticity where if they create anything everything theyve ever created gets created hence since the bank is an individual creation the bank beefs up if you use these remedies and you keep these things in mind it would be safe to do creative processing you can prove this by taking picture improving it then looking at picture b you will find that picture b has also improved if you improve the pcs ability to perceive you improve his ability to create and it is only because the pc is doing it all himself that you can clear him however if you improve the pcs ability to create without improving his ability to confront youve done him in art school does this same with technical schools if you make sure the school has only text diagrams and real objects being studied youll cave the students in everything he doesnt like about the subject will eventually come to the fore because you are running cant have on him its games condition you are fixing it so he cant have what hes being educated in the more theory on the mind you give someone unaccompanied by an ability or opportunity to confront the substance of minds thinkingness and the beingness of life the less reality they will have on it so youd do better to leave them alone in their present confusion all training must be accompanied by confronting particularly in the creative fields the cure for obsessive create is confront if the guy is creating his own aberrations it must be that the road out would be confront that would be the secret of clearing 51a mind is an obsessive unknowing creation into which only few important factors enter create problems confront change responsibility notknow goals prevent the pc from looking at anything hes always looking at tomorrow not looking at what hes looking at theres nothing wrong with having goals but what you are looking for is the obsessive goal of the case theres only one of these and it prevents the pc from looking at any part of that goals chain because the goal is so obsessive that it removes his attention from that chain to something that isnt yet in the chain when you find the terminal that represents that goal youll have found the terminal theyve never looked at or inspected but have been with an obsessive goal the pc isnt in pt hes down the future track at an imagined future point so of course he isnt confronting where he is one of the pcs goals leads to the person who most obsessively had that goal which is the valence the pc is in and of course this is the total noconfront of the bank all bunched up in that spot if you only looked at tomorrow and never observed the immediacy of the situation you would eventually have asised any future of it at all so it hangs in time 100 youve never asised any immediacy of the situation so it is all there on that chain and all the future of it is asised goals processing undoes this mechanism of noconfront you are taking off all the futures if you did goals processing crudely and peculiarly you could get the pc totally regressed so that only some back point of the track has any reality to him and present point does if you arc broke him didnt keep him moving on the track this could happen rightnowness of moments on the track those points are on the goals chain theyre moments where the pc wished to god he were somewhere else but he cant be somewhere else so all hes got left to escape to is future this solid scene hes looking at part of it is actually observed its total overwhelm and hes got future there future postulate so it stays on the track as solidity since he cant confront it hell hit these and bounce into the future this could happen quite early in sop goals running the more hes confronted elsewheres than the unwanted incident the more they have asised and the more hes fixed in the incident where he didnt want to be when you run creative processing these points come up easily because hes obsessively creating them all the time problem is the least confrontable thing there is being composed of unconfrontable confusions some pcs will run total irresponsibility on problems of any kind they will perceive connection between having trouble in life and not confronting problems in their lives this is the clue to slow clearing profiles dont change when ptps exist clue to cases is the magnitude of problem the pc comes up with it can drive kids buggy when their parents idea of what problem is is grossly different from theirs you may see someone sitting in the middle of disaster of dramatic or quiet sort who is worrying about the fact that the lady next door has bought new hat thats the level of problem which that person can confront and the things connected with the disaster are not problems in fact theyre not even there someone could say to this lady why dont you straighten all this out and shell think theyre nuts that theres nothing to look at or if there was something there there would be nothing you could do about it you could probably do sanity and ability test by making list of problems by dynamics prepared list in gradients of magnitude you could then have the test taker just check the problems in each dynamic what he checks would tell you where he lives 6107c11 shspec27 problems and solutions just going into session and running do fish swim would give gain if there were ptps arc breaks or whs this is hard to teach auditors though its been known since 1955 that if ptp was present youd get change in profile if an arc break was present youd have depressed 52graph and if wh is present you dont even have session its weird youre trying to hold the pc still so that you can audit him problem is postulatecounterpostulate resulting in indecision any time you have fixed stable postulate it accumulates or came about because of confusion problem has at least two stable data the two opposed postulates each surrounded by confusion so at mesty level it looks like confusion counterconfusion situation war is one of these twenty years after world war ii traces of it persist as nato the common market etc as for the bank someone set up some idea that he should oppose to some other idea however the idea that he set up to oppose the other idea commits overts against the other idea in that it confuses the other idea then it in turn gets back confusion and the other idea attacks his idea so you wind up with two opposed confusions which then gather more confusion this then goes down the ages as one aspect of the reactive mind problems have duration thus the reactive mind has duration how many ways could you take problem apart as motion as looking at two things as getting confusions of comparable magnitude all without adding new solution solving problems without being stuck with new solution has never been done before psychoanalysis by contrast lays in new solution that produces new confusions then more solutions thus you get branches and schools of psychoanalysis if someone has to have solution he didnt confront and asis the problem solution is always noconfront confronting produces vanishment of the problem if you want something to persist just dont confront it this gets us back to the original mechanism of structure in this universe preventing solution of the problems of the universe to guarantee the persistence of the universe so anybody who solved problems with regard to the universe was persona non grata with anyone who was trying to get total persistence of the universe the problem is that it is impossible to create and at the same time to say that something will persist things created tend to asis so if we want things persisting around us if we cant create weve got to preserve what was created the way to preserve it is to get in this mechanism of noconfront and solutions that we are now trying to undo in the reactive mind this is the idea that anyone who solves problems is dead duck horrible things will happen to anyone who solves problems and everybody agrees 100 and everybody does it to everyone and you get physical universe fact that enters the mental field with reference to the above quote i think hubbard means by solve asis this is where structure and mind take their first divergence if you want shakily persisting universe to persist forevermore youve got to prevent solution asising of its mysteries youve got to prevent it from being confronted so you say anyone who tries to solve this thing is gonna get it this goes over into pcs trying to solve their problems from day to day the terrors of having solutions asisings then bring about all these other mechanisms the universe poses lot of problems why is it here why does time go clicketyclick etc and person who could be tremendous mystery thought he could guarantee to himself tremendous persistence obviously the way to live was to be mysterious and if you confronted nothing youd live on and on so we developed whole genus of thetan who had decided not to solve anything because to solve something is dangerous if you just ask pc to solve something repetitively masses close in on him he dramatizes the cure of the impersistence of universes basically theres nothing wrong with solving asising problems but when youve got tremendous overts against people who were trying to solve problems of course it becomes impossible to solve problems the persistence of the reactive mind is q and aing with the physical universe so you find that most physical universe principles that affect the mind are in the area of problems gravity being trapped stillness etc the person gets threatened you solve asis problem and well put you in jail so the fellow has problem doesnt solve problem doesnt confront the problem doesnt create space between himself and the problem and of course he gets embedded in sort of black basalt of energy he solves the problem and jails himself he knows if you confront problem you get confused all this is protective mechanism resulting from an upperlevel creative failure the consequences of creating showed up with step six so after the universe was figured out on the basis of if you create one there are terrible consequences therefore its impossible to create another one so your havingness would be shot to pieces if you knocked out the one youve got because you couldnt create another one youve already had earlier on the track tremendous problems on the subject of creation it isnt enough to just create something and say thats it you have to agree its valuable 53and one can ever create another one like it etc you make something valuable by protecting it and by never being able to replace it these are all mechanisms of value by which people try to get you to lay off mest so everyone is convinced that creation carries penalties and that you have to protect creations against being asised and you get the problem sequence going we have legends against looking medusa pandora etc another threat would be you realize that if you solved the problem of time all time would cease actually if you could solve the problem of time the worst that would happen would be having to put it there for yourself again and mass without time probably wouldnt entrap anybody anyhow if you told the pc face solution repetitively hed get upset in the first place solutions are the easiest things thetan does and the easiest things to create and hed practically get his head knocked off with the confusion surrounding the solutions you didnt have him looking at the confusions only the solutions so the confusions just get more confused not confronting the confusions you have reason why any of the solutions ever occurred if we say look at the confusion they havent much inkling where to look whats communicable is the package of confusion solution which is the problem when he looks at problems he looks at future solutions too so it asises things bit youre not trying to get the fellow to solve or erase problems but to get him over his horror of problems and the piability of solving things youre trying to get him to recover from these things which were set up on the very earliest part of the track person who cant confront problems hasnt much judgment so this is the clue to judgment judgment can only take place in the presence of observation we can observe synthetically when using mathematics or when mocking something up judgment is absent in person who cant confront problem the auditor who cannot confront the problems of the pc wont see them as problems wont handle them and the pc wont make progress so this resolves auditing too the more confrontingness person has the better his judgment an auditor with judgment is valuable auditor so we want to get someone familiar with problems we start with reach and withdraw on the mest he has problems with any number of processes will increase the pcs familiarity with problems people go off onto the collection of solutions for which problems exist eg decorative knot tying or botany then there are people who will have nothing to do with problems but are overwhelmed with problems most of these problems wouldnt seem like real problems to you just facts as he describes them eg tell problem ok the sidewalk as you enter the area of problems with pc youll find him in one of these two conditions if its problem hes never been able to handle 1 pc in an obsessive automaticity of solutions 2 pc totally immersed in the problem as fact hell never be in the center line of these are problems until he wakes up to it when you run problems on someone he first starts coming up with solutions then on gradient he starts to relate them to the facts which for him appear to be problems or he goes into the processing announcing facts not solutions so it doesnt seem to you the auditor that you are listening to problems its not that he hasnt told you the whole story the fact hes given you is to him problem it starts peeling back onionlike until you find eventually there was some problem it was involved in usually with an overt in it and he can see it all and it blows the way to get the pc more familiar with problems is to get him to look at them recall problem is one way 6way confront bracket is another the two can be combined with profit you can also use recall ptp this situated him in the time of the problem its headon type of process with alteris of time for 6way confront see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a in view of the fact that the aberration about problems was originated to protect the universe and creations you find the early end of problems run appearing to run forever since it was put there to insure persistence however you will notice that the ta is active this then starts deteriorating and hell pass to either side either facts or solutions or cognitions he can alternate between facts and solutions too 546107c12 shspec28 q and period continuous lack of cognitions on the part of the pc means hes hung up in fantastic maybes the way to take it apart as per the anatomy of maybe as set forth in scientology 880 is on the plus minus side how have you done it how have you not done it maybe does not have any reality in fact its manifestation of positive and negative this is also the anatomy of problems maybe is counterbalanced insistence on it is it isnt or mustmust not since it is not fact it must be taken apart on the basis of the two sides this handles the subject of anxiety which is must must not isisnt it is frantic state of maybe so such case should be run on positivenegative bracketing everything you run on such pc should be run plus and minus even rudiments the case will change and never seem to notice it its not impossible to run solutions just dont prevent the pc from examining the problem eg sop goals runs solutions the universe has been boobytrapped with ease of getting in and difficulty of getting out eg marriage the army etc scientology even does it to degree discouraging people from squirrelling etc because its rigged this way the way out has to approximate the way in all resistance is to prevent oneself from going any further down if you can resolve the resistance to getting worse the pc will get better hes preventing deteriorating but this can produce deterioration however that is not his intention all the auditor has to do is to convince the pc that hes not going to push him further down nor to cure him then to dissolve his resistance to getting worse which is pinning him down and the pc can then spring back if the pc didnt make his goal for the session you can ask what didnt happen and sometimes you will get his hidden standard 6107c14 shspec29 checking ruds and withholds to clear somebody at this time he must be in body just so he can be picked up and audited thetan who has just dropped body has to get another one before we can clear him when columns b c and d consistently register low after processing you know the pc hasnt found the auditor this is due either to an auditor who doesnt impinge or pc who cant tolerate being effect or control case that hangs fire has an automatic notis which can wipe out the needle read hell tell you all sorts of overts on sec check but not consider them bad he doesnt think its real he knows about it but its all notised dont get outraged with the auditor who missed it he didnt really miss it all the time you are checking the pc over you ask about the auditing so as to unearth the moment of notis youll make it safe by putting it on via eg have you ever thought it wouldnt hold up your case if you didnt tell your auditor did you ever have objections to the auditing room and just fail to mention it is there any time in your life when you felt completely beyond help did you ever tell your auditor these are tricky questions but youre counting on the fact that during that fifty hours something did get brought to view that can be reexamined when spotted it requires bit of cleverness to spot it theres sense in trying this technique before hes has any auditing the ground hasnt been plowed yet hes been like this all his life and thinks its normal the meter registers on disagreement and he doesnt have any yet in fact you can use disagreement as broadsweep ruds question when nothing else will register the this is normal is in dianetics the evolution of science as the everyone knows the pc really knows its not normal but the valence hes in considers its ok you could ask what is life really like to find out what normalis to him when we say its below his level of reality we mean he has some specialized compartmented values of existence which really have nothing to do with existence his level of reality has nothing to do with other people this is his reality so it doesnt register when you ask for differences for instance you ask for critical thoughts he says and it doesnt register because its all justified that he natters continually the disagreement is in total agreement with his reality they have everything identified with everything so there is sense in disagreement the complexity of disagreement with everything is such that the disagreement is just the way things should be thus there is read an automatic notis is an automatic disagree you have to be clever to unveil it all the pc has opted out of life because it was too much but he knows he shouldnt have 55he will perhaps tell you that he has led calm orderly life that nothing much has happened actually he just hopes he has past how do you get him back into the mainstream of life the meanest thing you can do is to ask him have you ever left anyplace he answers then you hit him with why now you are asking for the points of departure from the main highway you are asking what didnt you confront that you feel you should have confronted now the meter gets active it can be summed up in this way did you ever have anybody demand that you put your attention on something have you ever had anybody tell you that youre wrong not to have had your attention on something thats the basic trick this comes up on problems the basic trick of life making people confront is the overt and having to confront is the motivator all deaths and the whole mechanism of death comes from unwillingness to confront so when people leave and feel they shouldnt have left it is because there was something there that was too threatening and it keyed in death so they did q and on death and opted out of life they were running noconfront on people giving people things that couldnt be confronted if you do that you get the idea that you cant confront after you get that idea you can only leave and when you cant even leave any more all you can do is to go nuts when you get the why of leaving you can ask if thats been problem to him at any other time you could get his ptp that way you can ask have you ever thought of blowing session why what youve done here is to walk around cleverly using all the buttons that he is using to lie there quietly unchanged the buttons of the prehav scale can be used in this line eg prevent which has to do with problems the surprise element is effective in all this so it shouldnt be rote the pc must realize that he is being interrogated by an intelligence control is associated with intelligence the labor management situation stems from suspiciousness of cleverness when people are unclever they are easily overwhelmed by cleverness they can protest it with strike labors basic yap is against the intelligence of management but management is never bright enough to use intelligence as counterweapon intelligence is an altitude factor this applies very strongly in sec checking you wont get anywhere operating as robot similarly with ruds if you know there is something wrong because the pc hasnt responded to the correct processes then there has got to be something wrong with rudiments if you cant get the pc to respond well its not that he is trying to hide from you consciously he is being dead body up in gully covered with leaves and youve got to work around cleverly to communicate with him so he can be gotten back into life the trouble is that he thinks he is just lying there quietly and he isnt he is shooting guns and making all kinds of fuss on the other hand you dont want to get so helpful that he comes to rely on you totally and never looks 6107c18 shspec30 cant have create in 1952 the philadelphia doctorate course and scientology 88008 were the basic texts on havingness havingness is dominant thing it is part of games conditions now we are back to games conditions and its relation to havingness in scientology 88008 we had the principle that the goal of processing is to remedy the scarcity and abundance of all things but all that we previously had to do this was creative processing and lot of people couldnt run it now we have come up with new way to do this and thus clear someone fast there is new datum on havingness its relation to create after you create something you may have it or not create doesnt necessarily mean that youll have all of auditing could be considered prehavingness hence the prehav scale the relationship between creating and havingness has to do with the fundamental formation of the reactive bank and is very important what person cant have he creates that is the law on which man operates it is the most fundamental law of the bank that has yet been discovered this is how the bank is formed eg whenever italy gets beaten they have renaissance or like when you abuse plant it blooms lrh wanted ship and couldnt buy one so he started to build one if rosebush cant have rose if you trim it off it creates roses if shipyard cant have ships it builds ships that wear out in twenty years so you cant have the ships either probably the government punishes everyone for producing in order to make them produce on reactive basis 56theres evidently some crossrelationship that goes further than the ow mechanism it was described in theory in scientology 88008 plus in the discussion of games conditions in the fundamentals of thought games conditions concern preventing people from having things things of all sorts are havingness the thetan is only unhappy when he cant have his idea of quality could be reformed if you deny him anything hell try to obtain it eg the prohibition now lrh knows how to make civilization decide what would be good things to have and create knuckleheaded bureaus to prevent each one of them the trouble with economics is that it tries to create demand with supply it should use scarcity how do you create creation run broad cant have the games condition can get so bad that if you insist on people having something they dont want it police action creates crime bbc creates rock and roll as long as you arent in games condition with the people around you as long as you dont run cant have or must have on them and still have control all will be smooth sailing its supposed to be good thing on this planet to run cant have eg with strictness but this is the way you create problems problems may appear to be dont haves but how did the pc get into the condition of dont have actually dont have is the last ditch of cant have because even with cant have you could materialize what you dont have maybe even build one but the way you got into dont have was the overtmotivator sequence first you run cant have on others then they dont have then you dont have so if the pc doesnt have anything it must be because he denied it if hes got low quality of something he gets it thus he cant have good one but nobody wants bad one so hes got bad one the test of his havingness is that he has it because nobody wants it if nobody wants it he can have it total lack of something doesnt mean that the thetan is without it itll still be obsessively created in his reactive bank the covert creativity of the bank is remedy of havingness thats all it is now say you run cant have on somebody on sex then you find people running cant have on you on the subject of sex and youre puzzled youll find 2d activities are impossible so youre likely to do flip to go off in some different direction and build up various sorts of 2d activities you could have when these also fail you end up with them hidden from yourself but still created in the bank so we get the downgrading quality the degrade is on the basis of what he can have common denominator of pcs at the bottom is the complaint of not being able to feel bit higher they complain of not feeling as much as theyd like about things thats cant have on feelings also the feelings degrade and go on down the tone scale serenity is impossible so the thetan becomes enthusiastic but thats an overt so he goes down to conservatism but thats for bank managers so he gets bored but people wont let you be bored so down to feelings but of course all these feelings are being mocked up at the back of the bank at the first st hill acc lrh talked about two routes experience and the auditing route used at that time they are now combined because the experiential factor is havingness experience is havingness so all experience can be restored beingness and doingness can be junior to havingness but cf p 42 at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness which is higher than havingness so maybe lrh is talking about lower level stratum here but beingness and doingness operate on the same cant have mechanism when you hit bottom on your own beingness youll mock up some very desirable beingness and you will be that except that you are not really being that for instance kid isnt permitted to be pilot and fly airplanes so he mocks up being an ace aviator person may end up settling for lesser and lesser beingness finally he is not being much so he mocks up substitute reactive beingness little kids are not permitted to fly planes so what do they do they become aviators what confuses people is that while cant have produces create at reactive level all this can take place at an analytical level not all cant haves trigger the obsessive create but if you communicate the cant have in an unacceptable cant have way in good games condition the guy may well slip into the reactive create absence of arc is almost requisite for reactive creation by reason of cant have if you run strong cant have on war in the interests of peace war will result keeping the peace is not done by running cant have on war by propaganda etc for instance at the outset of world war ii information was given out about the war it was not considered ok to attack the enemy yet we did get ourselves into it when people run cant have on things that do exist we get delusory state christian science does this try running 8c on christian scientist the insistence of thetan on axiom 1 is fantastic 57on some people if you try to run think process they cant do it these people must have an ow games condition on thoughts because they cant have thought if someone withholds thought hes running games condition on you on the subject of you cant have it this will put him in condition where he has less of it if you can get off his withholds ie get him to give you the thought youve stopped him from playing that game condition and hell feel better but why does he have these discreditable things anyway because they are scarce if thought is scarce there has been cutdown of thought of activity so the person withholds telling you about actions agains the mores of society because such actions are scarce if you can get hold of one its his jewel scarcity he also holds onto it because he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts about him this is another games condition to handle this you could run cant have process on thoughts theoretically 1 what thought havent you permitted another to have 2 what thought hasnt another permitted you to have you could see another mechanism from another theoretical process you run think of say woman at first he gets generality or nothing then he thinks of specific departed women then dead women sick women funerals too you are making him examine the scarcity of women and it runs backwards to the point where he could think of present woman with perfect ease and get 3d picture of her whatever it is you find him inverted or nonexistent on you develop process by which you can discharge his propensity for using that item in games condition on others and they on him because you are running out stable data on this you add confusion problem or motion along with it for instance you could use when have you denied another woman when has another denied you woman what problem about women is not present now the not present now is because it is the notis version of problem confront this is murderous process because it unnotises everything involved games condition is unnatural since in such condition the person becomes convinced that there is only that game so they run the cant have and the more they do this the less they have of it eventually it disappears from view and they have gotten worse not better way back people wouldnt clear because they thought it meant losing their game when cleared they promptly went out and aberrated themselves again to have game they expressed it as i didnt want to be detached from existence what pinned it down was scarcity of games they thought being aberrated was the only game going the remedy of havingness of games is broadening the pcs view on the subject of games all you have to do is knock out his fixed attention on aberrated games so that he can look around at all the other games if you do this the pc will blow clear almost at once 6107c19 shspec31 q and period auditor effect on meter read stage four needle often sits around clear read but the pc is dead thetan it has about 2 12 inch swing it goes up sticks unlike the fn and drops back it keeps doing it matter what the auditor does the pc wont read on sec check ruds or anything its an electronic transfer of energy in the mind machine reaction the person distrusts himself to such degree that he has become machine machines are run by energy you are seeing something like an ac motor feeding its current on surge and then reversing its flow repetitively this is charge line the only thing that can change it is auditing the person is total noresponsibility case he knows he can have effect on anything cchs undercut it best think processes are not very effective because this kind of pcs thought has effect on the bank the common denominator of all cases is the degree of effect the thetan has on his bank this ranges from absolute zero to total easy effect on the bank the stage four needle is retreat from the bottom some buttons are still open problems confusion motion leaving or something on such case all you have to do is to trigger one of his automaticities and let it run off the case giving the guy more control over his bank you are not at this stage really asking the pc to do anything there such thing as spook stage four needle turned on by the auditors statement it doesnt matter what the auditor says this is very common third of pcs have it thats you energizing the bank you can have more effect on the bank than the pc has this is something auditors find hard 58to duplicate being sold on the idea that the pc is responsible for it all they cant see the pcs pictures so they dont believe it sometimes the spook stage four needle confuses you when doing sec check the impact of your thinkingness and speakingness will activate the bank this is the lowest reaction below lie reaction or reverse lie reaction if youre sec checking pc his level of interest rises and creates an emergency level so dont avoid reaction on the needle just because the pc has one of these automatic reactions on the needle at first when you ask meaty questions hes right in there reacting so any reaction on sec check question that might be meaningful is always taken by the auditor as factual providing its an instant read stage four needle probably isnt an exception to this complicated question might not be duplicated as asked so 34 sec lag could still be an instant read anything more than one second lag is totally useless cant have is not prerequisite for creating only for unknowing creation nearly everyone whos studied the mind has studied only the analytical mind were looking at reactive mind laws but even this response was originally an analytical response all reactive responses were originally analytical one can just decide to create something knowingly this other law works this way one day you get picture of rhinoceros in front of you because someone somewhere prohibited you from having rhinoceroses but you arent aware of ever having wanted one this explains the mysterious appearance of mental image picture which has been hitherto unexplained it also explains some strange desire to make or do something someone has run cant have on you but most creativeness is spontaneous and able analytical reactive creativeness is generally terrible there is such thing as negative sec check to handle notis in the pc you can knock the withhold into existence by asking questions which asis the notis eg when havent you stolen something then you could ask the the positive question emeters can be pushed around by pcs but the reactions look different from reactive reads it looks like body motion jerky if pc is worried about pushing around the meter hes 1 not in session 2 got withholds 3 he wants to impress the auditor its what the pc doesnt know about that moves the needle the remedy is to handle ruds vitamins to be taken during an intensive dianazene used for radiation sickness has iron in it vitamin b1 100 mg guk dicalcium phosphate fifteen grains about one gram vitamin c 250 mg nicotinic acid 100mg iron you can run out all sunburns radiation flash burns etc this can turn skin cancer on and off when sunburn turned on with this you will see flush in the shape of bathing suit likewise not smoking enough will cause lung cancer guk makes the pc work better for the first 57 minutes after taking it the reason for the calcium is the b1 finds calcium somewhere in the body guk also helps nightmares itll run engrams through all by itself b1 also robs the body of ascorbic acid so you have to replace this too 6107c20 shspec32 games conditions games condition means an agreement of cant have amongst beings its have for self and cant have for others in true games condition but as an agreement its cant have on all flows its agreement that nails it in concrete widespread cant have agreement gives you lots of mass for instance the christian prohibition on sex which is very fundamental as cant create bodies are necessary as favorite vehicles and identities but theres penalty in the christian system for creating them this results in mustmust not it is in the field of disagreement and can be processed in various ways but how did you get suckered into position like this where you could accumulate motivators like this you must have been party to the cant have somewhere along the line you cant suffer any 59consequences you had hand in creating and you must have done it by agreement with lot of others with the disagreement youre objecting to the game you helped to create in the first place if you get the disagreement off you get considerable resurgence you could undercut it by getting all the agreements to have the game games condition process seeks to isolate the basic agreements on some kind of game games condition is derogatory term it means package consisting of fixated attention inability to escape coupled with inability to attack to the exclusion of other games theres nothing wrong with having games but game condition is unknown arbitrary reactive performed outside ones choice without his consent or will its sort of mental doingness trap in it youve got to do things assume certain beingness and have communication with anyone not part of the game the world thus becomes massless timeless spaceless and peopleless very rapidly most marriages that go on the rocks are in games condition where theres total agreement that neither one can have anything overlaid with another set of agreements that are in disagreement with that fundamental cant have agreement their tenderest moments are when theyre in disagreement with the basic agreement of cant have this gives us interesting maxims like hell hath fury like woman scorned which reflects the later disagreement when two people get this fixated the rest of the world ceases to exist they just stay with each other and shut out the rest of the world games conditions can exist on any dynamic wars are an example on the third or fourth dynamics one can find portions of the track where one has repeatedly gotten into the same game eg defending the capitol by being part of an interceptor squadron shooting down or being shot down by the enemy right over the middle of the airport this was games condition because it was an unknowing fixated activity it did nothing effective for the society the clue to games condition is that the person is doing compulsive confront that makes it necessary for him to assume compulsive beingness in order to play this game one must deny certain havingness the us has in its last two wars demonstrated itself to be in war games condition because it cannot have the fruits of any of its victories in games condition matter what the person says he always ends up with havingness so you get an obsessive beingness and doingness and cant havingness everybody has few games conditions few have complete games conditions going the latter are in the spin bin when you see one of these games conditions it defies all logic because its obsessive it has nothing to do with the real world this is true of all aberration its out of pt the rationale which rationalizes games condition has holes in it but dont try to argue someone out of it audit him out of it you cant educate someone out of games condition because its aberrated and he cant look at it analytically the situation of person who cant influence his bank with thinkingness is interesting the gradient scale of less effectiveness in this regard ends in effectiveness if you give such person an auditing command he doesnt do it and even if he did do it it would have effect on the bank such person breaks auditors hearts and gives people loses it is of interest to understand the anatomy of this phenomenon which exists to some degree in all cases since clearing person means putting him in control of the bank weve been working on the question of how person could get into condition where they could not affect the bank since 1954 the answer is withholds the fellow is backing out of life hes withholding as part of games condition denying something to someone else the withhold gives him cant reach pullback multiply this by lot of instances and you find that eventually the person practically exits from the dynamics but this is really not possible to do so he inverts on them as far as hes concerned his effort is to leave compounded with the withhold and notreach thus you get an ineffectiveness you cant control something you cant reach and from which you are withholding yourself the mustnt reach is really mustnt be reached of course this is true especially when there is punishment involved punishment compounds withholds so as we go downscale on reach we get 1 ineffectiveness 2 destructiveness the pc cant communicate with something well enough to understand it so when he does reach he can only be destructive 3 inability even to destroy something 4 inability to have any influence at all of any kind 605 inability even to affect his own mind add up all these withholds and cant haves on all dynamics and you get someone whos totally withdrawn individuated totally ineffective on his own bank when he runs cant have on people he makes them less familiar and more withdrawn from things then by the overtmotivator sequence this reacts on him so he stops reaching and starts withholding at 100 withhold or 100 withdraw he cant influence anything including his thoughts and bank if he reads on the meter you know something is effecting his bank dont be amazed if the pc has never noticed really the condition hes in he cant think or rationalize on the subject he will buy wrong whys on it readily so if you run command that you havent tested for read you are doing something adventurous since if it didnt read youre in an area where hes still totally ineffective or totally effective pc can be compulsively exterior the detached case freud could never help this kind of case thats someone who is backed out of the dynamics and backed out of his head people will tell you they feel detached that indicates games condition in the area where they feel detached most homosexuals are detached in this sense in any area person is in games condition about he is detached how do you reverse the games condition find something that reads on the emeter and is therefore something he can effect ie something real to the pc real means can the pc be effective in that sphere get the pcs withholds and cant have off the subject on gradient scale you take off the games condition and the pc can now reach in the area and regain effectiveness its basically idiotically simple but if you violate that doingness you dont get results in auditing say you want to cure psychosomatics with auditing you can find people who are so much the effect of their psychosomatics you can have more effect on them than the they can you can make them well but they dont know it so they never thank you for getting well what you should do to avoid this situation is to assess all the persons difficulties get the best read get off all the persons withholds on the area get the games conditions in the area cured and the difficulty will right itself you can eradicate illness and upsets but you have to assess them first the fact that the pc complains about something all the time doesnt prove anything it could be circuit or mechanism or it could be part of some other games condition there is gradient scale of difficulties the pc may have lots of them but may be effective only in one area thats where you must start thats been the barriered line on healing and help if you run command that doesnt read the pc is ineffective in the area therefore its auditor vs the pcs bank with help from the pc hell be arc breaky hard to audit because youre just auditing bank and the pc isnt there this violates the basic auditing principle auditor plus pc is greater than the bank 6108c03 shspec33 creation and goals the earliest unanswered question in dianetics and scientology is why does thetan mock up bad pictures its remained unanswered all these years you almost never find anyone with fixed pleasure moment old validation processing was productive of more grief charges etc validation processing validation effort processing this consists of discovering moments when the preclear is successfully approaching goals when he is successfully exerting an effort when his selfdetermined effort is winning 5110cm01 octser october series selfdeterminism effort processing plus validation straightwire the theory of which was to validate all the good moments of the preclears past by having him recall them ability major 5 ability straightwire page 7 what is this fixation on death disaster and invalidation one theoretical possibility is that hes getting even hes been made to produce so he mocks up bad production mechanically of course its something he hasnt asised because its unpleasant etc but why did he agree to those mechanics in the first place he makes an original agreement then revolts against it maybe hes been made to produce lots of good things so he revolts with this mechanism so when hes called upon to mock up something good he mocks up something bad this may happen on 11 level this can be seen running pleasure moments when the pc slips into the badness of it all assuming that the fellow is in revolt this can be very overt hitoned or covert eg not producing but having excuses for failure or forgetting to do it at all the latter is lower harmonic of direct refusal occlusion is this level of revolt and we let people get away with it for instance hitlers around somewhere and we allow him to get away with having forgotten who hes 61been i cant is covert i wont the mechanism is so lost it has become way of life not revolt any more the guy just mocks up bad pictures and forgets some civilizations on the track were really productioncrazy eg arslycus where the thetans were actively producing mocking up matter you couldnt get away there were entrapment mechanisms production got bad name because it was production against power of choice over production the bank dramatizes this creation against the wish to create the fellow doesnt want to mock up the bank so he mocks up the bank his will to create has been badly overwhelmed partly because he overwhelmed others will to create arslycus eventually fell apart some worker invented disintegration so that it could happen this was the only possible response to outcreate with new idea something worse than what was happening to them creation gets bad name from enforced creation theres another side to it lrh has been unhappiest when hes produced so much that he gluts the market others decide theyve been out created and they get unhappy too thats not so upsetting whats so upsetting is not having any market for your creation observers audience etc and not having it wanted one does want ones creations to be admired if you are made to produce when you dont want to or if you think there will be appreciation of your production you will generally produce an overt product one can also think that good creation in some field will bring one into state of victimization or some unpleasant consequence in this case one retreats saying i cant or i dont have any talent or i havent been educated in 1948 the answer to why does thetan create bank was that he creates something with resonance between his own tone and what he creates in the bank this is not the whole story though an individual mocks up or doesnt in an effort to prevent his will from being overthrown on the subject of creation he gets mechanisms to inhibit creativeness in order to protect his self determinism these mechanisms are what we run into in processing this is why creative processing works but it is also why some pcs eventually dreamed up that the bank gets solid the mechanism was already there methods of denying creation are the most fundamental thing youre dealing with in processing we have to figure out what the guys afraid of and disarm it on that angle so what is he afraid of hes afraid of being made to do you can substitute do for create to avoid some mine fields he considers there are bad consequences to doing he considers that you have to hit thetan to get him to create this is an oldold consideration it explains things like the high birth rate amongst the lower classes it also explains waiting until the last moment to write paper and the artistic temperament and why artists seek out sps if someone hits you youll make picture of it this explains to everyone that hes victim he has been made to create and he is following the law that the best way to keep from being hurt is to create this keeps you from being beaten the most involved point in an engram is where the fellow thinks he has mocked up the engram in full which should keep him from further injury then gets hit again by something else so he mocks that up too and then theres more injury or something which defeats him his best answer to blow was to create that used to get him off the hook then he suffers defeat and an invalidation of the mechanism of creation as defense then comes total notis of engrams which is another defeat and the disappearance of earlier engrams people with invisible fields have gotten to chronic state of believing it wont do any good to create this all sums up to the thetans responses to the accumulation of all the times his choice was overwhelmed someones choice is overwhelmed so he responds in some way in downscale attempt to make his postulates stick which he never gives up trying to do the basic assumption of thetan and the first thing he wants to do is the communication formula axiom 10 its the most fundamental game in the interrelationship of thetans anyway from there on he just wants to make his postulates stick when he fails to create an effect he will still try to create an effect by mocking stuff up routine 3 goals processing is effective because you are looking over all the powers of choice he has hoped to effect most of which have failed and running out his failed powers of choice running goals is sneaky way of getting at what postulates he would like to make stick by asking what conditions he was trying to bring about the bank is the mechanisms of all sorts that tend to defend his assertions of self though the effect of these mechanisms is to make mess of the pc the disintegration of his postulates is whats wrong with him his reaction to this is surprisingly extreme but the bank is still trying to have the effect the basic of the chain is an overt which is why overts work so well in processing someone who is obsessively protecting anything has overts on it he is still trying to make his basic postulate of effect on stick however why does he make the original overt postulate he has gotten into games condition on creation thats why he has been creating 62against someone else gets lose on making nothing of the opponents creation so he overts against it early on the track thetans specialized in goofy games and got into forgetting what they were doing so there seems to be something wrong in the field of postulates theoretically you could run pc on what effect could you actually create this doesnt work because it is too direct it goes straight through the mine field to the pc it seems unreal he cant do it modifying it to what decision would it be all right for you to make would be more workable thetan must have feeling that there are motions and confusions he cannot tolerate so he avoids them with mechanisms of creation if persons tolerance for motion and randomity is raised his fears of consequences of the overthrow of his power of choice are reduced most fundamentally obtaining tolerance for motion and catastrophe would wash away the fear of fear the creation of confusion is the last echelon of postulate the last echelon of confusion is the creation of confusion by omission so were on safe ground with pcs if we stress creation of confusions especially by omissions so you could use the process if you said nothing what confusion would occur or what notdoingness would create confusion cases that dont move are the roughest ones in catatonia we have the last desperate effort of thetan to make postulate stick somewhere its notdoingness theres probably such thing as thetan whod not trying to do something all thetans are busy if only trying to do things through omission thus in asking for goals we should ask for failed goals secret goals withheld goals etc since that leads straight to old postulates pc can be so confused on the blowcreate theory that just being talked to by the auditor can cause him to create something or below that hell mock up nothing while in session and get lots of ideas about it out of session ron handled this with short sessioning the pc would hand up his case right after session then lrh would begin new session and handle it at this level the pc is on total reverse he creates when hes not supposed to and doesnt create when hes supposed to occlusion is the last answer the last attempt to create an effect an overt of omission here you could use some far south process as what confusion wouldnt occur if you forgot this might get through to him if hes on failed forget so the dwindling spiral of creation or postulates is 1 postulate 2 failed postulate 3 creation 4 failed creation 5 creation of confusion 6 creation of confusion by omission 7 notised creation of confusion by omission tolerance of confusions problems motion etc is fine but failed postulates is what you are trying to get with goals processing you can also get this effect if you ask pc what he hopes would happen if he kept on doing what he was doing if he cant answer you can undercut it with what wont happen what shows up here will be caution which seems laudatory but hell begin to realize something will happen too as you get the notis off you could run off intentional overts with what would or wouldnt be damaged if you forgot it they are both aimed at getting the effect hes trying to produce or you could use what damage would forgettingness cause youre running ow crossed with forgettingness etc this is all at high level of theory its road parallel to the one through the minefield even if you cant get the exact road 6108c04 shspec34 methodology of auditing notdoingness and occlusion 63its impossible to have judgment in auditing if ones trs are out and one is worried about making mistakes in application of the tech on running brackets problem may be that the outer legs of the bracket may not be real to him at first reality on these legs may develop as he runs the process this happens because of the dynamics as he is audited the pc gains reality on the other dynamics besides the first dynamic the pcs ability to reach is directly reflected in his ability to conceive of someone else having an idea or action so as you run the process the command you started with can be too narrow and limiting as the pcs ideas reach further and the commands could need to be enlarged more legs could be added each leg of the command stands as an individuated unit without interchange among legs each in fact could be run as an individual command in view of the fact that it doesnt harm anybody to run an unreality as long as they are moving towards reality it would be ok to run all legs of the bracket from the outset try to choose bracket and command wordings all of which fall remember that if you choose command that restricts the pc you limit his gains also the pc will tend to look at the legs not being run as his reality comes up he will have to withhold himself from those areas tending to put them on automatic an auditing command can be broadened it shouldnt be made more particular and specific if in doubt take the broadest form and run it from the outset running one which is too restricted can turn on somatics its legitimate to change the targets flows etc but not the basic form dont change how to when or could to would you can drop portions of the command too as long as in so doing you are removing particularization when the pc gets very free on flows you can drop out the legs and go to the simplicity of eg get the idea of verb an aberration is located as total imprisonment total individuation auditing commands resolve the degree of imprisonment and individuation as the degree lessens you may lose ta on one leg of the process but now have it elsewhere the ta ceases to move when the targets of the process are flat so the rule is before leaving the command check it out for all variations which might produce new action remember that the reactive mind is an idiot so you could miss something because of wrong pronoun or whatever the biggest barrier in dissemination is notdoingness and misdoingness there is an old unresolved philosophic question about the value of notdoingness to do or not to do which is better the active or the passive life if you do you get into trouble if you dont do you get into trouble theres confusion on either side for instance lrh had problem as writer whether to be super nasty if he was criticized or to be nice and let himself be criticized thus protecting his markets and friends there are contradictory lessons in this of course neither answer is right the missing datum is that they are both overts longest continuous overt is notdoingness have you ever noticed the randomity that can be produced by missing datum in problem false datum can cause some confusion but look at what missing datum on the subject of the mind has done how about missing beingness this is nearultimate in notdoingness the ultimate of course is forgetting youre not only doing nothing youre not there to do it and youve forgotten this really produces confusion thetan never ceases to try to have an effect on something to put axiom 10 in effect matter how many trillenia have gone by you are trying to process someone who is in the middle of 10000 continuous overts of omission doing something is apparently the least damaging type of overt thus withhold seems to be the more therapeutic side of ow its his notdoingness which weighs on his case doingness and notdoingness are not data of comparable magnitude notdo is enormously greater thats why people who stop doing even if what they have been doing is nasty crash when they stop thats also why men die before women underneath it all thetan knows hes important to life and knows its an overt not to participate the only greater overt is to forget this is still an attempt to create an effect so theres gradient scale of effect creation 1 you do something to have an effect axiom 10 2 you create an effect by not doing something 3 you create an effect by being absent 4 you create an effect by forgetting 64what degree of randomity could you produce by forgetting whole lifetime quite bit and its an overt and the fellow realizes its an overt thats the reason for whole track occlusion the overt of forgetting the law behind all this is that the thetan never ceases to have an effect on those targets he has chosen and the only thing that could ever pry him loose from those fixated effects is something like scientology he is imprisoned to the degree that he is still trying to have hopeless effect on something he is his own jailer forgetting it prevents it from ever being asised if ow can stall case how much more can it be stalled by not being there the withhold of self how much can it be stalled by withhold from self and being there and from doingness and from the subject and from any knowledge of the subject and from any communication with any beingness of the subject etc thats why the more occluded case is the harder it is to audit so you run cases on what wouldnt you mind forgetting this gets off withholds or as general pattern for command what confusion wouldcould forgettingness create weve looked on forgettingness as sort of passive thing weve looked on notdoingness as the natural state of beingness seeing them as overts opens up new zones for processing 6108c08 shspec35 forgettingness the reactive mind is basically that area of occlusion which the pc is unable to contact and which contains total identification of all things with all things and until released into the realm of havingness continues to react upon the person compelling him into actions dramatizations and computations which are not optimum to survival we find in the reactive mind all the residual not asised material which the individual is seeking to avoid all the discreditable things of his existence are then contained in this area he hangs onto them the knucklehead he has various mechanisms of survival connected with this one being the justification of the aberrations he has psychology makes the error of saying that one is only able to create by virtue of ones reactive mind faculty psychology c the 1500s was an attempt to understand perception and the mind they didnt get anywhere because they dealt with the analytical sphere and got confused by the fact that men dont always react rationally behaviorism overlooks the unpredictabilities of men when they dont follow the stimulusresponse mechanisms until scientology theory about man was too precious not to be carefully guarded from attack men went to the stake to protect the theory of faculty psychology they threw away case histories to protect the theory of behaviorism the abundance or scarcity of all things applies theories were terribly scarce in scientology we are looking at an abundance of theories what we care about is what works former theorists didnt care whether their theories were workable or not they just felt they should protect the theory the cure of reactive bank is knowingness because the substance of the bank is notknowingness theres fourth postulate remember the third was forget it is senior its been stressed that one should run that rather than remember in order of making the four postulates are 0 native state potentiality of knowing everything 1 first postulate not know 2 second postulate he had to know something 3 third postulate he forgot what he knew 4 fourth postulate remember thetan does this on any given subject when you enter school you start by postulating you know nothing about the subject thats really request to find something you dont know in other schools youre asked to notknow and then learn lot of nonsense the only thing that ever blows up false theory is the workability of countertheory we know more about the unpredictable side of man than any other body of people on earth so any breakthrough we make in the area is valuable the breakthrough is in the area of forgettingness and 65confusion man wants things to be forgotten he not only uses forgettingness as continuous overt act he wants forgettingness to occur he wants all his evil deeds to be wrapped in the stygian darkness of yesteryear man is basically good so it his deeds are considered bad then theres only one cure for them that he knows to forget them so as an auditor you can ask what should be forgotten hell recover almost at once screaming impulse to make something forgotten and that is where his volition and the reactive mind cross his volition desires occlusion back of all his confusion is knowable volition he wishes forgettingness to occur and that wish creates reactive bank that is the postulate that comes ahead of everything he must forget so it can be reached with what should be forgotten theres danger that this will become forgotten point of scientology the postulate it must be forgotten must be the most forgotten of all postulates so it must be the one least able to be asised and thus best suited to accumulate the concatenation of bank the hidden standard is cousin to this you can handle the hidden standard by asking what is hidden about it or what should be forgotten about it and it blows the pcs attention frees up and he knows processing works for him you can ask what would have to happen for you to know scientology works strip all the motion out of the needle and youll have list of hidden standards more details on running of this any psychosomatic or livingness difficulty person has is difficulty because theres something about it he doesnt want known and he wants others to forget it compulsive rememberingness brings about forgettingness one pulls it in with the must have on remembering which postulates the likelihood of forgetting and vice versa someone who goes off to the south seas so as to forget first tries to forget with women then with liquor dope then death but all his urgency to forget keeps it there he pushes one button and gets the other this develops an awful confusion which is then buried with death and occluded forming the stimulus response mechanism of the reactive mind because his power of choice and his postulates are being overwhelmed even if its him whos overwhelming them restoration of memory on the whole track is the index by which you can measure case gain most easily if someone doesnt think hes lived before hes heavily plowed into forgettingness while the guy who has only delusory recall on track is doing pretended knowingness of the whole track this is games condition of magnitude its denying knowingness by giving false knowingness its forgetting and remembering at the same time very confusing and irritating to confront the irritation comes from ones awareness of the games condition putting you into the position of being an unwilling opponent if it goes on long enough your own occlusion is assisted the target is to occlude your track by giving false knowingness about theirs confusion asks itself to be forgotten because it was never remembered that is it is notknown thats what makes confusion confusion 6108c11 shspec38 basics of auditing matter of factness lot of auditors are doing something besides auditing they are pressing through introducing something in an effort of make auditing work probably its because of lrh saying that the auditor has to make the auditing work that he should be on the ball etc certain apathy about results creates in itself grind atmosphere desperation or apathy alike are counterproductive lrh audits with doubt about what hes doing withdraw question about purpose his auditing is very matteroffact because he has doubt that he can help the pc doubt about the effectiveness of the process hes going to run doubt about the fact that the process is working so he has relaxedness about auditing that gives him results five times as fast because he doesnt get in his own road the reason an auditor doesnt flatten process is anxiety to get the job done which gets in the way of getting the job done lrh doesnt artificialize the way he feels about the pc he keeps it real unlike other auditors whom he heard being stilted and artificial be effective help the pc dont be hidebound this should give faster results more easily notknow and forget would have run out engrams in 1950 if they had been used then this would have avoided lot of grinding and sweat youd use command form which includes as many dynamics as necessary eg what should remain unknown about this to the public the government family your superiors etc the occlusions that auditors were struggling with were the result of 66selfmotivated efforts to withhold the hangups in any engrams are from desire to make these things parts of the engram unknown or forgotten the pretense of knowing about it dubin also blows on the notknow processing running engrams should not be discounted as of benefit to the case if you get someone clear and stable they may still find themselves with an engram there it wont take long to run it since hes clear during stabilization theyre unsnarling track they are still bumping into things which can be run using notknow on it makes it run even faster since it pops the sticky point into view application of notknow to goals processing 6108c17 shspec41 rudiments and valences an emeter ceases to register in the presence of an outrudiment this may fool you into thinking process is flat if you get the rudiments in the process will again move the ta and needle keeping rudiments in is the most important part of auditing you can find the rudiment because only the out rud will move the meter details on goals running valence is synthetic beingness or beingness which pc is not but thinks he is it can be duplicate of any existing beingness or synthetic beingness created by what others have said about the other beingness there is such thing really as ones own valence his own valence is just himself hes either himself or in valence valence is package graph is picture of valence and any change you got was because you shifted his valence this is very important datum the pc will not gain in any way through any effort to alter the characteristics of valence hes in the pc will only change if you change the valence as whole package because the pc takes responsibility for any of the nowimsupposedtos or the package of characteristics which is the valence all the person can reach is knowingness of the identity of the valence what does the pc use the valence for survival the road out surmounted by knowingness valence is solid knowingness body is solid knowingness valence is an effort to get someone to know you are there to get someone to recognize something therefore they are road out of unwanted areas say soldier gets hit with mortar shell he doesnt want to be there hes in the wrong valence that knowingness valence is now invalidated and becomes notknowingness so he exteriorizes and decides that the only way to fight war is to be general or war correspondent if he cant be that hell keep on trying war after war life after life finally he gets it together and becomes very successful at it then he finds all war correspondents being shot for fomenting war as he is shot he decides hell be mata hari he gets female body moves on up the line becomes mata hari in war after war then eventually he gets executed for that etc these are all efforts to solve the problem of what to do in war every valence picked up is an effort to solve problem valences are antiquated solutions so you can say these identities are antiquated solutions to confusions the goals which go towards beingness are the more definite goals they are the more profitable ones in auditing because they go toward identity person is not himself he is in different knowingness as soon as hes in valence you can fix up valences broken leg as long as its valence that isnt supposed to have broken leg which is why you can do assists on almost anyone the only person it will fail on is someone who has nowimsupposedto of valence the pc has control over this any pc is being dominatedly in given valence but may be tortured or upset by other valences which are only really the concern of the valence he is mainly in so any pcs troubles are only the troubles of the valence hes in the troubles are part of the nowimsupposedtos of this valence so theres way to remedy the difficulties on the valence because they are outside the power of the pc to touch here you get the oddity of please audit but youd better not make well thats what it looks like the valence may have somatics turning on and off as part of the package which keep the valence from becoming something else the pc will keep the somatics to prevent himself from becoming an unworkable solution to future problem dont try to take that solution away from the pc so long as it seems vital that it be solution what youve got to do is to get the pc to face up to the various factors that make that valence you cant make valence well you can move valence so any process run at random on pc has very small chance of success this preselects our bag of tricks to small bag you must ask yourself is this process going to change familiarize accustom the 67person to identity or is it going to handle environments which make identities vital or is it going to alter valences if so it will work and stay working if not it wont what makes valence stick the way it sticks lets newly define psychotic as someone who doesnt know whats going on in his environment and who doesnt know what is going on inside himself its all unknown and unobserved neurosis is when hes got some idea of whats happening in his environment and where he is but this is overbalanced by unknowingness upscale from that you know whats happening where you are but not whats happening inside someone else few feet away you dont always know whats going on with everybody that makes slight unknowingness the stuck parts of your track are the points where you knew what was going on where you were but not what was going on around you because there are points of disagreement there was know facing an unknow the unknow can get so overwhelming that one adopts valence to solve it you pick up valence which knows about these things many scientists are solely being valences of scientists theyve got it confused with the whole track beingness of technician when you see the level of pretense of valence it becomes spotted for you it seems artificial anyone whos identified himself by some set of tricks has thereby put himself in valence the fact that hes in body is an obvious valence but its the valence that hes using the body to be thats the auditing target just having body isnt necessarily valence if hes aware of having body not ploughed in below his level of consciousness as an auditing target valence is the mip package person has composed to solve the problems of existence which he knows nothing about its always easier to pick up weaker valence than stronger one so your logical target in auditing is the weaker one if your pc has bunch of chronic somatics theyre part of the valence picture not part of the pc hes got to have two counteropposed identities in order to feel pain 1957 was when this was worked out to have experience hed have to survive to survive he has to be something other than himself otherwise he cant survive experience and live you havent chance in handling this person until he realizes that he can live without the valence hes been in games condition as valence against some environment which probably longer exists women are particularly confused here because at the present time the society is in flux and has really clear idea of where women fit in so women have more problems finding the valence to solve the problem of situations theyre not really in anyway identity crisis to straighten out case youve got to move valence say fellow has toothache youve got to find out who had toothache c 1950 tech and split the valences this is more effective than putting him in comm with the tooth since its not his tooth whatever his difficulties find out who had it or would do it cf xdn wants handled rundown you could say what beingness would be good solution for tough environment you process whos valences if you want to cure toothache run it back and forth with who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache and get terminal to cure the toothache you already have the goal of course you can also use this technique for the hidden standard for long time we had the question should we handle solids or significances the answer is solids but the further answer is that you shouldnt handle conditions of valence handle the valence this is the limitation of touch assist always handle the terminal this brings prehav 13 into the limelight prehav 13 process which takes list of charged terminals and combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets on levels assessed out see 6106c21 shspec17 or p 42 these notes prehav 13 will also fix up rudiments 6108c18 shspec42 control of attention you might think of auditing as having hundreds of rules as long as you think of it that way you arent auditing these rules are only guideposts back of them your good heart will carry the day you are trying to help the person out all right there are certain things his mind will and wont do if that is what your rules are youre fine rituals as developed by religions represent their failure to communicate the basic truths here is what pc will not do he will not go into session with his attention fixated on something else nor will you have his interest in what you are doing all the rudiments can be covered with is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wont talk to since these questions are little too broad you have the rudiments he can have fixation on ptp of short duration where his attention is fixed on the immediate environment in the 68ptp ld the pc also has his attention fixed on something in pt but he also has something subjective holding his attention something very real to him when you dont parallel what the mind is doing with auditing you fail in auditing the rate of change of attention defines relative pain and the common features of every stuck point on the track is sudden shift of attention this has been known since 1950 at least the processes being used are sufficiently strong that matter what the pcs attention is fixed on you can yank it away but doing so will result in an arc break furthermore his attention wont totally come off what it was on so you will create new identification of what he was looking at and what you pull his attention to you can of course go too far in paralleling the mind and wind up in q and lrh has never seen case progress when the pcs attention on ptps of short or long duration isnt handled if you dont handle attention fixation you eventually get an unexpected attention shift that produces an arc break it isnt the minor flub you make that really causes the arc break though it triggers it the arc break is really caused by yanking the pcs attention off his ptp and you wont find it by running ow on the auditor willing to talk to the auditor is the other requirement for the pc to be in session if the pc has an arc break or withhold his willingness is out with withhold theres another factor the pc is sitting with known where he is and an unknown where the auditor is so the auditing session is ridge in view of the fact that the pcs attention is fixed on the withhold even if only at subawareness level if you audit over it youre guilty of an attention shift the attention fix in withhold is complicated by being an outward fix with an inward pull to keep it from getting out these mechanisms take priority over all of the pcs considerations and postulates so matter what he says you cant go ahead and audit over it i order to audit him youve got to be able to put his attention where you want it if theres distracting noise outside its waste of time to ask if it bothered him you can assume it shifted his attention so ask what were you thinking of when the noise occurred until theres read and the pc feels ok about it anything that happens in the auditing session is the auditors fault if anything goes wrong in session its never the pcs fault if the auditor doesnt tell him how to get his attention off something by some acceptable gradient its not the pcs fault if he cant put it where you want it because you didnt put his attention on the things its on when he comes into session youre slow to take responsibility for taking it off but if the pc doesnt make gains its the auditors fault just as the pc must be gotten to the point where he is at cause over his life because you can get him to erase all the aberrated points in an auditing session there is another cause the auditor this is in violation of the idea that the pc is cause of all effects so youve got to be slippy because you are being cause over section of the pcs track the only way it can happen is for him to have some willingness to do what you want him to do so his cause must still be there and your direction of his cause must be acceptable to him otherwise he wont be cause over that section of track called an auditing session and if he isnt cause over it hell make gain so to keep him at cause you audit him with all his attention on the auditing not splintered elsewhere he must willingly follow your direction and have clear view of what hes doing you assume incorrectly that the pc is delicate but in fact the only thing you can really do to pc thats bad is not to give him win which can only be done by violating his attention factors auditing in the absence of the pcs attention is auditing how do you keep his attention keep the ruds in the earliest method of clearing was highly permissive and very delicate it amounts to this repetitive question what picture would it be safe to look at the reason it was longer being done by 1950 was this attention factor it hadnt been isolated so it couldnt be articulated also everybody kept dictating what picture the pc should look at but you could clear someone with that process and it would not be long route you can speed it up by getting him to use other perceptics eg what sound would it be safe for you to hear etc people who dont get any pictures are just stuck in pt to avoid looking at the disaster just earlier but you can work him around until he can confront the bank this approach didnt run into the attention problem because its so permissive it lets the pc put his attention where it already is it does take gentle smooth auditing and it takes quite awhile the engram necessary to resolve the case is actually just the picture the pc is stuck in so you are essentially running what picture would it be safe to look at 69now it goes faster you handle his attention gently unstick it from ptps and arc breaks give him wins and confidence dont get into games conditions with him on goals or terminals if the session goes awry its because you missed an attention factor try to get subjective reality on this if the pc says yow yow yow arc break you say what was your ptp 6108c22 shspec43 ptps unknownnesses details on goals running normally pc is arc breaky because he is being audited over undetected ptps which he will not is in order to get auditing the auditor should suspect it for instance when auditing an executive it is problems alone which give you this terrific timelessness they show up as sticky meter an unchanging graph slow reaction time not moving around much in life problems stick and float forward in time and the guy is stuck in past moment another useful definition of problem is unknown problem is an accumulation of notknowingnesses and consideration of the person as to the value of the notknownnesses remember that the thetan is stuck to his bank valences etc by mystery mystery is the glue of life if you want freedom you must restore knowledge if you want slavery establish ignorance create notknows so common denominator of all problems is an unknown problem cannot exist in the absence of unknowingness as the dianetic axiom puts it randomity can be caused by missing datum axiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data mans difficulties were getting more and more involved because of the missing data technology about man based on the fundamental missing datum what is mans nature or what is man trying to do when the pc runs describe the problem he may well be giving lots of aspects of the basic unknown problem if you run unknownness on the subject of problems you cut through to this central problem rapidly thetan is mystery sandwich two way comm is an inquiry of the pc as to what is going on and an invitation for him to look at it it should be limited to such questions as how are you doing whats worrying you what is that all about processes arent two way comm process is involved in two way comm except 2wc if you start process be sure you flatten it this datum has never varied it applies to running unknownness of problems its ok to handle ptp by asking what unknown is connected with it this runs ptps fast use any version of the oddnumbered postulates notknow forget doubted pretended dont use 2wc to handle problems you dont have to be repetitive get all versions of notknow off of it more details on running of ptps routine 1a consists of everything you can think of in terms of problems processes it gives total ability to confront problems without being upset by the unknownness of them man doesnt like having to confront the unknowns of life its hard to do because there is nothing there to confront were back to processing loss when you process unknowns since loss is notknow so someone with lots of problems experiences sense of loss what is so maddening about loss is that you dont know what is happening with the thing lost the pc will misassign causes of loss too because some terminal is gone and there is lots of unknownness on it the guy will go to the bottom of the prehav scale and pretend some knowingness and pretend cause the two are closely associated it makes someone who is real inventor feel strange when he gets down to the inventors club and the others know all about it and invented it two years earlier someone in that state cant duplicate if they were asked what did you invent theyd answer with some irrelevance so thats good rebuttal pretended knowingness and pretended cause are blood brothers and continually come up together this is at the bottom of the notknow scale because it is substitute know the way you handle it is not direct you go at it by way of problems the guy has had so many problems he has begun to substitute false solutions those are the pretended knowingnesses you see on the case so you dont process the pretended knowingnesses you process the problems and the pc will fly you enter at the level of reality of what problem is and the false solutions and pretended cause fade out flattening routine 1a means getting the guy comfortable confronting unknowns then he wont be obsessively escaping from them and longer experiencing lot of anxiety about them cf alan watts the wisdom of insecurity jealousy is basically an inability to confront the unknown the 70sickness one experiences with it is not because of betrayal it is just another aspect of the unknown of faithfulunfaithful or something they know that i dont etc why does case suddenly dive into the middle of the bank and refuse to come out the guy is unable to not ask why theres an unknown in the incident the guy gets some glimmer of the unknown and he dives into it he cannot confront an unknown and becomes hectic at the idea that an unknown exists the oddity is that all knowingnesses are invented knowingnesses with sn inability to confront the unknown you eventually get an inability to confront the known then this goes down to an inability to confront at all so any little tiny incident of the day becomes problem he dwells on so dont judge by the apparent size of the problem whether he will be stuck on it if he cant confront the unknown at all he will be totally glued into all his unknowns all along the track you could run what unknown about an auditing session could you confront would you rather not confront you will solve anybodys difficulties with auditing you could run it on an old timer who doesnt much like auditing anymore or on someone who is having trouble learning to audit etc one old timer would get every pcs somatic because its mystery he instantly snaps terminals with these unknowns this process would blow him out it is very workable specific process it could be used for anyone who has left off doing some formerly successful activity or someone who is having trouble learning something eg language what is unknown about german would handle problems with the german language the treatment of condition is an attempt to alter valence without addressing the valence and this just doesnt work so some process addressed directly at the condition unless it aimed at solids like engrams wont do it address the valence find whose condition it is handle the terminal cf again xdn wants handled rundown long lists of goals wont be that useful but long lists of valences could be out of this you could get process for ptps of long duration ww would have condition what isnt known about that person what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him you would strip off valences and get off problems and ow at the same time if you run lots of notknow youve got to remedy havingness because the whole bank is coming unglued 6108c23 shspec44 basics of auditing the constants of an auditing session are there you must start the session get all the rudiments in at sensitivity 16 we dont use the third of dial drop rule anymore now flatten the process you start and end the session to do this you need to have trs metering etc for pc to be in comm with the auditor it is necessary for the auditor to be in comm with the pc an auditor who would make invalidative comments or not get command across is not there giving session and isnt someone the pc can be in comm with so add to the in session definition that the auditor has to be giving session ie actually running session the way to run session is to run session the limitation on telling someone how to run session involves the amount of disagreement the auditor has with the forms and actions hes using to run the session ones disagreement with handling rudiments could be because of the relative ineffectiveness of the processes but one could also have far more fundamental disagreements eg that the pc shouldnt need auditing it works this way you using the elements of auditing could make anybody an arc breaky pc by running him with ruds out you could get lower scale pc and have propitiative pc if you have difficulty or disagreement with ruds you could produce considerable randomity the key rudiment is the ptp its sneaky because it doesnt necessarily fall at first the pc may have reality on something being ptp to him there is an interesting limiting factor on cases as result of auditing the pc goes into action in his life he then accumulates problems and now is being audited with ptps one of the primary characteristics of case gain is the pc going into action he may lose interest in auditing as result you could expect him to get more problems not less this is the same as with getting more withholds that is another indicator of case advance so dont be lulled by the quiet pc as auditing progresses he may well start having more problems which the auditor must not neglect the mitigating factor here is that as the pc increases his ability he blows these things faster if that isnt happening it must be because ruds are out 71an auditor who expects the pc to be doing something besides being pc is in trouble you must grant the pc his pc beingness its ok for him to have his case in session all pc is supposed to do is follow the session as given by the auditor this is what the auditor expects of him thats all if you grant the pc this beingness youll find auditing simplified because you wont expect him to report on how things are going or whatever its necessary for you to find out whats going on scientologists are understandably prone to run big oughttobe this is fine anywhere but in session the oughttobe gets joined up with probably is supposition which interferes with seeing where the pc really is at the pc could be in sweet old lady mockup but in the valence of space commander if the mockup is factual and the case isnt advancing the factual presentation must have some unknowns in it which must be in wild disagreement cases resolve on the isness of the case not on the oughttobes the isness of the case must be totally unknown if the case isnt resolving and its not what the pc is telling you that is causing his noprogress if you just keep auditing that you are in q and and you wont get result you should question the pc on the basis of what exactly are you complaining about what is the isness of it if something isnt resolving you havent gotten the isness of it the first isnesses you have are 1 session 2 ruds 3 what you are addressing on the case if youve got the isness of the session and the isness of the rudiments and the person continues to complain and you try to help them with certain isness its just probably and isnt the isness if it doesnt help rapidly the most trouble youll have is with ptp ld it can be tricky to get the isness of it we now have test to tell us if process is working anything except 2wc which is just to find out where the pc is at not the 2wc process but just staying in 2wc with the pc is process and you are committed to flattening what you started whether it was in model session or not whether its rudiment or anything else so youd better have good grip on what you start before you start it otherwise youll get unfinished cycles on the pc if you see this you could run prehav 13 on auditors but theres the liability of livening up levels which means youre running terminal which is in wild disagreement with the pcs case and livening up the whole prehav scale details on setting the pc up for goals running the second rudiment is the auditor ninety percent of the charge will be blown on routine 1a but to get the rest you could take up the subject of the auditor if these things are that important to case theyre all worth handling theyre preliminary to clearing as well as to the individual session 6108c24 shspec45 rudiments valence does not respond well to rudiments processing since the rudiments are addressed to changing the conditions of the valence thats limitation of ruds thats one reason its tough to keep the rudiments in its next to impossible since the characteristics of the valence are not owned by the pc none of the valences postulates are his postulates how do you get around this the functional ruds processes are those which can shift or lighten valences the pc long ago lost faith in himself as himself and adopted other beingnesses he reposed his hopes for survival in these other beingnesses and cannot change the conditions of these other beingnesses hes unpredictable to himself because of the valence problem process or routine 1a would have prayer of handling this situation because all valences are accepted by the pc as solutions to some overwhelming problems thats why routine 1a works every rudiments process that separates valences will tend to work you can also use tr1c just to get him in comm with the environment otherwise what will you do youd have to clear him to get ruds in you have to get ruds in to clear him tr 10 would help but very slowly so good valence process for getting in ruds would be who cancant be audited in this room or what couldcouldnt be done in this room also who should you be to be audited or who should i be to audit you these processes key the valences out temporarily its an uphill action but it does shake up or remedy havingness on valences withholds caused him to pick up valences so withholds work on valences pretty directly but you should whipsaw the withhold question around in ruds in the effort to make the pc able to talk to the 72auditor not just willing to talk so see if the pc feels able to talk to you or unable to and why if it is sticky find ww would be able to communicate with an auditor finding the pcs havingness process can help somewhat common denominator of valences is matter energy space and time so any approach to mest eg havingness has some slight power of shifting valence the only way pc can get upset with you on sec check is to leave something incomplete by bypassing question with something still on it youll lose the pcs respect lose your altitude you should always tell the pc the question is hot so that even if you do leave it unflat the pc knows you know so theres missed withhold if you cant strip down question by the end of session let the pc know that you know its not clean if you let him go with the impression that you have let him get away with something hell be arc broken and hard to control interestingly despite the games condition the pc knows that when you lose he loses so use promptertype questions to get the pc really able to talk to the auditor on who would i have to be to audit you and what are you doing you may find the pc doing something else than following the command what you want to find out is whether the pc is willing to be pc and follow the commands or is he going to add something else to it during session you may observe the pc doing something bit odd so you should use some little rudiment like what are you doing or are you willing to be audited pc doesnt mind being nagged its all interest all havingness when it gets grindy in auditing find out what the pc is doing and what is happening you have to avoid upsetting pc who is interiorized but if hes all snarled up in something about the session youd better handle it also pcs sometimes do selfaudit so especially with an old time auditor ask which process you were auditing yourself on is unflat if its very difficult to keep the ruds in ask yourself if you are real to the pc or if he feels theres something else in the session he knows nothing about for instance let the pc know if you missed lunch and that its ok etc its up to the auditor to make himself real to the pc when the rfactor starts to break the pc will start to ask the auditor question about the auditor this shows hes out of session the fastest way to handle the rfactor is to put in the r its almost always all right with the pc when the r disappears its because the auditor is out of session the pc frequently notices it and may well comment then the auditor had better put it right at once it comes as surprise to the auditor to learn that he should be real with the pc all the rules seem to indicate that he should be unreal but there has to be person auditing the pc 6108c29 shspec46 basics of auditing good auditing is not question of memorizing the rules of auditing if you are worried about the rules of auditing theres something basically wrong per the original thesis auditor pc is greater than the bank and the auditor is there to see that auditing gets done to direct the pcs attention so as to confront unknowns to straighten out the bank the less auditing you do or the less effective auditing you do the more upset the pc will be when the auditor sits down in the auditing chair and the pc in the pc chair what contract exists very simple the pc sits down to be audited ie to get on towards clear even if he doesnt know it consciously hes not there to have arc breaks run ptps handled or to straighten out his rudiments in fact ruds go out to the degree that auditing doesnt get done if you use the whole session to put ruds in or if you spend time on it little or auditing gets done somewhere in here is the optimum amount of time spent on ruds say five minutes if you spend most of the session getting ruds in hes got new ptp how to get auditing he doesnt consider ruds to be auditing so hes out of session he thinks auditing is things getting done towards going clear so your main chance is to audit the pc if it gets to choice between auditing and some obscure rud that his attention isnt on to the pc auditing is handling anything his attention is fixed on eg the hidden standard chronic ptps goals etc if you endlessly handle arc breaks you get more because you are creating ptp violating the contract with the pc he will sit there and endlessly run routine 1a because its in the direction of his problems do keep the ruds in but dont make session out of them the pc will protest strongly against handling his minor ptps he assigns high value to his auditing time and wants to use it towards his goal of going clear if an auditor takes positive controlling downtobusiness approach his pcs will swear by him because he audits 73escape as philosophy is complicated subject it has to do with the orientation of an auditor its the only thing that can get in his road as long as he follows scientology and goes on auditing all the levels of the prehav scale have to do with escape if any of them is hot or unflat on auditor youll get the auditor letting the pc escape because its his modus operandi of handling situations its totally wrongheaded as far as getting the pc clear is concerned this is why an auditor doesnt control session when he doesnt he thinks hes being nice to the pc under the same heading comes subjective case reality that is necessary in an auditor what are we looking at when we find scientologist who has never seen or gone through an engram never collided with ridge is not aware of the thenness of incidents if he is not aware of those things he will continue to make mistakes and amount of training will overcome it just knowing this will overcome it if he has never been stuck on the track has never seen ridges its because his basic philosophy of life is escape he doesnt have case reality because hes running from his case his way to handle case is to get out of it so thats all he does with pc so the pc is never in session its pure kindness from the auditors point of view one way to do this is to change the process another is to q and the auditor shortsightedly gives the pc freedom at the price of not getting him clear the auditor who has case reality dramatizes the engram hes stuck in and which hes trying to escape by not confronting when he gets into the engram what hell see is what he looked at to avoid confronting the pain or unpleasantness which he suppressed to escape from it he escapes mentally unconsciousness is an escape it works cf red blanchard and his blackouts this person will have odd somatics and difficulties that he cant account for he cant see the pictures because hes putting his attention on the solution escape all the mechanisms of notis will be present here if he contacts the engram at all itll be very brief he pulls his attention right off of it but he will have somatic that doesnt notis hes stuck in pt which is really the ends of all his engrams so he will keep his pc in pt at all times because the auditor is in pt he wont guide the pcs attention through an engram because escape is the better philosophy theres direct cure for this oneshot process that gives these auditors an enormous reality on what were running namely what unknown might you be trying to escape from this unstacks all those notised engrams youre running the reverse of escape which is confront you dont have to erase the whole bank you can just get familiarity with it the mechanism of escape is one used widely by thetans of course thetan would be in bad way if when his body dies he couldnt exteriorize its not bad thing to be able to escape but when someone is compulsively escaping he never escapes escape as philosophy gets in the road of auditing case reality is necessary in the auditor ie willingness to stay there and take look person who doesnt have reality on the bank has consistently escaped from bank he of course does odd things in auditing when he audits pc he doesnt know what the pc is doing or thinks he shouldnt be doing it so we get clearing if you as an auditor pull the pcs attention away from the incident hes running he gets confused sticks there feels betrayed you could educate that auditor endlessly without producing any change in that philosophy unless you hit the philosophy itself you cannot educate an auditor who has that philosophy into giving smooth session keeping the pc in session with his attention on his bank when an auditor makes consistent mistakes does lot of q and yanks the pcs attention to pt we assume that that auditor has the philosophy of escape theres sense in putting up laws to counter it just spot it and handle it about responsibility for the session from the original thesis you have the law of auditor pc greater than the bank and pc less than the bank thus for instance selfauditing produces minor results at best it just remedies havingness on auditing selfauditing tends to happen when true auditing is scarce for instance by having an auditor whose philosophy is escape to handle this just audit reestablish the pcs confidence in the fact that he is being audited and will be audited if the preclear werent less than the bank the bank wouldnt give him any trouble even though hes creating the bank hes created something out of control someone whos aberrated is less than the bank someone whos psychotic is the bank being totally overwhelmed by the bank recognizing that one is auditing someone who is to degree overwhelmed by his bank and realizing the laws from the original thesis we should realize that the auditor has got to be running the pc at his bank to get anything done when the auditor withdraws from doing this he collapses the pcs bank back on the pc way to get major collapse of the pcs bank is to take direction of the pcs and follow it there are two reasons for this 1 the auditor is taking directions from the bank 742 the auditor has subtracted himself from the basic equation it looks to the pc as if only he is confronting the bank he loses the illusion that the auditor is confronting it too and his bank collapses on him the pc is now just selfauditing pcs do this out of anxiety to get auditing they take over responsibility and try to take control if you take one direction from the pc his bank collapses on him matter how reasonable his direction may seem this is the first time weve really looked at this mechanism its the primary method by which the auditor ceases to take responsibility for the session this may mean model session should be rewritten its there to give the illusion of courtesy thats all if the auditor doesnt want the pc to be butchered by the bank hed better stick by his ideas of what he should be doing matter how wrongheaded or upsetting those ideas may appear to be never do what the pc says matter how right he may be or how wrong you are if you take the pcs advice on some direction youve given him matter how screwy and uncompliable with your direction was youve made very major error and collapsed the pcs bank in on him you can also put pc at responsibility for the session by considering that pcs ought to do such and such that makes the pc responsible for the condition hes in in session this makes for the equation auditor pc is less than the bank this is failure to grant beingness to the pc in session pc is doing what he is doing and he should be doing what he is doing auditors code 14 considerations on top of this about what the pc should be doing interrupt responsibility for making the pc do something as long as your intentions are wrapped up with what the pc ought to be doing in inspecting pictures and so on you are making this occur the error is that instead of making the pc do or become what you want him to you add the sneak consideration the pc ought to this faintly implies im not responsible this winds up with collapsed bank the most prevalent kind of q and is where every time the pc says something you follow it this lets the pc spot what you should be auditing you are thus dropping your responsibility and you have permitted him to escape from the original question the pc never wants to handle what you want him to handle but he has been running away for trillions of years and knows quite well that he has to face up he just needs some backup on it this doesnt mean you must be totally unreasonable if the pc wants to go to the bathroom you can let him its not session direction but if he wants to go again five minutes later its an escape so you say invalidation is the basic overwhelm the pc says its my father you say it cant be you could run whole case probably with who has been invalidated what is death sickness or punishment but invalidation you are taking him on tour of the bank getting him familiar hell come out the other end not afraid dont let him escape with ruds or his own directions about what to do etc an auditor would win even if ignorant of fine points of tech if he followed these principles the pc must feel able to talk to the auditor so you dont shut him up when he tells you that something is wrong with the process or whatever auditors code 16 6108c30 shspec47 auditing quality if you pass up any reading rudiment and try to go on with the session when the pc has his attention on something else even if it is notised you will set up trouble in session youll get arc breaks stemming from the ptp it may not be ptp stemming from the environment sessions can be ptps also asking for ptps can restimulate one that had been dormant until looked for so rudiments can be dangerous ground if the pcs ptp is the session he has already postulated that he cant have session otherwise hed just relax about it and not have the ptp hes got such scarcity of auditing that he has to get the most session he can in that unit of time he presses at it gives himself more commands substitutes process he can do for one he cant in all this the pc is just trying to make session out of it this creates ptp for the pc new pcs especially have scarcity of any treatment because theyve had so much ineffective treatment they feel treatment is being offered anywhere so they get cant have on treatment this gets carried over into auditing it produces scarcity the pc will demand auditing and wont have it when he gets it this all stems from the ptp of scarcity of treatment handle it with any ptp process once you get the pc to see that he has it using innuendo to get him to cognite that auditing is scarce use something like what auditing sessions have you been unable to confront or when has there been auditing or what unknown in an auditing session would you want to escape from this would cure the phenomenon 75the pc who has continual ptps has obviously not told you anything about his ptp because those things that are known are not aberrative so if he says i know whats wrong with its my mother you can write it off those things that are halfknown can still make trouble from the unknown half so the second the pc says i know all about it that does not necessarily mean hes recovered from it if he found out about it in auditing it may not be fully known never believe pc except on goals and terminals to the pc auditing is handling of his fixed attention on the track so you neednt quail at getting in rudiment if thats where the pcs attention is fixed you do have to find the root of it the thing hes really stuck on auditing is what the pc considers frees up his attention so ask enough questions to find out what hes doing and where his attention is if the auditor sits there running the process and doesnt know whats happening with the pc he has big notknow on the session the pc can also notknow what the auditor is doing he can feel hes got withhold because the auditor never asks whats going on you can ask pertinent questions in any number get very certain on what hes doing how what hes looking at etc etc it keeps the pcs attention on his case to keep asking about it it also keeps his comm in and it gives you chance to guide him into doing the command the way you want him to pc who goes anaten has suffered drop in havingness his primary havingness is havingness of an auditor so if hes gone anaten hes lost the auditor you could ask when is the first time you lost the auditor if you dont give him back an auditor hell continue to go anaten the pc with the most anaten has the least auditor the things that cause him to lose the auditor could be what the auditor does eg an error or just the pc hitting some incidents and losing the auditor the pc starts going anaten and the pc is alone thats all find out where he is hes doing retreat anaten and boiloff on the part of the pc indicate that from the point of view of the pc the auditor isnt there if you find out where the pcs attention is you free it which is the goal of auditing if you are interested in the pcs case it helps hip to be interested in it you can just sit back and give the command and never find out what the pc is doing and it will work but compared to what happens if you really do cooks tour of the bank getting the pc to tell you whats going on all the time its an inferior type of auditing if you dont do it that way the pc will hit the thing and bounce hit and bounce leaving bit stuck here and there the pc will eventually come out fine it just takes longer the reason lrh hasnt insisted on auditors doing it this way is that they can be so knuckleheaded about it they dc some escape mechanism by asking dumb question as long as an auditor experiences impulses matter how obscure to rescue the pc from the dangers of the bank by pulling him away from it its not safe to have him asking questions thats the bug in back of it the bank is as it is because of the confusion and randomity in it if you dont keep the pc confronting the randomity he wont clear up thats all thats the source of the 51 ratio in length of time needed to produce an auditing result between others and lrh ron has allergy to action but has musthave on it either you dont audit the quiet points of the track although scarcity of action is what is wrong with the pc we have to ask how did this scarcity of action occur it occurred because of the unpalatability of action stillness is preferred because it keeps you from getting hurt you may find the pc complaining of the boredom of life if you suggest lets go join the marines the pc will say well action has become discreditable society at this time has the opinion that action is bad idea at least as represented in literature why should this be if pc is so starved for action you would think that the scarcity of action just stemmed from his situation in life but how did he get himself in that situation the faster you get him over the idea of the discreditable nature of action the sooner youll get him unstuck from the quiet areas of his track the blood and guts are there moment before and after its fascinating to find out what pcs think pictures should be too they may have weird ideas about what they should have all backed up with the discreditability of action you can direct the pcs attention by asking him questions as long as your questions do not yank his attention off the subject on which it is operating hell get into trouble at all finding out what hes doing what hes looking at etc is beneficial and whenever it seems hes just escaped find out about what is unknown about what he just left cog this would also be the mechanism of blows on misunderstoods person cannot confront the unknown or if theres anything else in that keep putting his attention back on the thing he bounced out of dont do this forcefully but use pointed questions eventually the whole thing is sorted out and hes not stuck on it by all the effort to escape and the mystery and the unconfronted action furthermore he knows hes getting auditing because he gets his attention freed from the spot where it was stuck he winds up with action not being discreditable and being able to have it 766108c31 shspec48 what is auditing there are two stages of poor auditing 1 the auditor audits naturally 2 then learns the rules and audits all thumbs with the rules eventually the rules fall back to where they belong and he does fine the basics of auditing are what they are you are auditing human being the auditing is addressed to case auditing must be done what is auditing auditing is the pc in session willing to talk to the auditor and interested in his own case and able to talk to the auditor interested in own case does not mean interested in session the session itself should never be interesting witch doctors maintained such compelling presence that the patient couldnt help being interested in the session this was the wrong way to operate there was such complexity in the tech that it took half lifetime to learn eg the technique of piercing scream followed by silence then an hypnotic command then resuming the scream at the same pitch and volume or the ability to leap with back somersault through the smoke hole of wigwam or lodge and sit on the trees so as to apparently disappear then talk down through the hole in spirit voices this would be so interesting that the patient would come back to life in scientology you walk into these expectations of what healer is supposed to be and do but the fake is the guy who doesnt know model session and cant do this or that so he isnt an auditor youve got the nowimsupposedtos theyve got potent reasons in back of them but they also become badge of being pro his ease in handling the form impresses the pc and has magical effect omit some of the forms and the pc suspects that theres something wrong with your auditing this can be ridiculous form for the sake of form and magical effect its good to know and use the forms but auditing comes back to something else running cases its always more important to run cases than to run according to form the form just makes it easier as guideline when youre really expert the form wont even be apparent itll just look like youre doing something effective this requires real skill you have to be completely comfortable with what you are doing making it look utterly natural while doing it utterly by the rules in this respect auditing is like doing japanese paintings doing it by the rules makes it harder because you have to be natural while doing it by the form which is artificial if you fall short of appearing totally natural you will fall short of total control there is real art in using rudiments without the pc noticing the order youre using so he complies because its so natural that it must be addressed to him it is communication that is compelling it must sound so casual that it sounds perfectly relaxed and theres question in your mind about what you are doing or where you are going or what you are going to achieve and this very casualness seems to speak of reserved power like rolls royce idling at the curb ease is power strain is never power quiet voice is more commanding than loud one this is based on the effect scale naturally its easy for you to audit pc with tremendous control if you yourself are not anxious if you are confident you can control any part of the situation you are not trying to interest him in the session and he feels theres nothing for him to look at but the bank nothing to see but his case the ease with which you can do it is based on confidence which is based on wins and ability when you have ideas that you wont win your confidence drops the reality factor has to be in and if you are anxious about somebodys case youll appear anxious about his case i handle it another way i say gee i sure am worried about your case these days the pc says really i havent been worried about my case why are you well you never say gee whiz i just realized you just keep on running this thing this creates much higher reality than robotic iamgoingtoaudityounowdofishfly if you look confident but feel unconfident hes likely to respond to your anxiety the more he withholds this the less hell go into session it doesnt help the pc for the auditor to be an unknown factor to the pc as long as the auditor stops short of eval or inval or q and the auditor should keep the rfactor in the reality factor begins in your command of your information if you dont feel you have command of the information and you pretend to have command of your information your session will come cropper every time you cannot help it matter how hard you try session goes to pieces only on these points of unreality in the auditor in the auditor you can find the points of unreality by asking what did you disagree with in that session youll find thats where things go awry because theres r in the session if theres r theres or c dont think there is any lag on this when the r goes the others drop at once you may become aware of them later the unreality entered into the session by the auditor causes the auditor to get peeved with the pc 77session is basically an arc activity if theres been high arc in the auditor it will materialize in the pc pc can look at his bank as well as he can communicate good auditor has highly perceptive pc the same pc audited by another auditor with low arc is not as perceptive these factors have always existed if you feel annoyance or anxiety with the pc that will drop the r and cut c this can be destructive to the pc because the auditor projects low perceptivity this is one of the first factors that got in the road of dianetics auditor presence in the session varied an auditor who is confident creates an auditing environment in which it is safe to depart into the nevernever land of the unknown so its the auditor and the emotional tone of the session which determine what takes place when youve been auditing long time and havent cleared somebody you arent operating on very high level of confidence when youve seen somebody get cleared your confidence level goes up to hopeful when youve cleared somebody you get confident when youve cleared string of them you get insouciant but that in itself is reality when youve not gotten results you feel less confident about pcs so youre auditing in an environment which has low arc in it false note in the auditors confidence is always detectable the pcs attention goes off his case onto the auditor because he feels theres something here he doesnt know and theres something unknown in the session unknownness is the keynote here the auditor doesnt know whether he can produce result or what he can do or whether hell get the pc through etc he has determination of the final result to the pc it adds up as the auditor not knowing so theres mystery in the session the pc may try arduously to spot the notknow because of the mystery which sticks him the auditor cant keep the pc in session because the pcs attention is on the auditor how much mystery does he smell lrh would disabuse him of any mystery he can how long the session will be if thats relevant any mystery about whats going on just destroy it you tell him what you are going to run if youre going to ignore something etc the arc break disappears because so much r has been thrown into the session always try to make the pc right never make the pc wrong but dont make the pc right at the expense of making yourself wrong if challenged because of legitimate flub lrh would normally catch it before the pc does if he doesnt he figures hes slipping you should know more about whats going on in the session at any given moment than the pc does therefore you have more r therefore more control if the pc is telling you whats going on something is seriously out and probably has been for weeks the pc is not always right but the auditor doesnt have to tell him hes wrong theres need to prove anything to the pc to prove is one of the basic games of the thetan so the pc can easily get into this games condition but if he does something earlier is out some rfactor i would never audit someone to electrify the community weve done it and its never been effective its the old prove game you dont use scientology to prove it works because youve gotten into games condition before you start and an auditing session is not games condition and you should know it every homo sapiens is in games condition this could easily take precedence over session so just dont play because if you let it be games condition youll both lose since the pc wont let you get him better at the least whiff of games condition the pc will take off in that direction as soon as you agree to have game with the pc auditing does not exist when you drop out r youve entered an ingredient which can lead to games condition youre withholding something from the pc so obviously theres game just the fact that you are doing this causes this atmosphere auditing is an activity of an auditor taking over control of and shepherding the attention of pc so as to bring about higher level of confront ability he has got to be able to confront more of what he has done and is doing etc youre not really changing the pc you may remove valences etc which makes him appear to have changed but what you are really doing is to extend the pc and to familiarize him with himself and his bank and the universe on various dynamics so his attention has to be shepherded and not all by the automaticity of the auditing command because the pc is going to duck you can count on the fact that every stuck picture is in some degree held there but the pc can look at the action surrounding the stuck point if he can look at the stuck picture the indication that he can regard the action is that he can regard the stuck picture which is blanking it out the pc is the one who brought up the stuck picture changes on cases which are rapid and beneficial frequently come from shepherding the pcs attention not from permissive grind grind grind if the pc offers up 78something his attention is on and the auditor refuses to help him look at it the pc can get upset the pc doesnt know what hes looking at he needs to be guided into looking at what he hasnt confronted the pc often indicates hes in trouble by sweating screaming writhing etc the only fast way the auditor can get him out is by not letting him escape the auditor shouldnt dress for anything except case gain dont change process because it isnt going fast enough change the pcs attention the way out is the way through so if hes stuck in something move him through it an auditor cant do this if he has reality on what the pc is doing if the pc is looking fixedly the way to handle it is to get him to look little further the stuck picture is stable datum which hes busily looking at to avoid looking at the confusion around it when you get him to look at the confusion the stable datum can blow with case that has black field ask whats on the other side of it with an invisible field or an invisible case with pictures get which way he is looking and get him to look in different direction its up to you to direct the pcs attention why because he himself in that very bank he has been in has his attention fixed on these objects solely for one reason because he has been powerless to direct his own attention in that particular bank and in those particular situations if an auditor doesnt do any attentiondirecting the command alone will do it but far more slowly but there will be arc if the pc believes the auditor doesnt care if you want fast clearing youll just have to get down to the fundamental which is that the auditor is someone who directs the pcs attention through his bank 6109c05 shspec49 principles of auditing there is substitute for understanding and there is understanding without experience in an auditing situation where there is understanding or familiarity there is likely to be established only the reality of war and if the auditor does not have understanding of and familiarity with the pc and his bank he will be at war whether he likes it or not the anatomy of hatred is based on the anatomy of noncomprehension noncomprehension is based on lack of familiarity and observation if you want to not comprehend something by all means dont look at it another condition applies tremendous amount of pretended knowingness and pretended understanding can arise after one has not observed psychiatry and psychology got nowhere because they mostly observed dead tissue when they observed anything the reason lrh made progress in the field of the study of the mind was his novel introduction of the study of living beings youd have to be able to confront motion to do that and you would have to be man of action an auditor has two sources of familiarity in processing 1 subjective reality 2 observation of the pc and meter behavior while he audits he can also live and observe life though this universe is rigged so that if you do too much living in this particular society you wind up with too many withholds and after that your auditor has lot of trouble trying to get you in session there possibly is some phase of life that is not punished but if so lrh hasnt discovered what it is yet certain rules govern auditing but they can go only so far in guiding you along the road to making clears the great oddity is that it can be done at all number of rules can give you familiarity with what is going on in the pc at any given moment you should experience it yourself to gain knowingness on it at that point you will see the reasons value and importance of the rules about 30 of all cases in scientology have never seen mind thats the only source of bad auditing why are auditors difficult to train theyre only difficult to train in those areas where they dont have familiarity so whats needed is process which gives familiarity with the bank and all its aspects and at the same time youd pick up all the hangfired clear cases they are hanging fire because they are not going along the line they should in auditing theyre walking the far edge of the crater so as not to fall in an auditor who doesnt have familiarity with the mind will applaud this tightrope walk and makes sure the pc never falls in because the thing to do is to keep out of trouble all of mans wars sicknesses economic disasters political chaos etc come entirely from one thing keeping out of trouble you are not supposed to keep the pc out of trouble if the trouble is in his bank pc never protests at getting into trouble if it gives him potential familiarity with the bank he protests measures that prevent him from becoming familiar with his bank he protests 79auditing to audit without curiosity about where the pc is and what he is doing is surefire way to keep him from getting into any trouble if you never find out whats going on you never have to confront his bank and he doesnt have to confront his bank the time can go up to light years and nobody gets any auditing done as general rule any mechanism you introduce into session which permits pc to avoid confronting his bank or takes the pc out of session is going to produce arc breaks heavy problems etc all pc ever objects to is not being audited it has to be the pc getting none not thinking he isnt say the pc has continual ptp with his wife who denies him auditing this creates the arc break how she denies him auditing can vary but the prevention of auditing makes the upset the reason she does it is interesting it is because she cant have auditing so the grades of cases are 1 those that cant have any auditing 2 those that consider their auditing is being prevented 3 those that can have auditing on the first two classes you wont get any clearing so you must remedy havingness of auditing some of the prevention of auditing can result from noncomprehension of what it is missing data of one kind or another those who cant have auditing come under the same heading of scarcity of auditing either it doesnt exist because they have understanding and therefore it isnt anything or if it did occur there would be too many social repercussions because they have too many withholds the pc who is arc breaky or who has ptps is being denied auditing in some way this sounds very monocentric since auditing is new subject but adequate treatment has not hitherto existed on this planet everyones reaction to getting sick or injured is oh ill have to get treatment god forbid the only place where regard for treatment has been lower is in the markab confederacy where medicine was taught with dried tissue samples as the only mass there it got so bad that you werent ever permitted to get new body this was typical of many spaceopera societies this society is moving in the direction of replacing parts with mechanical substitutes because treatment is so ineffective it has to be delivered by callous people who make nothing out of their patients otherwise the treatment would be an overt they are lessening the overt and preclears have been educated into the attitude that there is effective treatment nevertheless large percentage still hopes treatment can take place amazingly the hope must be rather thin by now so if the auditor makes move in the direction of treatment the pc arc breaks so at first you are doing cheerleaders job then when you have him in session let him have treatment how could you prevent him from getting treatment first dont let him put his attention on his case he never protests crude fumbling with his case as long as you do guide him into it all protests and difficulties of the pc stem from treatment auditing you get the violence of an arc break if you prevent the pc from getting auditing because auditing is painful and the basis of the pain is that there is auditing so irreparable damage might occur the pc believes now that auditing can cure any damage but if there is to be auditing then the damage isnt curable so he is in state of anxiety as soon as you violate insessionness another phenomenon is involved in this he is looking at an engram the only space in the engram is brought about by his attention on the engram and until the engram is desensitized he will have to keep some space in it to keep the engram off the end of his nose so if you distract him suddenly from an engram the space may disappear from out of the engram and he finds that engram on the end of his nose you let the engram bite him by taking his attention off the engram he can get somatics then he compounds it with an overt against the auditor there are many ways one can let the pcs attention be yanked out of session one is choosing an auditing room which has action of activity in its vicinity because you then set up auditing as the stable datum around which action is occurring you can get away with lot of this but dont try to audit in the middle of busy street you can run out past auditing in busy areas by asking what has been unknown about the activity of an auditing area this is to handle the 50 cubic yards he was aware of whose motion pinned him down into the half cubic yard of the session so ensure that the session wont be interrupted an auditor who chatters at pc about other things than the session is setting 80the pc up to pull his attention off his case in the session itself an ineffective process is auditing almost anything we have now run smoothly would keep him in session tech is not source of auditing bustups since it is auditing but the administration of it is the important one the prediction factor involves surprise what is surprise people with low tolerance of unknowns can be surprised more easily than youd think and the degree that person can be surprised is in proportion to his tolerance of unknownnesses the less he tolerates the unknown the more be can be surprised surprise is not having known past tense unknownness what isnt known doesnt run surprises what wasnt known runs surprises the fact had existence before he found out about it and he is shocked that he didnt know about it when it was going on the anatomy of surprise is unpredicted change it registers in the mind only if there was knownness present which the pc didnt know and then finds out later he tries to go backtrack into all that unknownness and gets the impression of floundering around during that time in notknownness which is an invalidation of his knowingness and his permeation that is the only thing thetan ever objects to an invalidation of knowingness he objects on the basis of surprise so he gets future which looks like this all sorts of things going on in his vicinity which he doesnt know about that he will maybe find out about and they will be terrible shock to him so he starts living in state of anxiety because hes had it demonstrated that facts not known to him which are quite destructive can exist in his environment without his awareness hes sucked back into the whirlpool of unknown yesterdays the truth is he knew his environment in those yesterdays but he looks back on it as not knowing his environment so things of horrible portent could be going on at this very moment so thats what anxiety and nervousness is he gets very alert so as not to be surprised this destroys iq iq goes down in direct proportion to the amount of unknownness he conceives the environment to hold this will apply to subject too someone who gets more unknownness in the environment than he can tolerate may manifest the insanity of putting known delusory terminal there thats pretended knowingness on the environment this applies directly to sessions most of what pc is going through is accumulation of unknownnesses that he suddenly found out and nearly everything hes got in the bank is prevention against being caught unawares again so when pc finds out something from the auditor which existed before he discovered it heres what could happen hes interiorized into his bank and the auditor fiddles with the cans and says the meter is out so well have to stop the session the pc is given the data that the meter was out when he didnt know it so there wasnt session when he thought there was one he doesnt know how long this was the case and the mystery pins him in the session or the auditor stops the when the pc thought he was doing all right that gives him an unknown surprise is based on change were interested in the unknown factor which is what sticks pcs in it you can change process fifteen times an hour on pc without damaging him but you can suddenly change process on some consideration he doesnt know about and arc break him across the boards the pc will accuse the auditor in an effort to solve the unknownness which existed before the change you could advise the pc well in advance of what you intented to do so long as you dont yank his attention off what hes looking at if you start running process without clearing it first or letting him know youre going to do it youll probably get away with it unless the process doesnt work well in which case hell think you are impetuous pc is only one kind of victim victim of auditing matter how many motivators show up on his case thats the only one that can cause auditing difficulties he feels an unknown exists he doesnt know about in the session thats why youve got to keep the rfactor up and the knowingness factor in pcs sense the unknowns when one is about to occur turn it into known warn him dont try to gain auditing time by omitting these things you can audit pc without his agreement but you cant audit him without his knowingness arc breaks clear up most rapidly on notknow processing run it always in the past tense not the present because thats where there was an element of surprise the unknown which preceded the found outs model session also provides known structure you can jump it as long as you tell him the unknownness of the pcs bank really impinges on him if you the auditor have reality on its components knownness on its components hell sense you dont know your business your ability to control the session depends directly on your knowingness of the parts of the mind this is of course why lrh audits so effectively the pc feels you see all know all when you seeing 81where he isnt looking direct his attention to it get familiar with the mind and make the session familiar to the pc and youll be bearcat of an auditor to handle arc breaks you can ask what didnt i know about what you were doing 6109c06 shspec50 subjective reality an auditor who believes there are engrams who has an intellectual understanding of the time track who has the idea that there are such things as masses and who is aware of pcs having been out of present time but himself has slightest idea of ever being in another time stream than now that auditor is dangerous auditor because he is escaping from then now is only an escape from then by definition this auditor will allow pcs to escape from then this is directly opposed to clearing which is showing someone he doesnt have to escape from then because he can confront then and when he confronts then he is longer stuck in then he must see that he can survive in spite of his demons that they were the shadows of life not its substance if you are showing him how to escape from life youre teaching him to be worse off an auditor who is letting the pc escape from the bank will make mistakes in auditing this is the most fruitful source of mistakes the pc feeling confidence arc breaking etc the pc knows down deep that its wrong not to confront the bank so he objects because he vaguely knows hes not getting auditing understanding is built on observation and familiarity person who has had experience of reactive mind trying to get someone to handle reactive mind makes dogs breakfast out of it you hear at times that scientologist is harder to audit than rawmeat pc there are several reasons for this he knows how it ought to go he is accustomed to handling an auditing session so as pc he is more accustomed to handling the session than an inexperienced pc would be he audits faster but he also arc breaks more he is more critical as pc because he cannot permit himself to duplicate bad session all his training tells him not to duplicate bad sessions so his havingness of the session vanishes when he recognizes it to be different from what he conceives it should be the amount of arc break here is not case indicator nothing shows up faster in an auditor than unfamiliarity with the bank and if the scientologist who is familiar with the bank is being audited by someone who isnt youll never get session theres outr so you get arc breaks one way to audit out bad session is what about the session the auditor etc would you be willing to be not be willing to be it is this unwillingness to be that makes it impossible for the session to occur if an auditor who is familiar with the bank flubs hell know what occurred so he can repair it and the arc break doesnt last long an auditor who has familiarity with the bank will put the pcs attention on the flub wont find what the pc is looking at on the backtrack so in trying to handle what he thinks wrongly is important he will pile up more noauditing thus creating more arc breaks he thinks the pc is just sitting in chair in pt nastily having an arc break you can make lots of flubs if you have an understanding of the pcs reality because you can fix them but person with subjective reality on the track wont realize that the pc isnt in pt and will drag him up to pt collapsing the track in pt and disorienting him disorientation is for one thing source of dreams and delusions the thetan in the skull cant find out where he is when the body is asleep so he puts up some false knowingnesses of where he is making dream or nightmare thats all dream is when you disorient thetan you have given him the only real shock he can get you have chosen him out for your randomity and told him to get lost and get confused in auditing you are in direct communication with the thetan he has problems most of which are disorientation problems he is down the track trying to find out where he has been if you spring surprise on him his first reaction is not to know where he is his next action is delusory knowingness he will tell you he doesnt know something like what you are doing he actually means that he doesnt know where he is he will put up delusory arguments to account for the shift the real reason for it is the auditors lack of reality on the pcs bank the pc is putting up delusory knowingness when he criticizes your auditing he is trying to find his unknown but of course he is in the unknown of thinkingness because he is confused enough not to be able to confront the unknownness of whereness unknownness of where requires more of the pc than the unknownness of idea because solids take more confront than ideas if you dont put him where he is in hurry he will keep adding delusion and significances in an effort to orient himself all the auditor has to do to shut it off is to find out where the pc has been and where he is but the auditor would have to have 82reality on the isness of the bank to know that thats the obvious thing to do dont pull the pcs attention to the arc break it just disorients him more and arc breaks him more if you have trouble with nightmares figure out how the nightmare located you and figure out where you are locate yourself or run locational if you give the wrong command let the pc answer it then ask him the right command dont yank the pc up to pt to give an auditor reality on the bank you could run what unknown would you escape from attack use any verb form that gives reach and withdraw as valence process you could run think of an unknown who would escape from it attack it or think of being what unknown would he escape from attack when you find person who has somatics and has reality on the bank he is of course not in pt he has escaped by total withdrawal from some ancient environment this process gets them to do what they are doing escape from and attack what they are in which is the unconfrontable past environment you could use another process who would escape from attack things you can run who would you be willing to be rather not be the reason why beingness is functional is that part of valence package is track so every now and then someone runs on track thats not his own he sees himself always from the outside and gets thin impressions of himself he has the bank of each person into whose valence hes gone this is disorienting it gives him an unreality of location valence has bank skills disabilities etc the person entered it on the basis of being unable to control the valence or terminal so of course he cant have or control any of the mechanisms of the valence so you cannot move that bank he hasnt enough ownership of it to run engrams etc there was point where the pc got the valence thats the only point where the valence will break by auditing beings not ideas or pictures youll get the valences blowing off routine three is very effective but shortcut would be any beingness process eg think of being this will give his his own track back sometimes youll have pcs with tremendous numbers of pictures they dimly recognize as not theirs the pictures are not familiar they are thin this gives an unreality on past lives when thats the quality of the pictures off the track of course in his past life he was another beingness people who have had valence trouble go out of valence easily so they have lots of wrong pictures so you take an incident of vast confusion and motion one is not willing to tolerate because it occurs with target that isnt appropriate to the motion and it causes disorientation as you protest valence could occur in that way ordinarily one who was there would pick up the valence of someone else so that all subsequent track is seen from the wrong point of view and it all stems from total disorientation an auditor who has too much valence trouble has great reality on somebody elses bank because his bank isnt really his its very thin set of pictures run him back and youll hit some tremendous explosion when twenty spaceships collided thats the type of incident which makes valence transfer not some mind incident an auditor who has reality on past lives hasnt collided with his bank very hard its not reprehensible its just symptom of valence and bank trouble so the guy doesnt get his own pictures and has conception of being stuck in pictures hell worry about his auditing flubs and why he cant quite handle his pcs hell worry about his ability to audit hes trying to orient himself with datum the datum hes looking for is this as long as he has low subjective reality of bank when pc gets into one his reality is not instantaneous so he will do little fumble or comm lag which causes an arc break because the pc loses confidence in the auditors ability to run the session its not that the person was trying to do something bad to the pc or that he didnt know scientology its just that his mechanisms of handling life have been escape from self into others and not getting in contact with the horrors of thenness the difficulties you encounter all come under the heading of auditor comm lag an auditors fumble is the unreality he has on what the pc is doing or going through you dont have time to remember the datum you have to know it and act instantaneously the only thing that teaches this is experiencing fumbling is not overcomable with rules and texts drill might help but it probably wouldnt because of outreality the only real cure is to audit the person enough to give him the reality however an auditor doesnt have to be cleared to learn to audit it would be nice but its not absolutely necessary 83the escape mechanism where person never tours the track surrenders fairly easily to auditing because it is based on another idea than that which degrades or aberrates thetan escape is simply method of handling bank not method of getting aberrated case deteriorates when the individual longer has confidence in himself as himself and thus adopts another packaged beingness to handle the situation then this beingness turns out not to be solution so he gets another etc etc and your backtrack of clearing could not be followed by the idea of escape because thats much too simple statement of the situation person can find himself inadequate in numerous ways besides the fact that they are trying to escape also there are situations when escape is wise but deterioration of confidence in ones own ability to handle life leads one to believe he must have another beingness in order to handle things for him now he starts living life on an irresponsibility eventually his adoption of new identities goes into the lifedeath cycle which is not at all usual in the life of thetans life invalidating the body and the valences gets down to the idea that the best thing to do is to chuck the mockup that just makes failure person ages to the degree that he feels invalidated the age of man in any lifetime is directly proportional to the accumulation of unknowns which of course is invalidation children probably grow up fast because they are moving through so much unknownness they have hope and confidence because they are growing up this hope is not necessarily justified person with valence trouble is especially effected by invalidation and is likely to have long lists of goals and terminals or to have more submerged goal there is positive correlation between the roughness of case and the length of time it would take you to find goal if you didnt take up the inval with rudiments invalidation could be said to be the basis of aberration how much inval person feels determines how aberrated he is give the auditor with slight reality on the track some auditing aimed at fixing his reality and his auditing will get better his invalidatability will decrease now he knows what hes doing and it was that which was in his road 6109c07 shspec51 reality in auditing engrams never ran with the pc out of valence all long engram running stems from the pc being out of valence we want him in the body he was in when the incident occurred its not necessarily his own valence its the valence he was in when the incident occurred being out of valence is the pcs way of denying responsibility for his part in the incident being in valence just permits him to run the pictures as long as he occupies body and thinks of it as himself hes not really being himself when the pc who is out of valence sees pictures they are small and thin they have nothing to do with him if the auditor is not aware of such phenomena he can make classic errors the pc sees picture the auditor never asks where are you viewing it from or what body do you occupy in the picture not asking these things the auditor thinks its all going fine when in fact the picture is way over there and very thin youre not really running the picture the pc saw you are running safe version with the condition that he never view it from the original viewpoint so it never asises pcs who are run this way on any process never get anyplace dont pay any attention the pc has from someone elses viewpoint it wont do any good conceptual processes have the virtue of moving pc straight back to the picture he is in that is of charging up the chain he is stuck in that makes him out of valence from that point on eventually he will wind up in his own valence in picture if the auditor doesnt make him handle it he doesnt know his business there are several approaches to this if you understand it the track is the series of pictures made by the person from the viewpoint he was occupying at the time of the incidents on it trying to run stuff from other viewpoints is just running branch lines and he wont get erasures his engrams are pictures of engrams and youre trying to erase picture that never occurred though the engram occurred there is simple method to handle this have you ever seen picture from inside the body you were in at the time the pc frequently will say well yes and he tells you about one or several take one of them and ask if theres anything about the auditing question he answered which is unknown run all the unknownnesses out of the incident you can find out that the incident has been with him ever since theres fundamental method find out if he has been in one and put him back in it 84if hes never been in an engram you can run recall an arc break this will unstack the track to point where hed find himself in the upsetting incident then you can flatten it another one which will do it easily get the idea of action out in front of you 200300 ft away conceive of an action 200300 ft behind you what happened to the mass it shifted you could follow this through use processes of inspection at distance and eventually get the guy to where hed be in the picture he was stuck in that peels down the valence people like repetitive processes if the pc has bad leg but never mentions it dont run it but if he complains about it there is something you can run ask if he has any odd pressures which will be his chronic psychosomatic illness probably his hidden standard run this vicious process who would have an unknown motion around the leg this sort of question knock out chronic somatics if flattened it also works on absence of sensation another thing to do is see on the meter if motion confusion action etc reads well then make command who would have an unknown action etc around his leg pc who will not view his bank has tremendous intolerance of notions and unknowns motion can become intolerable to someone who is fixated on the subject of pain he believes that all motion adds up to pain pain does involve motion the strange thing is that someone who is trying to stop motion to prevent pain is doing the thing that makes pain occur if the thetan wasnt trying to stop motion around the body the body would experience pain notice with pain how it seems to result from two opposing motions as with all things people dont like it because they havent had enough of it in handling pc who has bank visible these factors must be present 1 he has an intolerance of pain hence of motion and unknowns 2 he has fantastic importance attached to motions and unknowns we see this but notis it people being very concerned about some particular unknown area the most unknownness there can be the most important one is the unknownness of motion being hit by surprise tends to give stuck somatic because of the unknownness of it those engrams which are most seriously stuck on the track are the ones composed of incomprehensibles the pc may keep getting fixed ideas about it in an effort to figure it out pretended knowingness substitutes for non confront of unknownness the importance of the unknownness and motion depends on the degree of threat to survival this goes back to the idea that one must survive which is the basic idiocy any way of getting version of unknown and motion together combined with valences gives you process to get the pc into his own pictures in space opera when theyre conditioning thetans theres sometimes tumbler incident this is pretty common hes thrown down shaft which is lighted at the top and bottom spinning as he goes he gets lot of pictures of white spots as he tries to stop himself all the way down so he gets bright spots stuck around him not very far from him at various distances up to 100 feet if you tell someone to look closer in than 200 feet hes likely to run into them there are lots of ways to get somebody dislocated delusory bank like dreams is an effort to locate oneself this is why 8c and tr10 make him feel better nearly every picture pc has is an effort to locate himself at point where he got dislocated unknown time plays major role tool having the pc spot unknown pictures shakes up all these efforts to locate himself by means of them hell get pictures flying by in all directions universe could be seen as an effort to locate oneself therefore because thetan doesnt have to be located its dirty trick to give him the idea he has to be located its very senior concept in processing that thetan does not have to if one could just cog on that out of the blue hed be clear but if you did begin to have that thought youd probably stop because the thought would set unknown motions going trying to locate another thetan must be basic overt but one that is prior to the overtmotivator sequence you try to get the concept i dont have to be located and you run up against the om phenomena you could run think of locating somebody this first runs off as good actions then it goes over into overts then into dispersal where he gets hard to audit if you clean up motion and unknownness well which cleans up valences the pc reaches back and starts changing his mind about these things and we get 85change of mind processing the route we are looking for is the route to change of mind the thetan just asising his old considerations what boobytraps this is that the pc must have escaped from innumerable pictures and gone off the track in numerous places he doesnt have concept of where hes been and what hes done and the unknownness of that is important because if hes escaped from these things they must have been dangerous thetan proves that things are dangerous by the fact that he ran away people in fact do not escape to the degree that things are dangerous they escape to the degree that they are unknown and have unacceptable motion wars are dangerous but known so people will play that game in war there is an effort to dislocate and locate by the enemy and by ones own commanders one could dream up substitute for war using the principle of locate vs dislocate fix and unfix the whole idea of power stems from the ability to hold location this is an idea of thetans which has become actualized in the physical universe the ability to hold the location depends in part on ones belief that one can hold it the power of body of troops on hilltop depends on their ability to hold their position and to make the enemy hold his position they have to take responsibility for holding the enemy where they are but they usually dont bother to pin the enemy down countries look weak after wars because one terminal has dislodged the other you always get generated energy by thrusting something at something that wont move this applies in the mest or the theta universe thetans friction against life and lifes thrust against him does generate energy the force of an engine depends on the strength of the elements that restrain the motion of the piston eg the bearings etc to the degree thetan resists position he gets picture to get solid 3d picture in pc get him to find time when there were two forces each trying to push the other away or find an argument the pc had with someone girls get the idea that they have to know something about electricity to understand scientology and since theyve gotten out of the habit of fighting holding the front line etc they think they shouldnt know much about power force etc this is not true girls generate more power and sparks than anything else in this society they will get firmly attached to an idea and not let go of it matter how much you argue it banks are charged and bother people to the degree that one has tried to hold positions and knock people off positions bank is like mold of what one tried to dislodge or hold position against when one is dislodged one dramatizes with picture from another position an out of valence picture if you try to force someone into the engram you only restimulate the forces pushing him away from it if you can take him up to it on gradient he can get into it you take the pc on gradient of what led up to the incident or masses and it will go back with confront into thenness and longer impinge on nowness 6109c12 shspec52 clearing breakthrough hubbard adds engram running to routine 3 gives some details of process sequences arcb processes 1 what have you been unable to tell an auditor 2 what has an auditor failed to do 3 what did an auditor do more details on goals running and ruds engram running is important in clearing because lrh has learned that somatic cannot be unburdened somatic is where it is at the tension and velocity that it is and it is nowhere else it is totally independent of all other incidents it discharges only as what it is and not as any lock and matter how thoroughly it has been unburdened it will come on with the same intensity when you find it where it is all the pcs hidden standards and ptps of long duration stem from the first engram you will contact after the prehav assessment generalized process has ever made those chronic somatics less when you run the engram the pcs ptp of long duration will vanish and that is the only way it will be solved the isness of the situation is in the time and place of the situation and nowhere else 86the engram necessary to resolve the case didnt resolve the case in 1950 because it was not on the goalterminal line of the pc it wasnt an earlier incident the engram necessary to resolve the case is on the goalterminal line of the pc so unless you found the goalterminal line of the pc the engrams arent going to reduce rapidly if youre not on the goalterminal line of the pc and hes not in valence youre in for 75 hours of reduction in running engrams in r3 the engrams run easily because theyre on the pcs goalterminal line youve got the pc in the valence that was the destructive valence of his case what has been solved is 1 how do you get pc in valence on an engram 2 how do you find an engram on the case that will run 3 what is the engram necessary to resolve the case the reason youve had trouble with engrams in the past is than they werent on the goalterminal line the pc was out of valence and the engrams were associated with other chains now this is all handled as long as the auditor has reality on what bank looks like if he has this reality hell know for instance that the pcs misemotion while running as engram stems from the engram not from what the auditor is doing and why you can get the pcs resistance to the forward motion of the action off the engram by running it backwards then the pc can confront more of it this data has nothing to do with occlusion of cases an occluded case is just one who is stuck in an occluded engram something with black field there is condition of pretended knowingness which can get in our road its super escape factor when the knowingness is too horrible and the notknowingness is too thick and the person feels too stupid about it hes likely to dream it up such that it will have nothing unknown about it you wont get any of these with the prehav technique the keynote of an engram is the fact that the pc knows nothing about it pretended knowingness will get in your road and youll buy garbage then one day youll invalidate pcs data but do run the engram dont jerk the pcs attention off the engram when hes got all the unknownnesses out of it has more somatics have him go through it few times to see if theres anything missing see if hes got sonic and all the other perceptions out of it dont try to force them to be there just note it so when youve run few more you can go back and run it perceptions are the last thing to turn on just be sure you get all the perceptions out of it eventually dont make it too real to the pc let it be comfortably real perception is something which turns off gradually somatics are right now 6109c13 shspec53 sec check and withholds on sec checks if people argue that rights of privacy shouldnt be invaded eg in public meeting the answer is in the hcob 8feb60 honest people have rights too this has been so neglected on this planet that only criminals have rights at saint hill among the domestic staff the ones who had withholds always got rid of the good staff members it always works this way the ones with withholds will tell lies about the good ones and seek to get rid of them because they cant bend them down to their level good staff members are made nervous upset and uncertain about their future in the presence of insecure people spreading entheta withholds cause people to get individuated more and more to the point that theyre not even themselves guy who shoots ducks cant be duck the more individuation occurs the less likely person is to be able to walk out of anywhere its like backing up through succession of isolation rooms person to be in good shape must be able to be almost anything to the degree that you cant be something you have overts on it that you are withholding its well known in the motorcycle world that some people have so many overts against motorcycles that to touch one produces disaster you can stop automobile accidents by having the person reach and withdraw from car hell drive better and stop having accidents you could also run startchangestop on the vehicle this process could give you somatics as the overts start blowing the best way to blow overts is with the sec check because the overt only remains bad if its withheld wars get fought because its so horrible to have war that it gets put on automatic that is individuation from subject and loss of control of it 87if you can be something you wont have to become it theres another mechanism too after you backed yourself out of life to the end of the corridor you snap terminals and obsessively become the thing you were trying to leave this is valence closure its the withholding of overts that does it where you have pc whos loaded with withholds on sec check youve got someone who cant be and you are trying to find valences you cant find valences easily on someone who cant be but you can find the fixed valence hes in because its this mechanism the mechanism of ow causing valence closure that has led to his becoming that valence so you could find someones terminal without completing his sec check but hell be hard to get into session if hes got lots of withholds because of the resultant individuation he gets easily upset because he cant be pc and is critical of the auditor because he has withholds you can run what are you willing to be what would you rather not be two things will occur if you run it very much it will soften him up on security check because beingness and withholds are opposed and one solves the other however it also walks the pc into his valence chain without identifying the chain so it can get him into engrams hes not ready to run you must remember that she somatic is where it is on the track and in other place and it will release only from that place so you can walk him away from that place on the track which keys it out or you can walk him into that place on the track and asis it thats all processes can do with somatics withholds will often soften up and knock out presenttime somatics by walking the person away from the area and maybe thats good thing he could be stuck tightly into an engram in life and you can move him out of it until youre got him in shape to run it out he could be so tightly in it he couldnt put his attention on the session the best approach to this is security check you could even run it on the basis of his chronic ptp somatic it knocks out his obsessive individuation this is an assist that walks him out of the valence hes been stuck in hes always got the chronic somatic on the chain of the valence which will be his terminal thats why you have to get the correct goal and terminal because theres only one valence chain in which hes stuck the end product of withholds is good communication not clear sec checks can be tailored to hit the area of the persons ptp so as to key it out so you can make progress with the case 6109c19 shspec55 q and period prehav sec checks arc break processes details on prehav processes with the 5way brackets and different flows you are trying to knock off the pcs obsessive valence which hes stuck in by some stuck flow eg sergeant always orders troops one orders him thus he gets stuck flow and eventually does something weird like becoming troop or inability to accept orders from officers if someone kept giving orders it would unstick the flow eventually flows are the mechanism by which someone snaps terminals and gets valence closure you run body continually it never runs you so youre in body one day you get reaction from body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body run you if you start consciously driving car youve been driving unconsciously ie you start taking the car somewhere instead of just letting the car take you all sorts of weird things are liable to happen you might lose your ability to drive temporarily in driving the car unconsciously youve already succumbed to stuck flow we have the idea that skill should be unconscious so one doesnt have to think this is big reactive trap when one has run out all the flows on terminal that the pc has as an obsessive valence youll have discharged the pcs compulsion to be interiorized into it or to command it or be unconscious about it the overt act motivator phenomenon has to be part and parcel of this stuck flow phenomenon eg sergeant tells his troops theyre going for picnic when they get out in the field they find they have to build fortifications the lies and prevarications are part of what causes the valence closure if you start teaching student about scientology and pushed bunch of false or misinterpreted data on him that would be an overt in order for the stuck flow to come about you have to have an individuation and unease an unconscious reaction plus something unknown something hidden an overt in instruction at saint hill far instance on the auditor process beingness is in the middle of confusion so the process what are you willing to be what would you rather not be is limited process it picks the stable datum out of 88the confusion which is reverse auditing it is very good only on limited basis if you were going to run case with this youd have to run some 1a processes problems and sec check processes alternated see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a as part of the auditing commandsee also p 57 paragraph 4 for the theory behind this eg for long run use 1a what would you be willing to be b what would you rather not be 2a what would another be willing to be b what would another rather not be 3a what confusion could you confront b what confusion could another confront you can use problem or motion in the confront command instead of confusion whichever reads best to run whole case with it add two more commands the negative confront parts that could run the whole case to clear maybe after very long time if you ran it without the problems part it would run the pc right into engrams within few hours on withholds you first find some doingness eg fish around for anything he thought he should tell you that hes forgotten about clean up with 2wc if possible first asking what was it when was it what sort of thing would you find it hard to tell etc you could use peter williams version of ow think of something youve donewithheld for 3 or 4 cycles then is there anything youd care to tell to give the pc chance to get the withhold off you could use this latter after 2wc doesnt get it or you could use what is unknown about my reactions to shake it out clearing the auditor so the pc can talk to him you are not trying to run sec check on the pc however if you get read on withhold the pc tells what it was and it still reads you release it with to whom wasnt that known to whom shouldnt that be known this is the nastiest withhold process ever dreamed up this process cleans up basicbasic on the arc break chain what didnt an auditor do when what werent you able to tell an auditor when you can clean up the immediate session arc break with what werent you able to tell when or shorter process what didnt i do when what werent you able to tell when this is the final descendant of the discovery that communication is the most important corner of the arc triangle as long as you run recall its perfectly safe to run what werent you able to say but dont put it in the present or future or it will be an outofarc process eg what wouldnt you be able to say this could even be unanswerable you can use the past tense process with specific terminals eg what werent you able to tell your mother psychotics have gone sane on think of communicating with somebody run for 25 hours despite the stuck flow aspect but it wasnt communication that aberrated anybody it was the notcommunications so recall on the not communications operates as very powerful process to round it out as total valence process get the other flow what wasnt terminal able to tell you when that would be powerful valence splitter so skip prehav 13 as way to clean up ptps with present time environment terminals run the above prehav 13 is process which combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets relative to list of charged terminals see tape 6106c21 shspec17 theres booster to this the pc is in position where he is expecting somebody to do something because he is depending on somebody to do something if somebody doesnt do it hes left in she soup so in session for an auditor not to have done something and for him not to have been able to tell the auditor is frequent source of arc breaks running that out picks up all the times he wasnt in session and cleans up past sessions to make long run out of this use what didnt an auditor do when what didnt you do when and what werent you able to tell an auditor when what didnt an auditor tell you when that would made wellbalanced process to clean up the pcs auditing track she full dress parade would be to assess all the people who the pc is having arc breaks with take the best reading one and run it in the above commands this moves the valence out dont run it very long on any of these terminals or its dangerous use it especially on terminals who are connected to the pc but object to scientology if you put ritual ahead of getting auditing done you would be wrong every time form can get in your road the time for using perfect form is when everything is going well the whole world of diplomacy is world of form rather than doingness the idea that the safe thing to do is to adhere to 89ritual because then you are not responsible is the whole basis of diplomacy if you think form will get you out of trouble where you need wit you are wrong always put getting the job done ahead of doing it by the rules the rules will only fit majority of cases being well trained to use form doesnt excuse you from being clever when necessary staying within the auditors code 6109c20 shspec56 q and period what is knowable to the pc why do you get reaction on the meter at all that which is in the ken of reaction is in the knowledge of the pc that which will react is knowable an emeter can only react on those things which are instantly and immediately restimulated by the preclear himself the reason why you assess for an engram is not to find the hottest charge the reason you assess is to find out what is real to the pc what the pc can connect with emeters always used to be backed up with clever interrogation this is especially true in sec checks if something reacts it is real dont enforce reality on the pc contrary to what the pc says groupers give the pc an apparency that all time has jammed grouper is number of incidents becoming apparently located in one time instant the collapse of track that the pc experiences when they hit him doesnt in fact occur in session it occurred at some earlier track point the anatomy of grouper is commonly coldinstalled vacuum associated with implants person who has grouper has implanted people the only thing which can mash electricity like that is cold vacuum you could brainwash someone by smashing dry ice in his face and holding it there his bank would collapse cold is extreme stillness time is temperature temperature equals time equals motion therefore you must not run nomotion particularly near grouper so all you can run in the vicinity of grouper is motion and time it doesnt necessarily work fast add unknownness to that and it really gets interesting you could ask when was the time unknown to you what havent you known about time what time was unknown to what person has time been unknown what motion wouldnt you care to undertake gives motion and restraint or what motion was unknown which runs surprises and produces mean somatics the grouper will look like its stacking up and getting worse matter what you are doing but its not thats just the apparency you could relieve the grouper by running out the auditor and the session where he hit it all you have to do to free up grouper is to find the picture that the pc isnt grouped in and run it this rehabs his confidence in his ability to run pictures what does grouper look like like an art gallery all of whose pictures were thrown in heap and glued there the incident which produces one is like this rocket jockey lying on bed being hit by electronic rays so as to prevent him from exteriorizing and going back to running one of those planes thats been strafing the capitol they do an implant in which he thinks hes being hit by moving rays when implant they move in cold vacuum on him and plow it straight into his body thetan doesnt move out of that easily especially if hes done it to others the incident is of person lying on bed with pictures flying at him in running it keep the pcs attention on the bed not the pictures find whether hes administering the implant or getting it keep his attention on the bed and off the pictures use what dont you know about that patient etc you can unveil grouper by running arc break straightwire flatten this before starting to run the grouper and always assess engrams dont take one up just because the pc seems in it dont run the grouper get the pc out of it pc is so fixated on it he is so sure it happened in session that he thinks the session should cure it it was intended when put there to keep the person from getting out of it what kind of person applies groupers just about everyone in space opera is liable to decide the enemys habit of exteriorizing from body thats been shot down getting new body etc must be stopped he must be made to forget the information specialized implanting was the answer the most antipathetic things about the implant are that its cold lonely black etc put those things together and you get grouper someone whos alone in his scout craft for few years has only his own pictures to look at hell selfaudit space itself does lot of brainwashing you hit meteorite shower and suddenly youre in space falling into the sun having just been hit with redhot object this mades hefty engram when they implant the guy its presented as big arc break betrayal etc he gets the implant and never knows if they are his pictures or theirs the pictures will all be of class hell be sure theyre not his which is nice trick he disowns them he takes responsibility 90for it he dramatizes the irresponsibility by saying it happened in the session and he can do nothing about it but you can always find other pictures he can run and some day hell run the overt side of it grouper turns on with big somatic that makes the pc very uncomfortable this somatic can be turned off with what was unknown about that pain thats very good assist too pc whos gone into grouper can be hard to audit so its good thing to find out what hes in when running engrams look at why youre running particular engram its on terminal chain and should be run as what dont you know about it etc youre trying to get the pc as you to run package called valence the engram is the engram of the valence the pc is in so you should mention it while running it if you found as terminal looper you should use that in running it as what wasnt known to looper this also applies to running groupers its more serious problem when you have pc whos in grouper and you dont know his goal or terminal well go ahead and find the goal and terminal running engrams in scientology you run them more symbolically than verbally the same mechanisms are present as in book i bouncers groupers deniers callback etc you should use this trick when you find still picture direct the pcs attention to the motion on the other side of it or just before or after the egyptian area is bad one to get into because its confusing and violates the pcs beliefs it was space opera from one end to the other it was battleground between two space groups pcs have trouble running it because it violates their reality as gotten from history books lrh ran an incident of egyptians printing books of orders of the day from the invader force he knew there must be motion and sure enough he found battle after the death of the pharoah always audit the motion the heat never call for the still or the cold and youll keep your pc out of groupers it is what happens in the picture the picture is held in place by an avoidance of motion or notknownness on the subject of motion not by someone saying stay there you audit the motion not the words and not stillnesses 6109c21 shspec57 smoothness in auditing if an auditor keeps going for total perfection in his auditing he will miss the state of acceptable mediocrity in his frantic figurefigure desperation for technical perfection it is better to do some personalized auditing with majority of rightnesses and have wins the pc forgives anything but auditing if the auditor is worried about the ritual instead of getting in comm with the pc the pc has person to talk to and goes out of session if the pc is already starting to tell you about his case before you get him in the chair dont worry about the formal procedures just audit the pc the session starts when the pc recognizes you as the auditor not when you say start of session difficulties in starting sessions always come because the auditor doesnt recognize the start of session the pc may be leery of going into session because hes been denied sessions too often but you can handle it with ruds if you see that pc is interested in his case and starting to talk to you about it youll see hes in session if if happens in public say im sorry heres my card come see at 200 tuesday this will work to have him not be arc broken lrhs difficulty is getting people out of session not into session if you work very hard to start session youll have corresponding amount of trouble doing it how do you handle the situation of the pc telling you before youve started the session about his case you hear him out but not all the way theres difference between just listening to the pc and auditing the pc the liability of letting pc run on and on is that hell lower his havingness and slip downtone auditing consists in directing the attention of the pc your questions are what direct his attention to where you want him how do you interrogate you should have knowledge enough of the mind to know what to ask be smooth dont arc break him if hes nattering away about something you want to get him to look at his own overt you dont get far with direct what did you do you can always ask when did it all start you dont want to shift the pcs attention too abruptly you can ask him question he cant answer immediately and put him in the chair during his comm lag youve got to size up the situation obnose 91what needs handling and direct his attention there youll seem very smooth to the pc if you can shift his attention deftly without his awareness of being pushed around this gives you altitude you may be weak at directing the pcs attention because you have low reality on the pcs ability to direct it himself his attention must at one time have been restraining factor for keeping things from coming in on him when we get on the subject of something hes been restraining from coming in on him the pcs attention wanders or disperses because he cant control it because it has been overwhelmed thats what aberrated him if the auditor doesnt direct his attention it will be directed by the valence hes in and the valence will do god knows what with it if you leave session on automatic youre asking for it to be taken over by the valence dont blame the pc who has very little energy to exercise at this point for what goes wrong in the session you can almost predict how hell react once you know his terminal if you lose control of the session how do you direct the pcs attention the pc has put his hope for survival which is totally useless since he cant help surviving in beingness valence to do it for him so these beingnesses have lot of survival mixed up in them once you have survival on via however it becomes succumb valences actions are usually out of time it is incapable of change because its characteristics are all set for survival ie continuing unchanged past civilizations have tried to use punishment to change valence that doesnt work if you do break the valence you have nothing not even person an operating valence is better than nothing but person is far better genetic entity is super packaged valence meat body isnt necessarily bad body form it should be possible to smash it into wall without even bruising it if you can heal body with an assist it must have been the thetan who was perpetuating the process of destruction theres real liability in running meat body in our mechanized society unless one is in body oriented to fighting lions fixed condition of valence which is unchangeable and out of date will make an unhappy person medicine has never been able to handle readjustment of beings or handling valences processing does have an effect of valences which will object to it the most basic processes dont clear someone unless his valence gets audited out the pc is unaware of being who he is being the valence is of help to him it is an addiction to some skill and beingness package you cant excel when operating as valence because it is nonsentient operation an operation in the absence of knowingness when thetan is overwhelmed and has totally given up so that he becomes the valence that did him in he cant even do good job as that valence because of his own overts against that valencebeingness the pcs basic impulse toward the valence is destruction of the valence every time the thetan wakes up even slightly in situation requiring decision it will be destructive decision for the valence this should make your job as an auditor very easy youll also understand the activities of men better and what you are trying to do is to direct the pcs attention toward eradication of all the points on the track which made him slave to valence if you fail to direct his attention theres nothing else there if you overwhelm him hell dramatize the valence the more you know about the valence the easier it is to audit the pc and to predict what the valence will do so when the pc does that you know youd better get ruds in you need ways to observe the pc to know better when hes out of session if hes in the valence that he dramatizes he has rudiment out you dont necessarily put ruds in at the exact point you see it if hes in the middle of some engram youd do better to direct his attention to keep control from the valence anything youre doing which detracts from directing the pcs attention overcoming valences rehabilitating the thetan so he can operate again is utterly unnecessary dont worry about directing your attention and your technical perfection do direct the pcs attention fortunately auditor and pc very rarely have the same terminal 6109c26 shspec58 teaching the field sec checks one can always add to sec checks but never subtract from it for given person depending on his interests and activities this gets complicated enough to be real to someone whos having difficulty in life there are lots of different sec checks for instance you could use the childrens sec check to help restore persons memory of childhood and get all the results freudian psychiatry sought 92if an auditor can run some process with great confidence of good results have him run that on every pc regardless of what the pc needs you try not to give him pc who can only be run on something else on sec checks you get fast wins this gives an auditor reality fast any auditor who has gotten tired of auditing or upset with auditing has had lot of loses someone who doesnt want to learn how to audit has had long series of disasters with trying to help people an auditor who has an exaggerated idea about what ought to happen in session who gets frantic changes processes continually has had loses with auditing so you want to give him something that gets fast result in order to restore their confidence in their ability to help sec check is good way to get results on pcs who just never cognite who never give you what do you know about their cases especially if you use sec checks that hit on the pcs particular areas you can even cure psychosomatic illness by using the ptp of long duration as the subject of the sec check looking for hidden standards which is the one thing on which his attention is fixed you pay attention when the pc tells you what would have to happen for him to know scientology works which could be something on any of the eight dynamics when you get one that is extensional ie where something would have to happen to someone else youll find that it is easy to audit this on sec check you get all their overts on the other terminal with it this works very well because youre separating valences and terminals withholds add up to lots more than just withholds overts secrecies individuations and games conditions were asking the person to straighten out his relationships with another terminal the normal sec check is addressed to the individual versus his society or family because its what people would consider reprehensible that makes it withhold you could have special mores between husband and wife or auditor and pc if person transgresses against moral code he individuates if he individuates too obsessively he snaps terminals and becomes it the security check clears this all up to get rid of chronic somatic you must first find something the person really thinks is wrong that he wants to recover from you cant assume that if its wrong he wants it fixed it could well be solution to some other problem it could be service fac this generally starts somewhere way back with some series of withholds illnesses are protests against life so you can tailor sec check to reach the areas of life the person is protesting against and run it the psychosomatic illness will disappear it does take lot of figurefigure and detective work the sort of problem about case that many auditors just love so get the thing the person wants to handle trace it back to some area or activity you are looking for activities which had to do with changing the position of mass the massier it is and the more change of positions the more aberrative it is sec check the persons handling of masses and changes of space if you have clue on that go into his most confused motional areas if hes now motionless find what he was doing prior to becoming so motionless and find an area of intolerable activity run sec check on that area of activity get all the items and terminals in that area and invent all possible overts against them crude way to do it is to use modification of an existing sec check it is better still to mock up new one using all the crimes you could do in an area of tight mores you could handle someone whose goal is to fix up his memory both by what wouldnt you mind forgetting plus ow on various terminals with deficient perception plus find who didnt remember well or who insisted he remember and sec check him on those people this will spring him into his what do you know on the subject you can assume if he doesnt cognite that hes really pinned down on the area by withholds from you from the area and even from himself the sec check will increase his freedom to know which is the opposite of the notknowingness enforced by ow so make list of all the items you can think of from his area of difficulty ask if hes done anything to or interfered with those items and activities his cognition may come out little by little or at last with bang the rule is that any zone of life with which person is having difficulty is fruitful area for security check any area where the person is having difficulty hes stupid stupidity is notknowingness which occurs through overts but the overt has to be hidden so its withheld so withholds add up to stupidity so he has trouble in the area you must always assume psychosomatic difficulty is solution after the fact of confusion confusion consists of change of position of particles in time and space predicted or unpredicted if 93they are unpredicted changes in space youll have confusion the pc puts attention on one particle as stable datum this is fine except that he ends up with psychosomatic complaint to resolve the complaint find the prior confusion and do good security check on the things in the vicinity of the confusion to get off the overts that made it necessary to pull in the somatic all sec checks add up to very thorough keyouts 6109c27 shspec59 q and period state of beingness an overt act is an effort to individuate or withhold self from something you cut comm with the thing postulate separateness use effort to withhold self get involved with it and become it 1 cut comm with something 2 postulate separateness 3 use effort to withhold self 4 get involved with it 5 become it whenever you are avoiding something youll be making energy pictures of it whenever you see it so the bank gets full of the thing you are avoiding and youll start being it you never look at the pictures of the thing so they dont asis so they can become rather dominant you have to have postulated that the thing can overwhelm you before this sequence can start when you start auditing somebody he cant see that he has done anything to the objects he is being but as he confronts more he can individuate himself from his pictures valences start to separate and on sec checking he will come up with more withholds an individual is not responsible for the things that have overwhelmed him to the point where he is being them processing lets him asis some of his pictures so that he can stop being the thing and see that he has overts against it so getting more withholds on subsequent sec checks is an index of case progress theta clear is someone who operates exterior to body without need of body theta clears are clear on all dynamics the state of mest clear has been upgraded because of the stability of the state operating thetan is different state clear would be someone who didnt have bank troubling him and was not influenced in favor of one dynamic over another and not dependent on mest for survival ot would be someone who is in state of being quite manipulative of mest starter of whirlwinds etc this doesnt necessarily mean hes unaberrated the best statement of this definition is that ot someone who has consequences connected with creation it has been state which others have feared and have sought to suppress theres fourth state which is release this is when youve found the pcs goal terminal and level and run sec check on him when release has the idea that his new freedom is really betrayal he hasnt quite made it he must know he wont get any worse mest clear is one who has completed routine 3 he has persistent fn hed have to have had his ptp of long duration handled the common denominator of all cases that have bodies is that their attitudes of havingness are incorrect they have anxieties about getting food air etc you clear clear of hunger clear tends to go onto the fourth dynamic with crash he gets very aware of the need to do something about it clears tend to lead and infect people with their enthusiasm the only problem is that the clears reality is beyond that of the surrounding populace the most you can realistically do is to get them started and have an hgc to clear them the clear will go on past awareness of the problems of the fourth dynamic to the fifth seventh and eighth then back to the sixth by this time hell be upwards towards theta clear if at this point he felt there was need to do something about mankind hed do it eg straightening out peoples games conditions etc the best thing you can do for society is to rehabilitate knowingness so people can work things out for themselves those solutions which restore comprehension are the only ones which really work in the long run the more people who are responsible able to decide able to tell right from wrong the better things will be person has as much power as he can trust himself to have at the lower and of the spectrum you have criminal who responds only to exterior stimuli in this case theres sentience left so where many people are 94at this level all you get in confusion the randomity of mest the police make the error of granting him more beingness than is warranted the trouble is that society is rigged for people to be responsible in if there are large numbers of people being irresponsible in it its hard to see how it can go on running if you want to disestablish chaos all you need to do is to return responsibility to the area 6109c28 shspec60 grades of auditors describes three classes of auditors for details see p 152 below and hcopl 29sep61 hgc allowed processes when you run into the imponderables the pc whose case doesnt move youre tempted to use some extraordinary solution instead of finding the gross auditing error this permits the error to go uncorrected youll be adding new errors to old ones the error may be that the pc isnt doing the auditing command which could involve the pc doing something different or doing something else in addition to it if the pc has hidden standard hell do something else to produce an effect on his hidden standard when pc has ptp of long duration hell always try to create an effect on it with whatever auditing command has been given so you cant just audit over it you have to get ruds in and also be curious to know what the pc is doing with the command the pc with ptp of long duration will apply the auditing command not to his terminal but to terminal of his problem it is good idea to ask the pc what his idea is of the terminal he is running to be sure its the one you assessed now that you have the rule of the prior confusion you have an undercut to the ptp of long duration the terminal the pc is complaining of is the solution to the prior confusion and is stillness motion point you dont audit stillnesses anyway you get rid of the chronic somatic by finding the prior confusion by assessment take the personnel of the prior confusion and sec check them this is bit similar to doing ow on the terminal of the ptp but better since it is auditing confusion not stillness this might even apply to engrams you could find where the fellow is stuck assess the prior confusion and sec check its terminals thats just guess at present dont q and with the pc telling you he cant confront the confusion get the terminals involved and sec check them on check made up to apply to the possible overts general ow may be too permissive to get him to confront it so thats the anatomy of stuck point on the track this also predicts that lot of confusion went on before the person picked up the valence hes in theres possibility that you might get the valence and goal to blow by looking at it but its not likely the earlier on the track they were the beefier they were as thetans and the more confusion there would be it gets pretty unreal when you get them looking at it now if they can even confront it at all other gross auditing errors which could be preventing the pc from making progress could be grossly out ruds or the auditor having an attitude that drives the pc out the bottom or try to audit scientologist who has been around awhile without sec checking him on the auditors sec check and the last couple of pages of hcoww form 3 6110c04 shspec61 the prior confusion chronic somatic is the stuck point on the time track which is the stable datum of prior confusion so is hidden standard its easy to miss this because the confusion is earlier and is confusing the stable datum isnt in the middle of it if its aberrative you can always adopt stable datum in the middle of confusion its the one chosen later that sticks you on the track this isnt necessarily logical it is true because it is observed to be true not because of any theoretical reason the way to blow the chronic somatic is to blow the confusion immediately before its start it may be tricky to get the pc to look at the confusion not at the stable datum his attention bounces to later periods the confusion has lot of unknownness in it which may be masked by lot of pretended knowingness when looking for the prior confusion dont get just whatever was there right before it may be six months earlier lots of odd forgettingness turns up as you look forgettingness is caused be inability to confront motion the confusion area is notknow area which the guy handles with know later even if its stupid and painful its still knowingness all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cure for mysteries 95one can get feeling of relief following confusion that isnt really much relieved it can be just from getting knownness following confusion chronic somatic can be knowingness if its being used as hidden standard it is being used for knowingness there must have been some confusion before it this could be an explanation for the phenomenon of getting somatics following misunderstood words it can take some time for the pc to sort out when the somatic started and what the prior confusion was about when it started you can ask when did you notice it earlier or what happened before you noticed its not repetitive command you can even by assessment get the pc to look at the confusion accurately enough so it will asis and blow where the pc is not making progress on routine 3 you can bet that the pc has not done and is not doing the auditing command the pc may be being the auditing command he does the command and applies it to some area of the mind or body and looks at it to see if anything happened you are auditing pc whose attention is fixed on some special area and is doing something extra with the command it indicates outruds since the pc isnt under the auditors control but is putting in self audit step on each cycle any pc who hasnt gone clear in 150 hours is doing this he may resist telling the auditor what hes doing also if you ask him when did you start to notice the thing hes complaining of and he gives non sequitur answer you can see him bounce out of the confusion and up to pt this tells you that you are on the right track you have to direct his attention to the right area to get the confusion dont just give him carte blanche to natter about the terminal hes fixated on keep guiding him to the occluded area that precedes the somatic or whatever ask about confusions or upsets or whatever you can get this sounds like long process this phenomenon can show up when you run an engram you start with the motionless point and search around to find the earlier action parts just auditing the motionless part with the chronic somatic in it wont resolve it even when running an ordinary engram as part of routine 3 if part of the engram sticks get the earlier part of the engram more basic question arises here how does person get stuck on the track in the first place and why is one on time track at all could it be that theres confusion at the beginning what is time maybe its retreat from confusion we did not care to confront persons ability to confront confusion could just blow chronic somatics but its not to be counted on it might be necessary to get several hidden standards out of the way so it might be well to clean them up well before getting into prehave levels using prior confusion assessments and sec checks 6110c04 shspec62 moral codes what is withhold one is nonsecurity checkable its just necessary to find the areas where he has what he considers to be overts if he doesnt read on standard sec check it just means those things arent transgressions against his moral code criminals moral code is about the reverse of lawabiding persons all pcs have moral codes against which they have transgressed youll only get withholds off case when you locate the code against which the pc has transgressed withhold is an unannounced transgression against moral code by which the person was bound moral code is that series of agreements to which person has subscribed in order to guarantee the survival of group man has learned down the track that where he has agreed on proper conduct he has survived and where he hasnt he hasnt survived so people agree on what is moral ie survivalconducive actions the us was founded on an agreement the constitution wherever it has been breached the country has gotten in trouble the reason for the trouble is that there arent any other agreements than the basic agreement there arent modified agreements you start with moral code which eventually gets interpreted and altered and people longer knew what was moral it thus got to be confusion people tried to enforce it but the confusion increased finally people dispersed and left the group and formed or entered other groups there they got new moral codes which eventually got diluted time marched on and more confusion entered etc etc 96the cycle of action of civilizations is 1 an agreement on optimum conduct 2 disbanding of the group 3 formation of new group with new agreement on optimum conduct 4 disintegration of this agreement the disintegration occurs because of the individuation that results from overts moral codes can also disintegrate when attacked by another code that gets imposed on them eg by colonialists on native peoples one reason auditors find scientologists harder to audit than nonscientologists is that when you flub youve transgressed against the survival codes of the group this is why the last two pages of hcoww form 3 straighten out oldtime scientologists who natter about scientology the most important code to the person is the one by which he is currently living if you transgress against the code of your group you tend to feel like an outsider if the group is scientology the transgression prevents one from making progress in auditing transgression of moral code separates the transgressor from free communication with the group the seriousness of the transgression is monitored by the degree of cut comm and impossibility of communicating which is accomplished by pretending to be member of the group when hes transgressed he individuates and thus the group disintegrates another element of this is coaction mutual action toward common goal the crew of ship is good until it has been through some common danger business group could get cohered if management let everyone in on the attacks against them otherwise not group becomes group when it encounters danger to its survival the common denominator of the moral codes and of transgression is one must not injure the survival of fellow group member therefore manager or leader of group tends to be isolated from the group because of the occasional necessity for injuring the survival of group member who has transgressed against the others if the leader has led slightly detached life so he hasnt been affected by the offenders transgressions he commits an unmotivated overt when he kicks him out he gets these undisclosed overts against ex group members he seldom tells the group why the ousted group member has to be ousted because he thinks it will be too enturbulative this is so widely true that man has accepted the idea of the loneliness of command as natural when it isnt you can change groups leader but if the new leader changes the mores of the group there will be trouble the leader of the group can destroy it this leads to the popularity of such things as socialism and communism why is the old soldier always degraded its not because the military in itself is bad its because hes group member who is longer part of the group his old mores longer apply he is degraded not even because of his overts he is degraded because when person is longer part of group he feels automatically that he must have overts against it and was driven out of it even if he didnt have any overts because the result exists people feel that the crime must have existed people will feel responsible for effects they havent really caused this is the same mechanism so youll find yourself processing someone at times who feels he has tremendous overts against group which you as an auditor cant find on the meter its simply because he is longer member of the group whose purpose may have ended hell be very happy to get off his transgressions because it will make his longer being member ok it justifies the state hes in what actions are necessary to cohere group coaction in the direction of survival with two or more people inevitably results in social more if one of the group dies the other in group of two will feel he must have transgressed and will be glad to find what his overts were so that it makes sense to be longer member the coaction doesnt even have to be toward mutual survival it can be opposed eg two fighter pilots who are enemies they will have certain fellowfeeling and if they 97withhold their failure to kill the other from their own groups theyve got bit individuated from the groups etc so this gets complex on the basis of agreement what is agreement it is two or more people making the same postulate stick if they go into mutual action toward survival they have coaction and they confuse one with another they dont quite distinguish whose is whose and they misown action in their vicinity engine drivers start sounding like engines after awhile they can be unidentified by having them get the idea of mutual action with the motor that is the source of overt acts you have mutual action with something else you do something cruel to that with which you have mutual action and you experience the somatic thats the exact mechanics of the overtmotivator sequence after youve had lot of group coaction you embark upon cruel action to that with which you have coacted and you will get the somatic the group dramatizes it with you must be punished for your act but thats not part of the mechanism religionists who push the golden rule are forcing into existence something that already exists overtmotivator sequences become very pronounced when cruel actions against ones group members ars engaged in while withholding one is really member of the group but engages in cruel action against another member and tries to back out why does one try to withhold it is because he doesnt want the effect of the coaction he tries to individuate disowns the coaction in an effort to avoid the motivator he doesnt want the somatics of coaction that experience has taught him will inevitably occur were down to fundamentals of nondifferentiation and identification he identifies his action with every group members action so he withholds self in an effort to escape if you ask him to recognize his coaction with the group member he has injured the coaction prior to the overt the overt will blow the more commotion action withholds and nonsense preceded his overt act the more it will hang up and the more he will try to withhold it he can only suffer from his overt because of former coaction because he is involved with mutual action toward survival every time he has tried to back out of mutual action he has sought to deny the mutuality of the action he thinks he can avoid the overtmotivator sequence by denying it so he individuates you have to knock out the individuation before he can walk out the action he takes to escape punishment is the action which settles in the punishment withholds and overts will become visible as you uncover the confusion and coaction which preceded the overt when he blows the withhold he can move again on the time track every time he withholds he parks himself on the time track so it eventually becomes one big now which is the reactive mind he has never really succeeded in individuating from any group he has belonged to therefore all groups newly formed are formed by transgressors so if scientologists could get off that mechanism they could form the first true group since the beginning of the universe one reason withhold sticks on the track is that its noaction nomotion point when the pc has picture where nothing is happening get the earlier commotion or confusion and the overt will show up one can withhold oneself as well as data thoughts or deeds or objects withhold of self is the commonest when you clear somebody you clear the identities which the person has teamed up with and their withholds and nowimsupposedtos theres process that hits at this find something the person has identified with something tell him to think of mutual action with first the one thing then the other and the identifications will spring apart fifteen or twenty other subjects will emerge as you go dont q and with them stay with the original two broader simpler process would be tell group you are longer part of 6110c05 shspec63 sec checking types of withhold punishment following the revelation of withholds is mechanism of older groups by which they sought to enforce their mores it is bad mechanism since it encourages withholding 98if you the auditor are worried about your own withholds or trying to present an image of sinlessness because youre scientologist youll q and at times with the pcs withholds and start mutual avoidance of certain subjects the auditor must have the courage to ask the sec check questions matter how crude and nasty it seems to do so its rough enough if your withholds are off if they arent youll back off the subject altogether auditors instructors etc can back off from being sec checked because of fear of loss of reputation or image theyll then slack off sec checking other people if you find someone who is ducking being sec checked he will also duck sec checking but it is not true that to be good auditor you must never have done anything wrong if you let yourself take that viewpoint you are surrendering to an oughttobe which action would slow the progress of scientology by putting every good auditor in lousy case shape along with every good exec the mechanism by which man has been governed had in it the idea that man was evil and therefore has to be held in line by evil practices they never noticed that the evil in the world stemmed from holding men in line society without arc is society which will inevitably have crime man is good but only to the degree that he is in arc with existence the primary mechanism someone uses who is out of arc with existence yet trying to survive is to withhold society is forced apart to the degree that people are made guilty to prevent murder dont hang murderers make it unnecessary for people to resign from the human race people get grievances about things theres agency in society to remedy the grievance and they end up committing desperate overts the unintentional withhold is something that occurs when the person is not able to tell anybody though hes willing to this could be because one is there or one is listening it happens in insane asylums all the time you get this peculiar kind of withhold which you mustnt overlook in sec checking then there is kind of withhold where the pc knew that he was withholding because hed be punished if others knew or theres withhold which would damage his beingness or reputation not necessarily doingness thats withheld it could be beingness group is based on communication withholds all add up to cut communication so it falls apart to the degree that there is communication up to point withholds appear to cohere group sec check is dedicated to the restoration of communication if comm were restored totally in any past group the pc will longer be hung in that group he will not be parked on the track so he will be more able to be part of his present group the group you are most concerned with in auditing isnt the group called scientology its the little group which is the session when the individual is too individuated end develops an unintentional withhold in that group or the auditor conducts himself in such way as to bring about punishment because of withhold or crime or demands specious reactions from the pc the auditor has shot the session group auditing is third dynamic activity for the session to be good group youve got to get all three kinds of withholds off 1 unintentional withholds when one will listen to the pc hence the process what werent you able to tell an auditor 2 reputational withholds defense of ones beingness eg ones family came from the wrong side of the tracks 3 withholds for fear of punishment the only thing that can deteriorate graph is arc breaks the basis of an arc break is being made to have an unintentional withhold from that immediate group thats more serious evidently than an intentional withhold as far as session results go then theres the enforced withhold on the basis of improved state someone who is pretending to audit gets result but seeks to convince the pc that hes much better here the pc thinks hed better not say otherwise then youve got the withhold of protecting beingness this is the reputational withhold its pretty rare on this basis but you can also have the propitiative pc who tells the auditor 99its all fine because he doesnt want to make the auditor feel bad when actually he still has his headache or whatever rudiments are aimed at handling these withholds the arc break questions ask for unintentional withholds what couldnt you tell an auditor and what didnt an auditor do the latter question is going after an auditor in games condition unintentional withhold and games condition questions go together compartmenting question you take the words get the charge off them you get reads off any phrases in it then if it still reads the read is on the question never leave question still reading it will throw the pc out of session immediately you can leave it for the next session but tell the pc that thats what you are doing another important point is to select sec check relevant to the pcs activities sec check against the reality of the pc taking into account the moral codes by which he lives never treat sec checking as repetitive process its for getting off withholds so vary the question and be real be inquisitive nosey and imaginative theres an overt act consisting of enforcing the mores of group to make others withhold thats the makeguilty action which also acts as withhold eg girl says i never raped anybody ive been raped and the question keeps reading dont q and by auditing out the rape get the overt which is gotten by whom have you made guilty of rape youll find the makeguilties lie on an actual done anyway so always come back to the original question with the same wording as you first used if pc thinks question is insulting he is telling you that he has done the thing 6110c10 shspec64 problems intensives supposing that dianetics and scientology did everything they were supposed to do what would your problem have been before you came into it your own personal problem that is the approach you should use on pe course give all the firsts of scientology and dianetics give very broad complete description then ask what is the problem that would make you come into scientology this is assuming that everything that was said about scientology was true you restimulate their ptp of long duration then ask what is your problem the problem is now staring them in the face and in some percentage they will for the first time recognize the source of some discomfort then give them some data about processing and get them into the hgc that should be the first lecture on pe course because it gives stable datum conditional but desirable stable datum on certain number you will produce startling change theres new addition to pc assessment sheet it gets you list of things you take the best reading and run list of processes on it reassess the list of thinks and repeat the process it gets the prior confusion and handles it with ruds problems processes and sec check on the personnel in the prior confusion the first list asks for times the pcs life changed ask when the changes occurred each of them will be handled with the problem that existed just prior as well as the prior confusion the change was solution get the changes of lifestyle also the when doesnt have to be very precise now get the bestreading change and ask what problem did you have immediately before that change get him to state the problem not just fact it should have question mystery about it how why or what then just run the problems rud process until flat eg when the somatic that got going quiets down it gets at the ptp of long duration which gives hidden standards run it by the ta after it is flat ask what was the confusion in your life just before that then assess the people in that confusion the idea of listing and asking for another person in the confusion will put the pc back in the confusion and stop him from skidding forward and youll wind up with list of personnel you sec check the list this requires some acumen to mock up the sec check its really glorified ow and you could just run ow except that it has some danger since its running against terminal which hasnt been assessed so its better to sec check if terminal is not on goals line running it can beef up case unless run on sec check the sec check neednt be awfully extensive though doing it very thoroughly will give better result you continue the process with the next bestreading change etc when all is done we could say that the person was release and has hidden standards and would do auditing commands this fully supplants routine 1a as way to handle problems 100the reason you are handling hidden standards is not because the individual has his attention stuck someplace nor because the pc vias your auditing commands through it though these things are true you are running it because to the pc its an oracle hes not really analytically checking his eyesight every session to see if auditing is making it better his eyesight somatic knows and thats the only data there is observation and experience have bearing on his knowingness its more than ptp of long duration of specialized sort its pretty vicious proposition the pc does it every command or every session if he does it every command it knows and he doesnt so he has to consult it to find out he does it in life all the time too unbeknownst to you he judges goodness and badness truth and falsity by whether he gets somatic which comes from some circuit or other criminal knows right from wrong because circuit is restimulated or not therefore the cops are crazy because the little green light in his skull lit up when he was about to commit his crime hes baffled when hes arrested he knows nobody can tell right from wrong or he knows by the way he feels whether hes doing right or wrong the way people get that way is thus 1 they are thetan as themselves 2 they get so invalidated or invalidate others so much that they get overwhelmed with their own inval and they pick up valence 3 somatic overwhelm while being the valence he got hell of somatic an impact is easily substituted for knowingness it can also seem to be punishment for some unknown crime so hes got terrible problem what has he done to be punished for it he doesnt know he just feels guilty anyway impact seems like knowingness ones own knowingness as valence is in validated so hes got an impact knowingness which he keeps around which is part of an engram on his goalsterminal chain the engram presents problem because it is not reachable because its in the middle of the goalsterminal chain since the pcs own knowingness has been invalidated he can only go on being validated in his knowingness as circuit but he has to be careful because it knows more than he does superstitious peoples who have very little and have been knocked around badly have catalogs of superstitions which are sort of third dynamic circuits this moves out into secondary state the circuit is now audible it dictates to him gives him orders aloud this is the final result of valence which has been overwhelmed by somatic which has been overwhelmed by another thinkingness etc see fig 4 it is not an endless number of valences but there can be nearly endless number of hidden standards real hidden standard is something the pc consults with each command or each session consults is the clue the hidden standards key in because of problems of magnitude or because of prior confusion the usual course of human events is the individual went through lot of trouble and lot of confusion he couldnt quite figure any part of it out and it left him hung with problem which he up and solved by changing his life in some way he may get the idea when theres change there must have been problem before there isnt always problem otherdetermined changes dont necessarily have problems before them but they wont assess on the meter he solves the problem with hidden standard where does circuit come from theyre different from valences valence answers the question of who to be or how to be right with beingness circuit answers the question without changing beingness how do you know when youre right circuit furnishes information valence furnishes beingness circuit can step up from furnishing information to furnishing orders and then it can step up to furnishing orders below the level of consciousness always expressed faintly at least in somatics most people live in haunted houses they think there are other thetans in their bodies because of the commands of circuits circuit can be set up easily and isnt bad thing unless its out of his control forgotten as to authorship etc controlling the fellow with him taking responsibility for it thetan can do anything circuit can do and more the basic of circuit trouble is setting something up and taking responsibility and leaving it on automatic if hes done this he has some godawful problem just before he did it just before he has the problem he was in fantastic confusion and before the confusion he had fantastic numbers of withholds from the people in the confusion those conditions 101must all be present to get circuit trouble and you have to pay attention to all of them to unravel the circuits to get into that state hed have to have been pretty active and to have started withholding everything from everybody he was in contact with about everything or about something special hes not free to communicate things start going wrong since his comm is messed up life got very confused eventually became an awful problem then he solved the problem if he had enough overts and withholds hed blow which brought about change the change is now the tag you can use to get back to all the stuff behind it dwindling spiral of circuit formation 1 the thetan being as himself 2 he gets invalidatedoverwhelmed as himself 3 he picks up valence 4 the valence gets overwhelmed by somatic 5 the valences knowingness is invalidated 6 the pc as the valence sets up circuit to use the impact knowingness of the somatic as senior source of knowledge so he can go on being validated in his knowingness the circuit now does the observing and knowing 7 the circuit becomes audible 8 the circuit gives orders 9 the circuit gives orders below the level of consciousness always expressed at least faintly in somatics the point of change is withdrawal so is the original ow both key in circuits cf page 47 where lrh points out that circuits are substitute for confront and gives more data about what circuits are used for the whole story is repetitive outofcommunication with periscope that looks for him and tells him thats the hidden standard seen as circuit experience must not approach this person and since auditing is an experience he never allows it to approach you are trying to audit the person not the via thus case gain is slow at best the problems intensive hits all this and knocks the circuits out of the road it can be done with imprecise auditing and it starts with pc assessment which is less accusative to the new pc than sec check assessment he gets familiar with sec checks on gradient dealing with specific people interesting areas to him it makes practically any level of case processable and can be done by the most selfconscious auditor 6110c11 shspec65 problems intensive assessment the pc assessment form is of vast use to the auditor to know what is going on is the pcs life if you have new pc new to scientology do one even if the pc is just new to you do one it gives the pc some confidence to know that his auditor knows something about him it should be done by the auditor who is going to audit that pc this will relieve the pcs sneaking suspicion that the auditor knows nothing about him if the pc knows about something it isnt aberrative so this is negative assessment since whatever is known there isnt aberrative number of times divorced is an important one especially if it doesnt correlate with number of times married since youve then got big withholds to get off educational level is another area for withholds pcs can be ashamed of how little or how much theyve had jobs accidents illnesses this starts to get into an interesting zone engrams he never mentions watch out for restimulation in these areas if you ask any details about them this can throw the pc right into engrams the auditor gets data while doing this form that tempts him to take things up with the pc but dont do it acknowledge and go on without creating an arc break dont let the pc talk his havingness down in the accidents and illnesses area if the pc is very chatty give him an rfactor beforehand that you only want to know briefly about each thing the some applies to the present physical condition were very interested in whether there are any withheld physical conditions or worries about health they havent told anyone or diseases theyd hate to have anyone know about pump the pc get all the withholds off because this is serious withhold on the case on mental treatment be equally sure to get off any withholds it would be not ok to be getting other treatment physical or mental at the same time as auditing the usual cause of high tone arms on pcs who leave with low ta and come back with high ta is some withhold about their physical condition or concurrent mental treatment or some bug on the subject of the mind get the withholds off on the subject or you wont be his auditor because he wont be willing to talk to you if you do get them off youll be his auditor because you know things about him one else knows 1026110c12 shspec66 problems rockslams always take precedence over other needle phenomena rockslam is very badly overrun flow rise on the other hand means nothing because you dont know what turned it off its latent response to something that exceeded the pcs reality so you cant tell where it come from the rise means something it means the pc isnt going to confront something but you cant spot what so its not worth pursuing also the pc wouldnt respond to auditing of it anymore since its beyond his reality sometimes when the pc has an arc break all the needle will do is rise when you get ruds in the needle wont rise much note that on running problems intensive you get the problem before the change it can turn out to be problem hes had for hundreds or millions of years so dont ask for the confusion before the problem you want the confusion before the thislifetime change you must realize that the only reason that people move slowly and get parked on the track or anything else is that problems become timeless the timelessness of problems composed the reactive mind people and organizations are slow he degree that they have problems they cant solve they are inactive to the degree that they have problems they cant solve most of their actions are reactive every new action adds into the old problem to the point of feeling it doesnt matter what we do also the magnitude of the problem can make any other nonconnected thing seem very trivial other peoples reality is viewed apathetically since hes so overwhelmed that he cant look at it matter how immediate it is such people react to everything in life this way its an apparent apathy which is apathy toward life the person being in terrific agony about the problem he cant even articulate what the problem is if you ask him to take his attention off the problem he knows itll eat him up he has attention to spare for you or for auditing you often have pc who is escaping from present time by being in the past you can make mistake by believing hed audit better on his terminals line so you should skip ruds and any thislifetime difficulties and just go back on the line the pc is back on the line because its safer one of the symptoms of that is the pc who never gets picture pictures are dangerous they became dangerous at some time in the past possibly during session getting rudiments in on someone can turn on his pictures rudiments can show someone who has never had auditing that life is solvable at these little finite points its characteristic of pc who is in apathy that he has got to solve it all at once now move the apathy off and youll get the franticness they wont do the available auditing command youve given them theyll take it and make it something to resolve their whole case by one answer why because their whole track is collapsed the fact that problems are timeless and problems join to problems makes it all timeless explosive stratum and anything that explosive about which they worry that much must be solved explosively desperate solution for desperate problem which occurs at one point people look for one command one magic word which will make the pc go clear this becomes what the pc wants when he cant do any of the little things in desperation he will have to do one of the big ones auditing however is done by gradients it depends for success on reaching reality pc can tolerate getting to picture the pc can see at this moment of time in session what the pc really can do are little gradients youve got to find the gradient which is real to the pc something confrontable not the explosive right now effect there are people with frantic desire to have lots of money right now they may have fantastic schemes to get it very unworkable ones if you asked them how much money could you have and sorted it out on the meter youd find that while they said oh millions the amount that would be real to them would be farthing nickel something so small that they dont make that coin its the other side of the circle they think in terms of millions while they get poorer and poorer and poorer the case that has to have total change now and the case that makes change now are almost the same case the case that just sits there apathetically knows that there cant be big enough change or big enough effect right now to solve his problems so hes given up on the idea that anything is going to happen at all he has cancelled all this out he is on lower rung than that he cant have change because theres change tiny enough until you figure out what it is 103how did he get into this state by having problems that were so overwhelming that he must keep his attention on them all the time and he knows nothing could be done about them but they are terribly important but you have to do something about them but nothing can be done about them so that everything else in life is trivial including your auditing command your command has nothing to do with his problems unless you have his exact problem in which case your commands will have something to do with his case thats actually the only process that will work on him the whole of this problems intensive is to find where the pc is stuck and what problem hes looking at the trick is he doesnt know or he wouldnt be overwhelmed with it the problems he glibly tells you arent it proper assessment will get you the right one not one with lot of figurefigure and musthavebeen the clue to this is that hes figuring from different time band and the real problem is this moment in time the time band of the pc its now if the pc were looking at the problem he is stuck in he wouldnt say person who would have had that problem then because he is in then hes in that problem and other pc who is arc breaking or getting apathetic during goals or terminal assessment is doing it because youre taking his attention off the only thing its safe to keep it on which is the problem hes stuck in if his ruds are very well in and he has lot of confidence in the auditor you can do it and hell feel fine but he still has his attention on the problem now when you try to run his prehav level on the terminal it takes too much attention so he puts that on via so he can keep his attention on the problem he is arc breaky and gets upset or hes apathetic and just grinds if hes lower on the scale in this case hell be running with his attention at monotone because most of his attention is glued to problem so horrendous that if it were solved the whole universe would blow up its even too much effort to say what the problem is so it all operates as withhold every time you have an arc breaky pc you have violated to some degree fixation of attention on problems youve asked him to do something he doesnt consider safe and he is protesting having his attention shifted if someone is in this state you have to work like mad to keep his attention centered where it is centered and not shift it around so its about the hottest thing you can do with case to give problems intensive were getting the backtrack problems which slide up and become pt problems of long duration the problems which underlie the hidden standards and the prior confusions which made the hidden and the problems necessary it works because you are putting his attention where it already is so it goes easily auditors blame themselves because pcs arc break so if you can get certainty as an auditor on exactly why session goes wrong and see the exact mechanism and its magnitude exactly when and why session detours if you can see that the pcs attention is fixated on problem of great importance to degree that any shift of attention causes him to go through this arc break phenomenon you will see that all you have done is to disturb his attention you very often have been running pcs with ptps without recognizing any part of it very often pc has unknowingly to himself stated his problem to you many times and you have never heard it as problem so you go ahead and solve it problem is problem it is what the pc is worried about and feels he has to do something about or that he cant do anything about auditing the problems intensive he may give it to you again and youll suddenly recognize it as problem dont feel silly about it but do recognize that there arent problems which should be solved as opposed to being run as far as ptps of long duration are concerned furthermore the problem you think you see some usual problem may well not be the problem at all eg the instructor who has problem with students that turns out to be the problem of not believing auditors can audit including his present auditor so how could he get auditing problems about scientology are of the order of magnitude of withholds on the subject of scientology in terms of stopping case gain the fact that hes in session acts to restimulate the withhold or the problem and everything you are doing restimulated it dont solve his problem about auditing by giving him more or better auditing the pc has ptp and will behave like case with one matter what you do to solve it 6110c17 shspec67 problems intensives procedure heroic measures have been used on the time track when lighter efforts to get into communication have failed brutality follows failed communication overts are always to be found in the wake of communication the auditor who gets annoyed with the pc has just failed to audit the pc he has just failed to get the pc to communicate he has had methodology or he hasnt applied it if this were 104widespread scientology would go the way of all former religions towards ritual and brutality the real overt is not bad auditing its bad dissemination ie bad teaching bad comm of how to apply not insisting that it be done right its your inability to get information from pcs which leads to your not trying to get any which drives you into vicious frame of mind about pcs which drives you into not wanting to audit any at all the auditor who has withholds wont ask for withholds if on top of that he cant get information from the pc and doesnt know how to go about it hell end up not auditing thats why any auditor who is not now auditing isnt auditing hes lost his confidence in his ability to obtain the information necessary to resolve the case as long as you have social mores people will violate them and go out of comm with the group the auditorpc relationship is group and if they are out of comm with group they will tend to be out of comm with all groups youve got to raise their group consciousness before you get an auditorpc relationship so by using the white form you get the withholds off from the sections where they are likely to be concealing anything present physical condition 2d stuff crimes past mental treatment etc all societies set themselves up to be ill because as soon as you have bunch of thoushaltnots you will get the two phenomena of withholds and make guilty so you get people out of comm as ising of those conditions so civilizations grow ill and die when mores are your sole method of being civilized youll get destruction scientology is the first civilization not to operate this way as long as you can get people to talk so that they can asis instead of repressing it you can truly handle the ills of civilizations up to now repression was the only available method someone could prove that civilization was made possible only by this mechanism of withholding and making guilty but only as long as his premise was that man is basically evil you have to process somebody and find they are nicer people than you thought previously before you can accept the idea that another basis for civilization is possible otherwise youd think that if you freed man hed become more evil if you audit someone and see him becoming more vital active polite and freer you dont get the impression that hes more evil at all where an individual has withdrawn out of earlier groups he becomes harder to process in the group called auditorpc and harder to get along with in the group called scientology failed group member doesnt make good group member this applies to this lifetime former lives have an effect but the force comes from the thislifetime groups that he has left you could do sec check on each of the groups they had left to get them going into session more easily pay particular attention to this with people who are renegades from groups which intended to help doctors psychiatrists etc run out his ows on that earlier group you have to be clever to do it because you have to find out the mores of the earlier group so do get all you can on his former groups at least as to what hes been in and left only take selfdetermined changes for the problems intensive processing they dont give you anything to handle eg graduation but eg dropping out of school you would be interested in what you want is his solutions to problems he didnt know he had other determined changes arent his solutions youll get reads on them because they are charged but they are not what you want details on running the process stable datum if you have to remedy havingness lot ruds are out never run stop avoid stills unless youve got movement in the command the mechanics of the prior confusion will hang you up in the stillness if you can get the pc to restate it so its got action in it great preventing type action is questionable but it will run perhaps slowly but better than stop more details on procedure 6110c18 shspec68 valences circuits are all thetans equal some pcs ask all cases are rough but some are rougher than others regardless of equality of thetans however we find that all beings in this area of the universe have the same type of aberration differing only in magnitude of aberration this is contrary to kraepelins 105index of insanity which points out its many different manifestations the only question answered by such classification is that of how aberrations manifest themselves but all aberrations arise from the same causes having only different manifestations and magnitudes the reason why we are clearing people is that we are taking people out by the same route they went in so you have to parallel what the mind is doing it works like this thetan being and acting in this universe loses confidence in himself in his ability to do and to survive having lost that confidence he then assumes an identity which he considers will stand instead of self he himself goes down into degradation what he is overwhelmed by or what he has overwhelmed consistently is adopted by him as package of behavior and that is valence valence is substitute for self taken on after the fact of lost confidence in self as thetan sinks into degradation and lost confidence in self he goes down into personal oblivion so that he has further memory of self but only memory of valence having taken on this valence he then carries it on as mechanism of survival he does life continuum actually of what he has overwhelmed or what has overwhelmed him at the point of degradation you will find it backtracking this way just before he assumed the valence he has problem concerning his own survival that he himself could not solve as himself just before that problem there was tremendous confusion in which by process of overts and withholds he became enturbulated at himself these overts and withholds were against the various dynamics that was the route by which he went in he missed his way and had overts and withholds against the mores of the group in which he was operating and he lost confidence in himself completely he felt he couldnt go on as himself which gave him tremendous problem relating to survival he felt he couldnt solve this problem so he adopted an identity he thought would stand as solution to this problem then he went on as that identity now that identity was in turn submerged by the same cycle as the identity while member of the group the thetan committed overts and had withholds from members of the group which produced an insoluble problem the thetan usually solved the problem by the acceptance not of another valence but of change to another status the cycle is always the same while member of group having certain goals he commits overts and has withholds from other group members from which arises confusion this confusion summates into problem which he then solves by _______ the _______ is the only variable early on the track the thetan always used valence but the common denominator of all his solutions is change this has always been an element that is equally true of the first assumption of valence and of every new lifetime etc the whole of the buddhist concern was the lifedeath cycle the goal of the buddhist is to escape the cycle hes afraid of change because he could become responsible for wider changes this is almost on the principle that if i shirk enough responsibility ill just float out of my head unfortunately it doesnt work it is true that occasionally accidentally thetan can sit down and go out of his head sproingg the way he does it is that he has set up an escape mechanism to spring him out of dead bodies like fighter pilot ejection seat usually they dont work every now and then one works its actually mocked up heavyenergy guillotine pcs think that if they feel enough pain they wont be able to think so they set this up to be triggered by pain at certain time they get enough pain and the guillotine is supposed to knock off the body so people wind up by now with the belief that you have to kill body to get out of it actually unless you had overts on the body you would practically float out of it people who are going around sick may have triggered the ejection mechanism and had it fail to kill the body or eject them its failed solution one of the mechanisms of the series of truths the buddhists believed was that the world was horrible poverty stricken etc the basic truths they put out were so interlarded with these other exaggerations overts and unkind thoughts criticisms and so on that it operated as selftrapping mechanism if you get guy to be still long enough you will key him in like crazy all the motions of the past will come in and kick him in the head why do you find pc sitting in the middle of problem sitting there with that solution and why is it such still solution its still point on the track and every time the pc has tried to rest hes practically been overwhelmed when you get the problem out of the way and look back for the motion and confusion the motion and confusion run and the still spot disappears the still spot is held there by the pressure and duress of an active spot behind or earlier than the still spot so when the pc tries to rest the motion threatens to overwhelm him as it gets restimulated so its upsetting to him to be still theres nothing to do once one has blown out of ones head so the goal of the buddhist must have been to do nothing that is the defeatist goal people in defeat will say they want to do nothing in 106some variety of ways of course the nothingness is the point of overwhelm so people who yearn for nothingness inadvertently yearn to be overwhelmed so every great culture strives for peace they get so much peace theres so much peace everywhere that some barbarian comes along and knocks the whole thing off they achieve perfect nomotion which is death so thetans ambitions can often be contrary to his best interests this is not surprising in view of the fact that there are real liabilities to being thetan except the liability of interest inaction nothing to do or have or be nowhere to go when you see people preaching these you see people in the finest possible games condition they are playing game of seeing other players overwhelmed using the mechanisms of the track which would most easily overwhelm the other players it is not really in the best interest of the other to advise rest peace and inaction the proof of this are all over the place eg soldier gets wounded gets frontline first aid result lower death rate for wounds treated there than for similar wounds treated at the base hospital society subscribes to the idea that someone can kill himself with work this is complete red herring how does thetan get sick you know that when you release the still he is stuck in hell get well what has happened to thetan that he doesnt just heal up an injured body on the spot he has been leading too quiet life thats all people in circuses take falls that would kill regular person the only reason an injured body doesnt spring back into shape is that its held out of shape by stills things wrong with people are held wrong with considerable energy the effort it takes to stay crazy must be fantastic the best way to get sudden recoveries is to run withholds because withholds are the motion before the still that was going on while the person was not participating with the motion he was withholding himself from the motion so he was already being slightly still he eventually withdraws so hard from the motion and commits so many overts against the other participants in the motion that he backs out all the way and becomes still when you havent any right to be part of motion any longer you have only one other choice to be still thats the mechanism by which you can get confusion overts and withholds becoming problem problem is the still after the problem comes the solution to the problem of course since the problem is motionless in time the solution becomes continuous in time now the thetan has the problem of how to get some motion although motion is evidently bad for thetan he nevertheless likes to move and insists on doing it if he hadnt done so much motion in the past his present still would be ok but as with car having its bumper up against another cars bumper should do harm unless it was previously traveling at 165 miles per hour its the motion prior to the still that produces the impact theres nothing wrong with still if there hasnt been some motion and motion is fine if still doesnt occur if you can tolerate both motion and stillness you wont have any trouble but there are certain motions and certain stills thetan cannot tolerate you could move insane people up the track just by giving them huge boulder in the middle of the courtyard to look at to familiarize themselves with still if we look at how thetan got aberrated we see that its cycle of action 1 overts against coaction 2 confusion leading to 3 problem which is stop leading to 4 change to solve the problem the cycle keeps repeating itself the thetan keeps picking up new bodies who are somebody else this really makes it complicated since each of them is an identity he doesnt stack up any new valences however because the basic valence is in there so solid that transient valences dont overwhelm it the basic valence motivated by the basic goal is the biggest single change that takes place in lifetime that is available to an auditor it is available on anyone with whom you can communicate if you cant communicate you can still use cchs they arent used otherwise now that the problems intensive can be used to get off hidden standards what other changes besides valences are available one is new body every death is preceded by an unsolvable problem to which death was the solution new body is solution to death which left the 107thetan in inaction all illness evolves from unsolved problems its always gradient scale of dying people even get sick when they win prize or get new possessions beyond what they feel they should have to survive it can be too much change and too much havingness unsafe because of ones liability to being attacked thetans arent stupid one of their aberrations may be stupidity but according to the computation on which they are living what they are doing is very clever youll always find that the very stupid have great belief in their cunning often too the very bright consider themselves to be stupid how many changes can occur just after problem in terms of mental changes very few they could suppress or enhance certain characteristics get rid of or adopt certain manifestations and thats about all the earliest step is taking on valence valence both limits and exaggerates persons own skills thetan can only set up valence or circuit to do what he can already do thetan can without body walk out on stage pick up 1000 lb weight turn it around and drop it but hes so dedicated to the idea that it takes strong mans body to do it that he only does it when hes in strong mans body then it gets to the point that he can only do it when in condition when hes well when hes employed to do it when he has problems with his manager when he believes in himself and feels powerful these are all vias the basic truth is that he can just do it each of the limitations and vias he puts in there is solution to problem he couldnt otherwise solve the problem got there because he was trying to get something done as part of group and in that motion has overts and withholds and these resolved into problem the whole cycle has to take place every time to wind up with solution like that the problems and changes you are interested in as an auditor are not very many you are not interested in his being in body he has been in and out of bodies before or he wouldnt be here but what is he doing with this body he isnt being the body he is in he is being valence which is in body in other words hes failed thetan being failed valence in body up to this point hed be easy to communicate with but new problems and changes interpose such things as constant somatics then you are auditing him through the problem which is the constant somatic circuit is like subsidiary valence it is mechanism which modifies valence solution to the realization that the valence can often be wrong so it needs to be dictated to or to have things hidden from it so when the thetan as valence runs into problem where the valence has failed he sets up valence that can think and circuit to modify the thinking of the valence after the thetan has failed everything he adopts after that is subject to failure and each one of them becomes barrier to processing circuit modifies the thinkingness and doingness of the valence it is dictational machine circuits slow down or speed up show things or hide things etc if they get too wild and complicated the person can modify the circuit with somatic when you get this much bricabrac somewhere along the line you could get hidden standard which knows more than the valence which knows more than the thetan hidden standard is just something which knows better to which the thetan is paying attention the thetans concentration on this item can be so great the dependency on it so heavy that the thetan only knows if it knows if it tells him its true if it doesnt tell him its not true when you are auditing him he lets it tell him he pays so much attention to it he hardly sees you at all to some degree everyones attention is absorbed in some part of the bank but where total overwhelm exists attention is so absorbed that only it knows people run totally on social circuitry for instance parents often have totally unreal ideas about their children whom they have never observed at all circuits are often so idiotic that when they are activated by what they are set up to produce they criticize as if it werent there eg one has the circuit childs appearance should be very good so if childs appearance in the vicinity of someone with that circuit is very good hes criticized if the childs appearance is very bad hes ignored this confuses children and causes them to feel betrayed most things that person protests against he will do himself we call this hypocrisy its caused by circuits circuitry is an escape from knowing and confront vias used by the thetan to divorce himself from life when you audit him you are part of life and you will hit his interpositions you will thus be auditing circuit which prevents him from being able to go clear on straight routine 3 if you get off his ptps arc breaks objections to the room etc he is less likely to interpose vias and you can then talk to the pc not the circuit but people have problems of such magnitude on the recent 108backtrack that they set up permanent circuit so you are always auditing away at the circuit and making slow progress the problems intensive directly handles and knocks out circuits so that you can audit the pc out of the valence he is in 6110c19 shspec69 q and period flows pointers on running problems intensives any auditing command has the potentiality of flows in it if the pc is running command with the flow always from to b the pc could go into an occlusion you could then have him run it the other way few times and it will unocclude all stuck flows give stuck needles you see this in withholds too withhold is nonpermitted flow so anything going in against it sticks nothing can backflow youll see the ta rise and the needle stick the more you make him conscious of it the more tightly he squashes himself with the withhold you finally trigger it this reverses the flow and you get blowdowns in withhold the pc regrets the backflow eg he should not have back flowed the bullet when he killed the king of france he shouldnt have backflowed in the first place so he is withholding it he can receive everything you tell him about the king of france but nothing can come out about the king of france watch the needle go up and stick the more questions you flow in the more he packs it in when he stops withholding the ta goes down from reversing the flow there are lots of directions of flows but five or ten ways seems pretty adequate if you only run pc to another and another to pc you can start getting the other persons flows jamming and you will again get stuck meter this doesnt pose problem if you are running it for short time only you can overrun flow on prehav run or all flows can run out you can run flow too long in one direction and get high ta then it can blow up with blowdown you can overrun it in which case the more you run it the more stuck it is going to get the mind is capable of considerable resurgence by getting in ruds you give the mind the freedom to look at pt with that freedom comes the ability to asis this makes it possible to use fiveway bracket instead of 32way bracket auditing is not an absolute practice fortunately if everything bad that ever happened to the pc had to be audited out youd be at it forever if you pull certain pins enough will blow so that the mind can resurge if the ruds are in problems intensive is run so that the mind can resurge enough to let you run goals easily auditors can have trouble with the idea of flows if they dont realize that the mind is full of particles thoughts get connected with the particles and the particles get connected with solids and masses so the pc tries to think and runs into solids you try to audit him and run into particles theres nothing wrong with the pcs thinkingness per the trouble is that it gets joined up with energy space time and particles so he cant think of time without getting space or of thought without getting particles or masses he cant differentiate amongst these things or amongst the dynamics the preclear identifies the sixth dynamic particularly with with all the dynamics and the seventh dynamic gets identified with the reactive mind thinkingness only goes haywire when person can longer differentiate where he should or associate where he should he identifies even on semantic level eg he road boat you can get some amazing results with semantics like the airline pilot who came in looking for the phrase that gave him compulsion to have accidents while flying his mother has said hes earthly good which reactively made him fly even though he hated it leukemia was once found to be caused by the mothers phrase it would turn your blood to water but auditing by phrases requires very good auditor and it doesnt work on everybody if it worked well and easily wed still be doing it it is mistake to let the pc run only oneway flows the pc has been motivating for years and years not just in session what is holding it pinned is lack of any reverse flow it looks moral to the pc but its not its that he started an outflow along certain tone level making line along which an interchange could occur having done so he can be inflowed on at that level this is all based on the horrible fact that thetan can never be inflowed on until he has outflowed how could he have been located by someone else otherwise 109this leads to the safe solution of never being anywhere or saying anything of course then youll never do anything or see anything and nothing will ever happen ever the police evidently operate on this since its being there and communicating that are punished someone in apathy has solved life this way and hes easy to inflow on so he gets kicked if hes not careful though he may get reputation for being good listener yet people get taught this be good listener dont be obtrusive be little late but it backfires when making up auditing commands be sure it is understood and that it reads on the meter and that it is explicit and that you get it answered every time and dont set up stuck flow situation even flow of giving punishment to someone will violate games condition because it is giving something to an enemy so it makes one feel degraded and start figuring on it war is degrading because soldiers are always giving things to their enemies this sets up bad games condition an auditor shouldnt run contrarytogamescondition process which is all give or one that violates flows with all receive there are wordings that allow for any flow eg what was happening or what was unknown if the pc cant run unknown you can use forgotten the lower harmonic of unknown use any of the notknow words if necessary dont leave the problem unrun if you start getting into stuck flow on process you can just end the process without too much fuss and add another flow to it eg by saying now we are going to add another side to this if your intention is to get auditing done rather than to follow ritual itll go down just fine anything that goes wrong to pc in session is registered by him on the basis of scarcity of auditing and is best remedied by giving him auditing if you run withholds lot eg unkind thoughts you can wind up with stuck flow unless you run the overt as the outflow in the problems intensive the osection is list of selfdetermined changes the pc has made in this lifetime the list is assessed out by elimination and the item is then handled in the psection the auditor gets the problem that preceded this change he runs it on what is unknown about that problem with the terminal in the problem or some such process later version omits running it then the confusion prior tc the change later prior to the problem is located and the dramatis personae of the confusion are sec checked getting off all the and ws in the area of the confusion until the problem longer reacts then another selfdetermined change is assessed out etc later version of the problems intensive is given in hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion the number of problems person has determines how fast or slow he will audit and his speed of accomplishment in life in general so hell speed up in life when you get his problems out of the way 6110c24 shspec70 clearing auditing is third dynamic activity most aberration stems from group mores because there was an agreement agreement is high on the reality scale as an individual agrees to something then disagrees to it he runs contradiction on his own postulates when thetan becomes member of group he agrees to certain things then finds he cant uphold them and disagrees with those things this activity is high on the reality scale having agreed to something then disagreed with it the thetan doesnt normally asis his original agreement thus he finds himself in disagreement with himself since it was originally his own agreement this is apparently the first and foremost invalidation of thetan he invalidates himself by first agreeing then disagreeing with his own agreements in between the agreement and disagreement we get further set of agreements and activities all of which are lesser in value but which bring about complexity so you get an area of mutual motion with the group and even confusion of ownership of motion you get whole series of problems from this this gets us back to something that has been question since 1948 if the thetan was making his pictures why did he create the particular ones hes got why his proclivity for morbidity we find the answer in the fact that he cant differentiate between his own actions and other peoples hes not sure who caused these communication lines and actions all motions are of course caused individually there is such thing as collectively caused motion governments err by thinking that theres some entity called the people when in fact there are just individuals but in his third dynamics the pc got into this confusion of mutual motion he then defends himself by backing out of it he says well it was all bad here i am outside of it at least i am still an identity thetan has gone through this over and over 110the dynamics give us an excellent picture of the confusion of mutual motion the sixth dynamic is exclusively comotion an undifferentiated one all the collective undifferentiated comotions of the past become matter energy space and time the sixth dynamic nobody can say what he did thetan in this universe can only say that was our activity this is ok until you get failure for instance its we built this bridge until it collapses at which point it becomes they built this bridge when mutual comotion comes cropper people deny their part in it at any given time an individual is member of at least two or three groups he has been on the track for 200 trillion years which makes lot of groups so it is impractical to run out his coaction with all his groups for instance every time he died he left group but we are assisted by automaticity all overts and withholds are preceded by coaction you can straighten out the people involved by running ow or you can free the effect of the ow by differentiating the coaction this is basic discovery that you can knock out the coaction preceding the ow he cant face the coaction sometimes until you get off some of the withholds and overts body of agreement has been violated and thereafter will remain aberrative thats where you get the packaged nowimsupposedtos the packaged postulates valences enforced by group mores someone who is withholding himself from his former group cant even tell you what really went on in it until he his gotten off some of the ow his withholding is not only in the physical universe but in the mind also you could have group whose mutual action is all mutually destructive at first glance when you process the pc you are just asking him to stop withholding himself mentally just because he is withholding himself physically hell resist because it feels like being asked to return to it physically the reason you have to have ruds in in order to find goal or terminal is that you are asking the individual to walk very closely to the fact of an identity from which he is withholding himself while being the identity hes not executing the goal while executing the goal you are asking him to look at something that he is in the middle of when you run groups you are asking him what group co motion are you still in the middle of that youre now having nothing to do with this confuses him but it works out very well you go back through his ows to coaction eventually you could even get the mutual agreements each step asks him to confront little more than he would be comfortable confronting so youll find his goal and find his terminal fine thats oriented towards the future and away from the unpleasant past but then you ask him to go back over the past and suddenly you get all the reasons why he doesnt want to go clear facing all those prior groups and people and activities is something else yesterday should remain buried this is the most critical period of processing for one thing if you have the wrong goal and the wrong terminal you will throw the pc in over his head and it will take experts to bail him out its not light thing to attempt the pc doesnt want to face what he has left so you had better be prepared for evasions ducks and dodges arc breaks etc even if hes aberrated now he knows hes alive hes not so sure he will be alive if he confronts this he died last time didnt he pc can also slide out from under the terminal up into degradation this is an alarming fact of running terminals the pc looks very pitiful as he comes through the degradation and may not feel at all like going on but all his escape mechanisms are reactive by keeping rudiments in and carrying on straight ahead you will succeed because the pc himself is really with you all the way the objections are all reactive you may have smooth trip through it too not all pcs go through degradation degradation is lower harmonic of apathy and is the first emotion the pc encounters on the road up even if hes below it he goes through the band of death on the way to apathy then on up the tone scale theres sort of hurdygurdy that goes on theres the pc and the valence and the pc is as overwhelmed as the valence is high toned during processing the positions reverse at one point they are level at this point the nowimsupposedtos dont work well and the pc still doesnt decide well what to do then the valence goes down and the pc up the pc andor the valence may hit the boredom band it is important not to leave it there but to continue 6110c26 shspec72 security checking auditing errors all the heretics the catholic church has had trouble with were produced by the mechanism of incomplete confessions this is poetic justice since the church buried most of the earlier knowledge that had been around so sec check the very thing which is supposed to prevent dissension upsets and slowed cases if badly done restimulates heresy of some sort which eventually brings about an 111overthrow of the group sooner or later the cycle is that this overt not being pulled but restimulated causes the pc to lessen it by running down the target of the overt this is new overt which then makes him also run down the group that failed to pull the withhold if you fail to pull the withhold you will get the effect of the succeeding overts as the pc makes nothing of the people who might find out this is part of lessening the missed overt it also serves to make it such that one would ever believe those people if the overt ever does come out the amazing thing is that the withhold as its pulled transmutes from smoking volcano before it is pulled to limp dead fish as its gotten off so if you start to release it but dont carry through youve left the pc with live head of steam which will frequently explode the way to have accidents with dangerous object is to know its dangerous and not know how to handle it weve tended to tell students that you cant do anything wrong with auditing in order to inspire confidence and to degree its true but now that we have accomplished speedup of getting rid of the basic core of reactivity weve paid for it with loss of the safety mechanisms of older processes like conceptual processes objectives etc now we have to run things that make people pretty uncomfortable when it is done wrong this is not permanent but it can be quite uncomfortable at the time part of the trouble too is that the auditor can be looking very pleasant doing his best though he has make gaes so that the pc when he finds himself looking awful blames himself for it and feels it couldnt be the auditors fault when in fact it is his fault the common denominator of gaes is some degree of auditing done where there have been errors it is mostly incomprehension of auditing directions examples are leaving withhold question unflat doing wrong assessment or using wrong assessment running prehav level until the ta is moving and leaving it failing to continue to sec check pc as his case advances 6110c31 shspec73 rudiments those things that are closest to present time have greater influence on the pc than the whole track in his estimation so you have pc who is convinced that anything wrong with him must have happened in this lifetime this is one of the things wrong with him that he thinks he can get this aberrated in fifty years or less as far as the basic seat of aberration is concerned it is all way prior to this lifetime to the pc what has happened in the last twentyfour hours is more important than what has happened in the past month but it isnt really from the pcs viewpoint what has happened in the session is more important than what has happened in this day hence the violence of session arc breaks because of this evaluation of importances you cant audit over the arc break as it recedes into the past it loses importance the analytical mind fixes its attention closest to all of the havingness which is in present time so theres always the disagreement in the session that whats really wrong with the pc is in the yester lives but the pc thinks its something wrong right now if you treat what is wrong with him now with heavy actions as if it were tremendous barrier the pc will think so too thus you can validate the pc into outruds an auditor has to adjudicate whether it will do more damage to get the rudiments in or to audit with them out goals run is very difficult with the ruds out but you can attack ruds with such ferocity that the pc gets convinced that they must be really out so they go more out if the ta starts going up while you are getting ruds in lock very pleased as if youd just gotten ruds really in wind up the ruds and get back on the goals terminal line ruds bit out is better than ruds way out details on goals running you will sometimes find the pc planting his heels in examine the case from the aspect of its goal examine the goal from the aspect of what dynamic it is an overt against and you will find out how pc got goal in this solid he had this goal as perfectly honest goal perhaps and nobody wanted this goal because it didnt fit in with certain dynamics they invalidated it and he reasserted it etc etc to the point where he pretty much dropped it when you first pick it up you find it behaves like an overt you can run it as an overt which is why the twoway flow run on it works you can ask what would the goal _______ do to group and find how it could be lots of overts against groups this means it has been invalidated lot which is why it goes out so easily any goal that isnt an axiom is out of agreement to some degree with groups the pc has been associated with thus it has 112been invalidated on other dynamics and so becomes source of invalidation he uses it to invalidate and others invalidate it so if you as the auditor invalidate it even slightly out it goes the terminal being an outgrowth of the goal is similarly fragile not accepting the pcs handwritten list resulted in the goal getting lost the pc didnt mention when the auditor got new goals list with the meter dont run any processes eg sec checks on any specific terminals other that the goals terminal line terminals except ow and when the pc runs out of ow against the terminal dont force it on the terminal anymore the pc will arc break as his attention is newly forced on the terminal 6111c01 shspec74 formation of commands details on formulating commands for goals processing you can have difficulty with some standard command like think of _______ in about 50 of cases the pc wont make sense out of think and it wont read you could clear the word very carefully get all his considerations process the condition etc or better yet find substitute the pc can understand often get the idea will work but if the second part of the command has it in another form then what well square it around so it makes sense cure for inability to think look around and find something thats not thinking be sure its clear to the pc dont find that you are having trouble with it after you have run it for three hours but dont go to the extreme of clearing the same command every session either just clear it when you first use it even if it looks fine to you see if it makes sense and is answerable to the pc mental concepts can exist in the absence of words when you are forming commands its concepts you want to communicate words express the form and character of the think thetan in order to communicate goes through mest and to hear takes the communication out of mest thats how he keeps off other thetans the whole business of forming commands uses that mechanism the command should of course always be duplicated thats havingness factor as well as not attracting the pcs attention and it makes him think repetitive thought which will eventually asis his circuits dont get pedantic about it process in the language he speaks including dialects and colloquialisms if you are trying to compose commands without knowledge of the basics of scientology youd do better to go hang yourself one of the basics is to make sense remember that if word was something the pc was quite rational about it wouldnt read in the first place and its not up to you to run language school for pc often he will cognite on what it means as you run it but if you have to change wordings to make the command grammatical or sensible be sure to get one that reads and has the same sense to the pc your commands are always being formed and cleared up against the raw stuff of which aberration is concocted as result it becomes tricky and vast subject the fundamentals of the mind are simple and not very many the difficulties of clearing and forming commands can cause the auditor to give up and just take commands lrh has given even if you do this try at least to understand the thought behind the command which is meant to be transmitted to the pc if it doesnt transmit because of some weirdness fix it up so it fits and transmits lrh expects that you would make sure its answerable dont change any commands that you are already running matter how much better you now see you could make it realize that commands are communication not semantics 6111c02 shspec75 how to security check the answer to why the bank beefs up when nongoalsterminals are run is this when you run the terminal which is not the goals terminal his attention is too bound up in his own terminal and goal to asis the collapsing mass so the mass the auditor pushes in on the pc connected to the new terminal doesnt get asised the pc doesnt have enough attention units to asis anything except the goals terminal so the bank beefs up similarly your emeter starts up the ta rises to the degree that the pc is not asising what you are throwing in on him the worst thing about emeters is tr0 tr0 goes out and the meter doesnt work an emeter is deadly weapon you can slaughter pc if the emeter is not used correctly you do this by missing instant reads if in addition you took up latent reads and let the pc get off other peoples overts the session itself would be an overt and the pc would feel worse afterwards more dangerous mistake 113is missing an instant read and leaving the question live which can often result in the pc nattering criticizing you and the organization etc very funny if you miss the question he doubts you your ability the tech etc when you clean it up by pulling the withhold the natter stops latent read has comm lag of 05 sec or more you could sec check person into high ta by making sure all the ruds were out so his attention would be dispersed audit what the pc is stuck in when pcs attention is too bound up in one area the pc cannot asis anything else so the ta goes high and sticks its not that the tas going high should be utterly avoided but the ta goes high because more is being thrown in on the pc than the pc can handle or asis if during run the pc hits an engram he may not be able to asis it if you start directing his attention to all the details etc and start running the engram so just acknowledge it and carry on with the goals or terminals run you were doing the auditor can push mass circuits pictures etc in on the pc and can move his track more easily than the pc hard though it may be for auditors to recognize this so your interrogation of the pc can pin his attention on the track its ok to be curious enough to find out what he is looking at or doing but not to start running it of course you can move him out of it by asking for earlier or later incidents the reactive mind is always keyed to otherdeterminism and never to selfdeterminism so the auditor can always move it around high ta is often cured by getting off withhold even small one getting off any withhold will make the ta go down data on sec checking by dynamics the trouble with the sec check is usually that the auditor is working from his own viewpoint and not from the pcs thetan is not natively member of any culture thetans have come down the track accumulating various mores and civilizations and group ideas some have come down the track without finding out that groups exist theyve collected various things but their mores register on the dynamics rather than relative to groups make sure you sec check what the pc considers an overt even if to you it seems trivial people are different men are so busy being ordinary that they dont recognize that every one of them is slightly somewhere extraordinary this professional ordinariness is great repressor it notises the differences unless you can reestablish difference you cant reestablish differentiation the easy way out the easy solution is to say that its all the same they are all alike all bad so now im warned and safe if miserable thats such stupid reasoning that its wonder countries go down the drain of all people are equal but some people are more equal than others perhaps thetans were all equal at the beginning of the track then became unequal and masked it with pretended equality details on problems intensives and sec check procedures it is interesting that you can sec check out of existence every outrudiment the room ptps the auditor arc breaks just get the prior confusion rudiment cant hang up unless theres an unknown and an unknown cant exist unless theres withhold here we have class of things that all go together unknowingness forgettingness stupidity and withholds they are like r and c in the arc triangle they go up and down together you are not likely to get factual answer to the question have you ever made someone guilty of something the thing that is wrong with the pc is that he has never successfully made anybody guilty and he is still trying the basis of his aberration is the effort to made someone guilty not the accomplished fact you should ask have you ever attempted to make anybody guilty of _______ the only reason anyone has victimish motivatorish attitude is in an effort to make someone guilty it may have even been successful effort but the person making the effort doesnt know about it it is debatable point whether you should ever take an unkind thought as an overt sometimes it does seem to be the only available overt and the person does feel friendlier and better for having gotten it off but there appears to be evidence that person with body of unkind thoughts against someone or something has an actual overt which is being withheld the unkind thoughts are evidently just evidence that overts exist so if you dont get the overts you are leaving them with unflat sec check questions critical thoughts dont aberrate people but the pc may not be able to reach the underlying overt so if he cant make note so that you can return to it 1146111c08 shspec77 checking case reports details on running routine 3a see hcob 7nov61 routine 3a also see 6111c08 shspec76 routine 3a which was deleted from the shsbc checksheet see definition of routine 3a in the tech dictionary routine 3a involved finding modifier for the goal modifier being that consideration which opposes the attainment of goal and tends to suspend it in time example goal to be willow wand modifier so as never to be reached there are two or three civilizations way on the backtrack where the language was english never be ashamed to be clever as an auditor it is not the same as being squirrel squirrel doesnt understand any of the principles so he makes them up to fulfill his ignorance if you do know the principles and never get clever youre knucklehead since there arent textbook solutions for every situation after the pc has told you fifteen or twenty times you keep asking for the modifier but i just cant reach it ask him if but i just cant reach it is the modifier when pc is arc broken he gets into kind of numb games condition where he has fluidity of mind or flexibility if you try to audit pc in wooden sullen state you are highly unlikely to get anywhere more details on running of routine 3a 6111c09 shspec78 effective auditing there is only one thing that can make an emeter lie and thats bad auditor where an auditor has withholds he wont want to get others withholds off so he wont want to believe the meter auditor diffidence is also based on fear of what they might hear from pcs such as gossip about themselves pcs do appreciate auditor control in session on sec check the pc may not know what it is thats giving read at that point you get helpful ask lot of various things to help him locate it compartment the question to see where the read is coming from etc but if the pc is resisting not even trying to look acting resentful etc dont be softy get as tough as necessary to get the withhold the pc has gone into games condition and you have got to get him out of it you have to be able to judge whats happening to the pc and not expect there is ritual way to handle him the technology and procedures of scientology are to assist you to audit the pc not to hide behind there is substitute for live auditor particularly in sec checking this doesnt mean you should always he sweet dont overwhump the pc creating missed withholds of nothing dont be robot dont ignore the pcs answers creating an enforced withhold dont do something that suddenly shifts the pcs attention like going from interest to enthusiastic interest in jump it takes certain amount of auditor to make an auditing session some auditors can put too much there with distractive comments and so forth if the meter breaks in midsession dont do anything at all about it except carry on with the session until you can declare break then fix the meter and restart never distract the pcs attention out of session fiddling with the meter can cause the ta to climb as much as two divisions dont develop nice calloused death mask in lieu of tr0 process the pc in front of you just get brave the way to get your ruds in as an auditor is to just relax look over the situation even if it takes bit of time find out what is going on by asking what is going on you ask him thats different from ritual do you know that with one single question that is heartfelt and meant by you you can put all the ruds in just like that how do you run sec check on tough pc with lots of withholds when the meter is broken you dont you run some havingness and confront and end session and get new meter but never distract pcs attention from the session you can be as interesting or as interested as you please as long as its relevant to the session and to what the pc is doing what upsets the pc is an irrelevancy to his case its not what you do its how relevant your actions are you must have your attention on the pc the auditor could dance jig as long as it is relevant to the pcs case youll drop some of your shackles and death masks when you learn this differentiate between what you can get away with and what you cant all the pc demands is that the auditor be effective and his attention relevant 115to the pcs case thats what the auditor violates when he gets in trouble with the pc the whole pattern of arc breaks is that the pc ceases to believe that the auditors attention is relevant to his case per the philadelphia doctorate lectures the highest level of reality is conviction this is above agreement communication above mechanics its belief the pc must stay convinced that the auditor is interested in auditing him and interested in auditing his case and doing it effectively with attention on the pc this conviction takes something to achieve it can be accomplished if you know enough about the mind and have enough reality on its mechanics knowing these things you are never debarred by the mystery of it all the pc looks like something that can be resolved if you know the mechanics of how he operates and if you know all the parts of his mind you understand enough of what he is doing to form arc with the pc now your interest and attention is on the particularities the specifics of his difficulties if you are comfortable with the basics and the mechanics youll be able to handle peoples upsets effectively somebody who understands life can talk about life and other people know he understands life even if they dont know what he is saying oddly enough so if you who could be looking and interested arent doing it with the pc he has been out its upsetting that you dont do what you could be doing people do not forgive auditing or being ineffective so audit the pc and be effective the pc wants your attention on his case if you start to tell him about your case forget it matter how kindly your motives are just be sure you are effective and that your attention is on his case details on modifiers the arc the pc forms with the auditor is not just from sweetness and kindness its from auditor control interest and effectiveness student auditing can well be slow because the pc can feel the student is auditing in order to learn about it not because of interest in his case if an auditor goes and carelessly sleeps with the pc hell get auditing done thereafter hes longer interested in the pcs case hes interested in the pcs body being complimentary to your pc goes only so far then it becomes interest in the pcs body not in his case so it is longer effective out of session compliments may be fine every skill you have in auditing routines sec checks model session problems intensive has certain form which rather guarantees interest in the pcs case dont let it ride on automatic however or it compounds the felony you get the situation where the ritual is interested in the pcs case but the auditor isnt the pc gets weird unreality about the whole thing the auditor has to be interested in the pcs case and determined to do something effective about it then through the media of emeter and procedure he gives the auditing commands the commands are vital but secondary they do nothing by themselves in sec checking if the auditor does not become visible and real to the pc withholds will read you get reads on the meter in direct ratio to your reality to the pc this is true in assessment too your presence is as poor in the pcs opinion as you have to keep the rudiments in the auditor is as real and has as much presence to the pc as the ruds stay in interest must be present to get reads and restimulate the pc the more presence you have the more you can get out of the pc it can disturb pc to have some overt or partly known thing and to hear from some nonpresent and nonlocated terminal question about it that doesnt restimulate it when its thetan to thetan question theres live interest and communication and you get reads and answers the bank is responsive to your presence you can handle it better than he can if you never order his bank around nothing happens the way to get pc into session is to audit him do something effective beware of mechanical distractions of all kinds pcs who are arc broken about unflat processes are really upset about moving off an effective process to something ineffective if its effective run it through to the end even if its rough the only is not auditing especially when youve started auditing if to be effective you have to throw down the meter ok and thats sometimes what it takes put your attention on the pc and what hes doing the pc will even forgive something like this just sit there and shut up for minute and let think youve presented here with rough one and im not quite sure which way im going on the thing so just be quiet for moment and lemme figure this out shut up now jesus youve got rough case all right this is what im gonna do the pc will accept this because you are going to do something about his case 1166111c16 shspec81 points in assessing assessment by elimination started because auditors had trouble differentiating which read was biggest it was found that you could assess down to one item left the phraseology in the modifiers gives the illusion of elsewhere and the pc responds with total dramatization of the modifier callback like but i will leave and come here gets the pc in pt anything you can give which acts as command to move in some direction will be bouncer denyer is something that denies knowledge of something stickers formerly called holders park the person on the track its an oddity that these modifiers exist and are appended to the goal more details on running routine 3d see 6111c14 shspec79 routine 3d shspec82 running 3d hcob 20nov61 routine 3d commands and hcob 3dec61 running 3d levels 6111c21 shspec82 running 3d hcob 20nov61 routine 3d commands and hcob 3dec61 running 3d levels youll find that the majority of the skills pc has in this lifetime are those of his goalsmodifier terminal hell push his education just as far as it would be needed by his goals terminal even though its longer an existing doingness goals terminal when found is only the total answer to the current case from the mental aspect basis it will take care of so much in lifetime that it would be easy to make the error of considering that one goals run of routine 3d and one level knocked out should resolve the whole case not so it will go long way and it looks as though the case should be resolved but the pc will still have chronic somatics circuits and whole new goalvalence chain to get out of the road youve just gotten off the most available series out of 12 15 20 they resolve the case not just the first one after all how did the pc get in such lousy shape that he could get this valen 6111c22 shspec83 reading the emeter it is horrible fact that the request for the extraordinary solution if prompted always by the gross auditing error your sense of propriety may be so violated by the magnitude of the outness that you dont see it for instance the auditor runs session with the emeter broken or sessions are given at all not reading the emeter is gae the early emeter 1951 wouldnt read because the electrodes were little quarterinch bars soup cans were substituted and then you could see that something was going on british meters started being supplied with aluminum pipes they arent as good as cans for can squeeze the meter was first used for dating incidents on the track ron found that the onthebeach incidents gave 16dial drops at that point he still thought that the higher the ta went the clearer the person was for the first five months lrh had reality on the meter and would take his own judgment instead of the meters every time for the next three years lrh had to get used to every new meter they were variable that is why they are made standard now so you dont have to learn each ones idiosyncracies one reason why emeters werent used in the mid 50s was that they got too complicated don breeding joe wallace and jim pinkham eventually in the late 50s designed one for lrh in washington with simple basic circuit design they were transportable unlike the volney matthison models which were mains meters with high current that could if malfunctioning deliver potent electric shock some pcs now can feel current from battery meter they are just hypersensitive to electricity the british mark iv is now standard its behavior is very similar to the american meter the tone arm was originally believed to indicate the tone of the pc on the tone scale hence the name tone arm its really complete misnomer lie detector operators go wholly on body motion plus respiration pulse and blood pressure since the emeter can measure the mental reaction of the pc eg as given in the instant read it is well in advance of lie detectors also unlike polygraph the emeter is pt machine furthermore there are only two hundred people out of thousands trained in the use of polygraphs who can really use them 117the emeter is present time machine you use its information as you get it not after some comm lag youve got to catch the read when it happens youve got to know that in checking ruds stop on the rise is read and that its got to be an instant read it registers the moment the sense gets to the pc if the pc is trying to sell you on something the read will be latent because the pc takes an instant to get it and respond but the reactive mind doesnt it has time in it and reads instantly you have to be satisfied that the meter works get to where it is an unimportant albeit vital part of the session and you can have your attention on the pc instead of the meter 6111c23 shspec84 auxiliary prehav 3d scale this scale is contained in hcob 23nov61 aux prehav 3d scale first part of tape contains details on running routine 3d gpm mentioned for the first time here at least in nonconfidential tapes its also mentioned in hcob 20nov61 routine 3d commands so that it appears that the gpm comes into existence with routine 3d run inexpertly routine 3d slams the gates shut for the next hundred trillion years for thetan what it takes is expertness in metering if thats what it takes youll do it back few years ago lrh decided well if thats what it takes to break this barrier and push this thing through for big win for all of us well that what it takes quote it isnt question of being bright or being extraordinary i do know where i came from you see i used to tell my grandfather to explain my red hair to him i fell off mars and got into bucket of red paint was two when i was telling him that and he thought i was joking it wasnt question of what i could do or what my ability was it was question of what would it take to get it done all im asking you to do is do the impossibility of do it i couldnt possibly have done it you cant possibly audit it i did it you do it is that good bargain thats what it takes if you dont know how to read meter of course you dont have much confidence in your ability to run one and after someone has thrown the meter at you or youve thrown the meter and someone has missed your withholds few times of course your ability to read meter deteriorates like mad what you are really beaten by is not the meter but the operator of the meter einstein had the concept of the observer he even wrote paper on the subject entitled the viewpoint of the observer an observer is somebody who without the introduction of an opinion can look exactly and directly at needle or registering item and say exactly what it did without further introduction of an opinion psychologists and psychiatrists do not observe they are so interested in doing something that they never notice what they are doing it to thus these disciplines not knowing what an observer is have denied us data because they introduced opinion and evaluation the ability to observe as single action is what is required to run an emeter if you take that as separate action of the auditor you will get the whole problem compartmented properly and only when you do that action do you do anything else we dont sit there and worry about what we will do if the needle does something why should the observation of the needle assault reality its just an observation keep the observer independent of the doer and you are all set the needle acted in certain way what it means and what you will do about it are utterly separate from the observation that it acted in certain way try just observing tree sometime with opinion or think youll find it very interesting now look at the tree when the wind is blowing if you can hold this as an observation independent of an emotional reaction opinion doingness summation or prediction fine it is characteristic of the human race that they predict without bothering to see as far as the emeter is concerned an auditor must be purely an observer who can look and see exactly what the needle is doing it may take only one tenth of his attention but it must be pure attention the analysis of what the pcs mind is doing is another activity perfectly valid one but one which follows the observation one must not be so fond of ones theories that one slants the observation to prove the theory right the fact that lrh is willing to observe and very seldom goes to sleep and keeps his mind on what hes doing as an auditor is what gets him good auditing results to observe for one second is skill of sorts thats what metering takes what happens is what happens with alteris connected with the observation where you have bad assessment its because hopefulness or pessimism has 118entered in you need the willingness to put something to the pure reliable test an observer neednt know anything about scientology or the mind all he needs to know is whether something happened or not and what pure observation is nice trick if you get pc who talks during an assessment just get him to shut up so you can assess he wont arc break as long as he sees hes getting your attention you dont care what he does as long as he holds the cans and lets you assess the mechanics of it is thus it doesnt matter whether he is thinking about it or not youre assessing his bank and power on earth could prevent his bank from reading on the right level for that terminal many systems may be followed but they would all share the principle of getting the maximum number of levels in minimum time with minimum restimulation of the pc if you jar someones attention onto his terminal itll stay there awhile for several levels you can take advantage of that by assessing several levels without repeating the terminal 6111c28 shspec85 havingness havingness doesnt have to go with confront if you are running subjective process on pc that is the confront part havingness is an adjunct to any subjective process it goes out about every six months and comes in again six months or so later why does the meter get stuck one reason is that arc breaks get so furious that nothing reads everything has gone out hes in games condition and wont let anything have any command over him one else is permitted to have anything you can fix it by running havingness the two hundred lie detector operators who can make it operate do so because they can get into arc with the person on the lie detector the emeter likewise wont register in the presence of an operator who has faintest command value over the person on the meter you can err by thinking that if it doesnt read on the meter it doesnt exist this can make one invalidate the meter at that moment you must be able to obnose the pc and see whether he has an arc break the arc broken pc wont confront the auditor looks glum gives short answers gets ta or rising ta that sticks the latter indicator is not diagnostic in itself the ta stays up because the meter is inoperative so you must look at the pc and see his indicators an auditor can make another error lot of people have the idea they can tell better than the emeter what persons terminal is because there is something they can know better than the emeter thats because they do know that the pc is not with the session have asked the pc for an arc break and have gotten read that is the situation where they know more than the meter this doesnt mean they know better which is the pcs terminal so be relaxed but not careless what could stand between you and rapid assessment is an arc broken pc who is not registering on the meter someone who is nattering about how scientology is fraud etc etc can be shut off by asking them why cant you talk to anyone about your difficulties new rudiments question then is could you talk to about your case which combines the elements of insessionness if hes got an arc break he wont answer it positively then youve got another series of questions to get him in session see hcob 30nov61 arc process 1961 the arc break process is the best havingness chewerupper there is next to routine 3d hence the importance of havingness in the first place the thetan doesnt want this mass he has but it is mass and thetans motto is anything is better than nothing but this mass is an introversion mass and the more you run the mass the less hes got the physical universe so even if the mass didnt increase it is introverting him and the more pc introverts the less universe he has so he would get the feeling of losing havingness just by contacting some introverting thing something that introverted him badly would give him the feeling of havingness it has always been there whenever he has gotten sick this mass you are running out caved in on him dont be amazed to find the pc running fever while running 3d just keep on smoothly handling him 119the formula for getting rid of havingness is whatever the persons attention is on put it on something else for everything he has at the moment tell him hes got to have something else this is more effective than brainwashing its the suddenness of the shift that is unsettling when you are running persons arc break and hes out of arc with you he wants to go out of the session he starts by feeling hes not getting auditing then that he should be thinking about something else then that he will physically leave the session catch him one step back run havingness you will get command value as hes looking around the room and you will heal the arc break almost any pc run long enough on havingness will get all his rudiments in the earliest rudiments process was is it all right to be audited in this room is it all right for to audit you were just about back there havingness is that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pcs attention dont underrun it once started of all processes the right havingness process is the safest process to run on anyone at any time it cannot be overrun if the pc comes into session with bounteous ptps arc breaks ruds wildly out and you are going to straighten them all out wouldnt it be nice to get them all out of the road ask the room question first consult your humanness and decide whether he is in any kind of shape to be audited if not start by running havingness this will start to extrovert him and make it easier for him to run ruds and to audit him on what you want to run dont collide with the ptp at all the terminal is wrong havingness isnt run against can squeeze its run against the pcs ability to have large objects in the room its tested on can squeeze you always run havingness until the pc can have large objects in the room the old rules of havingness applied to running it paired with confront the can squeeze check neednt be done more than two or three times week and the test of enough havingness is when he can have large objects in the room the havingnessconfront system ran large sections of case but havingness isnt residual in this system it was loaned to it pc with reduced havingness is picky and choosey about room objects hes cautious with havingness up the pc is relaxed and unconcerned he is bangy if havingness is working the ta goes up and blows down havingness runs the bank if you run very much of it the reason you dont run lot of havingness along with confront is that the confront runs the bank faster the havingness was to keep the pcs attention flexible havingness processes from the thirtysix presessions are run by themselves you dont need confront when running sec checks terminals 3d etc the depth of reach of the processing is accompanied by reduction of havingness in the extreme so run lot of havingness dont be upset when the pc goes into and out of pt thats the havingness running the bank its signalized by the pc apparently doping off but he isnt actually the pc can see but not look dont stop the process when he has gone blah run the process until he is back amongst us thats the second rule along with the large objects rule keep giving him the command at the same rate even though hes all blah hes still doing the command matter what he is doing with his eyeballs the pc does not have to tell you that he has executed the auditing command the pc can get into trouble with havingness by having things he cant see with his eyes if he looks too much without looking he could be having bank in which case his havingness goes down instead of up become wary pcs do this person can be going around in life his whole lifetime without ever having seen any part of the physical universe its shock to get reality on it the pc puts up picture of the shelf and looks at that he sometimes discovers while running havingness that he is doing this the reason you have different havingness processes is that people have different degrees of perception someone with poor sight ability would do better on some other perceptic if there are thirtysix havingness processes you can be sure that there are more even thirtysix is more than is usually needed however you can run havingness process five times test it then if it loosened the needle run it twelve commands test again to be sure if the needle is looser ok if not look for another one if the needle was tighter dont put in any randomity go immediately to another process dont look dismayed if the needle does tighten in the interest of having standard posture from which to do the can squeeze get the pc to put his hands in his lap 120having found the pcs havingness process start the session run havingness to the large object rule especially if you had trouble finding the havingness process now run ruds youll have minimized the number of arc breaks you will get the pc is in games condition with you because his havingness is down get his havingness up and the games condition will vanish and his ruds will tend to be in and can easily be checked because your meter registers better if necessary now you can run the arc process it eats havingness so when he cycles into pt or has good cognition acknowledge the hell out of it and run havingness youll get bd of that tight ta and can go on and run the arc process better and longer and faster running havingness helps the pc give up his old havingness of old pictures you are getting him to realize that there is other havingness the common denominator of all goals terminals is games and the common denominator of all games is cant have keep it remedied or you will get games condition 6111c29 shspec86 emeter tips various helpful hints about care of meters and detecting malfunction of them lrh had beep meter which you could influence with energy flows you can do this to persons body too the beep meter detects pain in the body when held in the area of pain it goes beep person can do it remotely by seeing black area in the person who is holding it and turning it white someone who isnt scientologist cant do it just because of not being in good enough shape not having enough horsepower as thetan you can knock the needle with beam it looks like body motion jerky tick if the pc is influencing the meter the read will be latent he cant hear the command and put the meter into action as fast as the reactive mind can 6112c06 shspec89 sec checks necessary the more aberrated person is the more onlyone he is he moves in towards clearing from his lonely vigil on cloud 69 where he has been keeping watch against all comers and where he learned never to take any orders then you step up with your emeter and give him an order you get response the symptom of extreme aberration is total unwillingness to receive any help you can be fooled by the fact that people or countries who are very lowtoned will beg for help you are fooled if you dont notice what is done with the help when it is received it is wasted andor used to make the helper wrong they use help as trap to show you how ineffectual you are india is in that condition now you will also find this in insane asylums you will see person on post somewhere who has to do everything himself he is proving that he must not be helped when you are auditing pc who can be helped things go pretty smoothly when you are auditing someone who is being an onlyone he is out of communication very suspicious and possibly unwilling to be helped even if hes ok on help you still have the communication barrier until that is knocked apart you wont find your meter reading on the pc he will be hard to assess if his communication level is going in and out during the assessment the average wog is highly suspicious he is highly alert his ability to be hurt is so enormous that he thinks he has to protect himself with all sorts of barricades and amongst these is help the more aberrated person is the more onlyone he is take someone who is not even vaguely in comm we are going to assess him to discover something about him if he feels that anything about him will be used against him you will get only total defense so your first effort in clearing anyone is to get that person into communication not only willing to talk to you but when you talk to him it means little something so that when you talk to him he can receive it you could sec check person whose help factor was way down if you got the exact right questions but you couldnt assess him remember theres charge on assessment hes not trying to withhold anything from you hes not trying to give you anything hes just meat the only place meter has hole in it is with arc breaks and you can repair that with an arc break process but that isnt good enough for assessment the person has to be in good communication with the auditor to get an accurate rapid assessment or the auditor has to have fantastic altitude in which case hell get reads 121the rudiments can be found to be in for one auditor yet hed be unable to get reads on assessment that just means the meter isnt registering for that person another auditor could find ruds out and be able to assess the pc so the meter is registering for him this is not spooky the onlyone pc who is not part of the human race wont let anyone have command value over him the first barrier you have to cross with him is getting him into communication speed of assessment depends on degree on willingness to communicate with the auditor altitude is the command value you have over the pc an auditor has to have confidence in his tools and what he is doing if he lacks it the pc can tell and assigns him lower altitude accordingly an inexpert auditor who is not in comm with the emeter and hostile pc who is not in comm with the human race will give you debacle it is much more economical to sec check someone for seventy five hours and put them in communication with the human race than to assess them for seventyfive hours the assessment will go nowhere but the sec check will make him feel better details on goals running and assessments unburdening is the mechanism of the way we are handling the gpm were taking the solutions off the top of it and it deintensified as problem because these terminals are as much problem as they have been solved the trick is to solve it without solving it again in way that pulls it in on the person you do it by taking off the solutions which is how it should have been solved in the first place the other barrier in your road is that the pc at the outset is uncertain that anything can be solved find out what in life he is having most trouble with find out who had that trouble briefly sec check that terminal hell feel different and gain awareness that change is possible you can even q and with his feeling that nothing works find someone else who felt that way and run ow on the person you can always count on whatever the pcs complaining about being present in another person keyed in by his ow on the person its also always on his own goals line so you are unburdening him with it try to handle something for the pc it will make your meter read better you can always find something the person will remember that will key out that was the procedure in 1950 the only trouble was that it only worked for 20 30 of cases and people tended to key it right back in because ow was run on the person who had it you can always run terminal for little while you could find eventually that you were the pcs opposition terminal sitting right there going in the teeth of his worst aberration auditing will nevertheless work over the top of this your job in handling pc is to get the pc to sit down and have some confidence and read on meter it could take up to seventyfive hours to get the pc into that state of mind but it is necessary to do so dont be in such hurry he has been crazy for the past 100 trillion years as far as auditor training is concerned its obviously better for the auditor to have degree of confidence and expertness and to know what he has been doing because the pcs confidence will go up at once so you will get something like 3d it all works itself out for us the pc is being run on security checks and the auditor is gaining confidence in his metering at the same time we trust the auditor wont miss too many sec check questions if the auditor isnt too familiar with the meter have him spend half an hour on end ruds so he can get what sec check question has been missed cleaned up well this keeps pcs from being upset pcs will also be upset by not being asked for the withhold behind the critical thought asking for critical thoughts is just trap for the pc to get in on the overt slippily 6112c12 shspec91 sec checks in processing what every good auditor should have 1 british mark iv meter 2 someone to handle appointments money etc 3 two understudies who have had good hpa training and who need some real brush up to class ii see hcopl 26may61 modification of hpahca bscnhcs schedule 122per this pl the hpa course consists of two units unit 1 and unit 2 unit 1 consists of trs metering model session and ruds unit 2 consists of the 36 presessions finding the hav and confront process for the pc general assessment and running pcs on prehav scale not sop goals and sec checking for definition of classes of auditors see hcopl 29sep61 hgc allowed processes class i refers to relatively unskilled hcahpa graduated or field or staff auditors etc this auditor is allowed to audit only process that he has had success with on pcs regardless of the hgc pcs case requirements class ii auditors have passed hco quizzes on emeter essentials model session sec checking and tape 6109c26 shspec58 teaching the field sec checks they are only allowed to audit sec checks class iii auditors may audit routine 3 but not run engrams class iv auditors are releases have had their goal and terminal found and have had engrams run on their goals terminal chain and have excellent subjective reality on engrams these auditors may run routine 3 and engrams on hgc pcs unless an auditor has these things he will get auditing done hell either spend all his time setting up cases or more likely he will try to assess routine 3d on someone who isnt set up and fall on his head he also needs someone to handle the admin end you can easily get pcs with an ad like you can always talk to scientologist about your difficulties having someone doing admin is always security that the people you help will pay you for the service it is not really too bad that it takes some skill to apply routine 3d if you let loose powerful technology which anyone at all could apply youd be in trouble technology that doesnt require skilled applicator is what this world mainly suffers from for instance any government official can push the button on an atomic bomb if tech requires skill you cant build an ethic into it the broad program on which we are operating is concise and broad we have central organizations and offices all over earth which suffer mainly from lack of technology that they will now have the policy is to build in selfreliance within fixed pattern in the central orgs field auditors have been attempting to put up standard and having it collapse they generally dont get as consistently good results as hgcs which is why hgcs got started in the first place the basic reason for success in the hgcs is the stiffer discipline there the central organization as long as it is impoverished and feeling bad tends to go into games conditions with other orgs or field auditors this is simply because of lack of success when theres scarcity and havingness is low theres games condition scarcity is repaired by technical excellence the briefing course was instituted for only one reason to get the highest possible level of technology step 6 would work today but in fact it didnt work because it was never done in running step 6 before you had the pc make the object bigger smaller etc you had to find null object on the meter wherever it beefed up banks null object wasnt found relate it to the gpm if you found an object which quivered on the meter you would be onto the gpm and you wouldnt dare to do anything with it but you could take something not related to the gpm and exercise the pc on creating and mocking it up without antagonizing or messing up particularly the gpm the pc with some of the automaticities of mocking things up off could theoretically have the gpm evaporate details on running routine 3d q and puts the withhold in to stay when the pc gives you the withhold that is all you need if it still registers theres another withhold its not more on the withhold he has given you the reason you vary the question in sec checking is just to get more withholds to help the pc out but you always end up by asking the original question to see if it is cleared if you add any new sec check questions make them pertinent to what you are doing if burst of misemotion occurs on sec check or class ii activity it is turned off by what turned it on that is true of all secondaries particularly of an assessment running havingness or sec check question if withhold turned it on some withhold is keeping it powered up so get the withhold if misemotion is turned on by havingness you can find out what is happening if you like but continue the process that turned it on its cruelty to do otherwise matter how kind it may seem any other process you may switch to is so much less powerful than what you have been running that it wont handle the misemotion it takes more of the same 123the greatest cruelty is being kind to the pc it will not help pc to omit sec checking him or to rush him into an assessment he will never get through routine 3d levels if you do if you left sec check question unflat in one session dont spend the session getting ruds in flatten the question if the ta has soared meanwhile find out what has been going on if bypassing ptp upsets the pc go back to the earlier withhold that preceded it it could be some undelivered comm if the session looks confused to the auditor the pc will get upset the pc is trying to make session out of it so he is harder to audit if the auditor is confused because the pc reacts to the confusion of the auditor an unskilled auditor has much tougher pcs than anybody else then because it is all so complicated the unskilled auditor sees nothing wrong with adding more complications so he puts in additives the job is to teach people not to put in lots of useless stuff keep it very simple and they will win 6112c14 shspec93 anatomy of problems problem is postulate counterpostulate force counterforce idea versus idea solution versus solution you have two people in collision in trouble with each other to be in trouble with each other they have to be in the same time stream and they have to be able to communicate do you realize that you with your problems are on separate time stream from the physical universe and thats why you are not in present time so even in an individual you have two time streams how do you suppose pc got out of pt he must have started off in some instant of time that went on this same timestream but he went off on spur line during the middle of say race he finds his watch missing its an important thing to him and he loses it while he is at the racetrack in timestream called the race he tries to go back to the time he lost the watch and therefore on the subject of the watch he has departure in time from the timestream he starts running on back timetrack while time goes forward on the agreedupon time track he is trying to find out what happened not to stop time he just wants to see what happened thetan has the facility of running on another time stream so he goes off sideways worrying about it he has problem now and because he hasnt solved it very well he gets stuck in it but then he really gets stuck by solving it he becomes the foe of all pickpockets so he wont lose his watch but hes already on slightly different timestream and he remains on it because he started it you normally refer to this sort of thing as game rather downgraded one he isnt really hung up in moment of this timestream but in moment of departure the rest of the time he sort of makes time himself it becomes an endless affair that can float along forever so you are running along in session and he suddenly has picture of racetrack that picture exists in another timestream which he can slip into how about the fellow who didnt enter this universe at all you never met him he isnt on the time stream can you have problem with him when you have never met him and never will youve never had anything in common with him youve never communicated with him youve never gotten any ows on him so how can you have problem with him you cant so all problems have their own timestream between the two beingnesses ideas forces or whatever they must also have means of communication two armies will maneuver forward until someone fires shot thats communication which everybody can understand now the communication enlarges and they can really have an agreement not disagreement to have war now they can have problems with logistics mechanics propaganda and how to have motivators big enough to justify the overts where you see an argument there must have been prior agreement even light one cf the idea that there can be arc break without prior abc this is why the goriest wars are civil wars the defeated in civil war are treated like criminals not just losers this is because there has been tremendous amount of agreement so the arc break is very severe similarly with serious 2d upsets there couldnt be wild disagreement resulting in problem unless there was some prior agreement the problem is as large as there has been agreement france and germany have common blood going back to the conquest of gaul by the franks 124there might be road out on the solution of problem in the recognition that 3d is based on one time total agreement remember about games pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism person gets on one side of game to the degree that he has reduced his pandeterminism accepted otherdeterminism and considers himself to be operating on selfdeterminism there are always these factors there must be an outside disinterested arbitrator to resolve the problem thats where the auditor comes in routine 3d is one of the roughest ones to figure out even lrh had to have outside help to the degree of someone else reading the emeter to figure it out it was so involved that it was all selfdetermined or otherdetermined with pandetermined factors at all it looks at first to the pc like there are at least forty or fifty vital factors it takes the auditor to shake it all down to five the auditor does it by listing and assessing down to one item which will either be totally right or utterly wrong oppterm that is it will be either totally selfdetermined terminal or totally otherdetermined oppterm notice that any item you choose will get one of three reactions from the pc 1 he doesnt know if it is right and doesnt care this is rare it could be wrong item or he could be arc broken or groggy 2 it could be selfdetermined or otherdetermined 3 the pc could do flipflop between self and otherdeterminism this phenomenon is lower scale mockery of pan self and otherdeterminism the three factors present in all problems the pc just dramatizes these as he gets into the gpm hell be on one side for few days then go into dont know then go pandetermined for bit i can have both viewpoints im really something else so just run the side you can chip at best and if you are not making progress you have chosen side he cant confront there are levels of confront to consider if we were going to run only one side it would be vital to get the right one you could just run the right side of the right levels and hed go clear but you cant always expect it to happen the harder he is enmeshed in the gpm the less distinct it is to him that either side is real or he is liable to be very fixed in one side and not at all in the other as you run him he has hard time of it if you pick the wrong side for him he will run long time the gpm is problem before it was problem it was an agreement and after it was an agreement it was game there was time continuum and these two elements beingnesses and ideas which make up the 3d 3rd dynamic existed once in their nuclear form as total agreement 1 they were in the same timestream 2 they were in perfect communication 3 they had tremendous agreement and goals on what they were doing they had all these things in common and then they started to depart one from the other and got into game which got very thorough the game deteriorated into problem and stuck ie 1 there was long period of total agreement 2 then there was agreement on the game they got into 3 then it got to be very deadly and got beyond game into being problem but having originated with its own timecontinuum the problem continues up into present time as gpm the easiest way to approach it for most pcs is to find that side they can most easily fight that will give them big case gains and will take big solutions off the top of the problem but recognize that we have long way to go after having taken the solutions off the top of the problem the end of the auditing is not just reaching the end of the prehav levels but could be expected to go on further you now have the selfdeterminism otherdeterminism softened up bit you still have to attain self determinism for the other side for the pc and pandeterminism the pc is really on neither side the pc has been waterbucks he has been tigers before there were waterbucks and tigers as enemies the pc couldnt have told the difference between them they would have had the same goal they werent very solidly waterbucks or tigers yet their nowimsupposedtos werent yet congealed to 125that extent then they started separating out distinct characteristics which were only waterbucks or only tigers then they solved problems different ways and the game deteriorated into some very standard nowimsupposedtos those were specialized forms of selfdetermined survival that had nothing to do with pandeterminism but great deal to do with otherdeterminism the truth of the matter however is that the pc is neither side tiger or waterbuck and is capable of being either the pc shifts from one side to the other just because you have audited him lot just because you have done listing and nulling of his items thats tremendous amount of auditing his nowim supposedtos are shook up like dice in box now he will dramatize both sides while before you started auditing he was fixed in one side and dramatized it on stimulusresponse basis so the pc is assessed youve got the routine 3d package and now you want to find the right side for the pc the only thing that makes it the right side is that the pc can run it with benefit tis the side he can run best to run out somatics and break up the gpm its not that the pc is that side because the pc is equally the other side and is neither side in truth and is capable of being both both sides are equally otherdetermined to him but one side is higher than the other on the tone scale so it is easier to view as the ally and harder to buck in auditing but the pc has used both sides down through the ages until he has so many overts on himself as waterbuck that these overbalanced and he became tiger you are trying to establish the pandeterminism of thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad action because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he has some game running that has resulted in an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos all nowimsupposedtos were part of some old problem and earlier than that some old game and earlier than that some old agreement the pcs pandeterminism has been submerged and he is being obsessively selfdetermined which pins him thoroughly on dynamic and he is longer loose on the dynamics your first attack on routine 3d package is just to find the onlyonlyness of it does the pc think of himself mostly as waterbuck at this moment the easiest side to run is usually the lower toned side if you run the pc as it because of the trick of the commands you get more attack against the weakest side of the gpm so it runs more mass and more flows and it is easier for the pc to handle the other side may either totally slay him or have reality at all he is not capable of attacking tigers because they are too much for him they dont exist for him if you run this one watch out the pc may get so overwhumped that before the pc realizes it he is down the tubes even so if you kept attacking something would happen it would be uncomfortable for the pc he would arc break easily but hell try it but he doesnt get reality out of it thats the basic liability could you just blow one of these things up in the early stages of the run if you ask the pc what he would think of blowing it up or wiping it all out at one fell swoop hed go into an awful confusion he hasnt got it differentiated enough to do much about it he couldnt attack one side of the problem because it was too big for him to find it real what will be his reaction to wiping out the whole thing thats about seven times as unreal the idea of this game ever having an end or beginning is preposterous in view of the fact that there are confusions on down the line that tend to bang the pc up into the problem as you audit the thing you keep on hitting confusions of one kind or another it keeps banging the pc up towards pt so the track to him looks shorter and shorter he thinks maybe he was only waterbuck for one lifetime then it broadens out again and hell feel he was waterbuck for very long time what remains to be sorted out is the easiest way to beat the gpm over month or two you might be able to take pieces of it the pc can find conflicts and date them on the meter and get the whole track plotted on the subject that would soften up the gpm just by getting it aligned and assigned correctly on the track during that time you wouldnt have to figure out which side the pc was on this is feasible method of clearing somebody it would mean teaching people to date on the emeter which is quite skill but it could be done and its quite tool or you could find every confusion that might precede any stuck picture the pc has on the subject of waterbucks vs tigers find what the person was at the time and what they did it would be an interesting gimmick to make list of the number of goals the terminal and oppterm have in common or of the points on which they would be in agreement or you could ask what game would waterbuck play with tiger and vice verse it 126would all run out the center of the problem once the prehav runs have straightened it out somewhat all you are trying to do it to establish the pandeterminism of the thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad one because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he had some game going which has become an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos you are trying to establish the pcs pan determinism so he can breaths before auditing the pc is being solution solution solution the next thing you see with auditing is problem problem problem when this is peeled off he is game game game the ta goes up on the pc because he is breaking the mores of the terminal not necessarily those of society or his present group guy whose terminal is cat burglar will get high ta when he goes to bed at night because he refused to dramatize or went against the terminal 6112c20 shspec95 upgrading of auditors most people are diffident about tampering with other peoples minds better mechanism could be devised to keep race enslaved it means take responsibility for anyones thinking but your own and not even for that and you will stay in every implant you have ever been handed this ensures that revolt will ever come out of any planet this is the principle of the boxer if your opponent is knocked out hes safe but there is game this is galactic council thinking ie the thought of supergovernments which are slaverule governments these governments are in bottom scale nogames condition when they know all about it and nothing ever happens they go for this kind of concentration camp populations where everybody is out of the running and giving trouble the first thing you do to create this condition is never to let anyone tamper with anyones mind or thinking it guarantees that one will ever asis anything its put over as the principle that the right to privacy is paramount some auditors are more affected by this than others these are auditors who are withholding their terminals they have terminal and an oppterm and they are withholding both of them because they have been thoroughly punished for having been it so they know thats the safe thing to do to withhold the terminal first one has the right to privacy of minds it is accident that in 50000 years one on this planet has come close to even the edge of scientology the right to freedom is one thing the right to privacy is something else galactic thinking approves of the second not the first lrhs opinion is the opposite the trouble with the galactic thinking that would make criminal into mest by implanting him is that its unsuccessful you cant guarantee that he will stay mest just as you cant guarantee that planet wont revolt you cant guarantee that wisdom wont get abroad all you can guarantee is that thetans are basically good but get all mixed up but when you unmix them they revert to being good this is unpopular in galactic councils because it makes people so active and unpredictable these truths may or may not be known to galactic rulers case advance results in greater controlled motion motion in the vicinity of insanity is uncontrolled random motion directed controlled motion is preferable but dont try to sell the rulers of the universe on this because it would mean their losing power you will observe that people who arent totally spun in are willing to inquire into others minds because they havent accepted the idea that everything will be all right if you just be quiet auditors fall into three categories 1 the fairly free individual who hasnt taken his terminal too heavily he hasnt quite subscribed to the philosophy that hes slave hell charge in 2 the individual who can recognize intellectually that it would be all right to invade the privacy of others and that the only way he could set them free is if this sort of thing occurred but who has terminal so worded that he withholds it violently its hard to get this kind of auditor up to class ii because his terminal gets in his road his terminal seems dangerous so he will hold it out of action which makes it go into action withholding of the terminal is the key to the 3d package thats what makes it go out of sight its fantastic that you can get to it at all the degree that the pc withholds pt overts is the degree to which he is withholding his terminal if he is doing it hard he will have trouble getting other people to give up their withholds as 127he will have trouble doing good sec checks even though he knows intellectually what he should be doing he can be educated into doing it right 3 the third category of individual is too mixed in to be able to audit at all he forms large percentage of the human race he is often found in government where his galactic thinking is the norm he wont even try to get off withholds conduct in session is monitored by the terminal package it shows up as unwillingness to get off withholds plus doubt about it which also comes from the pulledin mass of the terminal the modifier modifies their conduct whenever ruds are out theyll dramatize it when ruds go out oddly enough auditors dont have cases the modifier doesnt much influence their auditing what influences the auditor is the amount of withhold on the terminal there is another factor in the plan of auditing every withhold the pc has is stacked up on top of withholdingness of the terminal since present time has greater value than past time presentlife overts and withholds have the terminal so glued down that it is virtually unassessable at first sec checking gets the withholds off so the terminal can come to view this gives us an estimate of how long it will take to get pc ready to be assessed and how long it will take given auditor to get assessed for his terminal its not necessarily the more violent or secret types of terminals that get the most withheld but the persons reaction to sec checks and ability to sec check is what alerts you to how quickly or easily they will be assessed one is only worried or concerned about subject when theres notknow on the subject therefore you can handle pc to the degree that you understand pcs because you can see whats happening with the pc someone who has never had bad auditing wont necessarily audit well because he has reality on what it is like to audit poorly getting some bad auditing would really make citizen out of him and give him an appreciation of perfectionist attitude toward training which prevents the technology from getting lost there is value in having been aberrated it gives you wealth of experience that you can gain in other way even if at present its unavailable to you it is the experience of knucklehead of course and few trillion years of such experience should be enough its time now to get experience in other lines than that of your terminal when life follows pattern from an aberrated to sane state the best way to accumulate experience in that direction is to take someone who is aberrated and teach them something and improve them at the same time misadventure can be teacher it is the only teacher if you have to learn solely by experience clearing would have value whatsoever if it was matter of just taking pill or having some magic formula to get it one ever appreciates his freedom unless he has had to work for it if person doesnt have to work for his freedom he never finds out that he is free you could even clear someone who doesnt realize that anything has happened that anything was improved or that they are going anyplace he has purpose to which to put his new breadth of skill and its more than he needs on this cottonpicking planet the net result is feeling of lose for you youve taken the chains off fellow and the chains left some rust marks and he keeps looking at the rust marks and he still thinks they are chains then one day he realizes hes not wearing any chains and goes into overwhelm and sets you up as household deity 6201c10 shspec98 sec checks withholds the process 2010 is used to handle psychosomatic difficulties using class ii skills and sec checking 2010 is process where ten minutes of havingness is run for every twenty minutes of sec checking this is run for 75 to 200 hours before attacking routine 3dxx see hcob 11jan62 security checking twentyten theory 128there is danger in sec checking by ritual you should do it by fundamentals heres what happens because you dont quite grasp the fundamental someone stiffens up the ritual then it stiffens again and you become ritualist and can depart from effective auditing the thing to do is to get the job done auditing is what you can get away with with the pc because you cant get away with everything ritual gets set down circumscribing what you should try to get away with model session is good thing to use except with few pcs who would never get past the third question see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised7 you can imagine case that is so critically poised that you have to find out what the mind is doing in order to parallel it if you tried to do model session to find out you would be in culdesac because the case doesnt have that much attention concentrated for instance take madman who could still be handled with basic sec checking he is insane because he keyed in an insane valence by withholding its not this lifetime that aberrated anyone people say that you cant understand the mind because this lifetime doesnt explain why people are aberrated someone who is insane got that way by keying in implants that he gave to drive enemy troops insane to prevent them from coming back plus some similar overts which developed an insane valence insane people can go in and out of valences very easily it is the notknow they have run on other people that results in the withhold on themselves so what basic question could you ask this fellow which he could answer to start keying out the insanity you could ask what dont people know about you he would answer it it is so fundamental that he couldnt help answering it case could be so attentive to its difficulties that it is already in session to try to fly ruds would be to distract the pcs attention from his case with deranged person the dont know question works well it crosscuts the ow questions when case does not consider something an overt he will still answer up to notknow and will come up to recognizing his withholds you can use such questions as what dont i know about you what dont you know about your condition what dont others know about you your condition what you are doing auditing by fundamental would be to restore the pcs communication with society or the group with which he is connected you would expect person who is having hard time with the social structure he is in to have withholds from that social structure you see this in vignette all the time you missed withhold and the pc got upset with you its reversed comm line he has ptps because he has withholds from people withhold is withhold whether the pc considers them withholds or not for instance if the pc withholds losing his temper with people its laudable but it is still withhold if in finding withholds you dont look for such withholds or for simple withheld communications you will have devil of time keeping ruds in the pc is busy little beaver sitting there thinking and withholding critical thoughts etc withholds are not confined to crimes the magnitude of the crime does not establish the magnitude of the withhold it is the force with which he is withholding so anything the pc is withholding is withhold anything he is not communicating is withhold when you realize this you will get ruds in with clank and be able to assess just fine and sec checking will go fine sec checking will fail if you expect the magnitude of the withhold to give you the magnitude of the recovery it is the magnitude of the restraint of the withholding that does it the way to find what the case is withholding is to get what any part of the eight dynamics doesnt know about him the way you have gravity is by withholding self from space most of your sec checking will be on the third dynamic since it is the most complicated and there have been so many groups on the track but you might do well to look at the others too the second dynamic is of course loaded with mores to violate withhold is restraining self from communicating the corresponding overt is restraining another from communicating when someone is withholding some action he gets into the valence of someone who would do the action moral codes are patterns of behavior on all eight dynamics that means you are triggering those moments when the pc was not communicating perforce he should have been talking and he wasnt thats what it amounts to the ability of thetan in this universe is expressed along the lines of reach and withdraw in various directions when person should be reaching and is withdrawing that is withhold then there are overts of omission he should be reaching and he is not for instance there may be times when soldier should have attacked and he ran these are overts of omission if they are the reverse of 129nowimsupposedto it all amounts to failure to communicate with the environment or restrained communication with the environment which ends up as not being here in the environment which ends up with the environment pulled in on oneself you could ask what should you have communicated and get some marvellous results where should you have been gets off effort withholds withholding is worse than just not reaching very withholdy pc will stack up withholds on subject the tiniest impulses to withhold will remain as withholds if the pc has set of withholds on subject this pc will have loads of critical thoughts if you are not sec checking its valid to ask pc what are you withholding and if you dont get fall dont press it but dont think he is not withholding because he is you dont have missed withhold to contend with but the pc has at least some laudable withholds thats ok he can be in session but he still has withhold you only have to do something about it if he gets upset and goes out of session then you will have to find it ruds in merely means in condition to be audited you can always find the ruds out if it is your purpose to audit the case by rudiments when you sec check you try to restimulate the withholds so you can clean them up this has an opposite purpose from ruds the auditors mission in sec checking is to stir up things the pc doesnt feel ok about communicating so that the withholds can be gotten off because that is what aberration is made of so be suggestive knowing fundamentals use eg what doesnt _______ know about you what have you done that _______ wouldnt like and dont miss withholds the fourth dynamic is whole species not just mankind 6201c11 shspec99 how to audit if thetan can communicate directly and straightly with things he begins to communicate more directly with his body since the eyes are the most direct comm route from thetan when youve done something with thetan you will notice the eyes changing color if i cant make pcs eyes change color i dont think ive done anything making somebody well is not much of trick bodies are ok but to fixate on one totally is silly if you are dealing with technology that can restore the comm lines of thetan you are going to find psychosomatics knocked out with 2010 you may also find pcs getting whole new set of psychosomatics body responds in direct ratio to the communication level of the thetan running it body will also run on complete automatic so body can be in good shape when the thetan is nowhere around and because the thetan is nowhere around you will see some people hollywood starlet types for instance who are simply operating bodies these are people who are so irresponsible that they dont have enough thetan horsepower to make body sick similarly with the dead thetan case which reads at clear but with stuck needle aberration on help etc if you process such pc hs will come uh into some degree of density if you dont get some physical changes you are doing something different from what lrh is trying to teach you with current technologies lot of you think you are doing fine i dont think so yet because i havent seen you changing the color of anybodys eyes i can so why cant you ill audit pc until their eyecolor changes maybe its just very faint change and maybe its from brown to blue but its change because thats the most direct channel of communication from the thetan to you and to the outside world and if you can improve that channel of communication from the thetan outward it cant help but do something to his eyes theyll at least sparkle or glisten differently im asking you to audit the pc who is sitting in front of you and not somebody else and not some synthetic person that you dreamed up audit the guy who is there please to produce disaster miss withhold and you have had it the next time the pc has an arc break just follow it back to the withhold you can always hold pc in session with technical tricks but dont stop with tricks audit the person in front or you that person he is mystery as far as fundamentals are concerned he is nevertheless an individual peculiar handmade mud pie you have got to be able to put your finger on any button that is in there to be pressed and produce considerable reaction in the pc you have to be able to advance the pcs communication and that is all you are trying to produce all that is wrong with the pc is that he has shortened the reach of his communication as his ability to reach which is to say to communicate decreases he considers that he is aberrated when you audit this person all you have got to do is to extend his communication reach workable processes have all done this 130the pcs inability to reach can come about from two things 1 he is restraining himself from reaching in some fashion 2 he doesnt know what to reach into or at auditing the second button gives you the biggest gains for instance routine 3d straightens out the messedup condition inside his mind on the first button the auditor has to figure out what the restraint of reach is about we call this withholds how is he restraining himself from reaching he has overtly reached at some point then he has decided that was bad thing to do so he withholds the reach next time this gives you confusion followed by rest point the withhold which locks it on the track and makes it float rather timelessly this is not as bad as problem but it is similar now that the thetan has decided he must never exercise that type of reach again he has forgotten what type of reach he was exercising that he mustnt reach again so he is now in total confusion as to what he is withholding so how are you going to get off this persons particular and peculiar withholds not by virtue of any form lrh has made to get at his withholds he is after all unique an auditor can get so lost in the infinite variety of the pcs 3d package and the complexity and idiocy of the pcs withholds that the auditor believes he cant reach but thats the auditors belief that he cant reach the reason the pc wont reach into black masses or valences is that they are enturbulative after all they did kill him many times so he knows better than to touch them they give him somatics even in session colds etc when he forgets himself and takes direct and instantly forgotten look at them people complain about scientologists lack of sympathy but once you have learned to handle something to the degree that we have confound it you just cant bring yourself to worship it anymore you know too much about the cause and effect of it all what are persons basic withholds they could be anything but he knows he will be punished for getting them off because hes made people guilty for doing such things this is great mechanism he really knows his withholds have nothing to do with his state of health or his brightness person cant improve his reach and communication while simultaneously restraining his communication so an auditor has two zones of action in dianetics he has pictures which are shallow look compared to valences which are whole packages of pictures each valence represents at least one lifetime so what things are keeping the pc from communicating he is impeding his own reach by having things he feels he cannot communicate now it is up to the auditor to get these off by whatever means are effective he has to be able to get that pcs withholds all you are trying to do is release the comm lines that the pc has pulled in on himself so he can widen the zones into which he can again reach all you have to do to get withholds off is to find where the pc isnt how come he blew from some elsewhere he is at least withholding himself from all the places he is not that is not aberrative in itself but you could say to the pc where havent you liked to be the pc says i never liked to be at the seashore ok hes not at the seashore and doesnt want to be all sorts of withholds could be developed from this ask him what have they done to you at the seashore and who was it who did it then rave you thought any critical thoughts about the person then what have you done to the person so the procedure is 1 where havent you liked to be 2 what have they done to you at location get details 3 who did it to you 4 get any critical thoughts about the person 5 what have you done to that person in running 2010 running havingness will get the pc to give you more withholds 131if the pc considers that he doesnt have any withholds you can run what the person about whom he is critical doesnt know about him and he will eventually come up to seeing his withholds and overts the trick is to audit with the ruds in and run the ruds so they stay in and then throw the pc around stir up the pcs bank and get the withholds dont muddy the still waters of the rudiments so that the pc never dreams of being anywhere but in session then churn up the pcs bank in the body of the session the pc has been careful not to do this for trillenia so it is the auditor who has got to make something happen so when you get something reading on the meter get the pc talking about it get his critical thoughts and let him get off the motivators and finally go on to the trap get the overts and withholds technique of running hidden standards etc with routine 3d 6201c16 shspec100 nature of withholds we are not trying to teach you not to have withholds it is ok not to do everything that occurs to you good or bad we are trying to get you out of the tangle you got yourself into what do you mean having such terrible impulses why does the pc have these impulses that he now has to withhold the withhold is that area of motionlessness following that area of doingness which you shouldnt have done this classifies actions into things you should have done and things you shouldnt have done of course there are laudable withholds eg not to have gotten angry or done some overt laudable withhold is something society expects of you providing you have these other impulses to do things you shouldnt according to society so all actions divide into laudable and undesirable laudable withhold goes with an undesirable action withholding self from doing it and the laudable action goes along with an undesirable withhold so society can always enforce mores by making some actions and some withholds laudable but since there are so many groups whose mores conflict one can get rather confused the same action in different times or places can be good or bad there is action that is good in all times and places and there is withhold that should be withheld at all times and places it all depends on viewpoint when sec checking we must then be dealing with another factor people compute that good people withhold more than bad people so the gooder you are the less you communicate so the goodest people are in cemeteries we must be doing something other than pulling withholds we are we are remedying the compulsion or obsession to commit actions that have to be withheld sec checking is to remedy unreasonable action thats all what you want to rehabilitate is his ability to determine his own actions this also rehabilitates his communication as well as covering whatever mores he will wind up with control of communication downgrades into mest as control of reach communication is the ability to control an outflow or inflow or stop it this downgrades into control of reach where you have person who is unable to leave his house the trouble is not the house but picadilly circus the pc is afraid that someday he will be in picadilly circus and take off all his clothes but he has forgotten this all he knows is that he mustnt leave home he has occluded the overt and the withhold the mechanism is that the pc can be so worried about taking his clothes off in picadilly circus that he will think of nothing but withholding this this circumscribes his life considerably this is the mechanism of phobias having to remember to do some desirable action is similar attention trap eg the superstitions that kids get into if we educated the same man never to outflow and never to withhold either both equally balanced we would have an insane ridge he would get stuck in an inaction because he would forget what he wasnt supposed to do and what he was withholding he would have covered overt and covered withhold and be motionless in some sphere he would not be free to communicate because he couldnt find out what the desirable action was the average person is in this condition he doesnt know what he must reach and what he must withhold but the habit pattern of caution stays with him all psychoanalysis trained people to be was cautious someone with an enforced outflow has similar problem he must go or do or whatever without knowing why in order to restore control over ones reach not reach be reached not be reached one must get these unknowingnesses out of the road or the person will sometimes be nervous to the point of collapse when you ask them to do something or other 132in order to aberrate somebody establish compulsion to reach or to withdraw withhold as an absolute necessity then shift them in time and place to produce necessity for this so they forget it make an unknowingness out of it all do this several hundred thousand times and the person will start to feel he didnt know what he should be doing when person gets very bad off any decision to act causes him to withhold and vice versa government programs are good examples of this some people are totally susceptible to any inflowing action of any kind anything that happens to them in society causes them to have an instant reaction to have that with them in assessing such pcs if the auditor suggests some item they will take it even if they are assessed by an auditor with degree of altitude they will hold like briars to whatever is found right or wrong you can test such an item by getting in suppress inval and eval on the item and see if it is still in the average person is on gradient scale of this sort of thing he sees few things which restimulate him and put him on total effect basis the only thing wrong with that total effect basis is that person has command over his reach and withdraw so he is not master of his actions and cant be sensible about what he does iq is ones ability to govern ones environment scientology is almost alone in considering that man should have any selfdeterminism because others falling short of this have looked on the fact that criminal has compulsion to commit crimes being unable to do anything for criminal they think the only answer is to make the criminal withhold his crimes harder that philosophy doesnt work you can compel someone not to do something to the point where he can do nothing else he withholds so far that the withhold fails and it becomes compulsion that is the danger of the philosophy that the more good withholds we have the better off we are the basis of action in human beings is 1 he doesnt know what his compulsive actions are so he doesnt know what he is withholding notknowingness is the common denominator of all ows that are operative on the individual 2 the halfknowns that arise in sec checking where the pc knows and you dont are also source of trouble withholds are half know if the pc knows something that is not enough the auditor has to know it too the pc will get upset if you go on notknowing about it when he knows the halfknow is very uncomfortable it wont duplicate so it wont blow so it is an upsetting thing to have the withholds dont have to be serious in session they can be very trivial bits of noncommunication which multiply they are relatively unknown to the pc as they drift by an invalidation often betokens withhold so check for inval and withhold to keep the ruds in and the needle clean during sec checks and assessments withhold is the common denominator of every out rudiment the only exception is where you are running the session for forms sake and not for the pc where you are not auditing the pc who is in front of you where you have disobeyed the auditors code through not being in communication with the pc and have set up an unintentional withhold for the pc throughout the whole session the pc who cannot talk to the auditor because the auditor is not really there is on an unintentional withhold which still causes an arc break you must run the session for the pc the pc owns the session almost all breakage amongst children is due to their being put on an unintentional withhold all withholds must contain an intention to communicate the intention to reach must exist before withhold can occur there must have been an intention to communicate before there is an arc break therefore pc being audited by someone who is out of comm with him will arc break remember that every session you run is for that pc and by the auditor and for one else in training you could get auditors to make long list of all the reasons why they were running session you are liable to get fabulous things not including that it is for the pc it is the pc who owns the session not the auditor if you master that point you will overcome most of your difficulties with auditing and any distaste you might have for it if pc feels that he cant comm to the auditor this equates to the fact that he must be withholding this restimulates other withholds of undesirable action the restimulated withhold may be failed withhold which brings about obsessive action at once and the pc finds himself in the godawful position of engaging in actions he knows are reprehensible and incapable of stopping himself from acting he wonders how he got in this position as he berates the auditor he feels bad about the fact 133that he is doing these actions while he is doing them so you by letting him have session withhold are likely to get him into this weird action which amazes him most of all tr0 and tr4 are the most important trs from the standpoint of getting and keeping the pc in session tr0 is important from the auditors viewpoint tr4 from the pcs the way to handle tr4 is to be sure that it is the pcs session just give him the session in sec checking you are trying to discover the actions that are considered undesirable by the pc and the withholds that restrain them you get off the withhold by blowing the prior confusion when you are sec checking you are on the business of the prior confusion and the motionless point the prior confusion is the overt the stable datum is the withhold the anatomy of withhold is 1 done undesirable action 2 stop undesirable action 3 natter the guy cant reach and he cant withhold but he can natter when you have the withhold you have the motionless point but you must get the prior confusion you must get what the flowed since this pc is the one who is there being audited this is why you must get the done in pulling withhold use the critical statement to find the overt but dont pull the unkind thought pull the overt underlying it this overt is what gives you sort of motor action natter is not necessarily motivatorish to get the charge off step 2 above you can ask the pc have you ever done that since the pc will think you are asking for more overts but in fact you are getting him to spot whether he has been withholding himself from doing it ever since he will be relieved when that withhold is off because the stress of maintaining the withhold is relieved he can feel uncomfortable just getting off the fact of having done some undesirable action because you have unstrapped some of the restraint against doing it again he wont feel relief from the session because the full extent of the withhold isnt off yet so ask the above question the pc may not be entirely happy about giving up the withhold doing this may trigger off ways he was restraining himself without getting the overt he may be afraid to get all the withhold off because he might do the action so make it rule always to find the overt also ask for other times he did it and didnt do it get all 6201c23 shspec103 basics of auditing person who is fairly new to scientology and in doubt about it is frequently someone who is just stuck in ridge where he has certainty that anything works or happens there is sense in trying to shove training down his throat he needs auditing first his whole life is in maybe and he will have to be run on positive and negative to handle the ridge another easily overcome barrier to training is pretended knowingness it is downscale mockery of knowing it gives the pc funny sensation being thorough going fake but it doesnt buck your effort to train as much as the maybe case person stuck in maybe can make trouble as pc too he often sets extravagant unreal session goals and is in an obsessive games condition with the auditor where he is attempting to give the auditor loses the pc will go out of session very easily he is not under the auditors control run him lightly fundamental processes give only light effects this is noeffect case and you must audit him with feather 8c is not low enough for them they go around touching walls with never comm lag the process doesnt bite because they are not really there sit them down with some small dull object like piece of chalk and have them get the idea that the chalk is there not there this will pick up lot of confusion and randomity work with the person take the chalk away let them see what that would look like run the process until the pc takes over the automaticity of not ising physical objects and the room starts going solid on them keep on with the process it is very light you are dealing with the old effect scale as the pc goes down towards total effect the effect he can experience is breath of air noeffect case cant confront or even notice large effect only very small one if you blew them up they would never find out about it thats too much effect we see that clearly in the overtmotivator phenomenon the more motivators the person has earned the less motivators the person can have so what to you seems minor to the person is major disaster he thinks everyone is against him etc but he couldnt perceive large explosive action if it occurred 134his automatic notis takes care of large effects you could probably give him session full of gaes noauditing and he wouldnt notice the badness of it but if you missed one tick on an arc break he would notice the small error critics of auditing are always looking for small errors on this basis in country like spain or mexico there can be enormous misgovernment atrocious wars banditry etc and at the same time punctilious courtesy and honesty in small things they dont see the gross outnesses democracy is only as good as people can see what is going on it is the enoughmotivator of an old empire that results in the notis lowscale cases could be given very bad auditing without their noticing this is not advised but it could be done middle range pcs will be aware of both large and small errors and are affected by them when they come upscale they see the whole error and are less affected by it than the lowscale pc so as you audit people up the line your auditing has to improve forms rituals procedures none of these will see you through session all that will see you through is auditing the second you start leaning on your tools like model session you are in trouble what is phenomenal is that you can make gain with pcs using only ritual auditing is science not an art lrhs sessions contain lots of auditing covering the bare bones of model session student sessions have the bones showing through the pc even if he is trained auditor or especially if he is is very aware of your taking up beginning rudiments but what is the pc doing listening to the auditing bones he is supposed to be interested in his case and there he is listening to the bones rattle good auditing is when you didnt notice the auditor using model session when he was using it it is smooooth theres need to make production out of everything you do get so that you can shift gears smoothly from say running simple havingness process to finding what inval or eval has caused it to stop working the more the pc is in session the faster the pc will blow an aberration the less afraid of things they are the less they duck and dodge and the braver they feel if the pc comes in talking about ptp he is stuck in handle it dont worry about formal start of session when it is handled get model session going so you either have to use tr4 when the pc comes up with any of the myriad things pcs can come up with or if it is something that really is in need of more handling you must know how to handle it you have the horsepower to head the pc in the right direction down through the slot the pc needs to get where he is going so use it and get him to the slot now there are four flows to the flow process 1 outflow 2 restrained outflow 3 inflow 4 restrained inflow all of these are selfdetermined they are easy for the pc to selfdetermine we have hitherto looked on inflow as motivators and restrained inflow as sort of motivator side of it but mixed up in the motivators is the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow occur and the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow not occur respectively flows three and four are not as important as withhold and outflow you handle flows one and two all the time pc can selfdetermine bad inflow in order to get motivator when you make an auditing error that causes the pc to arc break the action seems to be so much yours that you seldom notice the selfdetermined part the pc has in it maybe he did it so he could outflow makeyouguilty there are more than four flows of course theres the pc determining the flows for someone else for third dynamics etc how could you use flow processes in session to keep ruds in suppose the pc keeps coming up with session withholds how about tripping one of the other flows eg run what have you outflowed in this session to balance all his withholds then get when he started not wanting to outflow get the objection to the outflow off and the tendency to withhold vanishes or ask have you been inflowing the pc says yes auditing commands you dont have to q and with it just accept it and the pc has blown it you dont have to take up all the pcs withholds by the way let blown overts and withholds expire when they are blown dont try to remedy nonexistent 135situation on any flow line what you want to know is when it started roughly and how long it has been going on and whether the phenomenon whatever it is happened again etc just give it lick and promise when used as ruds pc who is going sporadically outruds has flow out that you havent spotted you could use onceover on beginning ruds too on flows this all gets what the pc is doing that he isnt communicating its all basically withholds that mess him up so the flows direct his attention to the things he hasnt told you as long as the auditor has the desire to assist the pc and to keep him communicating the auditor can straighten the pc up and keep the session going under almost any conditions an auditor can interfere with pcs comm to him in various ways there are obsessive withholds on other people for instance eg cop restraining people from committing crimes or tax collector getting people to outflow if an auditor is dramatizing some such valence he will prevent the pcs comm or make him talk after hes said all auditors always talk too much an auditor who talks too much is for the pc confused area which the pc cant reach so the pc cannot talk into the area since the pcs havingness is often down anyway the auditors talking can reduce it to the point where the pc dopes off processes that clean up the auditor for the pc make the auditor more haveable who would i have to be to audit you or what dont i know about you would help generally its bad idea for the auditor to use his body for anything in the session one exception is that if the pc believes the auditor is too enturbulative you can run put your hand on my shoulder repetitively few commands of this will help by giving the pc the illusion of being able to reach the auditor the auditor who tries to put the pc on an obsessive withhold is of course poor auditor the other extreme is the auditor into whose zone one must never reach the auditor who runs away by say changing processes before they are flat the pc will be aware of this more than the auditor as noauditing the difficulties you have as an auditor are of your own making and stem from using ritual to avoid auditing there is substitute for sitting down with the pc using what you know of the mind auditing his case finding what it is squaring it up etc all for the pc with auditing intended if you have other considerations entering into it criticising the pc or whatever you wont get much auditing done 6201c24 shspec104 training duplication there are two ways of getting someone out of apathy one on the route of making auditors the other on the route of auditing they are quite different to make an auditor the policy has to be that the auditor doesnt have case because if auditors had to get cases handled before they could audit one would ever audit anyone because there would be auditors so it is workable truth that auditors do not have cases you are not in such good shape yourselves these days compared to 500000000000000 years ago to make big stride towards actually making being is very fine this means that the thing can be bootstrapped even by auditors who have not had much case gain yet if it werent true we as people would never make it because the few able ones wouldnt be able to audit enough people to signify they have to train others furthermore if the few trained auditors only audited they could improve society but they would also be producing rich and poor society of aristocrats and slaves not all these more able people after auditing would suffer from lrhs peculiarity of wanting people to be free after few generations or decades we would have society of clears and slaves which is the route to chaos and destruction this is interesting as long look lrhs view of century hence includes several possibilities theres bound to be some effect with an effort of this size and effectiveness the more rapidly the job is done the better this is the same as with pc if you audit him slowly and poorly his progress is fitful part of our effectiveness is to make enough auditors if all of the students at saint hill trained auditors there would be enough auditors the job of clearing the planet is not oneman job so therefore you are learning to audit and improving in training auditors dont go in the direction of being kind expend your time on people who can be trained to audit without huge handicaps even though your natural impulse may be to spend your time on the numbskull who is all thumbs trying to get him up to level of mediocrity let him drift dont let him go but put your attention on the apt students 136it is adventurous to estimate the amount of time it will take to train someone there is however simple test you can do take datum of scientology say it to someone and have him repeat it do this few times then have him give you an example of it this educational process can knock out effect case in training let them duplicate the words eventually they will duplicate the understanding it is therapeutic as well to get someone to duplicate datum any datum the first gradient is comprehension of the words it is shocking to find morale suffering in some hgcs because of being made to duplicate bulletin exactly suppose we were just trying to increase persons ability to learn his learning rate it wouldnt matter if we were using automotive assembly books or the wpas history of socialism in northern arizona any data at all would serve you could read it off have the pc repeat it as sounds he is in tremendous data confusion which blows off as he attempts to duplicate data he will learn he can duplicate it even if it has buttons in it he will learn that duplication is just duplication just obnosis observation of what is there people will often before duplicating go off on stimulusresponse mechanism of evaluating or interest or belittling etc etc eventually the thetan wakes up and just does what you have asked he says what you said people who are aberrated get upset about this and think you are making slaves or something you are not you are just asking someone to duplicate datum if someone can do that he can also cause himself to be duplicated incidentally you can paralyze committee if you want by introducing restimulative words or buttons into the discussion study is an excellent one for this purpose beyond duplication comes understanding the duplication has to come first although people will often try to understand before they duplicate that is why study is such an important button that is getting somebody else to understand which relieves one of the responsibility for understanding this is the operating mechanism of governments that results in noaction or action from understanding democracy doesnt work in the absence of understanding when you get someone to duplicate datum he is now capable of understanding it and evaluating its importance so the third step after duplication and understanding is ability to comprehend observe and eventually judge one has ever taught judgment before there isnt much in any bank or it wouldnt be bank so the three steps are 1 duplication 2 understanding 3 judgment this is new skill one beings never had before they were capable of observation before but they always put curve on it in order to have game or something pure observation pure study pure comprehension or judgment have never been studied or known about they have merely been touched on in philosophy and avoided in religion entirely we know the source of this the greatest overt there is is enforcement of noncomprehension all the way down the responsibility scale dont know is still button when overts and withholds are over the pcs head study of notknowingness has been approached by two philosophers kant and spencer their conclusion was that what wasnt known couldnt be known so there was road to judgment for years lrh has been trying to teach auditors judgment about what was going on in the mind of another being and what to do about it it has been tough what bars you from it is notknowingness of it all it begins with duplication it cant be reached with processing because it is not already there the whole lesson of this universe is not to duplicate and not to communicate the two crimes in this universe are being there and communicating person has to become comfortable with the idea of being there and communicating and this can be approached by duplication of datum datum is location that doesnt have to be pinned down it is sort of cousin to thetan having mass thetans begin to use ideas for locations when they get driven out of places they start to use ideas as identities you can learn to have judgment by two steps duplication of data and then understanding you cannot go beyond that in teaching judgment you are learning judgment as you learn scientology this is fortunate since the very truth of the data if it were just swallowed and not understood would tend to destroy judgment since it would not have to be tested that is tests would always bear it out so 137there would be point in going through with the testing process you cannot go beyond getting person to duplicate data and understand in teaching judgment you cannot teach person how he should judge something and still have him judge it many students have run straight through being taught judgment without noticing that they have been taught it you have come up on the other side into realization of it not because you have been taught it but because you realize it this is what we know as making it your data when you are dealing with truth you always have this fourth step the ability to realize and to perceive your own selfdetermined comprehension that route has pandeterminism in it the person can understand why they learned the datum why they were taught the datum and the independent truth of the datum independent of having been taught it it may not be perfect route but it is the first route through to such an end product it has side benefit you will understand things you never understood before that have nothing to do with what you have studied an auditor must have this ability to understand what is going on without going into tryingtounderstand when the pc says something aberrated the auditor can and should just duplicate and acknowledge the pcs originations and not q and and go off into getting the reasons behind all the pcs originations so if you find an area where auditors cant duplicate bulletin you can tell how they have been handling pcs lots of q and efforts to understand before duplicating etc people who are going through having to duplicate first get into resentment they look gaunt apathetic then they get up to anger then sort of wandering routine and rote are poor substitute for understanding the place im trying to get you to is place where you can process by realization process by comprehension process by the exercise of judgment if i can get you to that point i will have considered it very well worth doing matter how heroic it has been on the way 6201c30 shspec106 insessionness assessing isnt to find something to run its running the case rudiments must be kept in throughout the session not just used to get the pc in session end rudiments are there to keep the session from perpetuating itself or hanging up beginning rudiments are to get the pc out of the physical universe into session and his own universe not still coping with his life outside of session if he has to put lot of attention on the auditor he is still in cope in having to handle another human being social situation not session an auditor who does poor job of getting rudiments in puts the pc into the physical universe coping with the auditor pc in session should be able to be in state of noresponsibility for the physical universe around him during the session that is the reason you can plumb the bank the less responsible you make the pc for the physical environment and the auditor and the auditing the more noresponsible the pc is for those things that sounds peculiar because it is also the state of an hypnotic trance but pc in session is not in an hypnotic trance the difference is interesting in an hypnotic trance it is demonstrated conclusively that he has control over anything the only person with any control is the hypnotist hypnotism is total overwhelm devoted directly to the physical universe the pcs body that has little in common with pcs attitude in session it was one of the few states man could induce on man along with cured dead injured etc it was the only one by which he could approach the spiritual and the infinite people can misinterpret this when it comes to getting pcs in session their past track in dealing with these other states can color their approach to pcs there are also the social states which have nothing much to do with auditing it is to play on that but auditors can get confused about what in sessionness is what is the beingness of pc it is of course willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case this is so simple that auditors can try to put additive states in on top of it using inval and eval they can turn the session into an hypnotic trance session by overwhelming the pc it cant happen easily it takes some doing but it could happen 138what you want is just someone who is longer fixated on the physical universe or in social state with the auditor but if you violate the auditors code he will still have the physical universe because he will have person not an auditor to deal with he will be too concerned with what the auditor might think what the auditor is doing etc that is normal enough to degree early in auditing so the first auditing person has should be the best because that is when he is most distrustful you dont want him to keep distrustful attitude towards an auditor pc in session can look at his own universe the auditor has to get him to look its interesting that he is in such state of noresponsibility for the physical universe since that is actually the state he has been in since the beginning of track it is his noresponsibility for the physical universe that makes it necessary for him to cope with it and be unsafe with it this is common denominator of bank at the most aberrated spots on the back track the person is 100 irresponsible for the lot so he goes into this state rather easily we are more interested in the backtrack than in his present time physical universe the reason why we are trying to detach him from the pt physical universe is so that we can put him into communication with the pasttime physical universe if he stays stuck in present time he is in state of supercope the mind to such person is already an area of danger because his time track is fraught with insecurity even greater than the insecurity of ft but he is actually not stuck in pt he is stuck on the back track believing that it is present time so you must get beginning ruds in much better with new pc or green pc likewise if auditing gets into grind tear into the ruds dont just check them to see if they are in use them to audit the case dont just get them in for the session we are running get them in for all his past sessions particularly the first how many ruds processes should you use normally you can just flick the withholds off of any ruds question to get the pc into session but the available processes for getting ruds in are nearly countless any valid communication process old problems processes withhold processes there are lots of them you must recognize what rudiments are they are reasons why he might not be in session if you want to straighten him out on the subject of auditing get his ruds in starting with his first session having located the first session you could run what didnt that auditor know and what didnt you know about the environment if the pc has been an auditor you can run out his first pc with what didnt that pc know about you you could get all ruds in on every session he has ever had including end rudiments only the first session or two and few others will have any importance the best method to do this would be form 6 sec check see hcopl 7jul61 processing sec check this is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing so if pc behaved peculiarly as pc if he was hard to get in session etc look for past bum session and get all ruds in for the first session hed had and given you could lockscan him to find where the pc is stuck lockscanning is very useful for that then you can get ruds in wherever he is parked until he takes time to get from the first session to pt you could do this over and over it shouldnt take more than four or five hours failure to do something like this wastes auditing time because of outofsessionness outofsessionness could arrive from another quarter either you didnt prepare the pc for assessment or ruds are out or there was at least one bad session which has been restimulated so that earlier auditing has to be cleaned up to get later auditing accomplished the pcs interest may be in later incidents but the trouble comes from earlier this has been the uniform mistake all down the track looking at the wrong end of the chain the pcs interest is in the last occurrence and his aberration is in the first occurrence the things person cant remember are the things he has taken responsibility for you can get an inversion where the pc has responsibility for things but has apparent full memory for them actually it is dubin dubin is an effort to take responsibility for something the pc has responsibility for this would be barrier to an auditor unless he could detect something under it for that you can use your emeter which will detect noresponsibility areas that the pc cannot remember 139when lrh audits pc he makes sure that the pc is interested in finding out about the unknown areas of his past that he gets some familiarity with his own thinkingness that he gets some realization that he has had some causation over his actions in life one thing looms large over all technicalities the state of being in session the most gross auditing error there is is not to get and keep pc in session one can fail to recognize when the pc isnt in session or one can hope insessionness will materialize it never materializes it is not an accident or something you can put on automatic you put pc in session or you take advantage of pcs in sessionness when it occurs the main thing that you dont notice is that the pc goes out of session in the middle of session you have to devote some time to putting ruds in when they are out during the session this is very necessary when doing 3d criss cross you are handling charged items the pc can hit one lack confidence in his ability to handle it and arc break with the auditor or something or they invalidate the situation or they withhold something the auditor has to keep these things picked up but the pc isnt telling you what is wrong with his case when he tells you one of these things he is telling you what has just blown that is why it is an error to q and with what the pc gives you in middle ruds if you do take it up you will put the pc out of session one way to get ruds in in midsession is to find what flow the pc has on automatic it is that flow that causes the others to materialize when you get that one cleaned up the ruds will stay in better because you know what the trigger is all you have to know is which flow is sticky which flow has his attention 6202c01 shspec108 flows what is withhold it is nonflow it is also dont know but the knowingness is influenced by flows it is something the pc doesnt want others to know about or that it hasnt occurred to him to tell the auditor or he is incapable of telling someone about it pc can withhold about flows withhold is restrained knowingness person who is restraining something from being known is withholding he is withholding knowledge data or information any one of the flows can assist aid and abet withhold because knowledge can be buried under the flow given any point or any two points where there is location in space there are only two possible flows for any one of those points inflow and outflow the thing that causes flows is the motionlessness or fixedness of the point the point may or may not have mass all power is derived from holding two positions fixed in space the two points must be kept separate and are to that degree fixed in space the strength with which they are fixed has everything to do with how much horsepower you can generate between them this gives you an idea of how fixed some of the points in the pcs bank must be to generate flows between them as person gets weaker he is longer able to hold two points in space and he gets masses masses are collapsed locations therefore asking someone to locate things in space will generate flows identification is first and foremost identification of locations in space the identified locations then disappear as location because he can do nothing to them or about them areas where one has been or expects to be overwhelmed tend to be identified with each other when lot of things get identified and one can longer differentiate but tries to compulsively you get disassociation he cannot locate anything but simply disperses off anything he tries to locate the mechanism of loss of memory is that several things become one thing identification then they become so much one thing that they cease to exist and you have forgettingness or lack of memory that is what happens to past lives the pc has lost all his power over that life and the locations of that life so he forgets that life factually he forgets things to get even he ceases to be able to place things to make another effect thetan never gets into situation where he is not making an effect axiom 10 is always in full throttle if you dont believe forgetting is getting even ask pc who would be affected by your forgetting about chronic somatic and you are liable to get an evaporation of the somatic however this is in the zone of postulates and considerations flows are just electrical phenomena you can do rather marvellous things with electrical phenomena when you run point out something he locates various points and he is located because the pc is located and another point is 140located this process can cause flows it can generate power and his bank goes whizwhiz and he can get funny feelings tingles etc various electrical phenomena at the border between flows and intention we have intention about flows until you try to do something with the flows you have only outflow and inflow now completely aside from electrical phenomena you move bit higher with his attitude about flows and in that region you can produce some interesting fireworks on case because you are in the band between electrical phenomena and knowingness that band is his attitude towards flows thetan decides to regulate flows with his intention at this first band of intention we get the cdei scale but at lower harmonic see fig 6 instead of desire we get something that is like desires lower edge permissible or allowable there is an enforced flow then relative to flows there are two kinds of inhibited prohibited meaning prohibited from without and inhibited proper meaning inhibited from within the point terminal we are talking about as you go further down you get an inversion of this scale so as the pc runs flow processes he comes up through eight attitudes towards flows inverted permissible inverted enforced inverted prohibit inverted inhibit inhibit prohibit enforce permit you only need four commands to run it to pick up both harmonics then there is inflow and outflow so there are actually sixteen flows but you only need eight since the harmonic is duplicate then if you did this with four legs in bracket you would have 16 x 4 types of flows or 64 flows 32 not counting the inversions but luckily we dont have to run these by brackets if we dont specify self or another or whatever point we are talking about the pc will automatically shift flows as we run the process so we only need four commands to run the process the rudiments get kicked out by triggering automaticities of flows the pc is so much the effect of electrical energy in the bank that he feels the flow and obeys it under the flow is consideration about it which is resident in some identity valence in the bank which routine 3dxx may some day discover all of the considerations about flows that we find in class ii auditing are in effect the considerations of identities contained in the bank that is what you are processing in class ii it is difficult to change the considerations of these packaged beingnesses but that is what you are doing these beingnesses in the bank have considerations about flows and when flows flow the beingnesses in the bank get ideas because they become activated electronically so current goes whiz and the pc goes ohh now im supposed to inhibit outflow and comm lags something else goes zap and the pc goes now im supposed to inhibit inflow so he gets the auditor to not talk or he prohibits inflow by talking back at the auditor etc so as you deal with pure knowingness pulling withholds ie notknowingnesses into view every now and then you run aground on flows the flow tells him to withhold he can have flow withhold as well as data withhold the data withhold can be pinned down by flows datum can actually substitute for thetan we do this all the time in education one of the most serious mistakes society can make is confusing ability with thetan such as with diploma or the old school tie if you look along the lines of datum you find that thetan in his bank has parked data which becomes fixed these data are all the nowimsupposedtos the most basic datum he can park the one he is withholding the hardest the one which forms most of the flows is an identity it is released by routine 3dxx this is datum which the pc thinks is holding locations in space one gets lazy here where bodies are all different on planet of doll bodies you would just know the guy even though the bodies were identical you thetan are carrying on nicely you are not datum or an identity the identity you were is datum that can park in the bank and be terminal from which the flow can charge and discharge this datum or identity had enemies john jones had the enemy bill smith and bill smith has been approximated in the bank someplace by john jones at an earlier time you see and now bill smith becomes lock on an earlier identification that john jones has made with an identity in the bank now you will get an electrical discharge between bill smith and john jones because theyre holding positions in space in the bank it is the interaction of flows between past beingnesses in the bank that causes all the bricabrac in the mind thus these beingnesses generate mass around them so that they appear to be like burnedout tar barrel past beingness is in itself mass because it has blocked flows so often it has gained mass its mass is dependent on its different positions in space as it has moved around and upon the number of positions it has held in space so the valences look very black sometimes with shape sometimes not it startles pc to come across one he tries to find something in one of these things and of course there is nothing in one he was in it its circuits are still operational it can still 141generate flows it looks like machine making pictures when it starts to come apart but it is really just an old beingness you cannot process points in space you can spot them but they are stills you can process stills if you discharge them but attempting to process stills without discharging them results in disaster processing the identity of living body isnt processing still because it moves around but processing dead bodies wouldnt work if you had someone find something still then make it more still then make it be as still as it was before you would get gains at first it would restimulate feeling of power holding position it is not the same as keeping something from going away which does generate power and discharges number of flows in general you do better to process actions rather than inerts in the bank having datum in the bank withhold fixed in space we find that it tends to act as pole in motor it causes some odd flows in the body because he must not tell it to anybody it becomes duplicative pole for the anybody he mustnt tell you the auditor thus get duplicated as the withhold by the pc and we get this odd phenomenon of discharge going when you process the withhold datum it goes snap out and some kind of circuit disappears at the some time he feels good what happened was that he had this datum being restrained from all sorts of people this gave the datum as great magnitude as the people from whom it was being restrained thus he sets up motor he is at the receiving end the withheld datum operates as pole to generate flow which then makes ridge that is how his valence gets solid in the bank we can take an electrical lock at problem if two people have withholds from each other it only takes little opposed intention to set up two opposite poles which then discharge on the old withholds for instance fish for fish supper for supper that is why the prior confusion containing withholds holds the problem in place if you get all the withholds off the problem vanishes since the problem was only the visible result of the hidden charged poles when you miss withhold you trigger live pole which then triggers another and another until you get an avalanche and the pc tells you off having gone into an automaticity so if you are going to pull withholds do it thoroughly pcs have habitual flows at least one of the eight attitudes will be in force with pc as rule so you could list the eight flows assess the pc and sec check the pc so during listing if you notice that your pc tends for instance to have prohibited inflow on automatic and things get sticky you can put ruds in by asking question that adds up to what inflow did you stop just then the pc has withheld the data that this flow has occurred and you could pull this fact as withhold pc can also believe that some exterior force should prevent his outflow if he is on prohibited outflow here you will find pc with compulsive outflow he is waiting for the auditor to stop him german knight knew what he was supposed to do enforce outflow he was supposed to yap about his great deeds and knock people over the head who wouldnt listen in fact to get total pattern of social conduct you could just apply the eight attitudes towards flows to the tone scale different societies have different ones characteristically the pc can apply all these things on the auditor he can try to enforce an outflow for instance or inhibit an outflow terminal can have flows for others as well as for itself since flows are caused by withholds running flows unburies withholds the pole of the withhold was buried by flows so running flows uncovers it you could assess the eight flows and sec check the most reactive etc 142a pcs bank could not possibly be discharged rapidly by any machine or chemical because the flows are intricate and the ridges are composited flows you have to do something to straighten the flows out any method that got rid of the bank as whole block would never expose the understanding which is beneath it because that is the second inversion understanding has first involved flows electrical nonsense masses and the sixth dynamic and then inverts and goes under it all and electricity is capable of burying all the knowledge in the world in the pcs bank case makes progress by finding out something about himself empirically 6202c06 shspec111 withholds withholds and the dynamic principle of existencesurvive as per 1938 data are now seen to be interrelated this is good because where principle has been an amplification of survive it has worked like mad with pcs we also have the reason why an identity is aberrative an identity is that accumulation of withholds that make an individuation when the pc gives you his name you have one part of routine 3dxx already done where you have to recognize person from his identity rather than from his beingness there cant be much beingness present 3d item is maximal identity and minimal beingness every now and then you get identity and beingness crossed and you get an historic character lrh has used identity on the track to make effects but it was mistake to think that he was successful in creating the effects because of the identity it was really because of the beingness you could reach more and influence more than other people so you did the identity side of it was to be more of lump of than anyone else which defeats the reach you can conceive of beingness as the ability to permeate pervade communicate to or fill up an area identity is method of not having to identity puts it on automatic an identity is substitute for communication and reachingness beingness is current activity identity is past activity fame etc the only thing this universe punishes are being there and communicating it is an antibeingness universe and proidentity universe withhold is notreachingness it is not communicating this includes holding onto piece of information that would damage survival of course since thetan cant really be hurt withhold must be to protect the survival of an identity not beingness so withhold goes beyond matter of mores it is something person thinks would reduce his survival as an identity if it were not withheld if you are building an identity on repute which is the standard trick in this universe and working to enhance your repute you withhold those things which would depress the survival identity thetan goes cautious on this and withholds more than he has to selfpreservation is of course misnomer it is really identitypreservation any identity that remains in the bank is the direct result of identitypreservation so we find these suspended 3dxx items hanging around the points that are really stuck however are the points where one failed to preserve ones life because those are the failed postulates the postulated impulse was to preserve the life so death hangs up more than life as failed postulate as an auditor finding some picture hanging up on the track you could ask what would you withhold about that picture and the whole incident would unreel as the pc found the identity that had to be suppressed for purposes of survival despite the fact that there may have been lot of survival in the action you get the withholds and the compulsive outflows off you could almost free up the track by asking what should you have told people about it will run at first with withholds then get into bragging that got withheld where there is conflict whether to withhold or let it out you get hung up on the track you could say that any difficult situation is an unequated or unresolved problem in survival so any hangup on the track is an unresolved problem in survival there were balanced factors involved in communicating or not each hungup identity is hung up with these computations such as the computation that to communicate or not to communicate is equally nonsurvival by pulling withholds off the case you release all these things an individual withholds an identity until it parks on the track when you find an identity you have key to tremendous section of track the identity is dedicated to hiding so finding it takes off tremendous amount of charge because the identity is withholding itself by hiding and you handle the withhold by finding the identity each identity has the feeling or computation they are probably still looking for if they find watch out he was trying to make the identity famous then failed to 143survive as the identity the pc gets very alert as you come near it feeling like wanted man this is the feeling of guilt which former therapies sought the source of the feeling of guilt is as much brag as anything else but it contains the feeling of being wanted when theres feeling that one has problem of survival which cant be solved on any of the dynamics it will come right up to pt and knock ones head off when one of these comes off identities come off and withholds come off with the identities pulling any identity off invariably involves getting connected withhold otherwise it wouldnt be in the bank and floating up to pt thats the common denominator of anything in the bank since it is there to solve survival of course efforts to survive are silly since thetan cant do anything else what the effort is really directed to is getting an identity to survive if there is an effort in the thing it must be built around lie that the person doesnt recognize the person doesnt realize that he is one thing and his identity is something else he also thinks his beingness and his communicatingness is his identity actually these are deteriorated because he is being joe doakes therefore all these things have withhold connected with them whenever you miss withhold person gets restimulation of withhold and he gets the idea that he is in danger that is all there is to it q and stimulusresponse mechanism if person has withhold that he must withhold he must be in danger because the reactive mind works on an the conclusion can put into action the causation for instance we put george in wrecked car with blood on it not in his car or wreck if george was asleep or drunk or something when we put him there when he wakes up his conclusion will be that he has been in wreck he would mock up sequence to explain his being there the least he would get out of it would be little shock of should i tell anybody or what is this what are the consequences of having wrecked this car in extremis he would show psychosomatic injuries etc so if you give someone the end product of chain of responsibility he will attempt to assume some of the earlier responsibility given b one concludes from evidence this leads pcs to write script in session sometimes sometimes the pc doesnt know what led to the consequences so he figures he must have withhold from himself it is interesting to find the material he must be withholding from himself but isnt his anxiety about identity would cover the whole picture say you have found terminal on 3dxx an angry man you could run what responsibility have you taken for the continued survival of an angry man you would see the package an angry man fall apart into separate identities if you have been responsible for something and then ceased to be responsible for it you can get your block knocked off thats about the only way you can get your block knocked off if you have taken wide identity then while in that identity have ceased to be responsible for it during decline or whatever next time around you take responsibility for the area that leaves the wide area permeated but responsibility for it matter what your identity is because it is only beingness after all people can try to shift their identities to change everything but it is only beingness that counts if he has beingness in his background which is associated with his identity and then suddenly cuts his beingness down to nothing in order to limit his identity he will be in trouble every time he cant function in his limited sphere because he has already accepted much larger sphere so he is always in trouble we could then ask him what responsibility have you taken for the survival of the wider zone thetans are always doing this having taken responsibility for the whole of europe and having battered europe to pieces in order to liberate it all nations who took part in that activity then drew back and said well have peace now and let the whole of europe go to hell sure enough thats what happened world war ii that is withhold of magnitude because it is withhold of ability so withhold can be withhold from anything that the pc has had permeation into or communication with when communication is followed by nocommunication the advent of the communication operating as withhold reduces survival we have made huge area survive now we are only going to make little part of it survive there will be some countersurvival in the area where you were formerly taking full responsibility that is the mechanism of individuation first communication into then refusal to communicate into you have established oneness with something by communicating into it or by taking responsibility for it you cant segmentalize responsibility into smaller zone without bad consequences once you have taken responsibility for energizing an area then retreat the area you retreat from is on your wavelength and clobbers you the people who cut your throat are your own police guard as soon as 144you decide that you can longer occupy the palace you cant take responsibility for the physical universe and then take responsibility for one room in boarding house in two successive lives and not have planets hit you in the head if the huge zone of responsibility is cut down by series of withholds which it always is then because it is now energized it can kick your head in survival process therefore discharges all withhold processes so the principle of survival is senior to all overtmotivator sequences responsibility processes survivaltype processes persistency processes and identity processes are all senior processes the most horrible opponent being can have is himself of course its got his wavelength in scientology we are making man his own best friend if one finds oneself withholding one automatically assumes one must be trying to survive hence that one must be in danger so if you miss withhold on pc that is the conclusion the pc comes to so he takes defensive actions at once the sequence is as follows 1 the pc finds himself withholding 2 therefore he reactively assumes he must be in danger 3 therefore he must take action to survive ie attack or defend himself if you miss withhold you get 2 and 3 above wild animals are only savage because one pulled their withholds they are individuated any withhold restimulates them though they are not natively savage as beings wolves interpret almost anything as withhold of theirs or yours so they attack rather easily so they must withhold in the vicinity of almost anything so you seldom run into them in order to handle wolf so he wont bite you you have to demonstrate to him conclusively that he is not withholding anything lrh handles wolves that way very successfully the trick is to show them that there is point in withholding anything because they are not going to damage you and you are not going to damage them you can get remarkable results this way but walk up to wild animal as though you are withholding something and you have had it go up to him as though you are not withholding anything and he will look at you and wonder what you are doing so you show him what you are doing dont excite his curiosity so you dont have withhold from him now if you have given the pc the impression in sec checking that he is withholding then dont pull the withhold to show the pc that he is not now withholding he is liable to go into defending himself by attacking pulling his withholds is the only thing that keeps him from individuating missing his withholds however will restimulate them and make him feel that he is in danger and must attack not pulling withhold is ok as long as you dont restimulate it otherwise you would have to get all his withholds in one session it is the missed withhold the one that is restimulated and not pulled that causes the trouble information available and not asked for or information asked for and not gotten is what makes wild animal out of the pc 6202c07 shspec112 missed withholds if in running havingness process you get needle action you should realize that there is something strange to get out of the road so you could ask about aspects of havingness and see if there is anything that would keep the pc from having etc clean it up always audit with the meter in direct line of sight so that by merely lifting or dropping your gaze you can see pc and meter without turning your head turning your head signifies to the pc that you are not interested in his case in organizations keep students and pcs missed withholds well cleaned up similarly with staff auditors what missed withhold is is subject to misinterpretation people are apt to ask for withholds when that is not what is wanted it is not unpulled unrestimulated withholds that cause trouble it is the whatshouldhavebeenfoundoutandwasnt it is not withhold it is should havefoundout 145empirically it turns out that all arc breaks blows upsets natter etc stem from missed withholds the mechanism and the theory may be what was outlined in the last lecture or it may not but this is still true as an empirical fact christ was crucified because he missed withholds the withhold can be inadvertent or didnt know matter what the pcs modifier of his main goal line will be thrown into dramatization when the withhold is missed you can prevent this by cleaning up arc breaks as soon as they happen pulling withholds as soon as they happen and keeping ruds in rigorously or if you know the modifier you can chant it to the pc to turn off the dramatization this is poor way to do it but possible you can get list to read in this way but just running shouldhaveknown to death would get all ruds in with clank this can be used at any time not parked in ritual of pattern random rudiment dont drop are you withholding anything from ruds but realize that the missed withhold is totally different question and proposition and area using missed withholds you can shortcircuit all the other outruds one caution if you open up whole new area of track the condition of the case has changed and you will want to check missed withholds again since new crop may have come to light from the change auditors dont always expect or allow for change in the pc they should the consequence of change is that aspects of the case shift this is quite apparent in 3dxx every identity you go through has its own bank its own package of engrams if you are listing effectively the pc is sitting right next to the terminal you announce so you are pulling up bank every item if the pc is really in session even though they are only lock valences the pc will dramatize the last item you found when you get these case changes you are getting bunch of shouldhaveknowns you hadnt seen before you handle them in sloppy fashion with middle rudiments dont distract the pc with them or make big fuss over them but when you notice the pc even one tenth out of session dont wait for more upset get in the shouldhaveknown since the pc is in valence with missed withholds that werent there for the valence he was in minute earlier catch it the instant the pc starts to slip out of session the quality of an auditor is observable at the stage of arc break where the auditor acts the less arc break needed to get action the better change of pace is enough lrh cleans up the session before the pc knows he has an arc break but not to the extent of patching up nonexistent arc breaks and causing one pc who has shouldhavefoundout is always on the verge of an arc break he is the arc breaky pc anybody who gives you bunch of upset disagreement with the organization etc has continuous missed withhold this principle is responsible for more loss of dissemination loss of scientologists and of public to scientology than any single factor pe foundations and coaudits need this datum you could run them on the basis that everyone in the pe foundation is professional findoutabouter then anyone who walks in on pe course should be assumed to have continuous missed withholds which they have come to see if you can find out about they dont really come in to find out about scientology or to be helped or anything else if you dont find out about them they arc break and go out and badmouth you you can create an anti scientology public by doing tests on people since doing so can result in just missing their withholds you would never lose people who you checked on meter with what should we find out about you what should the last group you were in have found out about you that they didnt and cleared up the reads knowingness to most people is knowledge of their ows the reason coaudit doesnt build up is that when auditing without meters withholds are missed and people blow knowledge as knowledge of overts is the bottom rung of knowledge it is past withhold that is restimulated an auditor is locked on by pcs as an expert if he can get the missed withholds off the case any criticism the pc throws at you is just caused by the shouldhavefoundout you didnt ask for even if you are actually worthy of criticism in your auditing tech so add missed withholds to both ends of the session and use shouldhaveknown in mid ruds cases that have reputation for being rough to audit should be approached by finding an area of shouldhaveknown prior to scientology and shooting it full of holes then get all the shouldhave knowns from scientology cleaned up 620zc12 shspec110 prepclearing sec checking is out prepclearing is newly born it sounds better for one thing and it is preparatory to clearing hence the prep auditors havent learned sec checking very well despite lots of efforts 146to teach them to do it so it is probably hard to do there must have been some element missing so lrh has been working on the subject of withholds realizing that if nothing was missing he should have been able to articulate it well enough so that auditors could get it and do it easily he has done remarkable things with pulling withholds now and then but maybe there is more to the mechanism he had been aware since the first of the year that if he couldnt relay it so that auditors could get resurgence after every time it was done then there must be some kind of variable in it missed withholds was the first discovery that resulted from this research they have proved out as the source of all the arc breaks and natter you get the proof is that when you pull the missed withhold the arc breaks and natter disappear and the pc gets case gain that had been missed before this is not variable it is not true that every time you miss withhold you will get an arc break but it is true that every arc break comes from missed withhold the only effective thing to do about it is to pull the missed withhold punishment has been tried in the past and it hasnt worked explaining and protesting also dont work so you have business trying to handle the pcs arc break with you except by pulling the missed withhold which is most likely to have been in the session you are running since to the pc present time things are more important than the past what the missed withhold is composed of monitors what rud goes out ptp is missed withhold in life an arc break is missed withhold in session etc shouldhaveknown is an unknown which puts us back to sec checking with unknown auditors doing that were putting people into engrams and trying to run the engrams with them it wasnt running well although it was successful at shaking up the bank the whole subject of withholds is notknow and unknowns missed withhold is halfknown halfunknown there seems to be enough charge to cause polarity that sets off godawful agitation in the bank it can be halfknown to the pc being halfknown analytically and half reactive hence half unknown unknow plays heavy part in 3dxx the notknow that is most important is the shouldhaveknown this is regret it bunches up the bank something half known is very disturbing it seems dangerous and makes one freeze up the regret mechanism is what turns 3dxx valence into ball and loops the time track the mechanism of looped time track is due to just one thing shouldhaveknown this smashes everything into the one time zone of valence it adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done shouldnt have confronted shouldnt have experienced so the prior pictures of having experienced are invalidated at once so he tries to say this never happened and we get the occlusion of the whole track should haveknown is apparently the most important button in the bank this is the sequence leading to occlusion 1 he should have known something 2 he didnt know it 3 one gets regret this smashes everything into the one timezone of valence 4 this adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done confronted experienced 5 he invalidates prior pictures of having experienced 6 he tries to say they never happened 7 we get whole track occlusion the only thing that reduces pcs profile after auditing is arc breaks but what produces an arc break is should have known via missed withhold so you can remedy arc breaks with should have knowns this universe has quantitative button it isnt the number or size or gruesomeness of the withholds you get that gives you case gain it is just the thoroughness with which you get withhold the quality of your auditing which gives the degree of case gain 147freud was always trying to get the one button that would produce big resurgence in the case he must have done it at least once to have such faith in it he never taught it to anyone but he must have had some success with it he was looking for withhold he was looking in one area sex and one time childhood which circumscribed it too narrowly his occasional successes were what gave psychoanalysis its success and repute even though they didnt know what they were doing you have two choices when dealing with missed withhold 1 do full dress job of knocking out all the shouldhaveknowns on the subject in this lifetime or 2 just get and knock out the latest keyin which way you do it depends on how successful you are with the light shouldhaveknown touch on the latest keyin if the pc stays arc broken or quickly rearc breaks you will need the full works per hcob 12feb62 how to clear withholds and missed withholds starting from the difficulty being handled finding what the withhold is when all and who should have known repetitively per the rules in that bulletin if you work this system you will find all of the basic buttons on the case will just roll out if you can do it by the numbers exactly per the above bulletin even chronic somatics will straighten out they will come back during 3dxx but this withhold system does give the resurgences that freudian practitioners are looking for prepchecking is the system of getting each rudiment in so it stays in fairly permanently during 3dxx it uses the same elements as the withhold system given above you could also do joburg form three with one of these things form three is the sec check form for new students see hcopl 22may61 the only valid sec check the zero question from form three would be any question from the form that you are trying to clear on the pc if you get read you move on to question number one what was that and more specifically what about subject of the sec check question write this down because you will have to clear that question it should duplicate as nearly as possible the pcs reply to the zero question and its read pc never refuses to tell the auditor but he sometimes doesnt tell because he doesnt know it is the auditors job to get the pc to look and to help him find the answer it may be so charged that he doesnt want to look but it is up to you to get him to look it is ok to be positive in getting him to look but if you ever imply he knows and wont say you have admitted that he is out of session and you have got games condition going so that point never comes into the session you must clear questions 0 and 1 if they clear without 2 3 and 4 fine when you first get into question 2 you dont have to be precise but if you have to cycle through it again get it more precise so as to spot it exactly if it doesnt clear question 2 is when the withhold occurred to clear question number one run 2 3 4 until 1 is cleared when it is clean check 0 again etc questions 2 3 and 4 are the way to blow the withhold to halifax so it never comes up again if in compartmenting the question you get read on subquestion that now becomes the zero question it is more important to handle one withhold question well than thousands indifferently it is not the quality of the withhold that counts it is how much of it is submerged out of sight if he has done something horrendous and knows about it it isnt going to aberrate him matter how tempting it may be to blame his condition on it you will find that it is out of some stupid little incident run back on stack of things the pc did that you recover recollections on bring them back to view and the pc confronts them and his case will tend to resurge it is good idea to take up any sec check question the pc has gotten reads on recurrently take it as the zero question get the what clean it thoroughly with 2 3 and 4 because it must be halfknown or it wouldnt be reading recurrently any difficulty could be handled that way it is fundamental question you may not get much in the way of cognitions for awhile as your zero question keeps reading but eventually things will begin to blow and it will all fall apart nothing will read on an meter that is not significantly charged and nothing will fall on an emeter that is not unknown in part to the pc if the emeter registers there must be something unknown at least in part the only thing you will get into and difficulties with is converting the zero question to the what question dont vary the zero or what questions 2 3 and 4 neednt be rote though you shouldnt get 148yappy on them just be natural with it you only use the meter to test one and zero do not take past life answers when using this system pcs will duck into the unreality of yesterday to avoid the withhold in this lifetime or they are trying to run the whole bank on this process and this process wont run the whole bank 3dxx is for handling past lifetimes you wont get any gains running past lives on this withhold system 6202c14 shspec117 directing attention if you cant easily release an arc break or easily get rudiment in it is always safe to assume that havingness is out when the pcs attention is distracted havingness drops and the bank tends to collapse on him details of running routine 3dxx dont hesitate to check ruds question twice if you are in doubt about read be careful be precise dont put looking good over doing good job put accuracy first the only person who loses otherwise is the pc it is the same with being kind to the pc or failing to direct the pcs attention or anything that adds up to noauditing and keep the should have knowns cleaned up and you will never get arc broken pcs it is interesting to note that if you look over an old sec check and find the missed withhold at the point where the pc went into past life you will find one in this lifetime it is connected and it restimulates the past life and maybe it is hot one that got missed by going backtrack it is true that withholds in past lives are causing all the pcs real difficulties but they are handled in 3dxx not missed withholds the pc never forgives you if you let him give up if you dont direct the pcs attention you will get gains in session if you let pcs attention wander that is more productive of arc breaks than directing his attention even if it doesnt seem nice or kind your attitude to the pc mean kind or whatever doesnt much matter as long as you are effective you dont overwhelm the pc with mood you overwhelm the pc with inval and eval it is not being ladylike or gentlemanly that gives the pc gains it is directing the pcs attention however crudely and badly and being effective the liability of prepchecking and the withhold system of hcob 12feb62 is that every time the pc comes close to the key withhold he is likely to get cross with the auditor it is an indicator the missed withhold mechanism with curve in it you innocently ask the pc who didnt know about that who should have known or whatever get down to all and have the pc irritated now you are on the edge of it thats all if you dont head the pc on down the alley to face that withhold you will have an upset pc primary withhold pulling flubs 1 the pc natters about joe the auditor gets only motivators thus letting the pc commit more overts by making damaging statements 2 letting the pc give you other peoples withholds that being interesting gossip waste of time 3 taking critical thoughts without getting the underlying overts this gives gain 4 stenographic auditing failure to direct the pcs attention it lets his run his havingness down and commit overts of defaming people critical thoughts are an indicator of overts and can be used to trap the pc into leading into the overts fifteen or twenty seconds of listening to them is enough under the withhold system critical thought can be one question all will get the rest where you can coax the pc into revealing the rest the one question is never the question you work hard on it is just used to test this is especially true when it is critical thought you are after all the done the critical thought question wont clear until youve got all the done the withhold system helps you direct the pcs attention to where it should be put but it is still not rote robotic action put little invitation and coax into it plus little insistence to look if you want to know the answers and you are interested you will operate much more effectively you can meter 149date to help the pc to look because withholds do scramble or group the track and make it difficult for him to spot when your rancor if any should only be directed at the aspect of the pcs looking not at his telling you even if the meter reacts the pc doesnt know in fact it is because the pc doesnt know that it reacts if you imply that he is deliberately not telling you put him into games condition use whatever trickery persuasion or skill you like to direct the pcs attention but direct it get the pcs interest in it too if you get an irregular response to the withhold question ask the pc if repetition of the question is causing an arc break because the emeter has confusion point data in the bank and an arc break can both give response cleaning clean will produce an arc break on the missed withhold of nothing lot of auditors ran goals and terminals lists up to thousands of items by getting protest reads on the demand for more items commonly though after you clean up the arc break in running the withhold system the pc will have more on the withhold the pc gets misemotional with the auditor because the auditor represents all the people who should have known about the withhold and didnt if the pc doesnt get misemotional it is sign that you are not getting anywhere because you havent hit anything hot if the pc stays bright and cheerful through the session and never gets anything that makes him feel bad or look bad he is liable to arc break after the session feeling that it was wasted time dont expect the pc to go on gradient scale of getting better on the withhold system he goes on gradient scale of looking worse life has begun to loom as grim serious proposition they may go into this curve and out in twenty minutes or in four sessions depending on the beefiness of the zero question how hot button it is with how much avoidance in it the hotter the question the more charge there is to be bled the milder the charge the shorter the cycle of action this cycle is not the usual processing cycle it is is alerted goes down to the bottom then shoots up to the top the entire force of an aberration is directed to pulling the attention in while buffing it off you dont have to pull the pcs attention to the middle of any aberration because it is fixed there dut every aberration has buffer that bounces the pc out again it is not clear inflow or outflow the mind is actually concentrated on it 100 so the more you get him to look in that direction the paler and worse he will look until he gets it all cleaned up then you get to the last remnants of it you really have to help the pc out because he is stonied he just cant force his attention into it so letting his attention ride all over the place is letting the pc be the effect of the withhold and the charge and he will never forgive you as the cognition approaches the attention is harder to direct into the center of the withhold given something the pc has really nonconfronted at the time he will often have some bit of it that he has utterly fictionalized written script for etc he backs out of all responsibility for it and as his attention gets directed at it he tends to veer off and gets chargy and irritated at the auditor you must differentiate between the pc who is arc broken because he is in games condition with the auditor and one who is introvertedly arc broken and snapping at everything they look quite different if you direct the pcs attention terminatedly to the whole precise withhold you will get fine resurgence if you dont the pc will be miserable because his whole bank is kicking him in the head because there is one helping him hold it down you have to keep your eye out for the pcs tendency to go general on you to never give you anything specific and to just gloss over the top of it all you have to get the pc to look he has to tell you when he has seen it but he will tell you only when he knows if he says i dont know just say lets find out lets look lets dig bit dont think the pc is upset with you when he is upset with the bank emphasize looking not telling the pc will tell you what he can see you can clean up pc who has had some auditing some sec checking with recurring withholds by getting what withhold kept coming up and using the withhold system steps 2 3 and 4 when all and who see page 186 above used repetitively to discharge the what question or one question on it to find what has been missed in it you can also start from who the pc has complained about lot but knowing 3dxx you wont sail in towards target that is terminal your zero question should be on doingness knowingness or havingness not beingness probably any terminal that has been located on 3dxx could be moved in on and prepchecked by this system this hasnt been tried yet but those would be the beingnesses to take up if any 6202c15 shspec118 prepchecking 150details on running of prepchecking see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill for an outline of the procedure prepchecking can be used in problems intensive as given in tapes shspec65 to 67 and pages 23 to 27 above and well outlined in hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion taking the terminals from the prior confusion you can make up zero1 question with what about your difficulty with eg fred then you can get the one1 question and do the withhold system on that to clear difficulties with fred if you get new what question you could call it one2 etc you can also make zero questions out of the dynamics eg zero1 are you willing to talk to about yourself zero2 are you willing to talk to about sex and family etc an auditor has to get the highest possible degree of relaxation on the part of the pc if it is built up the pc will stay in session come hell or high water even if he is mad at you prepchecking is particularly liable to send the pc out of session because in it you are asking for very intimate activities also just before he hits one of those big withholds it is missed withhold and has been for several seconds at least ie for as long as he has spotted it and before he has told you he is actually influenced by it before he hits it but misattributes it to the auditor so it pays to clear the auditor well early on when you are pulling withholds self is the one the pc feels he is damaging because giving up withholds threatens personal survival sometimes pcs run themselves down and make the overt worse than it is in desperate effort to make it blow if you are going to be handling some subject in the body of the session and it comes up on ruds dont try to handle it with the ruds you can let the pc know there is something there and that it is what is in the session if you are caught short without knowing the pcs havingness process nearly surefire one is one that has him reaching and touching things within his reach the only danger in it is with some small number of pcs that it takes long time to flatten and can turn on tactile pain if so this process was what was needed prepchecking solves an old problem how to bring pc who is reading below 20 on the meter up 6202c20 shspec113 what is withhold the common denominator of withholds is that withhold is something that person believes would endanger his selfpreservation if it were revealed this is the reason why whole track memory is occluded someone with little wholetrack recall considers himself to be in great danger this gives you the exact reason pc gets off withholds which arent withholds such as other peoples withholds all withholds students tend to get off on each other are safe withholds we get into this tacit consent on withholds because of overts on other peoples withholds eg spreading their overts around making them guilty for the overt sort of punishing them for having gotten it off after doing that it seems unsafe to get off withholds the more unsafe you make it to get off withholds the battier it becomes until you get civilization like this one for instance laws against perversion can be used by communists as means of blackmailing people the state lends itself to punishment of withholds which lays it open to undermining by the people in high positions who have those withholds likewise if the auditor makes it unsafe for the pc to get off withholds the pc will only get off safe withholds ie nonwithholds the hyperindividuation of the pc stems only from his withholds the pcs idea that to get it off would injure his survival is in fact aberrated it is the aberrated idea of what they dare to get off that brings about the condition of aberration everyone has some withholds which would in fact bring harm to him if they were revealed these get deeply buried encysted and the others build up on them if someone comes close to these withholds one gets the feeling that all hell will break loose and one will be imprisoned in some dungeon and tortured so naturally the auditor seems dangerous in reality dangerous auditor is one who doesnt pull withholds these auditors will always be involved in arc breaks cause pcs to natter about auditing orgs etc have loses etc the auditor who only gets off safe withholds is dangerous 151pcs whose withholds have been missed do not make their goals and gains the auditor who cannot get result with prepchecking will simply not audit the definition of withhold makes it not ok to let pcs take items off their lists because those become missed withholds because of the pcs considerations about safety as mentioned above he will want to withhold items from lists but you must not let this happen the items are on the list because they were dangerous at one time and were withheld in the first place prepchecking and 3dxx both are devoted to making the pc realize that it isnt dangerous to reveal himself the pc will mention some hot area then as the auditor starts him looking at it he will feel little reactive regret that he brought it up see page 185 above during the time you are going through this regret band you are still crossing over into the zone of what is unknown you hit should have known on the way up and you have to get through this to know in prepchecking when the pc gives you motivator you know you are an hot ground so you always ask an overt what question criticalness leads you to look for the overt doingness behind it explaining why something happened is milder phenomenon but it too requires new what question if the withhold itself is given it is the what question the withhold is measured by the amount of danger the pc conceives to be present in getting off the withhold if the withhold is not dangerous he will just give it if it is somewhat dangerous he will explain around it if it is rather dangerous he will criticize if it is super dangerous he will give you motivator we are taking about dangerousness in the eyes of the pc this gives you an index to the case case is as bad off as he considers it dangerous to reveal himself the insane person is dramatizing total motivator on the subject of punishment insanity is the last protest against punishment i cannot feel your punishment i dont know about it you have driven out of my mind etc length of time it takes to achieve result in auditing is indexed by danger of revelation from the pcs viewpoint how can you cut down this length of time dont pull safe withholds use prepchecking in 3dxx there is new line something like what identity would it be unsafe for you to reveal relief line could be what identity would it be safe for you to reveal to throw the others into view the pc actually wants the relief of the revelation but doesnt know how to get it safely so he is always hoping for some oneshot button for clearing without revealing anything unsafe to reveal type questions give you good zero prepcheck questions eg is there anything you have done which would be unsafe to reveal gives you what questions old age must be the consideration that it is unsafe to show up with mest body at first you must figure its safe to show up with mest body then you get the idea that it is unsafe so you take it down that must be what old age is the basic trick of this universe is if you withhold it it wont hurt you which is total lie offering fact seems dangerous withholding the fact is apparently not dangerous this is lie the thetan just builds up mass and gets less space this way it makes his withhold himself more and more occupy less and less space permeate less and less etc cant go outside case is someone who has lots of withholds stacked up an one fairly serious one he is the one who is afraid the police are after him phobias fit in here this is most salient in prepchecking some withholds you just let go by the safe withholds which are really red herrings 6202c21 shspec114 use of prepchecking in prepchecking you are trying to find underlying overts that is what the when all who refers to you are not just getting withholds you are interested in chains of overts the anatomy of the mind is that the basic incident holds she chain of incidents in place you are not looking for the hidden part of single incident you are looking for the hidden earliest incident the pc sees only the most recent incident until you get him to asis by telling you the when all and who we arent looking for basic basic on it because that is anchored in valence which you will only find in 3dxx prepchecking is limited to this lifetime the chain will blow if this lifetimes basic is found so what questions never apply to only one incident neither do the when all and who you have great fluidity in what questions you ask the what question however should be specific enough to find chain different dates come up on question two you try to clear the what youve got if you 152cant find the subsidiary chain and clear it if you cant clear that clear the subsidiary chain it depends on etc etc stay on the same subject the zero question is just rudiments question that gives starting point you can go with these by dynamics get kind of one question then follow that down to withhold and get real one question lrh has used eg for the initial one question what about your physical difficulties the question what physical difficulty would it be unsafe to reveal got list got an item reading well which now gives proper one question what about rectum trouble and one can go back to work the only riskiness in this case was that it led to an identity the pcs little brother we try not to use identities in prepchecking but if that is all you can get well the inevitable question if some subject doesnt clear up is what have you done to _______ there must be something there just from the basics of the overtmotivator sequence you dont treat every withhold as new what question when the pc gives one ask what about this chain of withholds that is you should phrase it as more general action but not so general as to take in the whole reactive bank you work your way down to something that clears then work on back you may get hung up along the way back requiring some new chain the pc could jump chains follow along as necessary but be sure to retrace your steps it all depends on the fact that hidden information exists on the chain someplace when you get that the whole chain will unravel the overt may be quite mild you are looking for needle in haystack so dont look just run the system and it will show up the best way to establish the question is by the approach described here it is called prepchecking because it is preparatory to clearing prepchecking gets the pcs rudiments sufficiently cleaned up so 3dxx can be done with more ease that is why the basic prepcheck questions are ruds questions for the withhold rud use form 3 see p 186 and form 6a see hcopl 3feb62 auditor processing check this is shortened form of form 6 and is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing for problems you have the problems intensive you prepcheck the withholds the pc comes up with in prior confusion areas you can do the same with end ruds half truths untruths etc for the question about influencing the emeter you can handle it more broadly with meters electronic gear mind reading etc so the pc can be at ease with the meter get his ruds in with thud and they wont get in the way during 3dxx when you change valences because of 3dxx new areas will come to view but finding new valence because of 3dxx doesnt mean the pc moves out of and abandons all his old valences the 3d problems mass pulls apart bit it has less influence on him than before but just before you find this the pc will dramatize the new valence coming up that dramatization influences the case and tends to throw ruds out put if the pc is already capable of being kept in session the influence of it is minimal you dont have to pay lot of attention to it the pc will have cognitions come up with withholds not as part of ruds but as part of 3dxx you could omit the prepcheck in fact but then the 3dxx would take about four times as long to do because of the upsets that 3dxx tends to produce anyway prepchecking tends to improve stability on case by handling ows so the pc is not in for big shock when running 3dxx uncovers new material well done prepcheck is like complete psychoanalysis every three or four hours person can become very morose upset and low doing 3dxx if you will ever have trouble with his ruds it is now so it is nice to be able to get ruds in prepchecking is also valuable just in itself after you have all the pcs terminals and oppterms all laid out on their line plot dont be sure that you have seen the last of prepchecking probably similar technique will be used to take these items to pieces therefore you are not concerned before you have the gpm isolated with any pastlife activity those are the withholds of whole life which you find with 3dxx since the basic holds the chain down you dont struggle too hard with some sticky withhold if it keeps reading and doesnt clean up with your 2 3 and 4 there is something else to look for 6202c22 shspec119 prepclearing and rudiments terminology its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing 153one index that withhold chain is working well is that the pcs havingness doesnt drop as much as before ta motion is another indicator one could clear up environment as part of ruds by prepchecking rooms this would in effect be prepchecking havingness to some extent we can locate withholds about games conditions what has the pc denied people what has he pushed people out of if you prepchecked this for broke you would find that his havingness would stay in without havingness process provided that he was willing to talk to the auditor at all times so use havingness while getting the pc to talk to the auditor then use things like the joburg form 3 for new students and form 6a for oldtime auditors to clean up withholds for problems find what problems he has caused people in this lifetime and prepcheck them as overts the problems intensive gets you to the problem he is sitting in you could go at it that way getting prior confusion etc or you could shortcut it by getting what problems he has caused in this lifetime as the zero question prepchecking might get you mest clear clear for this lifetime psychoanalyst would be able to learn to do this he would be flabbergasted by it especially when he learned that it was only preparatory action this system can be adapted to whatever the pc is doing you dont want the pc to give you whole lot of unconnected withholds if he does give them take up the one that reads and clear it up keep to the withholds on the same chain mine chain subject there is an art to converting what the pc says to what question you have to listen to what the pc said there are some rules it must not be too general so wide as to miss chain it must not be so narrow as to pin the pc in single incident it should be aimed at the part of the withhold that is most dangerous to the pc you must not take motivators or criticisms other peoples withholds or explanations if you get one of these you turn it around given motivator ask what overt the pc has done to that class of people many motivators are untruths anyway at least in part so it throws ruds out for you to accept one just convert it do an overt with q and criticism likewise leads to an overt it is hope that they can damage with an inability to do so it is bit higher toned than straight motivator motivator is based on an unknowingness criticism isnt necessarily criticism is also confession of an overt it converts as question to what have you done to _______ it is not always true that criticism is based on unknowingness but motivators always are it always seems safe to the pc to get other peoples overts off this is below motivators actually if the auditor lets the pc get these off you will get session where the pc made goals or gains when the pc says that said b did something ask the pc which person he knows then get what the pc has done to that person on explanations you know there is an overt so this also converts to what have you done actually the explanation itself is perfectly innocent but it leads to target eventually it is an extenuating circumstance for some overt you have to figure out what one way to open up some areas is to ask what should be done about _______ with the dynamics in the blank the pc goes off on some point and you can mine it whatever you get on some target convert the question to handle it in doing this you are steering the pc down chain of incidents that he considers relatively discreditable because he considers them discreditable he is not in communication with the subject matter he feels at the effect point of the subject matter the pc is the source of the aberration with which he is boxing as far as one lifetime or valence is concerned the individual has chosen certain areas as his randomity if he is giving other peoples withholds however he is not even on the cause effect line motivators being effect victim criticism the impulse to destroy explanation lines in dispersal you are walking the pc back to being cause by knocking out any reason he has to attack certain points or defend himself from them or to retreat from certain subjects on his track so he can communicate on all subjects naturally on areas where he is not being cause he doesnt know if you want to find person who is in total ignorance pull other peoples withholds here the pc doesnt even know he has bank or aberration on the subject on the motivator he knows that he is in trouble but he doesnt really know why critical pc may understand the situation but he wants to make nothing of it similarly with explanation there may not be any unknowns see the ow cycle as given in hcob 5jan61 ow limited theory what you handle is determined by what is real to the pc as shown by what reads on the meter if you get read it is the charge generated between the notknow and the know the pc must know 154something about it to have clash with the notknow on the subject if it is totally known there will be charge and read if it is totally unknown to the pc in the bank and everywhere else it doesnt register on the meter when the pc gets audited he will know more something that didnt show up before may well now read on the meter similarly the more pc knows about his own life the more charged up the bank will appear to be so you are always getting new withholds off the pc as areas of occlusion are located better it is not an endless situation since the pcs ability to find withholds and blow them increases at first withholds are few and blow slowly as the pc gets audited he gets more withholds and they blow faster and faster dont go for backtrack incidents with prepchecking the pc will just get mired down if you dont get this lifetime straightened out by getting ruds in on it he will get wins on it and have gains if you were crackerjack expert on 3dxx you could probably produce all the gains of prepchecking in terms of clearing up this lifetime blowing things into view etc but you would probably run into things like missed withholds which would make the pc blow and lots of outruds etc one of the things you could show the pc with prepclearing is that his ruds can be gotten in more details on prepclearing procedure and ruds 6202c27 shspec115 prepchecking dont take withholds you the auditor have and assume the pc has them this does tend to happen if you ask an auditor to list the withholds he thinks the pc has he will list his own especially if he doesnt know the pc very well you could take that list and check it against the auditors list of withholds and come out pretty close sometimes the auditor doesnt even realize what chain he is running he may recognize it afterwards this happens especially if the auditor doesnt take some time at the beginning of session to sort out the area for instance once lrh started from ptp then after 5 12 hours he realized that the subject of the chain was women once the auditor knows the basics of metering and repetitive questions trs etc and the mechanics of prepchecking he just needs to practice doing it until one day he finds it quite natural nobody can lay down what the pc will give you as withholds so you cant make it into totally rote procedure dont try to impose your moral code on the pc and dont let yourself get talked out of pulling withhold because it doesnt offend your mores when it does bother the pc 3dxx item that gives the pc pain is the pcs terminal an item that gives sensations and misemotion is the pcs oppterm to prepcheck terminal take whatever the terminals doingness is and get what the ow in the area is even if it is totally backwards eg the item could be moral man the zero question for this would be have you ever been moral you can get into the whole area of laudable withholds if the terminal was withheld all the terminals actions were also withheld there is also lot of withholding just in the laudable withhold area which could add up to withholding oneself from living more details on running routine 3dxx an item isnt winner it is only an apparent suppressor of other things and items there are two kinds of withholds for each terminal the withholds of dramatizing it and the withholds of not dramatizing it so if you dramatize the item you are obviously wrong and if you dont dramatize it you are wrong so you get withholds off both doing it and not doing it the easiest time to start to clear the pc is when the pc is clear of course now you have all the data you need to do it you know all about it but you have to apply the mechanics of scientology to case at time when you dont have all the data what you do have is all the rules axioms parts of the mind be do have etc you also have procedural systems like the withhold system to get what is keeping the pc from communicating but what are the withholds how are they formed up it is up to you to find that out you will find that if you give the pc good controlled session going right down the groove of something the pc can talk about because it is on the chain of withholds the pc can 155talk to you about that are real to the pc as withholds and if you can keep the pcs attention directed and if you make the pc go on and look you will find that the pc makes his goal and gets gains test of whether you are doing well with the pc is whether you know more every few hours about what makes this case tick whether you have higher understanding of the pc and of the human mind that is what you would expect of prepcheck activity as well as the pc making his goals and gains if your prepchecking is bad it could be because your auditing is bad or it could be that you can audit but you cant prepcheck you may have been expecting the pc to grow wings during prepchecking if prepchecking seems very arduous to you you are probably not doing it right it is really easy when you are doing it well like riding bicycle it is easier than other auditing and gives more gains per unit of time than any other auditing 6202c27 shspec116 auditors code the auditors code is to make auditing possible it is practical tool like most of scientology the auditors code was compiled in 1951 in wichita all of the points of the auditors code are empirical points the first theoretical code in dmsmh had greater appeal but was not the practical code lrh still favors it because it includes the idea that an auditor is courageous see dmsmh p 178 the first dianetic axioms were written in 1951 they are quite practical as auditing axioms and should be given more attention similarly with the prelogics the logics are interesting as synthesis of all education but there you are on theoretical material the mind as discussed in dmsmh is still what you are working with there is also some data in the original thesis that is very applicable to auditing the auditor as thetan plus the pc as thetan is greater than the pcs reactive mind etc the auditor cannot condemn the pc and expect the pc to overcome the reactive mind that set of formulas is what the auditors code was set up to put into effect the rules help the auditor avoid invalidating the pc as thetan and thereby beefing up his reactive mind the reactive mind is made up of machinery circuits and valences where machinery fits in is unclear unless it is the valence of machine circuit is specialized function of an identity or valence it is balledup automatic nothetan valence the thetan gave the identitywhichnowisacircuit orders for so long that now the circuit is giving the pc orders its the stuck flow mechanism the backflow the pc thetan has been resident in this body the identity giving it orders say to eat all of the mechanical actions of eating etc this has gone on for so long that the pc gets as backflow the idea that the identity should feed him so it becomes circuit this is all pertinent to 3dxx since all the things that make this life difficult went on in the lifetime of the earlier identity in an even more arduous and sincere way doubt that life has been lived and it is now neatly packaged as engrams ridges circuits etc all floating free longer located on the track package is the accumulated life experience of past identity just as this present lifetime can get grouped the black v case in the same way you can have valence going into grouper and becoming round black ball circuit which gives orders does various things etc as we pull this apart we will find all the picture manifestations and mechanisms you have in engrams chains etc all present in that circuit that circuit belongs somewhere on the time track in relation to the other circuits but if it is part of the gpm it has floated free from its position on the time track and every moment of time is now time it is instant time hence your instant read on the emeter instant read occurs because there is need to look or think and key anything in to get the read that which reads with an instant read is already there and keyed in in an eternal present time the following data is pertinent the above plus the phenomena of matter energy space and time the association of incidents the confusions and the early axiom that life is composed of differences similarities and identities the mind resolves problems related to survival utilizing its ability to conceive similarities and observe differences dianetics the original thesis p 59 the analytical mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experience data to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics it thinks in differences and similarities the reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files and retains physical pain and painful emotion 156and seeks to direct the organism solely on stimulusresponse basis it thinks only in identities dmsmh pp 589 all time is identified with this time and we get all these identities giving pcs all these orders dictating all these reflexes and that is really all you are handling all the counterpoints of morality that do exist and have existed give us so many confusions and conflicts on rightness of conduct that we can then get people seeking right conduct until they go nuts most laws are passed to prevent earlier laws from being applied if you are an egyptian then persian then greek then roman if you set up rightnessofconduct circuit for one culture you will be nutty in your next culture your circuit will have points of conflict with current mores if you set up new circuit you have more new automatic impulses which have to cancel the previous ones etc etc overlaid and confused by the builtin stops after few lifetimes we may feel less than free unable to decide etc this wouldnt be so bad if rightness of conduct was light matter but we get into cultures where it is life and death matter then the solution may be to forget it all to notis it to say that we have only lived once to shove it under the rug but now having hidden the source of the nowimsupposedtos its even worse we go around getting strange ideas which we cant even stop feeling peculiar if it were just rightness of conduct that we were concerned about it wouldnt be too bad but the moral codes are usually enforced with somatics the somatic is most intimately connected in mental phenomena with rightness and wrongness of conduct punishment just the physical universe enforces punishment for wrong estimation of direction and effort for instance if one makes mistake in ones footwork one may fall downstairs rightness of conduct enforced with pain inevitably becomes an enforced conduct so these valences and circuits enforce rightness of conduct on the pc with pain as the enforcer the somatic we try to run them out and get somatics the somatics appear so formidable that it seems we had better not touch the valence this protects it and allows it to keep up its flow of orders to the pc if you want to see how much command value the valence has over the pc note what he is saying doing and thinking in the few minutes just before you nail the item at that time it is in its highest level of restimulation its command value is extreme when it is found and identified its command value drops off but if it is also very unsafe thing that has tremendous withholds in its own lifetime if it is valence that keeps dropping out of the pcs sight and is unsafe to reveal the pc will dramatize it more when it has been brought to view he wont dramatize it much but he will still feel its impulses and feel upset about having the impulses that makes him feel very odd pc who is running his 3dxx terminal can find himself equating all his normal activities as being those of the terminal it can make him feel that he is on the verge of being found out all the time he is being it not being it and deciding he doesnt have to be it these are identities the person has been residual training patterns and facsimiles from those lifetimes every facsimile from that lifetime is in that bundle the pictures are there but smudgy and out of focus then as you try to run them you find that they have been laid in with tremendous cold this makes winter bad time to run 3dxx these black masses are drained of heat energy mostly however like cinders they contain occasional hot spots so you can get fevers off of them after death between lives people often go off into the ionosphere or into space where it is very cold here the track collapses and they get all their stuff keyed in because cold motion time every one of these bundles contains pictures in greater or lesser degree of decay the pictures are already burnt out and deteriorated to some degree and dont show up too well the pc may be disappointed not to have better pictures of those lifetimes this could be the way it goes the item itself was scarce so he made picture of it then because he didnt have the item but did have the picture the picture itself became scarce and therefore very valuable it could become so scarce and so valuable that the pc couldnt have it at all that is the condition of most of these circuits and valences at the same time the pc wants these pictures and has to have them he wont have anything to do with them and cant have them so you have nohavingness of the pictures so he uses the picture he depends on it to orient himself and to tell you what he is doing so he remains in state of godhelpus as you remedy his havingness and bring these things back prepcheck them get his overts off etc this state of affairs will improve persons havingness deteriorates to the degree he commits overts per the overtmotivator sequence only when an individual has done something to another can he receive the same action as an inflow fortunately it is not oneforone mechanism it is the sensibility of having done something that 157counts when you have done something to something you have cut down your havingness you get individuated to the point where it is their havingness and my havingness and therefore i can protect my havingness by destroying their havingness this totally overlooks the point that it is all your havingness if you destroy someone elses havingness you destroy your own because you have what others have havingness as personal ownership is misconception you actually own that which you can perceive this has degraded down to the idea that you can only own that which you can personally use freedom of use is the final idea of havingness to lot of people but it isnt really the final idea of havingness at all that is why the communist and the socialist etc can make such an effect on society because he is talking on harmonic that is mockery of what is basically true all ideas of ownership are postulated ownerships nobody really owns anything except those things that one owns by the right of having created them therefore some people fall back on creativeness as the only way of life because it is the only possible way of declared ownership what they neglect to point out is that what the other guy made is theirs too community property is lower mockery of this fact i dont even know that you own everything you create you can continue responsibility for the things you create without owning them in auditing the problem is to understand what fundamentals are important and what are not fundamentals dont think all data are equally important the things mentioned in this lecture are the basic important things the importance of datum in relation to other data is the sole criterion of the value of the datum in all study one must evaluate the importances of your data relative to the purpose and activity you are going to do it is not enough to be learned and to know data to be wise you have to be able to relate data to actions people tend to make data of monotone value not all this data in dianetics and scientology is equally important but if you know the basic and fundamental data you can easily decide what to handle and how in session 6203c01 shspec120 model session i model session was instituted because auditors were varying patter to degree that session was hardly recognizable and because as early as 1954 scientologists were arguing about the proper way to do auditing there was need for standard way to do it also it was found that if all sessions were on the same pattern subsequent sessions tended to run out earlier sessions this has considerable value there is predictability because of the application and auditing thereby becomes better communication the rudiments value became extreme at the moment auditors began having difficulties finding goals and terminals rudiments in present form are less than four to five months old ruds began in 1955 having them in can make the difference between auditing and noauditing model session is tailored against clearing it is not tailored so much for prepchecking the ruds are vital for assessment since prepchecking takes up lot of the things found in the ruds there could be confusion between prepchecking and ruds rudiments can be used by the pc to throw the session if you use any form cf ow in the rudiments because the pc can now get into whole new channel of overts while you had some previouslystarted chains you wanted to get handled rudiments are vital to session they get and hold pc in session however they can throw pc out of session as well as into session if they are used to prevent pc from communicating with the auditor if the pc comes in with all the answers to yesterdays prepcheck questions he is already in session the process of checking rudiments can create an arc break if the pc is already in session the emeter wont tell you if the pc is in session since the process of checking to see if the pc is ready can throw the pc out of session also the emeter will not register when the pc is so arc broken that the auditor has command value over him the pc must be way south very arc broken for this to be the case so before you start model session ask if it is all right for you to start the session if you get answer or you can tell that you will get reads on ruds pay attention to the pc get what is wrong before you expect to get much on the meter if the pc will talk to you pretty easily the meter will read if he wont it wont if the auditor rejects the pcs data that he is arc broken because the meter didnt read the pc will get arc broken with the meter the reason you start the session is to be sure the pc knows he is on specialized section of track that what is going to happen is not social relationship but that there is special auditor pc relationship to ensure that the special auditorpc relationship is in existence ask the pc if the session has started for him if he says give start of session again and ask again if he says again assume that it has started anyway and that the pc has an arc break with life somewhere the beginning 158rudiments are designed for the order of logical progress for session if you put ptp first you would be running session without goals havingness clearing the auditor etc for model session patter of this time period see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised the order of actions in model session tends to clear out the other things ie starting with goals tends to put him in session by putting his attention on his case having can clean up arc breaks etc you can put pc in session by clever use of goals in ruds if your definition of goals is broad enough the pc has some goal some hopeful postulate for the future which one has recognized or acknowledged even if the pcs goal is to die if you acknowledge it and grant him the beingness of having it he can then change it if the pc isnt giving any goals explore some future possibilities with him one way or the other find such things as what the pc is sure is going to happen in the session and sort out the goal involved with that dont go overboard as far as number of goals is concerned but get the pc to make some this presupposes of course that the pc doesnt come in already in session telling you something he really wants to tell you goals for life or livingness are there to differentiate from session goals this is not very vital and you never check up on it it is there to expose ptps of long duration if the same life or beingness goal keeps recurring you will know that there is ptp to take up if they dont contain problems fine this shows the pc that you are interested in him the next step havingness is easy to audit and beneficial for all concerned the pc will usually run it too matter what else he may or may not run finding the havingness process can take awhile but it is easy enough if you find one early in the pcs auditing it will be changed before too long so watch it closely the more complex processes will work better early on it is especially useful to find the havingness process early on if the pc arc breaks easily the havingness of the pc in the session is directly proportional to the smoothness of the auditing it is arc breaks that reduce havingness whether created by the auditor the environment or whatever when using havingness to heal an arc break be sure to flatten it run it for half an hour or an hour not doing it this way is why auditors dont have reality on the fact that havingness clears up arc breaks they dont see that it is working stopping it prematurely can give the pc quite jolt dont cause arc breaks with havingness process for gods sake make it part of the process to inquire how he is doing during the process so it doesnt become signal that you are about to end the process an intelligent use of havingness would be to use it when there is shadow of dropped interest on the part of the pc less comm etc but it should not be used to interrupt the pcs insessionness the stable rule is not that you run havingness whenever the pc dopes off you can get the same read during assessment whether the pc is conscious or not so there it is not necessary you use it to help the pc get better into session 6203c01 shspec121 model session ii if your pc hasnt been gotten into session by the time you have run havingness the rest of the ruds probably wont do it for you the next step is often too steep gradient if the pc isnt already fairly willing to have you audit him ow has liability for getting the pc into session it can miss withhold throwing the pc wildly out of session dont use an arc break process to handle an arc break when the pc wont be audited it works to get pc who is somewhat out of session better in the rud will improve the pcs in sessionness not create it the pc has to be in session enough to run process dont use havingness to heal an arc break except in extremis if you are using havingness to handle an arc break you will notice that the last thing the pc will point to is you the auditor therefore dont use are you willing to talk to about your difficulties unless you are desperate and there is nothing else to do or unless it is not heavy arc break just sort of cooler pc the pcs arc breaks always stem from from noauditing if he is still fussing and arguing with you he is in session enough to be audited but if he is totally absorbed in his case and not willing to talk to the auditor he is not in session missed withhold is an absence of auditing which creates an arc break in the withhold system it is the who should have known which gives you most ta because it points up absence of auditing to help get the pc into session during prepchecking since you dont want to run any ow run something like who would i have to be to audit you or the arc 61 process several questions 159about talking to people about difficulties see hcob 30nov61 arc process 1961 there is one process you can run that must be flattened and not get stuck in the second dynamic restimulation it creates touch my body part repetitive it is flat when there is longer any misemotion love anguish etc on it it does cure the pc falling in love with the auditor details on use of ruds in prepchecking and routine 3dxx sessions goals and gains let both auditor and pc know whether there has been progress gains is particularly for the auditor it gives the auditor wins when you end the session make sure it is ended if there seems to be any question ask has the session ended for you if necessary have the pc touch parts of the environment get him into present time then end the session not really ending the session is not very serious error but it is very common one you can tell if the session is ended by whether the pc is still talking to you about the session afterwards or still treating you as his auditor after session 6203c19 shspec122 the bad auditor this lecture is based on hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor and hcob 15mar62 suppressors person who becomes bad auditor has concentration on single ability like all aberration insanity is nothing else than an insane person does something to the exclusion of all else the psychiatrist errs in thinking that the conduct of the insane is insane when what makes it insane is the concentration on one area or behavior exclusively to an intensity that is contrasurvival if you did everything insane people do you would be acting sane this avoidance mechanism is present in everyone to some degree but the case we are talking about the bad auditor gets extreme reactions to running the revelation process see hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor there is an interesting approach to terror charge case that lrh used once he had the pc move to the beginning of track and scan forward to present time this got the pc stuck in the engram necessary to resolve the case which was where he was anyhow and the terror turned on so hard that all four legs of the couch started chattering on the floor the pc found and ran the incident and got the terror charge off if person can have as much charge as that imagine how much charge could be trapped in valence that is terrified through and through terror is the result of something having appeared engramically and then threatening to appear again an emotional charge always has an incident of physical pain underlying it person cannot experience misemotional charge independent of having received physical pain hence the term secondary if someone has the pain incident subsequent similar incidents can be associated with it and can restimulate the past pain if the pc hasnt become accustomed to such events one way or another he will suppress perception of the environment as being similar to the first incident and hence unsafe if the auditor is restimulator for the pc the pc will always omit pointing at the the auditor during havingness until he gets sufficiently familiar with the environment and aware of it to key out at this point the pc sees the auditor and breathes sigh of relief ie the pc finds the auditor the guy who has somatic and hence suppressor if asked have you ever had something happen to your stomach will say yes probably has the one who has had mysterious stomach somatic would say which is dead giveaway of the suppressor person suppresses environmental restimulators using the suppress in the original incident the original impulse to unmock for instance the car in the original incident is used to unmock the restimulator just before he was hit by the car he tried to unmock the car crunch it hit him anyway that made him lose but that same crunch later comes down to unmock the restimulators and the first incident appears to be unmocked thetan never gives up he has pictures of the car unmocked in the bank when you run it out you have to run out the unmock before you get the actual incident doing touch assist the time it takes to run out the suppressor is the time it takes for the physical pain to turn on if he wasnt suppressing and if he wasnt in such games condition with mest here is what would happen the car hits him splat he hits telephone pole splat he lands on the road and gets run over by bus splat if he didnt feel so undignified he would simply have said splat splat splat and picked up the body uninjured the somatic would have 160run out instantly but because of his notis the somatic stays in place that is the source of disease somatics etc person goes through various phases of notis and persons impulse towards notis if failed can turn into an alteris his alteris can turn into notis and his notis into alteris so he can have suppression stacked with change and that is dubin dubin follows failed suppression below the level of unconsciousness dreams are dubins alterises of the things you cant notis when as an auditor you feel bit leery about auditing somebody you have entered into specialized field of suppression some auditors have difficulty only with certain types of pcs their suppression on particular type of being is the prevention of restimulator they are afraid something is going to appear they are suppressing something the result is to prevent the pc from talking to the auditor in thousands of guises the pc mustnt originate he mustnt give up withholds change get acknowledged etc there are zillions of variations of ways to produce this effect including premature ack eval inval overcontrol undercontrol q and etc etc all these ways combine to produce every auditing fault formerly the only cure we had was to keep the student at it long enough to run it out by gaining familiarity with pcs and discovering that they didnt reveal anything which damaged him some however never did get used to it they took the route of suppressing pcs about 20 about 30 got over it rather slowly and 50 rather easily with varying degrees of speed the length of time required in training is directly proportional to the number of suppressors you are trying to overcome in the student they are dealing with the root stuff of aberration of course there is likely to be revealed from the pc some restimulator in the likely event that this occurs these students will suppress the pcs comm the way to handle this requires drills and familiarization with suppression and finding who or what would suppress get these things sorted out to clear up the mechanism who is the person with the field black v invisible field etc its the person with tremendous suppression blackness is difficulty of recognition invisibility which is rarer is suppression of glass objects person with black field is more likely to suppress at night than during the day the person who is suppressing thetans also gets an invisible field whenever you suppress something in given timestream you of course suppress time so time becomes the primary suppression giving the instantaneousness of all time in the reactive mind because of the notising of the reactive mind everybody is trying to suppress some things normal survival conduct calls for suppression of countersurvival impulses we go down from that to suppressing things that are liable to appear thence to suppressing things that are likely to become known the withhold then suppressing things which are likely to think this gives lots of failures and invisible fields and various complications and automaticities of suppression it is only the person who has suppression of banks on total automatic completely out of his own control who is dangerous as an auditor he wont let pc ever reveal anything so the pc gets stuck in everything he utters if process works today this auditor will drop it he will only run processes that are flat the auditor will q and goof only pick up safe withholds and miss all the ones that it could do the pc good to reveal which the pc is willing to reveal if asked this auditor is dangerous because missing withholds will arc break pcs and drive them out of scientology the auditor doesnt intend this he just intends to do good safe job where one gets upset or reveals anything in study if the person never lets the sense of the bulletin or tape to come through nothing will be revealed everyone to some degree has staggeringly bad memory thanks to their overts the person who has lot of overts is the last to be aware of it because of her suppression person will help another to the degree of tolerance he has for something being revealed this works into blackmail if you dont help ill reveal something about you the reverse is to help someone unless they are likely to reveal something that is the bad auditor and the bad student this is what keeps people from employing the technology even when they know it 6203c19 shspec123 mechanics of suppression 161the axioms always have been way ahead of us trying to get scientology tech to catch up with them is tough job the axioms contain the basic data on suppressors under the heading of notisness notisness is suppressed isness it is the effort to put an isness out of existence running lies out of bank runs out alterisness and notisness alterisness is change it sits between an isness and suppression time mechanically is change cycle of action runs from nonexistence to an existence to nonexistence the first material on this is science of certainty see pab 3 certainty processing p 4 the earliest reference is to journal of scientology issue 16g this is scientology the science of certainty the something nothing process the cycle of action never entered in it was just alternate something and nothing used to unstick maybe most people consider maybe as an unknown though it isnt really an unknown except perhaps mechanically maybe is really the nomansland between the certainty that something is and the certainty that it isnt cycle of action can be stacked alongside maybe and you could say that change is maybe it looks in the reactive mind as though the middle of cycle of action is maybe so that all change is maybe and therefore if anything is changed maybe it isnt we get new process out of the above the somethingnothing process it is hard to word this so that it is comprehensible to mind we have had trouble processing notis somethingnothing lies etc lies get into creating which beefs up some banks this new process somethingnothing which is class i process class i auditor is relatively unskilled and is only permitted to audit process that he has had success with on pcs see p 152 and hcopl 29sep61 hgc allowed processes needs refinement on wording perhaps it is just it is it isnt repetitively if he is run awhile on this the pc will move on the track he will also before long deliver up his chronic somatic ptp current difficulty or whatever by applying the process directly to his case what you are doing is running him on the cycle of action you havent said whether the it isnt is vanishment or notisness but the pc will always run it as notis or suppressors so you are running direct suppressors and the thing he is most immediately suppressing is most likely to come into view his hidden standard or chronic ptp the thing he is trying to make up his mind about is something he has said it is about then not liking it has said it isnt this has left him in the maybe or whether it ever was is or will be you would get nowhere processing someone on maybe because basically there is such thing as maybe there is only creation and the conditions of the creation even when cycle of action has been completed it is still there as memory this gives the pc recording of the it is you never get pure nonexistence after an existence the only pure nonexistence was before the existence so this fantastically simple process can produce practically every other phenomenon in scientology it stems from existence and nonexistence which stems from perception and dontwanttoperceive which goes over into creativeness and destruction and wild bands of change in between most people avoid isnesses like the plague in the course of running the above process the uncertainty of the case blows off the openminded maybe case is the normal frame of mind for modern scientists they think lrh isnt scientific because he is so positive because he is not full of maybes scientists are always on the verge of something being revealed suddenly which scares them therefore they make bad auditors people that have lot of withholds dont want their minds to be invaded people are hung up in revelations the catholic church is against the idea of investigating the mind they are big on revelations which are all delusory modern sciences revelation is the hbomb but this is too big revelation so people wont look at it similarly with scientology it would be more successful to oppose the hbomb by cutting back the revelation to an investigation of the guy who pushes the button than to try to impress people with the whole picture of the hbomb with scientology revealing that it clears people is too much revelation you will have more success with do you have pain scientology would probably take quite awhile to do anything about that the person could confront that much you could run get the idea that there is pain there get the idea that there is pain there this would tum on the pain he could confront it because it is slightly on unlike his suppressed pains so he wont be faced with an unexpected revelation check every five or six commands to make sure he has followed the commands pains which appear in some previously nonpainful areas where the person has some malfunction will turn on he will be completing old cycles of action 162only two things can happen to person to have nothing appear and to have something appear so the two conditions of any game are appearance and nonappearance so we get the anatomy of games which is the context in which lrh originally studied this subject the opposing player in game either is or isnt the middle between it is and it isnt is what reads there are all kinds of ramifications of it is anything can be represented by it the opposing player the team either team etc the amount of is the person can conceive compared to the amount of isnt the person can conceive finds the disagreement between the isnt and the is that gives the read all the meter reads on is the disagreement between the it is and the it isnt two valences in one mind can produce quite disagreement eg an atheist and presbyterian it is the disagreement that gives the read so in the case of the atheist and the presbyterian you will get big registry on the meter from either one because of the other on 3dxx you will get as much charge off running terminals as oppterms the whole mass goes out of balance when you discharge one but that one wont discharge totally until you can discharge the other why are they counteropposed it is because one says certain principles are and the other says certain principles arent and viceversa they are violently opposed you will find that this is characteristic of every gpm package you get identities which are opposites which make problems so all these isnesses are opposed by all these notisnesses it is heavily charged and violent because of all these disagreements you could probably put this theory into any process for instance you could make prepcheck zero question out of it have you ever considered that another didnt exist or have you ever insisted something was with that you would get tremendous number of overts since trying to damage something is trying to make it not exist and when you are creating something you are asserting it is every overt is an assertion that something is or isnt this is all very black and white unlike non aristotelian logic which insists that positives and negatives dont exist it is true that there are gradient scales and that ultimates are unattainable but you would be speaking nonsense to say that positives do not exist though ultimates dont general semantics see alfred korzybskis general semantics and modern science shy completely away from positiveness and certainties as time drags out positiveness reduces the less concept of time person has the less positive things seem all you have to be is aware of the nowness of the instant and you get quite bit of isness and notisness coming in this occurs during havingness the walls seem brighter what happens is that the notisness disappears and is replaced by nonexistence it ceases being suppression and becomes so to speak an awareness of nonexistence rather than suppression of existence person sits surrounded by masses these are all notisnesses the first thing the pc would say about them is that they dont exist as he runs havingness and comes up to pt the walls get brighter and these things would disappear but when you run some people on havingness it goes from notisness to nonexistence on such clearcut track that as you run havingness on them and make the walls more real their bank materializes and they have people standing in the room you run off the notisness by running on the isness of the wall the notisness that pushed the picture into invisibility released as the persons reality on the wall increased you ran out the invisibility of the isness the people have always been there but he has notised them and has had to be quite careful about them all this time the fellow whom you audit on and on who never gets any pictures is classic he is totally suppressing because there is something he is deathly afraid will appear you could make list of who or what would be afraid to find out oppterm the terminals etc as this ran awhile the dead bodies that he has notised would start to to show up sometimes someone in weakened condition will take his attention off these things for awhile and one will materialize and spook him he will say that he has been blanketed many people dont have time track they have only series of notisnesses these are the calm people hah there are some pretty hideous phenomena that can occur while running this out but continuing to run it will turn them off auditors used to get upset by this while running notknow they would get curious when the pc actually notknew something to the point of its vanishing and go off in q and and never flatten the process of course this was terribly restimulative on the subject of notfindout the notis button 163when the notis disappears the isness materializes and scares the pc to the point at times where the pc decides never to let that happen again the pictures that turn on can be more real than pt for awhile this is quite surprise pc gets afraid to find out when an identity in the bank has been asserting isness and somebody else has been asserting notisness various bank phenomena turn on and off and the pc gets stuck then he gets afraid to find out something is liable to materialize to appear this makes bad auditor he is just shaky on the subject of things appearing he can be gotten over it educationally andor with processing it is it isnt does it 3dxx would do it as would various prepcheck and notisness questions etc another method is change in the withhold system also see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data p 2 to use the withhold system on suppressors add appear before who this might even run an engram go when all appear and who appear is what might have appeared or revealed itself or should have shown up at that point or is there anything that didnt show up this mechanism helps get suppressors off the withhold beefed up in this way it might be strong enough to run an engram 6203c21 shspec124 prepchecking pcs attention can become so concentrated on particular part of the gpm that he does not recognize that the gpm has some 40 or 50 combinations in it trying to get the pcs attention off the last combination you found and onto the next combination you have found sometimes takes some doing the gpm is areas of stuck attention on identities the pc ordinarily runs through this cycle 1 they didnt want it then 2 they think it is fine some items are hotter than others and explain more than others you have twenty or thirty items before you get to the middle of the gpm the ones at the middle are the last ones the pc finds 3dxx bypasses and cuts through running items by the process of finding items 3dxx gets the bank down to the point of what is holding the bank together it is rather difficult since it is over the pcs last hundred thousand dead bodies fortunately only few of these items are remarkable the pc has probably been every item he puts on the list we are only trying to find the items that he is stuck with the process of listing keys out fifty to hundred of these at crack and we are left with the one that doesnt key out the gpm item the rest are locks on that what is holding that item is in some more basic deeper combination thus after you have found some more some of the ones you found earlier may drop out but only when you run the central package will you get rid of some of them the most horrifying ones the pc finds early on are liable to blow as locks later on though they may seem very important at first the reason auditors had so much trouble doing routine 3 for definition of this see p 34 above is that it is really much better though less accurate way of getting the actual package it reached deep into the gpm and the case and is more accurate when done absolutely right done poorly it was deadly to the pc running the wrong terminal was awful routine 3dxx doesnt require the some degree of accuracy and the pc shows continuous progress running it eventually too you get much more fundamental items than the original routine 3d items the object of prepchecking is to find chains of withholds and relieve them on the pcs case auditors seem to be having trouble duplicating this datum they dont seem to realize that you dont ask what question until you have specific withhold delivered into your lap auditors keep confusing zeroa questions with what questions see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill the zero question gives you vast generality the zeroa question gives somewhat less generality the what question should give you more specific withholds not just generalities the zero question is about whole dynamic the zeroa gives generality it is not what question even though it can begin with what 164when you do get the specific overt then ask what about overt get when all appear and who if it doesnt clean up ask for an earlier one dont take something else which is vaguely similar but is not the same doingness run the whole chain of doing what you started on there must be an earlier one if it doesnt free on two runs through the withhold system chain gets charged up only because the first part of the chain is suppressed and forgotten finding the data of something will cause it to blow so if you have taken off the when the all the appear not appear and the who should have known from some incident it would blow if that were all there was to it all that will keep it reacting is some earlier withhold you can help the pc tell you by the murder system suggesting incomparably exaggerated overts so his dont look so awful sometimes you will hit chain which goes way back probably as part of the gpm you can still run it it just takes long time and sometimes your pc throws you red herring he gives you ptps and missed withholds in the beginning ruds this can lead you off on some new chain which has nothing to do with what you had started and left unflat the pc has moved into control of the session which enables him to stay away from some almost uncovered area sometimes you can get away with ignoring the outrud sometimes it is fatal dont in any case use withhold processes to handle an outrud in checking for missed withholds in ruds ask severely limited question so you only pick up the ones between sessions dont let 3dxx session become prepcheck session because of the pcs out ruds at the beginning of session if his ruds keep being out and needing repair take few days off 3dxx and prepcheck for awhile otherwise the pc will feel he is getting auditing if it takes more than three days to find 3dxx item you will never get it because the pc will be arc broken about auditing ruds will just go further and further out you can even get the pc to put his own outruds in by insisting that you are going to find his item this promises him auditing 6203c21 shspec125 prepchecking the amount of case progress is directly proportional to the amount of ta ta asis of mass nothing was restimulated details on running of secondary prehav scale for overts way of hitting the overt chains the pc is trying to avoid in assessing the auditor should be brisk and interested not so much helpful if you assess slowly it gives the pc more time for random thoughts critical thoughts all sorts of outofsession producing stuff the less time you take the less mest universe gets into the session 6203c27 shspec130 prepchecking data details on correction of errors in prepchecking pc doesnt prepcheck all the way to the bottom of the deck not all levels of pcs prepcheck prepchecking is not as broadly good an approach to all cases matter how lowtoned as the cchs or even 3dxx both cchs and 3dxx go much farther south than prepchecking which requires some responsibility for thinkingness thus 1 prepchecking takes responsibility for doingness 2 3dxx takes responsibility for existingness beingness 3 cchs take some responsibility for mass and repetitive action havingness note that this is be do have situation 3dxx and cchs both go further south than responsibility for doingness which is what prepchecking attacks it is odd that the beingness processes 3dxx go further south than doingness but it is empirically true that this is the case the reason fur this is probably that doingness is the main punishment factor in this part of the universe one will admit to beingness and havingness before admitting to doingness 165if you are having lot of trouble with prepchecking if you are not making much gain if you have tried for several sessions to find an area that produces ta without success you should run cchs the problem is not necessarily the pc it could be lack of auditor skill but in any case cchs will give the pc more case gain and more auditing it could be that the auditor is timid or that the pc is new and the auditor doesnt want to upset or embarrass him or the pc may be in the middle of ptp of long duration that is undisclosed the cchs will discharge ptps of long duration even if they are undisclosed or the pcs moral code could be so different from the auditors so far outof this world that the auditor misses the boat on it or the pc could have confidence in the auditors prepchecking or the pc has insufficient responsibility to respond to any doingness that will be handled with cchs cch2 is less embarrassing to start new pc with than prepchecking also after an intensive of cchs the same things that didnt produce ta before will now give ta the only thing that breaks an auditors heart is getting nothing done so dont abandon responsibility for yourself by running things which get nothing done most auditor errors are from not flattening processes lrh doesnt care what you run on pc as long as you flatten it and as long as you get results if you are getting ta on something run it however running limited processes beyond the point where they stop producing ta is hazardous operation pcs sometimes get off lies and feel relieved that is just because you didnt get near their overts you should know how to crack the problem of social mores in 3dxx you get the terminals social mores by asking the pc what would be considered antisocial by the terminal you then use the mores to make up zero questions using the overt with the biggest meter reaction first you are liable to come up with the pcs oppterm and overts of failure to damage the oppterm pretty quickly so you have to find out if it is plus overt or minus overt ie whether it is what you would expect or whether it is from the other side of the fence every race every species having fourth dynamic tends to fixate on that dynamic and the thetans running those bodies tend to keep running those bodies as long as they are available but when the species got scarce or extinct they had to move over into something else there is reason you shouldnt have been an animal at one time or another it is actually quite relief you pick up your nowimsupposedtos easily animals tend to stay with their nowimsupposedtos because they cant talk about them that is the only thing wrong with being an animal as far as nationalities are concerned thetan transfer can really scramble things up say some indian gets new body as an englishman the us is now getting lots of exnazis exjapanese etc on the track the pc has often gone round and round on the greeceegyptpersia line getting all confused about his nowimsupposedtos however there is dominant moral code in the 3dxx package dont forget overts of omission as well as commission plus the fruitful area of makeguilty and being victim you could investigate the makeguilty aspect of any zero question to get his efforts to get motivator on the subject which would make someone else guilty of the overt if the pc tends to dodge into past lives to avoid his thislife overts when you get in endruds about halftruths untruths misses withholds etc you will pick up the avoided areas some pcs need lot of cleanup on halftruths all the time others dont you will get to know the pc and see if it is necessary dont use any form of ow to handle ruds in prepcheck sessions or you will pile up unflat chains and the pc will use ruds to avoid uncomfortable hot areas 6203c29 shspec126 cchs the cchs were developed when the hgc in london was finding out that there were pcs that werent gaining and were getting results the cchs dont run things out the cchs familiarize the pc with control communication and havingness the pc does an upgrade on cchs in the teeth of the adage that the pc must be at cause actually there is gradient of causativeness from very slight at cch1 to considerable at cch4 the cchs are way to get the pc to sit there and look at something so he finds out he can confront it the pc becomes aware through familiarization that control communication and havingness are not necessarily horrible as the case goes downscale it 166gets to level where it is predominantly motivator and wont respond to anything else the person does not have an adequate enough idea of cause to be causative above that point persons cause can be increased easily below that point it can only be increased to the point of getting him to confront something going on someplace else that is where cchs take over instead of letting the pc run up further overts by being accusative and critical we get him to confront communication control and duplication just communication and duplication in itself gives case gain havingness is the concept of not being prevented from reaching or the concept of being able to reach havingness process is continuous duplication of being able to reach havingness wasnt quirk cch1 getting the pc to reach you enables him to communicate with the auditor it establishes the auditor as terminal this should get the pc being at cause he cogs that he can reach and will therefore communicate to you cch2 the pc has had his body running on machine for ages it operates all by itself cch2 lets the pc take over the automaticity of body motion that he has relinquished he does this knowingly cch3 this was developed to get the pc in the same communication timeand space span as the auditor some people cant put dispatch on comm line because they cant tolerate distance on the line they always bring body cch3 gets the pc over the necessity to be touching something in order to feel in comm with it this is an effort at gradient how far can the pc be from the auditor and still be in comm for instance some people haveto be there in person to deliver message cch3 lets the pc enter space into communication his causedistanceeffect has been one of minimal distance just causeeffect with distance so if the pc were in the auditors head he could be auditedthe pc gets the idea of communication by duplication cch3 enters space into the communication and some duplication the pc cogs that he can talk to the auditor and understand what the auditor is telling him to do keep it very simple the word contributed introduces the idea of cause you are gradually bringing him around to this idea that is why you ask if he contributed to the motion you dont care what he answers youare just planting the idea cch4 you are actively asking if the pc is satisfied that he duplicatedthe motion its the pc who should be satisfied not the auditor necessarily if the pc is satisfied when he hasnt really duplicated the motion the auditors only mistake is to contradict or criticize him or invalidate him if the pc is wildly off but says he is doing it find simple motion the pc will duplicate so he doesnt keep making himself into lier every time or get off the misduplicated motion for two or three turns and then come back to it he will eventually improve it he will get better the above is the only reason why cchs actually work it is peculiar fact about cchs that they dont even require the pcs agreement or approval to get gains from them they worked in 1956 then got altered to point where they didnt work because they had stopped being run as combination which is as important as how each is done individually if pc gets run on cchs when they are not producing change he gets the idea that he is being punished so you run it to three times through with change then go on to the next cch it is as important for the pc to not mind doing it as it is for him to do it perfectly the pc will start nut doing them on the auditors determinism running just cch1 for hours with change doesnt offer enough randomity to cause change that is the trouble you get into tackling each one just by itself the pc will run for two hundred hours on cch1 with results an exception is that you can only run cch1 on an unconscious person similarly with touch assist engram running you make that body lie on that bed and others with an unconscious person you should also cycle through three or four processes do the rotation and the case will unsettle go through cchs to get them to bite there should be enough randomity in it so it will bite otherwise it might just go on and on the cchs unflatten each other they are run tone 40 upper indocs are vital training eg put thought in that ashtray helps the auditor get thought into pcs head that is the way they should be run they are tone 40 process ie cchs 1 and 2 you lay the commands into the pcs head not necessarily even verbally just command the pc without reservation the cchs are nonverbal processes they could be run on deaf person they are action processes with common denominator of solids not thoughts so do them when you are not getting ta on thinkingness processes for several sessions if discussion of auditing produces ta motion consistently put the pc on cchs the pc in such case is not familiar enough with control 167communication and havingness to be willing or able to go into session fairly easily the other pc who should get cchs is one who gets ta on tactile havingness cchs are not only for psychotics though they are the only process you can run on psychotic cchs reach far higher than was previously realized the need to keep doing cchs as long as they produce change and stop doing one when it produces change goes in the teeth of time and the physical universes q and you would think you should change one when there is change and not change when there is change but this isnt so 6203c29 shspec127 q and period when you get ta knob alternating between two different locations it is circulation between two masses this is similar to stage four needle but on the ta it is the case shifting between two valences this is not the same as ta motion it is sudden shift not gradual change if running cch turns on somatic you run it until the somatic turns off if it is not matter of somatics run cchs until the pc can do them all willingly and well run out gross changes somatics are the most gross little objections and raggedness are less gross if you cant detect the somatic by physical manifestations it doesnt exist for the purposes of cchs too many pcs dramatize victims and make up somatics etc if you wanted the greatest possible gain and the least possible blow on pcs who were pretty sensible anyway you would do ruds on the meter along with cchs this makes different breed of cchs when it is done this way you would ease up any tendency to blow and it would make it easier for the pc to stay in session on many cases you cant do ruds but if the pc is fairly upscale it would probably go better with ruds put in details on running 3dxx the pc is his terminal the terminal has pain on it and it is always facing outwards against enemies so you give him an enemy an enemy an enemy and he will get dizzy from too many enemies but on the pain phenomenon he is simply being someone else you wont get 3dxx turning on constant pain if the pc has the same pain grief or fights you for 20 minutes that is change but the pain must be something more than the pcs statement about it you must see some physical manifestation since cchs are nonverbal if the same grief or whatever has gone on for 20 minutes with change it wont just run out so that is why it is ok to leave it why the pain is on the pcs terminal it is just an observation however it doesnt seem too unreasonable that he should get pain as himself if he has created pain he will feel it as himself as the motivator that is highly probable you can run an oppterm flat sometimes and the pc will feel better the terminal will still be live on cchs 3 and 4 you handle pc originations but only out of courtesy you dont really care about how he says he is feeling because what you are running off can cause the pc to say the damnedest things most of them lies it runs out all sorts of countercreates verbal and nonverbal they will throw you all sorts of red herrings pc running cchs never originates he only dramatizes you dont have to get into games condition with the pc just run the process as an rfactor for cchs you can and should tell the pc what you are doing and why you are doing it as sort of rudiment to start the session try to get the pcs agreement before the session starts and then you run the session anyway after session you can talk about the cchs provided you dont evaluate for him if the pc wants to talk about them when cch session goes into screaming fits it is probable that the rfactor could have been established better you can tell the pc anything like its drill im gonna do it lets see if you can do it etc dramatizations on cchs are closely connected to oppterms and terminals but nothing can be read out of it the worst the pc is sitting in will discharge because circuit is unable to 1681 duplicate 2 have or 3 be controlled so giving someone control communication and havingness inevitably gets them into 3dxx items that are banging in and out usually there will be one major circuit that tries to discharge via the pcs dramatization the circuit he is sitting in cchs knock out the notis on masses he is sitting in and he will see them for the first time weird things show up from the vanishment of the notis heavy masses he has never had before somatics he hasnt felt etc he will move on the track in the valence he is in to more comfortable position cchs knock out notis you get an is the phenomena you see with the pc is the valence the phenomena that occur around the pc is the oppterm cchs also familiarize the pc with phenomena that he will encounter later on in 3dxx sensation that which is produced by reason of other beingness and dislocations of space pain alteration of form pain is produced by direct contact between the thetan and an identity pain is heat cold electrical shock combined the pc is always more directly connected with the terminal than the oppterm and thus feels pain he must be touching the mass with the idea that he is it in order to feel pain one of the biggest mistakes someone can make is to regard his body as self 6204c03 shspec131 the overtmotivator sequence the solution to what you do with 3dxx items is the resolution of what makes the overtmotivator sequence there are processes that undo the overtmotivator sequence for long time lrh has wanted to undo it instead of running it knowing that it is junior sequence how could you live if you had to get motivator for every overt it is evidently very junior idea invented to prevent people from attacking if the only thing that ever affected anybody was himself ultimately one would have perfect alibi one would never do anything to anyone anyplace lrh knew the overtmotivator sequence was limited but he couldnt find the entrance point he must have tried 1500 to 2000 combinations trying to blow the thing as itself if you are the only one that affects you numerous things apply for one thing you wouldnt be able to keep the same time track as others so there is something wrong with the overtmotivator sequence but at the same time everybody has fallen for it and can be processed the overtmotivator sequence runs nicely when handled as mechanism to prevent people from attacking one process you could use is what shouldnt _______ attack what shouldnt you attack or synonyms for attack it could also be varied with couldcouldnt and havehavent if you got someone who was sitting in bunch of overts and motivators to list what they shouldnt attack you might get somewhere that was the leadin on the research level not wanting to be attacked one tells others that they shouldnt attack you and what they shouldnt attack they do the same to you so eventually it looks like you have an overtmotivator sequence the most sensible thing in the world is that there are things which you in human body shouldnt attack the physical universe teaches the lesson that if you attack these things you get hurt this is basic learningness and it underlies all the overtmotivator phenomena when you attack mest you lose havingness then having learned not to kick paving blocks you have learned that what you do to others will happen to you this is actually not true at all it is merely philosophical extrapolation it goes back to newtons second law inertia which is physical universe law withhold is basically nothing more than your unwillingness to attack or to be attacked you could take any withhold person has and run off who shouldnt attack you about that or what shouldnt you attack in that way and the withhold will evaporate lrh never learned not to attack people have tried to teach him but they have failed he was once looking to see what on the track he felt worst about doing it looked for awhile as though doing anything to anybodys mind was the most destructive thing you could do there was some sense and 169workability to this but it proved not to be true it was the attacking of energy involved that seemed bad it is not even bad to attack energy its just that people have tried to convince each other that it is so you become allergic to energy the definition of being good is the same as the definition of being overwhelmed every fighting man lrh ever had under him was always in bad with other people at time when they needed fighting men the shore patrol only liked the people who werent worth damn of 100 men six or seven would be totally able competent active fireballs it bugged lrh that these were the guys who were always in trouble there would be dozens of nice guys who got commendations and bonuses but who were ineffective in action the world has built up series of superstitions about people the animal psychologists textbooks are full of them the mirage of oughttobe the message is beware of anybody who is active the civil defense manuals of the us government in the section on psychology has provisions to nab and put away anyone who gets active and tries to do something about the situation the civil defense system is based on the idea that there is thing called government that is composed of people they are going to take over the country in case of attack at the moment of attack one is supposed to do anything but be taken over by the government as early as 1941 lrh noticed that war is the antithesis of organization in combat it breaks down to the being the man on the job not the wellorganized machinery which actually is just men anyway if you are going to organize organize for chaos and count on the individual not some great third dynamic shadow individuals are quite destructable in areas of disaster so plans fall apart for this reason in space opera societies there were indestructable dolls incidently in planning something pin your schedule to event not to the clock all the systems are geared to good people there is supposed to be some great reservoir of good people to draw on but where is it these people are supposed to appear and make everything go right then in case of attack they are supposed to stop anyone who isnt wearing their magic badge from directing or organizing people the people who handled civil defense in various war areas in chaos conditions arent even in the civil defense organization all you have got ultimately is being not punchtape card systems not magical creatures the individual is the building block they are either competent or not when an individual ceases to be able to run his own life you can always have some group idiocy like communism which takes responsibility for conduct out of the hands of the individual and give it to some godhelpus monster one way they think they will create the reservoir of good people who will then tell everyone what to do is to use selective breeding etc the basis of the individual is his ability to observe to make decisions and to act he has to be able to inspect and know what he is looking at and where he is looking he must be able to make sensible summary of it and be able to act in accordance with what he has inspected this is true of student soldier or anybody if any of the above abilities are missing you will get bad result in making anything from perfect government to more livable world the basic building block you are working with is always and only the individual then the question arises is he competent or incompetent can he do his job if someone cannot observe and make decisions about what he has observed he is in bad way you will never have workable utopia unless you have individuals who can observe decide and act if you go in the direction of system that isnt designed to make individuals it is system which will fail it will end in slavery and denial to the individual of the right to observe decide and act the only system that is justified is one which pushes people in the direction of observation decision and acting the reason for the form of the org is to create agreement amongst its members one odd thing about scientology organizations is that as people get their cases better together the organizations get more able to act on their own and at the same time to be more in concert to the degree that individuals can observe decide and act systems are unnecessary if we have systems that depend utterly on making people good without inspection or decision but only on some nowimsupposedto automaticities the systems will fail such system is only 170achieved by overwhelming person with energy showing him that he will get into more action than he can stand if he does not concur with the right actingness the message is we can create more actingness and energy than you can so therefore you better get into this small actingness it is the outcreate of action that brings about the fixed actingness that is known as being good you can thereby snarl people into line system only works in the direction of consulting peoples observation of things but the world operates on the basis of things like faith and discipline people fixate on the good action when the alternative is confronting some supposedly unconfrontable action when you have totally disciplined nation you have total failure this is the route to decadence people observe less and less this is how civilizations decay and become old and decadent such society can be overwhelmed by any hostile energy mass that shows up since its people have been trained not to confront energy masses it gets licked up by any chaos the way an individual ages and dies is to give up his power of observation and decision and to act on the basis of not being able to do as much as he used to be able to do or to stand as much as he used to be able to stand he attributes this to advancing age not to being able to stand less the source of advancing age is being able to stand less aging is caused by lessening ability to confront action it is not that the individual cant confront as much action he ages because he believes he cant confront as much action the concern of an individual with action is 1 coaction 2 attacking energy or 3 being attacked by energy an individual is first as big as the universe and then he selects out half of it to fight and so becomes half the size of the universe and then selects out half of the remaining universe to fight and so becomes one fourth the size of the universe and then selects nut half of the remainder to fight and so becomes one eighth the size of the universe and i could go on and enumerate these steps but why should i when here you are your size in relation the universe is directly determined by only one thing the amount of randomity you can confront or the amount of attack you think you are subjected to or care to subject the universe to this determines thetan size it is how much you feel you can take on or how much you feel may take you on this is the mathematics of civilization say we have 100000 people at first one says i can take on any one or more of you who messes up they all feel like that at first then one day someone gets hurt and cant fight so he and some other weaklings invent justice justice says that when one person errs everyone else in the society is banded together against him as the government so its one person versus the government representing some tens of millions of people civilization is rigged in this way the thetan conceives this to be toomanyness so he is overwhelmed and obeys the law of the realm when you get old and creaky you subscribe to the idea of justice honest force is better then collective myth lrhs method of justice is not based on this will of the people it is based on his own preference for peace and order all goodness is brought about by force never by philosophic persuasion action based on observation and decision is fine action based on police threat threats from parents etc is something else true civilization would be based on observation the oddity is that man is basically good he gets synthetic bad valence that he can get into and then be bad every 3dxx item is either live that you have lived or your idea of somebody else the oppterms there isnt actually any somebody else in the bank all that is wrong with man is his imprisonment in evil but the evil is false we tell fellow that he is evil and convince him that he shouldnt attack because everything else is good this can be put as karma whatever you have done will be revisited upon you you will pay for everything you have ever done this isnt quite the same as the overtmotivator sequence which is the rule that you have to lay 171yourself open to feeling bad about something to motivator by the commission of an overt that rule holds but only because there is an area you have conceived you mustnt attack the reason the wall is stably there for you and can trap you is that somewhere down deep you consider it sacred you have certain sacred valences they mustnt be attacked you have convinced everybody that they mustnt be attacked people get upset when you attack temple priestess or sacred cow actually however all mechanisms of slavery should be attacked the toughest valences in 3dxx are also mechanisms to prevent you from being attacked as you know you would be if your deed were known the idea is to have good nonattackable beingness the only catch is that we fall from the other nonattackable beingnesses around us the basic mechanism of getting people not to attack is to show them that attacking will hurt them that is the whole lesson they teach in war if the mest universe is still here it must be that we consider that it shouldnt be attacked otherwise it would have been asised and that is also why it can hurt you when you attack it sometimes it attacks and hurts you even when you havent attacked it eg when you are hit by lightning or cliff falls on you having learned the lesson that one will harm oneself if one attacks we get the overtmotivator sequence if you teach enough people this you will have civilization but they will all be enslaved they will all be trapped and none of them will be able to observe clearly or decide clearly or to act decisively sooner or later they will all go crazy that is really all that is wrong with the human mind the only real penalty of attack is that if you attack something it will disappear there is liability actually in attacking anything but there is tremendous liability in not attacking overt attack as opposed to uncontrolled attack left on automatic doesnt do anything except get rid of havingness if it was undesired havingness what is the difference 6204c05 shspec128 the sacredness of cases pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism why is your case sacred if it is sacred dont attack preserve protect survive now we understand theetieweetie case to theetieweetie case everything is sacred his attitude is mustnt attack it mustnt be attacked must protect preserve survive this attitude especially applies to his case that is the only reason anyone ever has for results in processing the secret of this universe is that it is sacred universe and shouldnt be attacked it is too sacred this puts every poor thetan who comes into it on shouldnt attack which has the result of putting attack on automatic there are three states of mind 1 pandeterminism one can control or attack or whatever one chooses on ones own choice on either side of the situation this gets into bad repute when it is confused with shady control 2 selfdeterminism this carries with it the idea that the otherside of the group or situation is bad 3 otherdeterminism this nuts he is never for himself he is always for the other guy in any argument he is reasonable he will defend whatever you attack he claims to be impartial but he is not he is for whatever you are against all kinds of conflicts arise with pandeterminism over how you will continue it people generally dont continue it but slop off into selfdeterminism politics is based on the inability to choose successor benevolent monarchy is ideal for example except for that problem any form of politics is only necessary because you cannot guarantee that good successor will follow benevolent monarch so existing forms of government are all out of pt in the future good king would be pandetermined but people cant guarantee that if he died they would get another one so they have to become specialists or fascists or whatever when government cant guarantee that you wont get choice of government by civil war you have an unstable government this is what sank the roman empire for the next thirteen hundred years you 172got the divine right of kings lineal succession etc this all resulted from the failure of the roman republic this is essentially asking the ge to take over the rule otherdeterminism is hard to see because it is lower scale mockery of pandeterminism this person is never selfdetermined always otherdetermined such person is not for himself if everybody is against you then you must be against you also otherwise you are out of agreement with the whole universe this is the first level of case that will give you trouble since he is not for himself being appealed to to run out his engrams to benefit himself wont have any effect all cases at various parts of the track get stuck in one of these phases periods of illness demonstrate this phenomenon people who are under heavy attack or heavy responsibility can get into it easily leader in war gets otherdetermined partly because of overts committed during the war the state of mind can differ for different areas of life and different activities only in the area where person is consistently otherdetermined do you have persistent somatic he is attacking himself so he can have somatic when we get to the point where the whole individual is pandetermined selfdetermined or other determined we have chronic states of sanity 3dxx terminal can be in one of several different states 1 pandetermined you wont find it because it will never have hung up 2 selfdetermined it will be somewhat troublesome and part of gpm 3 otherdetermined it will nearly whip you because you can never help the pc in the vicinity of the otherdetermined valence people are most likely to keep and protect otherdetermined valences that are totally against their best interests it is difficult to move person on the track near one of these because every time you hit them they survive and the pc doesnt the pc is always the loser the pc will get very reasonable about the terminal he appears pandetermined and helpful but he is actually being otherdetermined it doesnt stop there when you get into that area the terminal will attack the pc this accounts for the selfdestructive impulse in man death wish as in freud the world operates on the idea that everyone else is on kick of selfpreservation but they are not some are on succumb to an auditor or organization they look to be executioners we only get in trouble when we refuse to fill the complementary role the thing to do when someone goes around slandering the organization is not to sue him for slander but to present him with confession and an award of damages for having slandered all legally drawn up present it to him and he will go ahead and sign it and you can execute it in court the guy has only one enemy himself if you keep worsening the deal in legal matters he will eventually settle up in auditing dont make the prepcheck questions easier make them tougher since the pc will only buy things that make them think they are bad succumbing person in this state will make things worse than is actually true he will admit to more things than he has actually done when prepchecked this is the best stuff to audit since he is nuttiest where he is other determined he is also hard to audit insofar as he is trying to succumb he will convert whatever you give him in the way of help into motivator otherdeterminism is successful sacredity an otherdetermined person has agreed 100 that certain valence or identity is something that shouldnt be attacked otherdetermined valences have as their least common denominator shouldnt attack and must be preserved if you wanted to be perfectly safe in this society what would you be your answer is sacredness item anything that you cant attack becomes an otherdeterminism never selfdeterminism to some degree all 3dxx items are otherdeterminisms and the whole gpm itself is an other determinism that is seeking to destroy the person who has got it sacredity is trap if you operate on the principle of dont speak evil of the dead dont attack the dead you are essentially saying dont asis the dead and what you get is bank stacked up with the dead when you operate on the principle dont be mean to communicate with the sick you get sick this is the result of the idea 173that sickness is sacred anything sacred is safe and mustnt be attacked it is very attractive to become such thing and thetans do valence is sacredity shouldnt attack shouldnt really look at shouldnt comm with therefore you get more and more otherdeterminism the most sacred of all the pcs items will be the one of highest otherdeterminism and the one that is most destructive of the pcs own self determinism if it cant be attacked it cant be controlled or reached havingness it cant be communicated with or defeated so it will completely determine the pc it will overwhelm him it is dangerous it is sacred so that is the key to the gpm the person is it while it destroys him it slaps the guy back with somatics every time he puts his head up or tries to be anything other than this otherdetermined valence 6204c05 shspec129 asisness people who can and cant asis things that wont asis include 1 things you dont know about 2 things you cant communicate with and that cant communicate with you 3 things that are not asised because there is nothing there to do any asising an operating ge doesnt asis things so any mechanism that makes nothing out of the thetan is non asisable thetan is nothing only in regard to mest attributes it still has abilities if you had something that made nothing of the thetans ability to look create do cause etc there would be reverse notis where instead of the person notising the item the item notises the the person that of course is the most dangerous valence religions often have campaigns to get rid of all the evil spirits earlier religions often admit the existence of nonmalignant beings spirits like leprechauns etc when religion has been totally successful it manifests itself in society where the spirit is totally unknown and there are spirits beware of that society it is pretty far south it is total overwhelm of you the thetan the soul is something you take care of an otherdeterminism which you send off at your demise to some pieinthesky sanitarium how is this manifested in our present world take the exact science of physics for example the first fundamental of elementary physics is the conservation of energy and mass this is very reasonable we cannot destroy or create energy and mass is really energy the question is how can you have an expanding universe with constant amount of energy why is there conservation of space wonder physicists go nuts they are dealing with something they can neither create nor destroy so it is sacred however you are likely to find times on the backtrack when you violated the conservation of energy if you cant do anything to energy time becomes inexorable time is postulate it is not monitored by the change in space of particles but one becomes aware of time through change of space of particles the physicist is actually just priest gone mad he discovers that the principles he has sworn to conservation of energy etc are bit shaky so he gets to be like boy whistling past graveyard this happens when he studies nuclear physics now he is trying to maintain one set of principles while experimenting with contradictory set so it is wonder that nuclear bombs are the main threat to civilization the first thing fellow who is in the condition the physicist is in would do is to destroy himself he is asking for an executioner we hear of the dedication of science which means all for science nothing for individual should have right to his own inventions patents belong to the university or corporation the scientist will accuse the scientologist of maintaining secrecy person in that condition is defending the sacredness the unreachability of the mind he thinks that there is nothing there to do the asising therefore those valences which you have the most trouble running out are those which deny the existence of the thetan because then there is one there to asis the valence the least asising situation is that of being an object 174when you look over items to run the emeter will indicate not the toughest to asis but the easiest after it is run and the individual has increased his own beingness to the extent of not being what you have just run out now he can be assessed again and become aware that he is not quite the nothing there valence it didnt read before but now it will register lots of vegetables and flowers read on the meter the more endurance there is in the plant the mestier it is the less it will register the greater the effort to survive something has the mestier it is tomatoes read more than trees so in the early stages of sorting out 3dxx you will get reaction on those things that should be run the pc is in the condition of notknow about them they are there but he isnt there this adds up to total overwhelm when you start differentiating items and nulling items the pc starts feeling that there is some beingness to them you at least have the pc in pt exterior enough to say yes somewhere on the track there is whizzer up to then he couldnt say whizzer was on the track because he was whizzer without being there at all until then all you had was whizzer not thetan plus whizzer or inspecting whizzer so assessing and differentiating these items leaves person more and more able to inspect and lessens his identification with mest because all these valences are composed of matter energy space and time and trapped postulates ie gpms have trapped postulates in them the person doesnt see himself come out of them he sees the ideas come alive so 3dxx is gradient scale of bailing someone nut the items which the pc cant asis are the ones where there is nothing to asis them with he is just in them but not there in them they just are and look to him like packages of mest when he first looks at them when you first encounter them he is that mest so your approach could be to notice doingness he has and to list who or what would oppose that from this he will get some item which he sees as an actual identity off his own past track you can find what opposed that continually getting him more and more able to observe these identities hence more and more aware of self so he can asis more that is why 3dxx gives constant gain if you are not getting ta action during listing on 3dxx you are not there and they are not there enough to have you there so nothing is asising at this point you can use cchs then the beingness of auditor and pc appear and there can be observation of an identity there is an extreme gradient of case state south 1 picking up future items 2 picking up pt items cchs cut in here 3 picking up present life items north 4 picking up past life items cchs cut the person in on this scale at pt with the identities of the auditor and the pc the pc gets higher and higher ability to differentiate between himself and the auditor op pro by dup run long enough gets the pc out of the body and able to observe the body doing the process op pro by dup shows the pc forcefully that he is not an it exteriorization by some more sudden process can shock him he will go back in into some other valence or something blowing him out of his head on an otherdeterminism is very unstable if you exteriorize someone on your determinism he wont remember it or he will invalidate it because he cant have not being thing 3dxx is an exteriorization process with very gentle gradient the last item to come off is the most sacred the one which was him it is not something that can be in any way characterized described it is just how does person get so interiorized he asserts that an identity or an object will react that is the clue to all future interiorization this is the first gradient on the overt motivator sequence if you do something this paper will react then it will do something to you 1756204c17 shspec132 auditing the best frame of mind for an auditor to have is one of calm competence and an intention to go on and do his job this gives the pc certainty that the auditor will go on and be effective this gives the auditor altitude the processes we are counting on today are cchs and 3dxx they take case all the way south and auditors can apply these processes well the first test of process is can an auditor other than ron do it an auditor can do any process that does not require of him more adjudication than can be given him by an emeter if you ask him for further judgment some will be able to do it but the majority will not auditing the cchs requires that an auditor be able to observe constancy or change instructors must make sure that students learn how to do this an auditor can be taught to list and to read meter against list what requires is instruction of precise nature there is only one right way to do cchs to list and to null given high level of competence in these spheres dissemination will proceed by leaps and bounds you can do these drills in the absence of complete understanding of them though it is better to have understanding to avoid introducing unnecessary ritual fortunately we know why these processes work youve also got to be able to prepcheck so you can audit an arc breaky pc who is madly withholding from you the least common denominator of ruds is withholds and the least common denominator of withholds is missed sometimes you have to find them to get things moving again to get ta action etc all of freuds work and all of the work of faculty psychology is wrapped up in prepchecking with prepchecking you can find and eradicate childhood traumas we have also wrapped up the work of freuds squirrels jung adler etc pavlov wrote four hundred page manuscript for stalin on how his data on animals could be applied to humans this has never been brought to light abroad communism used it to fixate attention on the third dynamic to the exclusion of all others capitalism capitalism lets you have what youve got if they cant get it away from you socialism socialism lets you have half of what you already own communism communism doesnt let you have anything that you own this is total games condition between the individual and the state early faculty psychology tried to relieve people of things from pavlov on psychology has tried to do things to people therefore pavlovian conditioning would have to be undone with cchs since it is an effort to do things to people rather than to alleviate things in people details on difficulties with prepchecking lrh states that he is taking it out of the lineup on sane case on cchs if you ever have any trouble getting them to do the actions their ruds are very probably out prepchecking missed withholds will get them in you could approach it by doing white farm and getting off the withholds that all she reading terminals have missed 6204c17 shspec133 how and why auditing works the twopole nature of the universe has to do with why auditing works there is mathematics connected with it developed by buckminster fuller dimaxian geometry this proves that the universe could not exist without two poles the lowest level of observation is being something at this level you cannot see something because you are being it know thyself has been introduced as trap for thetans the only way you could know yourself seemingly would be to view yourself but then how could you be yourself the very definition of observation appears to involve the communication formula duplication but how can you duplicate something without an intervening space between the thing and its duplicate unless 176you are asising the thing so unless observation is asising it must involve space and therefore separateness the gpm contains in it anything you need to know about the nature of problems problems are balanced forces in opposition hung up in time world war i for instance in gpm the intentions of one kind of beingness oppose the intentions of another type of beingness exactly equally if two sides of problem are not equal they dont hang up because one side overwhelms the other this is rare situation hence the fewness of items person has been many more beings than are in the gpm the gpm stays with person because of the balanced timeless quality of it there is also free track which can contain engrams that can be run out the gpm is the unfree track it is really quite unlikely that two valences would balance like that they would tend to get unbalanced or wear out but gpms are stuck in pt each gpm has lots of minds in it each with an accumulation of locks if each valence had two hundred lock items and gpm had say twenty packages in it you would have four thousand minds in the gpm the locks can be just as effective as the items themselves the lot of it plus the free track on both sides is the reactive mind running free track unravels lot but never quits explains everything packages composed of terminal and oppterm tend to lock up the rest of the track other things collide with them right in the middle you have the waterbuck and the tiger adjacent is the priest and the vestal virgin then there is god and the devil all these oppositions each pair perfectly balanced accumulate to themselves other identities that are hanging around and you get collapsed track these are represented in the bank by spherical masses inside each spherical mass there are compartments of thought because the person usually had head in which he did his thinking so the gpm tends to approximate head with thinkthinkthink in the middle of it and it is usually empty all through the gpm there are little compartments with ideas in them so you get trapped thought ideas enclosed by force these can be dramatized when spherical shapes are counterposed against other spherical shapes these things are hung up one against the other to such degree that neither one can go away this is the final material form the gpm takes all this comes down to fixated attention concentration upon the oppterm electronically power can be generated until you have two poles fixed in separate positions in space the mind is composed of energy which exists in space and condenses down to masses in the reactive mind there is time all time is now we must assume that if we have flows electrical masses current standing waves etc there must be two poles involved otherwise there would be flows people would never have somatics this has lot to do with cchs auditing is effective only in the presence of at least two poles this doesnt mean you cant ever selfaudit but it does mean that when you do it effectively you have two poles the pc who never cognites is bugaboo to auditors he is running on one pole pole that has thought in the middle of it and standing energy waves outside of it he is in the thought area and he keeps running through the energy when he has ideas they are the ones packaged in that thought zone he is being that mass not viewing it he is not viewing another mass either he is also not viewing the auditor he is being something and observing nothing only if he can observe other things will he make gains because then he has another role if he is just being that one thing he will be unable to change it would be ok if he could view something like glass there he would have two poles he could asis the cigarette lighter in this situation you would get tons arm action also in session if you can get the pc to look at the auditor you have twopole situation if that isnt happening you get change on cchs on 3dxx you will get ta action as long as the pc can look at the masses in his mind giving at least two poles there are two ways cchs could be run 1771 dummox style the auditor makes the machinery work to do the process this will still produce results in 500hours or so 2 right style get the pcs attention on the auditor and the environment by maintaining 2wc with the pc you handle the pcs attention towards his mind by taking every twitch as an origin this gets him to look at what he is doing and exteriorizes him from it then you can get change because he is looking at what he has teen and done and isnt still being it it is good idea to key out as many masses as you can before starting 3dxx you want to key out looks inverted loops etc you dont want to mess around with this in 3dxx otherwise he is always dramatizing these locks and has ptps when the pc is listing items he has been every one of those items or raised hell with them in getting him to list you have made him exteriorize to some degree from say five hundred identities the one the pc is being in pt does not discharge because he is being it if he wasnt in it it would discharge and quit reading this is the one that hangs up in time the hardest the oppterm is what he is concentrated on now you have twopole situation right there in the bank and the two will start to discharge the thing that makes the gpm hard to tie down and makes 3dxx sometimes hard to do is that he is obsessively being the internal items and sometimes so slightly being the initial ones you find that sometimes the terminal and the oppterm are widely separated in the gpm early on commonly you get terminal and plausible oppterm only there are twelve items between before they meet each other when they dont hit square on the nose and go poof you have intervening packages the pc has noknowingness of his beingness he may think that he is being man but actually he is being waterbuck andor tiger ask joe why he is biting his fingernails hell say oh am i he never thinks to ask himself who or what would bite fingernails it is probably to scratch out waterbucks eyes person starts worrying about himselves well he has to step back and look all processes are exteriorization processes just exteriorize the pc from different things cchs make pt comfortable enough so the pc can exteriorize from various parts of the past in which he has been sitting for trillenia cchs dont go all the way but the pc sure feels like they do all the way up from cchs to 3dxx you have twopole situation first with the pc as an object then on up to the pc being being stepping back to look at mass on routine 1 we were exteriorizing somatic the pc exteriorized as mass 3dxx exteriorizes people out of past identities the pc hasnt even been in his head for an incalculable period of time if you run cchs smoothly and correctly the pc can asis old facsimiles and come gradiently out of old bits and pieces of the past he goes through sequence of exteriorizations it shifts the bank and the pc feels better about pt when we have him as close to pt as possible he should move on to 3dxx he will come out of masses as mass duplicating those identities ta action comes from the pc looking at something whether or not he is being something else feelingness is lowerscale substitute far lookingness touchyfeelies work for that reason knowing this you could invent some new cchs but these would only be as good as they cause twopole situation to exist in the session you must keep directing the pcs attention to his bank or else he will never come out of the bank for any think process to work the pc has to be one mass in his mind looking at another mass in his mind when you have that you can have ta in the cchs the auditor and the environment act as the other pole if the auditor audits cchs like steam engine they will work even then but more slowly than when the auditor makes pt ok to the pc on cchs you must 1 keep pt attractive to the pc 2 do them precisely 3 keep in 2wc 4 keep the pcs attention on what is happening with his somatics if you do these things the pc will just sail on the cchs they are not slow process they are very fast process 178an instant before somatic turns on the pc is being it then when he feels it he is exterior from it so you are setting up twopole situation in the bank by getting the pc to exteriorize sufficiently to stop being the somatic and to see it in 3dxx you are finding out what the pc has been and when he sees it he ceases to be it 3dxx exteriorizes the pc from the past identities he has been and does this in assessing very fast it is like telephone poles flying past he has been in every one of the items he gives you you can actually thus kick pc out of his bank you will only get ta action as long as the pc is looking at something or at least feeling something ta action twopole situation you are doing something wrong 6204c19 shspec134 gross auditing errors if few sessions go by with ta action one should assume that something very gross is going on the oddity of scientology is that the textbook solution works unlike any other field or previous practice in practically every other subject the guy on the job is meeting up with situations that arent covered in the textbook rut in scientology it is when you depart from the textbook solution that you get in trouble this flies in the teeth of all ones past experience so you tend to approach the solution with little variation and deviation every pc is individual and all his originations are different from every other individuals but what the auditor does is always the same if the auditor departs from the textbook solutions he is asking for trouble auditing takes imagination to speak of unusual solutions just good ability to communicate the best of auditors goof at times the commonest mistake is not realizing that when the pc has said it it is blown and taking up all the pcs answers or origins for further discussion such auditors underestimate the power of 2wc the auditor should assume especially in ruds that it has blown until he tests it on the meter and finds differently he should acknowledge well what the pc says because that is part of the blow mechanism if the auditor goes on to take it up it keys the pc in again when you acknowledge it look pleased and relieved that it is all handled if it still reads give it only as much time and attention as is needed to slip it out of the way using same brushoff process if you are unlucky enough not to have the process work you must have been doing something else by giving flawless session the auditor can hold the ruds in anyone can make goofs but they shouldnt be frequent since we want the pc to be confident confidence is result of auditor consistency ruds on the environment will stay in if the auditor is consistent about the auditing environment the pcs confidence drops when you q and or act inconsistently the result is difficulty of keeping ruds in ie lack of consistency leads to lack of confidence leads to ruds going nut pc notices the care that is taken with him this aids in building his confidence he gets unconfident if each session is full of surprises and the auditor keeps changing things around if you keep having to use middle ruds it is probably something you did during the session even very nervous pc can gradually come to realize that the auditor wont permit anything to happen to him during the session he will permit the auditor to be responsible for the environment checking on those pcs who were getting ta disclosed the fact that while ta doesnt necessarily take place just because ruds are in if rudiments are out ta will not take place this means that ta is proportional to the degree ruds are in not to the state of the case that is monitored by what is being run on the case to be sure so the truth of it depends on the fact that the right process is being run 6204c19 shspec135 determining what to run details about currently used processes especially prepchecking and 3dxx the rock is the first thing the pc had been ta drifts during session dont count as ta motion eg on problems intensive that you are doing to see whether the ta moves with new pc if the ta is generally between 475 and 50 that is not ta motion to speak of motion is what happens in twenty minutes and it is up and down 179the way to get ta when the pc doesnt have much is optimally to alternate cchs and prepchecking good cchs and good prepchecking will be real winner but even indifferent cchs and prepchecking will be winner they should be done in different sessions person who cant asis things because he is being it all wont asis much on either cchs or prepchecking but there will be small effect note that the ta he gets while talking to you isnt adjudicative it is the ta he gets while thinking that counts if he doesnt get adequate ta during subjective processes you will know that it will be difficult to get and keep ruds in on him so he needs cchs and prepchecks to keep his ruds in if cchs turn into wrestling match the auditor has missed withhold finish up the session next session prepcheck with the zero question has withhold been missed clean it up if you can do it in not more than three sessions if it is that sticky he is having trouble asising but he will have gotten some missed withholds off so cchs can operate again when they are fairly flat go back to prepchecking etc if in doubt when to switch over go by the auditors code 13 auditors code of 1954 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer see the creation of human ability p 3 and run the process to nochange or switch over when you have gotten gain on cchs or on the prepcheck whichever you are doing the goal you have is to get the rudiments in because then you will get ta the pc has outruds in life continually if you could get rid of all the bad feelings he has about his environment and people you would have done more than any earlier therapy he would also be able to be in session with pc who is getting ta you will bring up his external ruds with cchs and his internal think ruds with prepchecking the combination of the two acts as an introvertextrovert action havingness goes down on think processes and is remedied on cchs you should realize that the longer it takes you to get an item an overt or whatever the longer it takes to accomplish something with auditing the harder it gets because length drifts in the direction of auditing an item per month is far less auditing than an item per week the longer it takes the more ruds go out and the more violently they go out the less chance you have of getting the item ruds are the most out on the least auditing they can go further out in auditing than they ever do in life this gives another reason for auditing in the direction of wins for the pc pcs at first set very largeeffect session goals despite the fact that they can have only very minor effects the win has to be real to the pc for him to know that he has had one so it has to be consistent with where he is on the effect scale if you keep giving him effects you know he can have he will come up by little gradients the worse off he is the longer it will take to get win alternating cchs and prepchecking gives good chance for him to start getting wins he will then start getting ta as he gets confident in his auditor and feels safer in the session environment he will start looking around as he realizes that he doesnt have to be all the things he is being in order to survive he can look at one of them out of eight million things he is being you will then get some ta prepchecking had the virtue as training process of giving pcs wins at the same time as it was giving the auditor lots of familiarity with the emeter if the pc fell apart on 3dxx if he got all messed up and outruds he could be put back on cchs and prepchecking routine 6204c26 shspec138 professional attitude rundown on prepchecking there are several things that monitor the success of auditing one of these is professional attitude the substance of the professional attitude is that someone is here to be healed and the auditor is going to heal him regardless of the pcs politics religion or pace etc the auditor is professional who is healing beings who need healing it doesnt matter who the pc is this is very hardboiled attitude actually an auditor is as good as he can assume professional attitude towards the pc in front of him regardless of any personal opinions or the pcs opinions creed etc that attitude alone has brought the healing professions along through the trillenia 180there are splinter groups of healers who may be far more effective than medical doctors but who dont have professional code of conduct these practitioners are far less well respected because they are not that professional or they havent created belief in the public that they have professional attitude this is also why husbandwife teams dont audit each other well there is too much personal concern and too little professional attitude as an auditor you will have terrific wins when you realize that case is case matter what the pcs body looks like and when you audit with professional attitude having professional attitude is also necessary because failure to do so will get in the way of your processing results push it home and stand by it where the public is concerned and you will inherit the world of healing where other splinter groups have not this doesnt necessarily mean having particular mockup or appearance it just means that anyone who comes for processing gets audited as himself dont process anyone because of anything just process him this will become very comfortable attitude to have in session one with additives or personal quirks it will result in public trust you had also better not be an auditor after the session or the pc will tend to continue to be in session after the session is supposed to be over act like an auditor during the session not before or after the public demands only that they be treated by someone who is interested in them if you always do good job both technically and professionally you will be in good shape technical perfection itself is very impressive prepchecking is harder to do than routine 3 processes it is the first test of whether an auditor knows his business furthermore if you cant do good job prepchecking you will never do good job on routine 3 there will always be something missing dont ever decide what should read and what shouldnt observe prepchecking gets the pc in session and frees up his attention so he can be audited it can also give fantastic changes and gains if run searchingly as total psychotherapy of this lifetime it completes the work of freud and any cathartictype therapy it is therefore very comprehensible to the public it could he used to help someone clean up some troublesome area if you expect too much of prepchecking however you will have some loses the basic thing that has been going wrong in running routine 3 is that the auditor doing the process was also trying to do sec check or ruds session trying to mate an eagle with shark this also accounts for the fact that people couldnt find goals because the ruds were out you cant combine sec checking or prepchecking session with routine 3 session but green auditor will try if the auditor starts to give one sort of session but finds he has to go on to another sort of session he gets the impression of loss of control of the pc if keeping the pcs ruds in is that big problem he shouldnt be doing routine 3 processes he should be on cchs prepchecks also get him used to being model sessioned and get him so that he will stay in session you will have enough difficulty with routine 3 without adding the difficulty of prepchecking at the same time the whole reason routine 3 kept being varied and moved around was that the ruds kept going nut on people and they werent able to find items prepchecking is the remedy for that it sets the pc up so that when you list you can just list and find goals terminals and oppterms it is luckily also very interesting to the pc from the viewpoint of auditor training routine 3 processes are too hard on case to be done wrong they cant safely be used as training activity prepchecking though it is harder and has the liability that you can miss withholds with devastating results is better training activity the theetieweetie case walks around with the idea that everybody should know all the time this is the perpetual missed withhold case he is in bad shape whenever you ask him question you get missed withhold because you should have known the answer if you ask three questions you miss three withholds he thinks everyone should know everything he is thinking so there is mass of continuous missed withholds prepchecking will handle it as keyout on 3dxx you will come up with an item like swami and then the circuit ceases but these cases are hell to prepcheck because they think you must know if they know so they dont have any withholds they have never done anything you have to know this phenomenon so you can straighten it all out that is the hard case to prepcheck not the sinner 181prepchecking is not easy but it is very precise and must be done very professionally since your personal reaction and personal interest interjected into the session ruins the pcs willingness td get off real overts he will only give up safe withholds if you have anything but calm professional attitude it is also necessary to keep missed withholds cleaned up particularly if he gets misemotional on you auditors have terrible time getting this through their heads and just pulling the missed withhold prepchecking is easy to do if it is done right it makes doing routine 3 ridiculously easy by comparison also 6205c01 shspec140 missed withholds see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for summary of this lecture the toughest thing to do is to get the auditor to ask simple question have i missed withhold on you its utterly wild there is even case of someone letting someone die rather then saying it there is even another way to say it is there something i should have found out about you auditors failure to do this makes lrh feel like he is on an involuntary withhold he feels like he is screaming in soundproof room people will actually let pc sit there yapping and screaming as though they the auditor had responsibility for what is going on when all they have to do is to ask for the missed withhold missed withholds cause lot of phenomena even gpms are caused by missed withholds it is almost as if the basic principle of existence is when existence is good thou hast not missed withhold and when existence is bad thou hath missed withhold missed withhold properly asked for the meter cleaned remedies each one of these things and many more 1 pc failing to make progress we know now that ptps stem from missed withholds and they stop progress 2 pc critical of or angry at the auditor nonwithholdy pc wont get angry at an auditor goof it doesnt matter whether the auditor was guilty as charged by the pc or not if the pc natters about it he has had withhold missed it is not what is known the thing he is nattering about that is wrong with the pc so you dropped his goals list into the spittoon so what if he says what the hell are you doing he has had withhold missed earlier in the session dont get reasonable about it complaints come from missed withholds get then pulled dont develop them dont follow them just pull them and get on with the session 3 pc refusing to talk to the auditor this happens fifteen to twenty minutes before the blow refusal to talk is simply the realization that one cant because one isnt being heard failing to acknowledge can stick the pc with an involuntary withhold that becomes missed you see this in prayer guy talking to god is talking to circuit if god is talking back sooner or later the circuit will blow and he will have fantastic missed withhold he will get angry at the catholic church or whatever when he suddenly gets answer to his communication one way to handle this is to acknowledge the living daylights out of the pc another is to ask if you have missed withhold 4 pc trying to leave session this is reverse flow of screaming at the auditor you create missed withhold with every failure to acknowledge pc originations or answers eventually the pc will scream at you if you refuse to receive communication from the pc you can create an arc break 5 any needle pattern if the needle is active regardless of what you are saying or even when you are not talking the pc has missed withhold all needle patterns are caused by missed withholds see 6202c15 shspec145 new trs p 240 below needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in 6 pc not desirous of being audited this applies to anybody not just pcs but how could you miss withhold on stranger when you havent even talked to him well you are the one who is supposed to know see p 184 above on what nonscientologist thinks knowledge is knowledge of his withholds so it is automatic if your presence is good enough you can get past all the argument and actually pull the withhold 1827 pc boiling off mechanically this is stuck flow but the reason for the stuck flow is missed withhold pc even going little fuzzy has missed withhold however minor it may be 8 pc exhausted this is caused by missed withhold as unlikely as it seems 9 pc feeling foggy at session end this is like boiloff you will get little nitpicky missed withholds like i wanted to take smoke break an hour ago and didnt mention it for this you can preface the missed withhold question with in this session 10 pcs havingness drops missed withhold is notreach isnt it thats havingness havingness comes up when missed withholds are cleaned up 11 pc criticising auditor to others here we are going out into life even if the auditor wasnt perceptive didnt acknowledge etc he has still missed his withholds we only learned this piece of tech fairly recently and by the way people studying scientology think that every time we come out with something new old things cease to be true eg they think the arc scale see scientology 0 8 pp 102 and 103 went out because we have just said that the effects scale exists this is not true 12 pc demanding redress of wrongs he is saying that you should audit him for free or some such thing it doesnt matter if everything he says is true the solution isnt to be found in court but in missed withholds you can ask what should the organization have found out about you to handle this 13 pc critical of organizations or people of scientology or of scientology these things can have enormous effects and yet be trivial even laudable in and of themselves say guy donates money to research foundation and finds out that it has been credited to his account instead the foundation has missed withhold on him right there he has tried to say something and it hasnt been acknowledged he has tried to communicate something and the communication has not occurred every question you dont answer becomes kissed withhold letter registrars should be aware of this the missed withhold comes from the they should know what im thinking they should have found out you can end an entheta campaign by sending detective around to investigate then they figure you know and the campaign stops because you have unmissed the withhold better out really find out what as going on and publish the truth believe it or not they wont attack you worse than before they will leave you alone the original attack wasnt based on your overts matter how many they may have been it was based only on the withholds missed by you 14 lack of auditing results this is cousin to 1 above progress handling this assists organizations immensely cleaning up missed withholds gives auditing results hence new pcs etc 15 dissemination failures what have i failed to find out about you handles this the trouble is that it is too simple so auditors miss it the missed withhold extends into virtually every other area of scientology tr4 the communication formula notknowingness ptps havingness etc shtvd4a prepchecking auditor lrh pc dorothy broaded demo tape 6205c02 shtvd4a prepchecking auditor lrh pc dorothy broaded demo tape shtvd4b above continued 6205c02 shtvd4b above continued 1836205c03 shspec142 craftsmanship fundamentals session missed withhold is anything the pc thought but didnt tell the auditor that is fins for the session but in prepchecking you want meat not skim milk you want meaningful acts it isnt necessarily antisocial or unmannerly acts like masturbation or nosepicking embarrassing acts that you are looking for what you are looking for is overts not just seamy withholds there is difference comments on the above tvd you can have chain based on notknowingness even if there is nothing there to be notknown this isnt common missed withhold of nothing you never give up on the fundamentals when the pc gets nattery he has missed withhold whether the natter has any basis in reason or not not many you audit by those you should get your own reality on this it can be crammed down your throat but it is better understanding since stable datum fixed in by confusion and not by understanding isnt available in tight spot this leads to auditing by being reasonable fundamentals are meant to be used if i tell you something is fundamental dont just believe it is find out if it is or is not in your own universe it will be but if you never find this out for yourself you will just keep going on by rote and ritual if you do find this out for yourself you will not need all your old stable data or superstitions what i expect of an auditor is to audit the pc that is right there in front of him by the most fundamental fundamentals that he can command and understand he will always get wins that way and he wont be in fog about any of it he will be able to evaluate importances in the ritual in prepchecking your what question will often miss the mark by bit because after all until you have done the prepcheck you dont know exactly what the chain is and if it is that unknown to the pc how could you know all about it before you found out from the pc besides all basic incidents must be unknown at least in part or the chain would blow auditing by fundamentals you know enough about the chain to formulate what question that will come close enough to get what you need as you go earlier you find yourself asking about similar things but not the exact same overt at the earlier time you get what question that describes the incident in workably general terms and go from there hoping for the best all you have to null is the incident that you got the what question from prepchecking is not an exact activity it depends on the pc in front of you because it is inexact you must do it in the framework of total exactitude that is given in model session trs metering all your fundamentals that must be known solidly when you have that you can play by ear with confidence and results any craftsman can create the illusion of terrific ease and offhandedness however the common denominator of all great art is great ability to do small detail if one tries to shortcut the ability to do the details and just does the offhanded action the result is slop an auditors tiny details consist of the meter trs model session etc how do you get to be superb auditor by knowing all these small parts perfectly if you find yourself wondering about any one of them you must practice drill to get it straightened out you can go over these items and ask yourself if any of them have been shaky in recent sessions and work on what you find dont let embarrassment stop you from finding out what needs to be worked on only when you have mastered the detail will you be free to audit the pc in front of you you wont be free to audit the pc in front of you as long as you are enslaved by dont knows among your auditing tools because you get chain of error that mounts in she session based on the basic not knowingness dont think that you will get results real honesttogod results if you are anything less than master of the craft that is the discouraging point of auditing the running of repetitive processes without attention on the pc hoping far the best does make lot of people well as does engram running this could get longtime auditors stuck in win but we havent had techniques prior to 1962 that reached all cases we have them now but they require precision auditing masters touch you have to find out that the technology we have does give the pc wins you find that out by auditing and seeing the 184results if you know all the parts trs metering model session etc then you can audit by fundamentals with confidence and ease there is more tension 6205c03 shspec143 prepchecking here is how to make prepchecking not work ignore the pc and omit the datum that it is easier for pc to confront think than mass gpm is thought chamber surrounded by mass the pc is perfectly happy to look at the thought chamber but doesnt like looking at the mass so he gets the thought first and confronts the mass an gradient this is why it is possible to get much deeper into the gpm with goal than with an item he can confront the goal because it is thought running routine3 we have the pc confront all the little masses the lock items first and then he will gradually get to where the goal starts showing up toward the end of the list the goal ticks because it is surrounded by mass then you list the item and it appears towards the end of the list you went into the gpm on the wings of thought and you follow through with the ugly burr and buzz of heat cold and lightning the somatics this is like taking jet plane to africa eventually you have to walk but in running routine 3dxx you travel by thought only short distance using the prehav scale take the first level that keeps banging from then on it is all mass listing items the pc does the same thing with his withholds and missed withholds pcs will confront any quantity of thought and ideas if the auditor doesnt push and shove the pc will go nowhere except on the wings of thought which dont really get the pc anyplace in 1956 lrh noticed that lots of think confront didnt change graph much it at all by 1959 he had determined that you had to be able to confront the mass to get anyplace the pc is working on secondhand thought anyway pulled out of locks in the gpm you will be fooled by such processes as rising scale processing in this process though the process is pure thoughtconfront if the pc made gains it is because he confronted some mass or changed position in the gpm every now and then you do get some results with confronting thought and because of your own willingness to go an confronting thought you buy it as good procedure but it is the rearrangement on mass that really produced the gain it is the same in prepchecking every now and then you will get good win by taking thought instead of deeds you have to get action to get masses to move the pc can add thinks to his case faster than you can pull them off in session there is doingness going on except thinking so it is fine to take thoughts as session missed withholds his thoughts in pt cancel out the thinks of past goals which is why you have to keep ruds in while listing something in pt is much more important to the pc than something that happened billion years ago even though it is the billion years back stuff that aberrated him but auditing is done in pt and the pc is always trying to sell the auditor on the ideas that 1 his thinkingness is what is wrong with him 2 pt is far more important than anything the auditor is trying to go into the auditor must not q and with his own human agreement with this he must have certainty that the longer ago it happened the more effect it had on the pcs aberrated state and that doingness and havingness are more important than thinkingness you clear up ruds as close to pt as possible and you prepcheck as far from pt as possible given the goal of each procedure that is the most effective thing to do you dont have the time or inclination to clear up ruds on the whole track because you are handling the whole track with beefier processes just because you can do something in ruds by pulling thinks dont be fooled into supposing that running think will get you anywhere in prepchecking in prepchecking you have to get dones there is basic difference on importances between the auditor and the pc concerning the location of the charge in prepchecking you cannot let the pc direct the questioning he will stay close to pt and in think if you dont have good auditor control good prepchecking is impossible you can key things out by shallow looks this is fins for ruds but you dont get any resurgence to speak of permanent change if the pc is thinking about it now he did it then you must operate on the basis that the chain is long and has basic that is unknown to the pc all this is available to you by taking locks off the top and 185going back under good auditor control of the pc you only get charge off later incidents to the point where the pc can see earlier the chain the auditor is getting the pc to go down has r for the pc because he has c with its further reaches the withhold system steps 2 3 4 and 5 of prepchecking when all appear and who see p 186 above and see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what for more current procedure takes the charge off each incident brings the incident to view so that he can asis it and then go earlier he will go earlier god help you if you go into the gpm with this but persevere find an incident that happened earlier memory is occluded by the most recent overt on the chain recovering memory of who one was in ones last life has virtually therapeutic value though it is very interesting to the pc and gives some resurgence you are prepchecking chains of similar incidents the charge is built up out of the first unknown in routine 3 you are dealing with packages of engrams called identities so routine 3 deals with whole lives of engrams all in bundle leading to the gpm prepchecking deals with chains of incidents and when you get the earliest unknown the whole chain will blow the pc will know where things come from and will feel better the permanent gains you can expect from adroit prepchecking are 1 the pc understands his case better 2 he sees where things come from 3 he feels better about life people and the environment around him but prepchecking doesnt solve the whole case from one end to the other 6205c15 shspec144 new training sections see hcopls 3may62 practical auditing skills 14may62 training sections issue ii training classes of auditors new thing has happened since the start of teaching the briefing course year ago new training pattern laid down in the academies new course materials have been added but practical section has been added to get people to confront doingness as well as thought data is very important but its application in doingness is harder to confront so we are putting in practical section to make sure that correct application occurs practical has always been there in the comm course and upper indocs this adds practical to the actual auditing along with added trs etc you could learn great deal about the mind and reactions of pcs if your technical procedure was perfect your understanding of the mind at present is blurred by the lack of an absolutely perfect application of scientology to the pc because of distractions entered in by imperfect auditing one stable datum is when confronted by the unusual do the usual every pc thinks his case is different from everyone elses actually he is thetan and he is here his case operates like everybody elses as far as fundamentals go the pc will give you sales talk on his unusuality on all his differences it is his privilege to come up with unusuals nonduplicates of everyone else of course he will with the bank he has got the moment the auditor buys the pcs unusualness he is teamed up with the reactive mind and the bank the auditor process the pc thenceforth if your application of auditing is wild and variable and everything looks all different to you you will get wild ideas about the human mind one could be blamed for varying procedure if they didnt know that standard auditing exists this is now know everything pc can do has standard auditor response that handles it it is the fact that these auditor responses do work in all cases that makes them standard responses universities sometimes have courses where the subject is hidden the students are there the professor is there but the course is double talk there is real subject eg art appreciation music appreciation domestic relations people confuse education with thinkingness you can go through school without ever understanding anything furthermore early classroom training is all data practical so giving doingness along with theory tends to break up the automaticity that equates education with total think education has become huge practical joke 186theory practical auditing gives two thirds doingness and one third think that is about what it takes there would be new tr for each new activity the result will be very smooth effortless auditing there will be uncertainties because the auditor knows the correct cause for every pc response and the proper response for very pc action this means that there is need or place for cleverness in handing pc only standardness in handling pcs there are certain stable data in the theory if you didnt have these you wouldnt know where you were going or why these stable data are the fundamental things there are certain practical actions that you must be able to do and few auditing skills to be used in auditing processes these things can be organized to go together and to complement each other to some degree see hcob 3may62 practical auditing skills for summary of practical auditing skills ie the student should learn 1 the basic fundamental precepts few bits of inescapable theory 2 certain basic practical actions basic to auditing 3 auditing skills that are relatively easy to do these three will be tied up together so that they complement each other class ia processes include op pro by dup scs and assists op pro by dup was originally invented solely as training process for auditors to teach them that duplication wouldnt kill them it enabled auditors to give repetitive commands without alterising so instead of asking do birds fly the auditor wont go off and ask are our feathered friends airborne it gets rid of obsessive change scs runs out bad control people must have been miscontrolled to object to control but the auditor must control the pc or he fails utterly control and duplication are the roughest hurdles for an auditor to get over student auditors should both give and receive op pro by dup and scs as first action see hcob 14may62 case repair for more data on op pro by dup and scs assists are the other basic auditing action to teach beginning auditors they can give spectacular results all these processes teach body mauling which is good thing now that upper indocs are removed because they lead people to misrun cchs and none of these processes goof up the pc if done wrong they all repair themselves if they are done right to repair the wrongly done process unlike engram running for instance which is not selfcorrecting these three processes constitute class ia class ib is arc sw in model session plus havingness this is sit down process that gives verbal repetitive think processing it will occasionally make someone sane who didnt know he was nuts and it gives the auditor reality on banks and timetracks as he sees the pc cycle in time you can run it positively and negatively which handles someone who winds up in agony when you try to run pleasure moments this process has tremendous horsepower class iia is prepchecks and cchs prepchecks at this level are preferably done by forms 3 and 6a form 3 hcopl 22mar61 the only valid sec check for new students the joburg form 6a hcopl 3feb62 auditor processing check shortened form of form 6 for students who have done fair amount of auditing form 6 hcopl 7ju161 processing sec check here the case would start to get good case advances class iib is where the student acquires complete command of the fundamentals of sessions and meters at an advanced level including all meter and needle phenomena and all elements and ruds of model session see hcopl 14may62 issue 2 training classes of auditors classes iic and iid include complete mastery of all thislifetime processes as well as very advanced general auditing skill at class iiia you have havingness getting ruds in dynamic assessment prehav assessment problems intensive and any kind of assessment you could dream up none of it has therapeutic value except havingness and lots of ruds to get someone up to doing routine 3 processes without doing any 3dxx he would have to do assessments of some kind that is bit of puzzle at present but you could do assessment by elimination on problems intensive for instance 187at class iiib the student would do goals assessment at class iiic the student audits routine 3 processes with skill see hcopl 14may62 issue 2 as above also see this pl for the theory and practical requirements for each class 6205c15 shspec145 new trs above tr4 there is tr which is auditor query this is the 2wc tr for cchs and model session in cchs the pcs physical reaction is considered to be an origination the auditor asks what happened just then pc what auditor that jerk of your head just then pc oh i had somatic auditor thank you this is the only communication used in the cchs if the pc originates something verbally you acknowledge it per tr4 and go on do not indulge in any extensive 2wc on the pcs answer to your query you ask the 2wc question at the end of command cycle this prevents him from taking control of the session though by the end of the command cycle he will frequently have forgotten what it was this form of 2wc is intended only to exteriorize the pc from somatic by getting him to look at it if his answer when you ask what happened doesnt pertain to the physical change you noticed you can ask what happened with your shoulder etc otherwise the pc can grind on and never notice what he is doing it is allowable to encourage him bit eg by asking how is it going as needed but this should only be done rarely there are emeter drills to teach auditors to recognize body motion and pc sell pcs will try to make items appear to read or to make ruds look clean by gradually loosening their can grip learn to set up the meter smoothly and quietly so that you dont distract the pc needle pattern reading is rather new needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in if you get dirty needle on calling goal you need to know that the goal isnt in it is kicking because there is missed withhold connected with it goals and items can be held in and made to look like goals and items by suppressions invalidations and missed withholds if you are good at it you can tell whether pc has missed withhold or an invalidation by the needle pattern you can and should correct the needle pattern to keep the pcs ruds in so that you can do routine 3 needle patterns vary from little buzzt patterns not just tick to larger patterns it is rare to find one on goal or item but it causes trouble if it is there so clean up the missed withhold inval reads with tick the dirty needle has given routine 3 more trouble than anything else there is tr for testing for clean needle described in an hcob of recent date it asks if something is free ie clean on the needle and then repeats the same action this applies to all auditing you go out by the same door you came in in other words when leaving an item you must check it for cleanness by using exactly the same phrase you originally used when starting to run the item if you ask has this goal been invalidated dont leave it with are there any more invalidations on this goal that is different question and you dont know if the first one cleared so this applies to all metered questions and if you are checking something tell the pc that that is what you are doing the best ptp process is the responsibility process what part of that problem could you be responsible for possibly q and with the pc ranges from doing what the pc says to worrying about what the pc was worried about q and tempters could be done as drill to teach the student to just clear his original question holding up against pc suggestions is also an anti q and drill holding constant against adversity is learning to answer with the usual when the unusual is being demanded of you 6205c17 shspec146 auditing errors there are two types of auditing activity in which you engage 1 rudiments type of activity you are trying to straighten something out right now not to dig something up done against the needle 1882 auditing activity done against the tone arm long wide sweeps of the needle may count as ta motion here you are trying to dig something up you have to get good at sliding from one type of activity to the other say the pc suddenly declares that the list is complete you have to shift fast to middle ruds and check for missed withholds there are also negative middle ruds eg in this session have you tried not to withhold anything or in this session have you tried not to invalidate anything suppress anything etc there are two reasons why your pc keeps picking up more and more missed withholds one is that you have missed withhold and the other is that the pc is strenuously and attentively keeping his ruds in running the session and being very careful not to withhold etc it doesnt matter what you use as middle rudiment it could be an endtype rud halftruths untruths etc or whatever seems to be needed to keep the body of the session going the faster you get the rud in the better you are not looking for more than clean needle even if it only stays clean for ten seconds if you want rudiment to stay in you get your session ruds in and use the body of the session to prepcheck particular rudiment so it will stay cleaned up you can drive yourself and the pc nuts by not acknowledging everything the pc says in answer to your questions even if what the pc says doesnt actually answer up you have to be clever in prepchecking to probe around and actually help the pc to find out things he didnt know about it is possible that there will be chain and that the overt will blow after he tells it to you when you are doing rudiments dont go into process to handle an outrud until you have given it several chances to blow by inspection if you do run process get in and out fast treat it as lightly as possible the best ruds process is the one that gets the ruds in fastest time spent on ruds is time robbed from the session so dont get started handling ruds if you can avoid it just dust them off pcs will obligingly get rid of things that you dont seem to think are very important when you are in the body of prepcheck you want to give some importance to the overts you are searching for by apparently taking responsibility for the pcs overts just to the degree of being very interested and thorough about getting them you throw an element of responsibility into the session and the pc will come up with more data 6205c17 shspec147 prepchecking rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session the body of prepcheck session has the purpose of letting the pc live in that lifetime you are after duration so you have to have thoroughness rudiment has to be clean but not permanent the processes you are using are insufficiently fundamental to do permanent job end rudiments are simply to get the pc back to the world of the living and smoothly out of that session middle ruds are even more evanescent in the body of prepcheck session we are going to do something that will change the pcs attitude towards living and improve his ability to confront life in this lifetime so we will do anything we can to straighten out some point that is askew in his attitude what is an overt all things are contained in the concept of interiorization into and exteriorization from there is beingness in this universe that is bad there is also none that is absolutely good but there is badness and goodness about beingnesses and that is an individuals ability to interiorize into or be something or exteriorize out of and not be something when an individual longer has power of choice over that fact he can be considered to be aberrated on that point there are vias by which you enter certain beingness steps of becoming that beingness there can be degrees of freedom of choice about entering or leaving something for instance there is difference between the position of career officer and the drafted private or slave war and slavery reduce power of choice that is what people object to in them not the blood and gore after all one really campaigns against highway deaths which are greater than the total world war i toll not to mention racing deaths you can almost evaluate practices and beingnesses relative to peoples power of choice over being them or not being them where an individual has high degree of freedom we find fairly highscale activity there is another activity going on reactively beneath this cycle of beingness notbeingness beingness see fig 9 the pc has decided to be something then for some reason he has found that he cant unbe this thing easily so he uses mechanism of committing overts against this thing in order to cease to be it he commits these overts and withholds himself from this beingness on 189repetitive cycle and his overts will get worse and worse and his effort not to be it will become more and more violent until he stretches out to maximum distance after reaching that point he will still commit overts against it but every new overt and withhold will bring him closer to becoming the thing again this is grim so he has beingness tries to postulate himself out of it and for some reason it doesnt work then he will commit overts against that beingness and that type of beingness he will think he is really separating himself from it to midpoint after which every overt and withhold brings him closer to totally enforced beingness which is complete overwhelm now he doesnt even think he has ever tried to unbe it all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes as well he becomes it on an inversion that is what is the matter with overts and that is what thetan is trying to do with overts he is trying to unbe the cycle of enforced beingness 1 an individual assumes beingness 2 he doesnt want to be it any more 3 he tries to postulate himself out of it 4 he fails to postulate himself out of it 5 he tries to unbe it by committing overts 6 he withholds himself from it 7 he alternates overting and withholding escalating up to point of maximum separation 8 continued overts and withholds bring him closer to the beingness again 9 he goes into total overwhelm and becomes the beingness enforcedly on an inversion 10 all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes he doesnt even think that he has ever tried to unbe it this cycle takes place on all dynamics on the second dynamic it is very apparent overts and the feeling of being unable to get out are very apparent in this area similarly on the third dynamic one can try to individuate from group to the point where one is being group and damning all individuals as in communism which results from an overwhelm by the group back down the track somebody has been god one day he decides to stop being it commits overts becomes it enforcedly and then one day you will find that it is terminal spiritualists are obsessively being spirits however the spirits they are being are other than themselves so in handling ow with prepchecking you are working with the mechanisms that bring about routine 3 bank remember that if the individual is being any one of the items you get in routine 3 he was it then wanted not to be it and couldnt unbe it and started using the ow mechanism to separate himself from it and ended up getting into it obsessively because that cycle takes place in this lifetime note that the pc has certain beingness and connections with all dynamics the item you are trying to handle is his current identity if you held the pc to this lifetime in the prepcheck you might well recover material that would otherwise be lost to this identity going backtrack in prepchecking would just be handling free track in other identities this might be better handled with routine 3 most of the chains can be deadended in this lifetime though not all this lifetime is not pure identity it is colored by beingnesses he has had in the past in order to straighten out this lifetime you must be pretty good and you cant be superficial you will get nowhere taking nothing but the pcs criticism of someone since criticism is just the last shadow the total defeat he can longer be this thing he can only criticize if he is so unhappy being it what did he do to it to make it such an unhappy thing to be getting overts is the mechanical statement what your goal is is to find out how he joe doakes made mary lou such miserable person to be because obviously he was being mary lou in this lifetime he has been every one of the eight dynamics in this lifetime to some degree he will discuss them all with you if you unplowed him from the one he was trying most obsessively not to be he would be free to be it and it would blow off in smoke you would have returned to the individual his power of choice of beingness hence the pts rundown question who would you really hate to be if you can return to the individual his power of choice of beingness you will get tremendous resurgence on the case you could go at it this crudely who havent you liked recently you get reading terminal you are trying to solve how did you make _______ horrible thing to be another way to put it is what have you done to _______ it must be chain because you have to get to the first part of the cycle as you run this his opinion of the terminal will change he will stop being unwilling to be it and there is now sector of existence from which he is not retreating so his reachingness into it is improved his doingness in that sector can occur because his beingness of that sector has been reoriented you cant reach into or affect any area from which you are retreating also person will not do anything that certain beingness can do when the person cannot be that beingness 190so you could find the thislifetime person who could do the things that the pc wishes he could do run off his overts on that person and at the least the pcs worry about not being able to do those things will cease perhaps he will now even be able to do the thing ie you could ask what do you wish you could have done who could do that then run ow or you could ask who couldnt walk who couldnt go anyplace who was terrific runner who went everywhere etc aunt chrysalis was crippled the pc wanted to kill her he gets into being aunt chrysalis prepchecking will at least improve the pcs condition even though his whole track needs to be straightened out you do need to get actual overts not thinks about what he would like to do or wanted to do that only tells you that he has been wanting not to be whoever the thoughts are about thinking about something is an harmonic of wishing someone who tells you that he has had unkind thoughts about his father is just telling you he wishes he werent his father getting off these unkind thoughts is not therapeutic to spring him out of his enforced beingness you must break up the system that got him there you must get at the ows that he has been using in order not to be his father criticism wish not to be disagreement disagreement is what the meter reads on if one is willing to be something that thing wont read on meter what the pc is trying hardest not to be is what he has done the most to also the identities he is totally overwhelmed by wont read you will get change as long as you take his thoughts and alreadyknowns and criticisms that is what he has been telling everybody for years with change the pc has to cease to fight being it and get to where he can comfortable become it at which point he will cease to be it l ron hubbard type 3 idate22562 volnum1 issue151 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec151 missed withholds 6205c22 shspec151 missed withholds q and is really q an some of the forms of q and are 1 double questioning auditor questions the pcs answer 2 changing because the pc changes you are questioning the fact that he is changing 3 following the pcs instructions that is q and of hubbard you are questioning his answers by assuming that the pc knows more about his case than you the auditor do the auditor must stay at cause over the session and put the pc at cause over his case if the auditor doesnt make the pc confront the pc will obey his bank which says dont confront full cycle of action must exist with an auditing command this puts tremendous responsibility on the auditor to ask the right question so there can be two mistakes 1 wrong auditing question like what should we run on you today or have you had motivator lately 2 failure to let an auditing cycle complete itself you can get in trouble by asking have i missed withhold on you because the pc can give motivator response this throws endruds out the first endrudiment question is have you told any halftruth untruth or said something only to impress or tried to damage anyone in this session see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised which puts the pc out of session then you have to question the pcs answer to handle the situation so dont ask an ambiguous question ask the type of question that makes q and very unlikely perfect question is one that produces an answer that doesnt have to be questioned since if you question his answer he will feel unacknowledged he will feel he cant talk to you and will go out of session even do you have an arc break is imperfect since if he says yes the non q and response is only an acknowledgement not what is it an auditor who changes when the pc changes is demonstrating so much impatience to produce an immediate effect that he will never give anything chance to get completed he lacks confidence in the usual working often because he is unaware of what the usual is he will easily go off into extraordinary solutions because he lacks confidence in the ordinary solutions because he has never done it sometimes auditors q and because the pc gets nasty and furious and they back out 191the commonest form of q and however is failure to acknowledge the pcs answer because one is questioning it this can cause pc to react furiously or eventually to go into apathy as an extreme response to being made to feel that he is having withholds missed before this point there is twilight zone of semioutof sessionness where all the rest of the ruds keep flying out as result of occasional nonacknowledgement or wrong questions if you ask an auditing question like do you have ptp and get an inadequate answer you can meter check it if it still reads dont just keep asking the same question ask something that will be answerable without producing q and when pc drifts out of session he is drifting on his feeling that he is unable to communicate with the auditor the way to throw him out permanently is to punish him for getting off withholds and to make him feel that he will never be able to communicate his withholds to the auditor the auditor doesnt have to be sweet and nice he does have to get his auditing questions answered permitting the pc to answer something else also throws endruds out and makes the pc feel the auditor didnt hear him since he knows really when he is really answered you must ask question that can be answered and get that question answered if you do that smoothly pcs will do almost anything for you when you see session running off the rails dont look at the pc as peculiar ape and dont develop good communistic selfcriticism just look at the questions you are asking in session ask yourself if they are answerable by the pc and if you are accepting the pcs answers if you are doing these things right it must be the pcs environment that is caving him in 6205c23 shtvd6 check on what question havingness probe demo tape of finding havingness mainly same as mts4 6205c23 shtvd7 fish and fumble checking dirty needles demo tape of cleaning dirty needle with fish and fumble some prepchecking same as mts5 6205c24 shspec148 emeter data instant reads i if pc has stuck picture dont try to run it get the session where it was found and get the missed withhold off that session lrh has simple plan use the emeter we had breakdown in 1961 where everybody was misreading meters now it is happening again see above for discussion of observing the needle auditors are ignoring reads on ruds questions and auditing over outruds they are not seeing instant reads for some reason the ford foundation was founded the same day as the hubbard research foundation and for the same purpose to find out about life however their idea of scientific research is looking on via through symbols in contrast when lrh observed the generally crummy appearance of students few weeks ago he looked for the reason without presuming what he would find this is good way to do research he found out that if ruds were out there would be ta so he had old prepchecks cleaned see above people thought the meter wasnt reacting because the auditors tr1 was out however that was not the reason auditors just failed to see reactions that were there if with modern processes the pc isnt looking better and doing better someone isnt reading the meter an auditor can get into not reading the meter by invalidating the meter this comes about because he has been audited by someone who missed reads on him which caused him to lose confidence in the meter he feels it should have read on and it didnt read this is lie and hangs up like any other lie if it had read the auditor would have seen it so the meter doesnt work so i wont pay attention to it when im auditing this neednt happen lot meters get invalidated the inval of the missed read gets suppressed it hangs up and builds whole chain you clean it up by prepchecking has any auditor failed to find meter read on you that you thought should have reacted that gets the unknowns out 192of it it has unknowns in it because it occurred in midsession when the pcs attention was on something else the mechanism of enchantment is similar to this it could work something like this at time when thetans could mock up their own bodies one thetan could put in command phrase on another thetan in the middle of subjecting him to severe secondary or engram the command phrase could be you are now deer and the enchantee would cease to mock up the prince or whatever he was mocking up and mock up deer and he would be an enchanted deer so you lay in an inval of the meter at time when the pcs attention is on his withholds or something he gets further withhold on top of it thereafter he distrusts meters and cant read them it would take more than that motivator however it would take some overt that is actually motivator also the pc is at the auditors mercy being out of pt etc you have to audit in way that doesnt impede the pc from going clear you avoid restimulation of the gpm until the pc is ready to go clear and you can then blow the gpm to bits auditing roughly can create inadvertent implants incomprehensible people are people who wouldnt want your goal see p 259 the individuals goal line is important things that cross against his goal to get clear are all auditing errors smooth auditing is designed not to bat his goal back not to impede him making him think the meter doesnt work is very upsetting to him even if analytically he is relieved not to have been found out of course once the pc is utterly arc broken the meter doesnt read so the auditor can get to the point where he doesnt see or believe the reads that he gets you can get random reads on the words in the question or on some stray thought but if you recheck it it drops out or at least doesnt appear in the same place an instant read is instant it is not contained in the body of the question those are prior reads the lag in an instant read is essentially nonexistent the auditor is actually talking to thought in the bank auditors often mistakenly think the pc can analytically influence the meter but he cant the pc cant even influence the meter on via as an instant read he can do it by thinking of something that he knows there is unknownness about but in this case the read will be latent since there is time in the reactive mind only nowness you get instant reads from the reactive mind furthermore the pc doesnt know what produced the instant read at least he doesnt know all about it or it wouldnt read reading item contains unknowns the reactive mind is cauldron of unknowns that always exist in now consistency of needle action is determined by consistency of unknown and its immediacy in pt so use the questions in hcob 23may62 very important emeter reads prepchecking how meters get invalidated this contains questions about invalidation of meter reads both from the point of being an auditor and from the point of view of being pc to clean up meter inval it is important to get this straightened out for the sake of pcs if you see the pcs instant embarrassment it is as good as an instant meter read you do have to observe however and it is tough to get people to to this note lrh first mentions routine 3ga at the end of this tape routine 3dxx is mentioned in the confidential tape 6204c26 shspec139 rundown on routine 3 routine 3dxx routine 3g is mentioned in 6205c01 shspec141 routine 3g this is routine 3 employing goals it is possible that the tape 6206c12 shspec160 how to do goals assessment contains the basic data about routine 3ga and that routine 3ga means routine 3 goals assessment routine 3ga is also mentioned in several other shsbc tapes 6206c19 shspec158 dos and donts of r3ga and shspec176 177 178 180 181 all appear to contain basic data on routine 3ga see also below above tapes are confidential 6205c24 shspec149 emeter data instant reads ii people can get into more complications by figuring instead of looking look dont think you can lose data if you are just being given lot of unweighted data so that you cannot see importances and align them the good or useful data or important data get lost among the rest data are not all equal most scientists are defending cult ask them for data and they will obfuscate the data and overwhelm you with mass of unweighted data machinegunned out with amplification another 193way to obscure things is to evaluate the reader and put in lots of footnotes referring to obscure sources etc this is typically professorial maneuver it tends to develop priesthood they are deriving their importance from their knowledge which they would consider to be worthless to them if everyone knew it their knowledge is like cloak of rare bird feathers polynesian navigators were priesthood modern navigators create the same effect by their obfuscations 6205c29 shspec152 question and answer period routine 3g4 is another untested process that might get used on cases which dont get plowed up enough with 3gaxx you find goal then find goal that would oppose it then do another assessment for goals that would not oppose it then assess for goals that would want that goal you get four goals that all tick alike then you list all four and you would theoretically get the four items which are actually two items in the same way as in 3gaxx i cant say what the life expectancy for this process is it is probably longer than 3ga in answer to the question since we dont have modifier now how do you keep gpm keyed in if it should key out and you get free needle actually the modifier is only the label on one of the items that you are listing on that listing you are still fighting the same package as in routine 3d by listing each one of those lines you keep it pulled in as much as you would anyway you might have more trouble keeping things stirred up for the second goal but by then the pc should be able to approach the gpm more closely so there should be trouble stabilization is just going on and on getting more goals and more fourlists until you couldnt get the meter to read if you hit the guy over the head with club you are not likely to find the guy flying off in keyout because every time you find goal you will wrap your paws around every element of it that was part of the gpm stabilization is getting rid of any masses the clear might run into which would get him reinvolved with the bank formerly before stabilization he could have gotten enturbulated again but by doing 3ga again and again you will get to where there is gpm to key in it is so intricate to keep the gpm there at all in the first place as you get rid of more packages you get rid of things that could cause the person to go unclear again something else can be done with the person drill him into the reacquisition of skills that is not doing anything to clear it is going into ot which is the recovery of skills of the thetan clearing is just getting the bricks off the track not the recovery of skills it looks to the thetan as if he will get his head knocked off if he does certain things what really knocks his head off is his inability to reach sustainability which is inherent in his bank not in the physical universe as long as he has aberrations he will key himself in by indulging in such exercises if there is nothing to key in he wont get keyed in prepchecking is the best setup procedure assuming very competent auditor problems intensive see hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion and p 134 above note that as used at the time of this tape prepchecking was used in place of sec checking in the problems intensive is like junior grade prepcheck but it can be done by notveryskilled auditor with skilled auditor prepchecking and cchs are by far the best difficult though it is to teach auditors to prepcheck well ive been experimenting the past many weeks trying to work out some repetitive process which could be used at lower levels to get some benefit there is lot of value to it doubt this involves threeway bracket what have you suppressed what has another suppressed what have others suppressed same phrasing with invalidated same with failed to reveal same with been careful of youve got these buttons and you could run them back and forth and undoubtedly get somewhere in 37 12 hours you could get as far with this as i could in one hour of prepchecking the problems intensive using the changes list getting the biggest self determined change finding the chronic ptp and so on gives you way to do something for the pc particularly if you are not very skilled at prepchecking but if you are it is to some degree waste of time there are pcs who dont respond to much else besides prepchecking the changes list prior confusion people in it prepcheck them route is very interesting to the pc and gives wins but otherwise it is an excursion it is also useful for teaching the auditor to assess because you get everybody the pc knew prior to the time of the change this means that the auditor learns to list the importance of havingness is that if the pcs havingness goes down he will have odd reactions you check look around the room and tell if you can have anything if it reads turn down the sensitivity and get can squeeze havingness being down brings masses in on the body and the pc will get reads with small body motions as when he looks around and moves even his eyes the pc is 194a bundle of piano wire with masses packed in against the body with low havingness these masses are likely to start talking circuits turn on the reason missed withhold reads with double tick is that the person is pulling back against himself pulling masses against the body the same as when havingness is down extreme nohavingness results in getting needle action when the pc moves his ear watch it in routine 3 especially you dont want to do goals assessing on lowhavingness pc when you find the right havingness process the drop on the second squeeze after few commands should be third to half dial drop 6205c29 shspec153 security check prepchecking the material of this lecture is summarized in hcob 10may62 prepchecking and sec checking details on prepchecking procedure when prepchecking ruds you are talking to the person about those things which are very pertinent to the subject of auditing these we have to have in if the pc is living life of secrecy we will find that ruds will go out even after having been put in broadly with prepchecking there is possibly something so wrong with the pc that joburg same as form 3 is needed to clean him up cases that go mad actually have number of missed withholds it is the missedness that makes them go mad their reach into an area is very difficult their departure from an area is difficult and the number of crimes they have under their hats is incredible their ruds go out as fast as you can get them in because there is tremendous weight of unknownness on the case the more closely the crimes are related to injuring scientology the less you will be able to get ruds in do recognize that if you cant keep the pcs ruds in the pc has overts matter how innocent he may seem people who invalidate emeters and have hell of time in session are having hell of time in life just because of their overts the easy way to get it off is to take some broad pervasive thing like joburg which has every crime known to man or beast on it using the joburg you will clip some corner of what they have been doing the pc would be damaged if the withholds were known so he doesnt give them up easily when one gets too many overts and withholds that are too damaging to oneself one wants to get the hell out the extremity of blowing from missed withholds is dying if you are auditing such case expecting that his overts will be of the magnitude of picking flowers in someone elses garden you will let them go ahead and croak out of kindness such pc has short attention span like if they are sick etc so the auditor has to be fairly quick he must parallel what the mind is doing find where the person doesnt want to go back to and what the people there dont know about the person what he is hiding etc since the pat list doesnt go straight to the area where the pc has his attention it has the liability of boring the pc to death before you get to his particular crime or item you must do it well and positively to minimize his dispersal of attention so handle things swiftly when you are cleaning up the relatively uncharged questions the ones that clean up with one incident good speed would be ten to twelve chains really prepchecked well per hour plus twelve or so null questions that speed keeps up the pcs interest fairly precise patter is being developed you need to word question so it keeps getting hot read and you need to get the question itself answered not some motivator version if you take motivator you will often find yourself spending long time and going nowhere just throwing endruds out eg halftruths untruths damaging others etc see p 244 above like mad when you realize you have done this go back and check it dont go on pursuing the wrong course canned lists scrape up areas that pcs are trying to avoid done well you can now prepcheck rudiments so that they will stay in and you can go on to routine 3 in checking up on past prepchecks look over only the what questions not the form in toto or the zero questions the process of prepchecking increases the persons responsibility so form 3 questions may now be alive that werent when it was done before the what questions that have really been nulled wont come alive again if you find one of these alive you are justified in chewing out the auditor the ones that are null will be stably gained 1956205c30 shtvd8a getting rudiments in this is demo of lrh running ruds and havingness on reg sharpe 6205c30 shtvd8b getting rudiments in continuation of the above demo lrh is running mike rigby on ruds and havingness note that middle ruds are presentday prepcheck buttons done repetitively each to clean needle eg suppressed invalidated failed to reveal etc see hcob 11jun62 prepchecking the middle rudiments 6205c31 shspec154 value of rudiments auditors tend to believe in the thought impulse system this is the idea that the auditors thought impulse is instantly and wordlessly transmitted to the pc so the meter reads then that is not the way you should be reading meter lrh has been doing research to see how vital how valuable ruds process is and how deep it will go if it is run as repetitive process we find that it is like trying to empty the ocean with small spoon that which is kicked into view by routine 3 is not kicked out of view by any repetitive process it is odd that this tremendous bulldozer 3ga wont run forward at all in the absence of these gnats flying at the back of it the answer to this puzzle is that the rudiments apply to present time and this universe now even if you get rud in on pc really solidly these rudiments processes are incapable of even dusting the gpm they will do only microscopic keyout if someone has gpm keyed in any repetitive rudiments process will do virtually nothing to it prepchecking can do keyout you can move it around with cchs but there are tremendous difficulties in assaulting gpms there is very effective process for cleaning up past auditing except for routine 3 auditing what didnt you know what didnt another know what didnt others know it is very lovely and effective it will sometimes do things for very arc breaky session but against lockedin gpm it has influence though it may look as though it is doing something repetitive rudiments processes can do things with the free track and whole track engrams that are not in gpms there is another good process multiple bracket on suppress what have you suppressed what has another suppressed in you what have you suppressed in another what have others suppressed in you what have you suppressed in others what has another suppressed in others when you start to run it you think it will clean up the whole track youd think it couldnt help cleaning up the whole track it makes you feel so horrible you could use invalidate in the same way and fail to reveal dont know same thing careful of could be very interesting but none of these processes is worthwhile as means of cleaning up the whole case this is because they are all thought manifestations figurefigure buttons what the pc has buried is the fact that his postulatingness is basically thinkingness it is on lower scale think is below effort on the know to mystery scale it is not postulatingness which is at the top of the scale none of these buttons will carry him through effort they just keep swatting him on the nose routine 3 processes are what it takes to get the pc above the effort band the pc is doing his figurefigure in the middle of the gpm masses he is getting his thinking dictated to him from circuits he is getting the word from circuit to circuit b from all kinds of conflicting and oppositional identities as you audit him you have to keep him from being alarmed and defensive about present time otherwise he is not up to confronting the effort and the masses he has large number of automatic thinks going these are all characterized under the existing beginning middle and end rudiments these buttons keep him so involved with thinkthink that he cant go upscale to get him to go upscale you need routine 3 processing this works by labelling and identifying masses which brings about differentiation among masses and gets the pc up to confronting masses your effort is not to get him to confront those masses it is to get the conflict of those masses identified and resolved any way you wish to do so it is actually pretty easy to do once you know what you are doing you can unhinge the almostimpossible balance of the gpm so that it can 196longer hang up and create itself out of the pcs energy the identification and labelling of the mass is the borderline between the thinkthink and the mass it lets the pc become aware of the mass whereupon it blows it is trick for thetan to confront the mass it is what mass to confront that is important when the pc confronts the anatomy of the gpm it disintegrates the way to get the pc into the gpm is with goals assessment see p 236 above on the theory on running goals in routine 3 the goal that the pc gets identifies the mass he is sitting in and when the pc gets it looked at it disintegrates goals assessment thus helps you identify which part of the gpm the pc is in it identifies the thinkthink that is going on and the principal mass that he has to get out of when you start listing down the gpm items all the pressures and electronics that hold the item in place start lifting so he cant stay there anymore he is not aware that he is in the item or being it he thinks he has to keep this one game because it is the only game he can play pcs are reluctant to get rid of mass because they feel that that is the only game around but the pc is really either not playing that game or having fun playing it when he gets his attention unfixated from that particular game he sees that there are other games around and he can start enjoying life he thinks he is in games condition but he is actually in nogames condition the only way you can boost the pc through the effort band is to permit the pc to have his full attention on the objects that you are trying to haul him out of if his attention is distracted by things in present time he has that much less attention free for addressing the task of going upscale through the know to mystery scale he feels that he doesnt have enough attention units to look at anything he is distracted by the thinkthink because masses with influential ideas are impinging on him rudiments processes have herding nonimpeding action the relationship of rudiments to routine 3 process is like that of hedge beside road it keeps the pc guided and heading forward outruds are like stones on the road ruds processes do not move the pc along the road they can retard the pc from going on if done wrong or if very badly done they can actually reverse progress with rudiments you collect all the pcs power of blowing things by straightening up his attitudes towards the auditor and the environment pc whose ruds go out gets recoil phenomenon if he looks at gpm then gets his attention jerked off he gets mass straight in the teeth the pcs attention acts as pressor beam it had part of his bank in focus and when his attention swept sideways it is suddenly as though you took the pole out of the hand of pole vaulter when he was half way up to the bar keeping ruds in includes not yanking the pc out of session this process of getting hit by something causes dispersal which causes the pcs ability to differentiate to lessen tremendously he confuses things and his anchor points are driven in the lower toned he is the less focussed he is or can be anyway and the more easily his ruds will go out even if he suppresses the outrud when an auditor has successfully put the pcs ruds in several times the pc will stay in session easily because of his confidence in the auditor he will learn that his attention can be properly directed by the auditor and that the auditor wont get him into trouble but dont get too cocky at this point the level of pc confidence adequate to prepchecking is probably not adequate to routine 3 because the stress in routine 3 is so great that the ruds have to be in much better and stay in well if the pc gets much auditing with rudiments out he gets more and more nervous so matter how little you expect from the session you should always get the pcs rudiments in in this way you will gain the pcs confidence that you can get his rudiments in and that he will at least get that degree of gain anyhow it is the auditor not the state of the case that makes the pc hard or easy to audit the first edge in may be difficult especially if there has been bad auditing that has made the pc nervous as time goes on however the tough pc whom you cant do anything with because he cant blow anything will improve as you gently and persistently get his ruds in shortsession him if necessary run something really easy so he has wins just get the ruds in little by little session by session as he stops being anxious about his ruds being in his needle will get cleaner clean needle should show up by the end of his second session you give him wins matter on what the first two times you get ruds in on pc you shouldnt expect the pc to respond well to rudiments check by the third time if the auditor got the ruds in thoroughly in all three sessions in 197the third the needle will be cleaner if that has not happened the auditor did not get ruds in in the earlier sessions the third rudiments check would be valid the fourth and fifth are still more valid rudiments are absolutely vital even though they wont move the gpm at all strangely enough the gpm also will not move at all without them 6205c31 shspec155 middle rudiments the middle rudiment consists of package question that handles suppressions invalidations missed withholds and careful of middle ruds may also contain the halftruth untruth impress and damage end rud see p 244 the question or command end rud and the influence the meter end rud have you failed to answer any question or command i have given you in this session have you deliberately tried to influence the emeter see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised to expand the middle ruds further you could run in the auditor and the room the former less advisedly and the latter only if there was lot of disturbance in the environment if you need more you would do better to shortsession the pc with endruds break then beginning ruds it is sometimes more economical to start new session than to patch up the one you are running ordinarily in prepchecking and routine 3 only one package middle ruds question would be mandatory you always do middle ruds in prepchecking and routine 3 you should use time or subjectlimiter is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of the first blank could be in this session on goals on listing or even in auditing when it gets outside the framework of one session it becomes the equivalent of prepcheck and must be regarded as such in this case it is best to take on the subject of goals is there anything you have suppressed as zero question and prepcheck it if you did this before starting routine 3 the pc would come up shining if you do one of these as prepcheck zero question do all four they obey all the rules of prepchecking you get the overts you should realize that the overt is often against self the chain may only go to last year ok so it goes very rapidly the buttons you are using are good strong think buttons prepcheck buttons are the basic think buttons of the thetan the above section on middle rudiments is of interest as part of the ontogenesis of modern prepchecking the first term used was prepclearing which was intended as euphemism for sec checking when sec checking was used as an auditing action intended to be preparatory to clearing see p 184 the term prepchecking replaced prepclearing for general usage after short space of time see p 186 prepchecking was here defined as way to get each rudiment in fairly permanently so it wouldnt be likely to go out during 3dxx at this time the withhold system was used for prepchecking later p 194 lrh made distinction its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing in may of 1962 lrh suggests the possibility of repetitive prepcheck process using some of the midruds buttons p 249 the middle ruds buttons also began to be prepchecked as standard thing p 251 repetitive prepchecking came in officially in july 1962 as an application of repetitive rudiments technology to prepchecking see hcob 3jul62 repetitive prepchecking while any zero question could be used for this type of prepcheck prepchecking of middle rudiments modern prepcheck buttons was emphasized use of the withhold system was soon cancelled because it was too hard to teach p 278 modern prepchecking was essentially present by the end of july 1962pp 291293 except that more buttons were added to the midrud buttons the final list of prepcheck buttons was brought out in hcob 14aug64 scientology two prepcheck buttons middle rudiments have use in prepchecking you can use them to get rudiments in when you use them as rudiments run prepchecking like any rud where you acknowledge and check on the meter assuming that the pc has answered the question you may have to get the pc to repeat it if you didnt understand take the onus on yourself by saying i didnt get that this is part of tr4 dont ever be fake if the pc has heavy accent you will do better to ask for repeat on every answer than to fake understanding which leaves you with missed withholds on the pc this applies particularly to these middle rudiments since the pc has to have answered the auditing question the other use of middle rudiments is prepchecking them as zero question the question have you ever suppressed anything is zero question not middle rud use middle ruds with great thoroughness but with great discretion not just willynilly dont distract the pc with them when he is thoroughly into something else you can ask the four middle ruds as package in this session is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been 198careful of watching each one if one falls stop there and get the rud in when that is done dont repeat what is clean or what has been cleaned just go on the general rule in routine 3 is to put in middle ruds when shifting doingnesses this is more frequent than the use in prepchecking so it should be done short sweet speedy and expertly though carefully you cant afford to drag or fumble on it dont insist on getting the pcs overts short session if necessary dont distract the pc with middle rudiments when listing for the goal you can use middle rudiments when the pc looks confounded and stops listing when he really gets boggy they should not be used every time the pc stops to think if it is hard to get the middle ruds to go or to stay in in the next session use the middle ruds to prepcheck listing the middle ruds play against themselves that is fail to reveal careful of and suppress can mean the same thing to the pc or they can at least be similar eg the pc who is being careful to reveal everything is really failing to reveal something so with the middle ruds you get several cracks at the same thing where did careful of come from it came straight from psychoanalysis because all psychoanalytic patients end up being very careful we dont want that in scientology and it is an embracive attitude or action it isnt really suppression or help it is just common denominator the end product of all aberration is being very careful this goes hand in glove with lrhs recent research into the overt motivator sequence the more people consider doingness dangerous the less they do that is direct index to aberration the level of inactivity is measure of the degree of aberration the more sane activity the less aberration careful fits right in there what the pc gives you in ruds is seldom what you should run in the body of the session since if the pc knew what was wrong it wouldnt be wrong so dont run bodyofthesessiontype processes on things that come up in rudiments as rule the pc knows too much about it you can go astray in prepchecking by taking up some outrud unless it is ptp of long duration of course it must react frequently they dont never correct anything that isnt out if you cant get something in and it is still reacting and you are going to leave it tell the pc dont make profession out of one middle rudiment be honest if it is still live and you are leaving it tell the pc dust off ruds lightly dont make whole session out of ruds 6206c12 shspec161 middle rudiments when you ask second question or double question pc you are omitting tr2 and q and aing gorgeously tr2 is an auditor weak point an adequate acknowledgement is worth great deal do you have ptp i had fight with my wife what about this is q and in trying not to q and one can err by not getting the auditing question answered it is not q and is comm lag that exists until the pc answers the auditing question this requires that the auditor hear what the pc said so tr2 should include understanding and acknowledging auditors create more arc breaks by failing to understand but pretending to the auditor now has missed withhold just put the onus on the auditor for failing to understand and get the pc to repeat it on tr10 point out something the auditor should know what the pc is pointing at and may need to ask it is fins for him to do so all rudiments must contain an answer to the question asked if they do the auditor must just understand and acknowledge that is all that happens only when it is manifestly impossible to clean it up with repetitive single questions does the auditor resort to ruds process the rudiments are now good enough so that if the pc gets the auditors question and answers it and the meter is cleaned on that exact question and the auditors trs are any good then you dont need any rudiments process in using repetitive rudiment you ask the question acknowledge the pcs answer and check the meter if not clean repeat the question until after cycle of pc answer acknowledgement and meter check the meter is clean this actually acts as process in itself dont wait around for the pc to find eg ptp if the meter is clean when you ask for it if it is null just acknowledge and go on you are actually thereby giving the pc his answer or you are giving him the answer the meter gave the last question is thus answered by the auditor for the pc this completes the communication cycle 199just repeating phrase to the pc will deintensify it in the bank if it is equivocal because of dirty needle or poor metering check it again let the pc know what you are doing and why do this enough so that the pc isnt left wondering in the dark always keen the pcs r in tell him what is going on pc who is screaming is less arc broken than one who wont talk to you you should put in middle ruds when the pc is having trouble listing more goals give the package question slowly enough so that you can stop and clean whatever reads then go back to listing goals you should attack mid ruds so as to spend minimal time on them so every time listing slows down zip through them every fifth session or so they have enough outofsession nonsense going to benefit from some prepchecking suppose the pc gets resistive in session where you did get beginning ruds in go ahead on middle ruds and prepcheck using middle ruds for zero questions this will pick up things like inval of goals as subject or listing as subject that is the commonest thing that causes the pc to stop listing on pc who is on the verge of telling you what to do all the time critical pc who is continually suppressing suggestions about your auditing you can use she buttons suggest and fail to suggest these fit in well with prepcheck in middle ruds you are only interested in the immediate session to keep the needle clean and readable and to keep the pc in session when doing your four line list on the goal do midruds between lines in prepchecking you put in middle ruds after each what question is null then recheck the what question this is fancier way to ask for missed withholds so dont also ask for them if she pc is down on havingness consistently you could do middle ruds then havingness then recheck the what question use midruds when the pc has slowed down shut up run into problems etc middle rudiments make an excellent communication bridge you can put anything in with the middle ruds following it if you are prepchecking against prepared sec check list and you get five or six questions cleaning up with only the zero question do the middle ruds in case he is suppressing something if the middle ruds were found to be out you go back and do what you were doing over again except in listing the use of middle rudiments can be extended to specific subject object or activity if you are checking out goal for instance you can put in midruds on that goal keep it fairly specific or you will be getting into prepcheck you could probably put in every other rudiment with the midruds for instance say the pc gives the same ptp twice and it still reads on beginning ruds you could put in midruds on that problem naming it in the commands lrh doesnt advise this but it could be done sometimes you add halftruths etc from end ruds but if you really have to do this it is smarter to end off and restart the session if the pc needs this short sessioning is better anyway you can also do end ruds on prepchecks where they are useful to pick up overts and withholds if you cant get midruds in you can try prepchecking them pc who has somewhat dirty needle and has to have midruds done often will benefit from midruds prepcheck if that doesnt do the job the pc should probably have more cchs and general prepchecks lrh has become expert in fish and fumble ig the pcs needle was dirtying up and not getting cleaner after ruds he would start the session with fish and fumble to clean up the needle before doing anything else he would say after beginning ruds i want you to carefully consider your auditing nothing happens now carefully consider your wife lots of reads now clean it up tracing down only one pattern at time the double tick should be handled first because it is missed withhold it takes bright auditor to clean it well it is necessary to ask something that will keep the read or just to pursue the read one started with or to formulate what question you can really clean it up so the needle doesnt get dirty again the way bad auditing could dirty it up again is for the auditors tr2 to be so bad that everything the pc says is automatically an inadvertent missed withhold fish and fumble procedure is also given as tr in hcob 14jun62 class iic trs one of the virtues of fish and fumble is that it is fast way of cleaning up the needle though it could be overused it is usually necessary only two or three times the vital read to clean up first is the double tick the missed withhold it is pretty easy using fish and fumble just to clean it up fish and fumble make it possible to do goals assessment which otherwise would be virtually impossible it does require the auditor to be inventive in figuring nut what overt might be connected to the read that 200the pc is telling you about you need to get the pattern of the mind which is that if there is something the pc is reading on he has either done something to or with it if you are doing prepchecking fish and fumble gives you wideopen chance to clean up the needle fish and fumble cleans up the needle so that you can prepcheck and is barbaric cousin to the prepcheck 6206c14 shspec156 future technology when pc takes responsibility for withholding from the auditor he locks himself straight into the mechanics of 3ga the arc break that results from such an action on the part of the pc is the sort on which the bank is built and may be too heavy to be handled by ruds that is the button that makes 3ga what it is it is based on the mechanics of taking full responsibility in limited way for one purpose there is pandeterminism here the person dedicates himself to the goal of the gpm as prime postulate doing anything else is devt for the pc this sets up situation where everything else is an otherness is departure from all pandeterminism the pc has had it since any other action is an alterisness of the basic purpose doing anything else is breakdown of his own very isolated determinism this is how the pc backs out of the physical universe thereby running into it again with thud thus other occurrences besides those which fulfil the goal are not asised they are alterised and mass gathers around them you should realize that it is missed withhold that louses up the session what if the pc took responsibility for never getting any withholds off he could make such postulate you would then have an arc break that rudiments could undo maybe even process couldnt undo it since it goes straight to the heart of the gpm and keys in all those basic purposes by this action the pc has keyed in the highest button in the bank withholding not that pcs are responsible for withholds but they are responsible for action of one kind or another so when the pc takes responsibility for the highest button in the bank wow if you try to run pc on what withholdingness have you taken responsibility for he would get more somatics than he knew existed because you are trying to run the gpm out from the topside down it is not clear at this time what you could do with this situation this is under investigation at this time so the final question on withholds in model session is under test lrh is trying to find something that could undo the possibility of the pcs having postulated that he wasnt going to tell you anything or talk to you in that session here he has found button in excess of all other buttons 3ga was designed to handle this button with ease but not to handle the above situation probably the reason for an occluded childhood is having taken full responsibility for not communicating eg ill never tell you anything again im mad at you the likelihood of the pcs making such postulate and hanging up the session as part of the gpm is remote if you are following the textbook solution dont let untrained auditors attempt listing or 3ga the only danger in listing is for some untrained unskilled auditor to try to run 3ga they can get pc into more trouble than you can easily get him put of 3ga solves 3ga if you run 3ga wrong you can make it right with more 3ga it is peculiarity of problems in this universe and in the mind that prime solution runs out its own errors that is the test of prime solution you make an error with this solution and it corrects the error so therefore it is not cure 3ga is the first thing that is not cure cure does something about prior problem 3ga operates on the prime postulate it wouldnt even register as goal if it werent prime postulate on some section of track so it isnt solving anything but it puts the person in situation where he doesnt have to be solved very tricky the trouble with finding wrong goal is that listing it will beef up the bank worse than any creative process ever run you are running an alteris and you will get an alteris mass is an alteris so the longer you run the wrong goal the more mental mass you are going to get if you suggest goal to the pc the misownership of it will seize it up in the gpm and cause it thereafter to read it will be reading on misownership like everything else in the gpm if you list it the mass will increase and increase and the pc will feel worse and worse at this point lrh mocks up world mental health organization which would inspect hospitals etc it would subscribe to the international congress of ethics in healing and it would require 201doctors to give an account of their facilities results technology credentials etc the right to inspect gives the right to command it is the first step in taking control 6206c14 shspec157 listing in 3ga you can form up the wording for an ordinary goal quite easily for instance if the goal is to catch catfish you would use who or what would 1 want to catch catfish 2 not want 3 oppose catching catfish 4 not oppose note that we had to change the wording of the goal to fit in the oppose and not oppose lines if there is any doubt about the acceptability of changing the wording of the goal just put the words the goal after want etc this has to be done frequently with negative goal in order to avoid an awkward double negative this procedure is still imperfect but there is way to get it perfect see p 285 for an amendment on the wording the goal is prime postulate that has accumulated onto itself number of identities by which the purpose could be executed the goal or the pc in taking on this goal as prime postulate has assumed these identities because there were people who didnt want the goal who were stupid and incomprehensible see p 247 so one had to prove to them that the goal was ok there were other people who desperately opposed this goal there were bunch more who were somehow associated with it if you cant express these four flows on your listings the process wont go clean to change wording in midflight can be quite upsetting to the pc so after you have done the prepcheck and the goal is reading beautifully be sure of that wording it should register be certain that it is the wording for the four flows for that goal this is not to say that you will never change the wording of listing sometimes you have to when you find that the line never has listed you will probably list on low sensitivity to get reads on the tone arm easily every fifth session prepcheck she whole subject of goals listing and auditing newly just as in goals assessment and run middle ruds every time you stop running list whether they are needed or not there is period of action for each list that decreases the length of time list is active before you leave it becomes progressively shorter ta action will be good then it will get slow do midruds then go to the next list establish pattern we cant tell where this prime postulate the goal will sit on the pcs crack or what gpm cycle this thing precedes we dont know that so we dont know how much bank we are relieving in running this goal but normally half an hour of listing on list seems overly long when starting off on muckedup pc you would probably only be able to do one list per session to get all the ta out this procedure is not necessarily recommended since it is unbalancing and impractical so you had better do the listing by count of stems or by minutes at first however if you stop pc in the middle of an automaticity he gets suppression so allowing for automaticities you should more or less list an arbitrary number of items for each list listing say fifteen minutes for each list none of those lists will be exhausted by doing it this way if the pc gets into an automaticity for heavens sakes dont stop him in his tracks because he will do suppress if pc is listing rapidly and freely let him go on listing none of these automaticities will go for more than 150 items more or less on listing it is very bad form to 1 tell the pc to wait while you write down an item 2 fail to write down an item either one is crime you pays your money and you takes your chance learn to write faster than is about all you can do pcs can be encouraged to common lag but this is not advised either 202your four lists should be kept to approximately equal lengths one may tend to be shorter eg not oppose if this happens list the short one as extensively as possible and list the others as briefly as you can in the first part of listing you list by arbitrary number it doesnt matter too much what the number is since there is so much mass to get into however later on you will find yourself running into free needle and it is crime to continue to list line on which free needle has appeared because you are running process that is not producing change when you get the fn you test the next line if it doesnt disturb the fn test the next line and so on when you have all four flows fning that goal is dead go find the next goal if line does stop the fn list it to fn or for awhile until you see that it is not going to fn then go on to the next line this evens out all the charge so that at the end all the lists will be equal not in length but in amount of charge blown i must caution you against the sins of overlisting listing flat process is an auditors code break see the auditors code of 1954 13 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer this is in the creation of human ability p 3 it will upset the pc but that is not why you shouldnt do it the goal you are operating with on this pc is not the prime postulate by which he entered this universe it is only the beginning of some cycles that you have laid your paws on by goals assessment it has some harmonic against an earlier goal so if you overlist you push the pc back into an earlier gpm or pull up earlier track out of place so just list the lines to fn not beyond fn it is relief to talk to you about what you do with free needle toward the end you will find the time so short on each list that putting midruds in every time you change lists is too frequent so do it after the pc has listed ten to fifteen items however many lists that may be the only reason pc stops listing is that he has some middle rudiment out this is true for both goals listing and lines listing pc can accumulate enough charge between sessions that the middle ruds have to be prepchecked to clean it all up never get the idea that the pc can run out of items pcs dont think of items they deal them off the bank if he had more items to deal off he would have more gpm so the pc stops listing only when the midruds are out and he therefore cant get into communication what do you do when you have brought one goal four lists to fn in earlier days you would have called him clear you could still call him clear and get his fn back with little cleanup of ruds any time watch your acknowledgements in listing writing the item down is acknowledging you can also go mhm and make little encouraging noises dont give fullstop ack that ends cycle and acts as an inval an auditor listing can feel so much like secretary with all that inflow that he loses control of the session so when you have stopped listing give good acknowledgement and do brisk middle ruds looking like proper auditor in listing you must look like an auditor during ruds because you look so little like an auditor the rest of the time then when the midruds are clean you go back to listing with good auditing command it is the last command you will give until you stop listing that list it is an awfully long auditing answer the pc lists for two pages then you go mhm any more you repeat the question gently who or what makes for plurality of answers the pc doesnt lose the command if he runs down you can give the command again to get more if he simply refuses to go on get middle ruds in also get them in at the end of the list give the pc the rfactor that you are going to do midruds before we go on with this list get them clean and get more items an item is very delicate it is easy to squash one or to glum one up it is also tempting to fake understanding an item but if you do it enters missed withhold into the session which will blow up right then when you didnt understand something admit it i didnt get that tr2 says you understand if you dont falsity enters in which will destroy the session do good admin on lists keep parity you will notice when an actual goal is listed out that an item will transfer from list to list when an item has been in all four lists that is just about the way is is the item has been or all four flows when all four flows are discharged the item is fully discharged against other items and lies null after listing is complete find new goal the list will be shorter the time to find it is less you get dwindling quantity of everything eventually you will wind up with theta clear it is my guess 203youll find type of goal you find in the basics of scientology these things will suddenly register is there one basic goal for all pcs oh yes but they cant reach it and its not real you want the goal that registers now not the perfect goal theyll get back earlier and earlier on the track and eventually hit the prime postulate clear is as stable as you cant find prior prime postulate as the gpm is listed the repetition of the items gets the discharge off the prime postulate that you call goal the definition of goal is basic postulate for which the individual has taken full responsibility as the bricks the items built up on the postulate tend not to resist the postulate anymore the postulate runs out you get the thing diminishing and getting thinner the pc is now sitting there with all the experience accumulated along the line and none of the mass because there is alteris connected with it 6206c19 shspec159 question and answer period notes are fragmentary on this tape to turn off persistent rockslam during listing call the pcs attention to room object she old solution was to repeat null word eg the name of room object until the rockslam disappeared then continue rockslam is symptom of not having listed enough goals since the major aberration is in gpms it may take as long or longer to clear freetrack case than black v release is person who is better by reason of auditing and knows it he also knows that he wont get any worse combines life repair and arc straightwire release definitions chronic ta at 45 is symptomatic of crowds chronic ta at 25 is symptomatic of machines you could read minds by moving someones somatic strip and reading the pictures fortune telling works by getting the seeker to agree to postulate when confronted with an undesirable future from one get the fortune teller to change it around until you get an acceptable future 6206c21 shspec162 model session revised parts of this tape are summarized in hcob 23jun62 model session revised this model session will make auditing much smoother it is remarkable in that it doesnt need any extra processes except for the pcs havingness the rudiments here are repetitive processes asked only as long as you get an instant read hcob 25may62 emeter instant reads defines instant read and should be known it is really instant on the end of the last letter of the last word of the question item or command if any read seems equivocal you should check it out it isnt true that the pc knowing the question will react before you have said it all you are not auditing knowing being you are auditing notime reactive bank the bank waits for the entire command and then reacts instantly if the read occurs on br and not on k when you are asking for an arc break it is prior read and you ignore it it is the read that starts on k that you want this is not hard its easy so be sure you use the meter properly the results are marvellous that way sad to say ruds done with prior and latent reads will mess up the pc only ask question twice or more if it had an instant read if there is instant read on the question ask it only once it is of great benefit to have repetitivecommand model session it doesnt change process on the pc all the time so you clean up what you ask for not some variation and there is variation in what you do you ask question get an answer check it on the meter etc it is very easy to do once you find that it works it is so easy that people dont do it at first they do something else which 204is hard everyone has to some degree the desire to demonstrate that they are an expert because what they are doing is difficult the real experts fool you they make it look effortless and easy when you start auditing on simple coaudit you may find that it is perfectly easy then you will go all the way around the dial to get back to that ease one becames all thumbs over the horrible unknownness of it all once one has gotten into it so the simplicity of this model session is fooler you enter in with the idea that there must be something else to do and with all the alterises wide open the expert has flattened the alteris impulse the amateur goes along fine up to the moment where the pc says something unclear there he gets confused and doesnt know the next time he comes to this point he alters he is nervous about discussing someones problems anyway so he alters and q and as if he gets into habit of doing this he gets results and thinks tech doesnt work but he has never tried it the first discussion of model session was in 1958 when millie galusha and lrh took the things auditors tended to say and made pattern made the session constant then the reason for doing this was recognized the consistency of pattern ran out old sessions at saint hill it became the earmark of professionallooking auditor the rfactor on auditing came up enormously using model session now all the questions in model session can be extended to become repetitive questions if necessary to handle the charge this use of repetitive processes to get ruds in makes model session even more valuable new pcs lack r model session being consistent puts in r this increases the pcs trust he is not being startled the auditor will thus be more real and solid to the pc you have established expectancy in the pc you have also put in arc using model session without departure will get interesting results all by itself if you put someone into session ran only model session and took him nut every day for three days running the pc would start talking about my auditor all by itself model session also has the power to smooth out the pcs needle this is even more true when it is combined with prepchecking and havingness new pc tends to look like someone who is swimming two or three feet out of the water they slip in gradually they dont know what to expect or what will be demanded of them once they find out they will be relieved you could run any set of harmless questions three days running and the pcs reality on session and arc with the auditor would be much greater dont expect any one question in model session to straighten out the pc it is not onebutton proposition dont expect to clean up dirty needle on pc with missed withhold handling or with any one particular action it is done with smooth auditing not part of auditing the needle cleans up gradually as the pc goes through session after session every now and then you will be thrown off because one pc in hundred will react with big change you tend to get stuck in that win and then you keep expecting to find the magic button what really happened was that you had been gradually improving the case before you hit that point freud had luck and then got hung up in the win clear is not made with 3ga alone it is good auditing plus 3ga that produces clear neither part alone to that degree model session is part of clearing by keeping the session predictable and present time clean enough to be audited in thus you get an undistracted pc asking the pc is it all right for to audit you violates the rule of not putting the pcs attention on the auditor so it is not good to ask the are you willing to talk to about your difficulties is ok because it gets him to look at his case and talk to the auditor so it gets him into session in middle ruds you have fourquestion package you look for an instant read on each part if you get read on one the repeated question is the single rud question for instance if invalidated reads you ask what was it get the pcs response ack then recheck invalidated when it is clean go on to check the rest of the four parts in singles if you like to keep him from getting confused the body of the session is where middle ruds are used end rudiments have had some additions the multiple halftruth question is handled the same as midruds on the emeter question one asks how not what was it on question or command drop the one that didnt read on critical you clear it with done on room run havingness if it reads or if havingness is down as indicated by can squeeze havingness began as way to bring joe winter back to pt from down the track calling the pcs attention to the environment it is always beneficial at end of session the following are some flagrant errors that can be made 2051 not being expert with the meter 2 not knowing model session script 3 asking question second time when it was clean the first time dont alteris the cleanness of the needle you can put an instant read on meter by reading clean question twice it is reading on protest 4 not checking again after you have had the question read 5 not saying that you couldnt tell what the read was when you couldnt never pretend on meter read 6 failing to give the pc an rfactor on each new step that is important to wipe out his mystery about it all 7 doing what the pc said 8 making irrelevant statements or remarks this always upsets the pc and yanks him out of session 6206c21 shspec163 question and answer period professional auditor is harder to put into session than raw meat pc he knows more and is more critical not in bad sense actually the raw meat pc is just as critical but he wont say so if professional auditor is almost impossible to get into session he has been audited with ruds out professional can be audited to outofsessionness faster than anyone else because he knows when something is being done wrong you can pick up and fish out pc cognitions by tone of voice or some irrelevant remark by the pc which is an appreciation of something it is not vital to do this in fact you probably shouldnt even do it it can boomerang an irrelevant remark would be when the pc is sailing along and you suddenly say wow that needle fell half dial this distracts the pc but if you can appreciate what thy pc is doing he feels more acknowledged its tr2 trick if the pc starts crying and you go in with hard boiled or crisp nononsense tone of voice the pc feels unacknowledged he needs to have certain feeling that the auditor is with him this is why you will sometimes hear lrh sounding bit sympathetic your voice should reflect some comprehension of the mood of the pc so that he will feel that you are with him dont fail to respond to what the pc is doing hut dont let the pc put you at effect either there is fine line between the two when in doubt keep it simple and by the book people have trouble with tr4 because they dont understand what the pc is saying lrh is perfectly willing to be at the effect of the pc to the degree of properly acknowledging the pc but further thus when you acknowledge the pc by responding to him he knows that he is having an effect on you and he will stop trying to produce an effect you can make mistake on this you can intend to show agreement and the pc can take it as derogatory if he is so inclined simple acknowledgement avoids this situation it is just when you know your tools and know what is happening so well that now an top of it you are free to be appreciative if the pc should get upset and start blathering entheta lrh would tend to ignore it he would not even tr4 it he would just give the next command the above degree of relaxation only extends to tr2 not to entering chitchat into the session to the degree that you dont use 2wc in model session you will succeed better 2wc slows down the progress of the session when used in model session or any part of ruds if the pc is all jumped up at the beginning of session you could instead of letting the session handle it say what has gotten into you as part of your rfactor that way you would get him talking to you at least then start the session and put some order into his confusion some pcs waste session time with conversation you need to establish control with good solid acknowledgement pcs will try to take session control away from you 206on ruds question if the pc says and the meter says yes you should acknowledge the meter where the pc and meter disagree forget the pc and trust the meter dont worry about this making the pc wrong because hell hes wrong anyhow there is trick in this you are not contradicting him when you say that reads just pay attention to the pcs yes or in ruds only answer the meter and you will never give the pc the feeling that you are countering what he has just said if pc were to ask lrh have you run cchs on the instructors too he would say thank you for asking we will now go into end ruds get them in give the pc break and do beginning rudiments this would be terrible symptom of outofsessionness the pc is not interested in his own case if the pc gives you an irrelevant question acknowledge it and handle it but realize that it shows something is out midruds at least so get him in session if he is in session and asks question it is generally fine to answer it if you did something wrong never think that you will lose session control by admitting it you actually only lose control by demanding to be right it is not unusual for the pcs havingness to be up at session start but down by the end of session though this doesnt always happen this is symptom of rough auditing unconfidence arc breaks and low havingness are interchangeable havingness goes down in the presence of arc breaks when havingness is up arc breaks disappear if the auditing is at all rough you will get dwindling of havingness confidence in the auditor is proportional to smoothness of the auditing you want to be predictable to the pc early in pcs auditing he tends to be more critical of his auditor than he will be later this is symptomatic of nervous pc who has been roughly handled in life and earlier auditing as your pc continues to be wellhandled in auditing this factor drops out and the pcs havingness will stay up also as the auditor improves his skill the pcs havingness will stay up the auditors tone of voice is not important it is irrelevant remarks that matter you can make remark without saying anything for instance you may have surprised tone at seeing clean needle that is bad thing to do it all comes under the heading of putting the pcs attention on the auditor instead of on his bank sounding robotic will do the same thing sudden yank of the pcs attention off the bank onto the auditor environment or meter will cause those masses that the pc has been holding away from him to hit him in the face you will have devil of time digging him out you can yank the pcs attention by getting the pc absorbed in question 1 and then before he answers asking him question no2 it is an irrelevant action you should neither inform the pc about the meter when he doesnt want to be so informed nor withhold information when he wants the information the question will come up do you ever use middle rudiments while doing beginning or end rudiments there are situations where it might happen but if the auditor has the pc well under control it shouldnt have to come up it is great relief to pc who has had q and prone auditors to get an auditor who just smoothly carries on when he the pc arc breaks and screams and spatters he finds that he can trust the auditor to audit him predictability alone will hold someone in session regardless of what other actions you take on the other hand any unusual solution you adopt makes auditing seem unpredictable and becomes curse to you predictability breeds pc confidence and relaxation and it makes him able to go into session when you add the powerful buttons of the beginning middle and end ruds you can really get somewhere strive for predictability the more nervous they are the more dispersed they are the more predictable and steady you should be 6206c26 shspec164 emeter quality some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 28jun62 dirty needles how to smooth out needles the whole crux of auditing today is the sensitivity of the emeter and the ability of the operator to read one there is recent bulletin on how to clean up needle see above reference needles can get rough and active clean needle reacts when the auditor speaks and does nothing the rest of the time there is gradient running from occasional ticks and tocks on up clean needle reads right it gives instant reads not prior reads needle that is twitchy gives prior reads because the pc is as it were segmentalized mentally next there is needle that is reacting continuously enough that one of its 207actions coincides with your instant read and you get reads that are equivocal because the needle is so active that you cant read it the most extreme dirty needle is in such constant and continuous motion that you could never get an instant read on it because it has blank spot for the end of the sentence to go into fortunately you can smooth out this kind of needle with havingness see p 249 for more data an the effect of havingness on reads this is fortunate because you cant use the needle to find anything wrong and fix it the path of thought transmission is from the thought in one person th the recorded symbol to relay in someone elses mind to the thought again that is why you can find goal in english which was originally expressed in phoenician the thought is there prior to the symbol by which it is transmitted the dirtiest needle would be the one from the bank that registered the least thought and generated the most thought autogenerated reactive thought you are watching circuit go zip and zap the auditor has impingement on this bank the restimulations that the mind is getting are often in this case from the external environment at all this person is totally introverted and is just autogenerating restimulation circuits are making each other think of things the pc thinks of cat then circuit thinks of another cat and another circuit then thinks of tiger then another one thinks of tank cars which leads to milk he has had sufficient restimulation in the past to last for trillenia he is wholly on the backtrack and the physical universe doesnt even exist there is worse one yet the stage four needle this is the same restimulation going on all the time the stage four needle is like rotating neon light it wont react even to the auditor kicking the pc in the shine there isnt even crossrestimulation there is also reverse stage four needle that goes down stick swoop up these stage four needles represent fixed condition one thought there is another condition the stuck needle which doesnt move or react this could be stage four needle stuck in ridge as though the neon sign got stuck while rotating with high sensitivity you will get some read out of this pc any needle that doesnt clean isnt all right the reason you are running cchs havingness prepchecking rudiments and so forth is to get clean needle if youve got clean needle why bother doing it clean needle reads when you say so it may rise and fall bit as the pc breathes but thats all if you have that you can go ahead with your goals assessment there is reason not to what is the best operation to clean needle lrh has cleaned some up with fish and fumble hitting the middle of circuits etc but the best method is to put the pc into state of confidence this is done with predictability of sessions in most cases it is mistake to try to sort nut all the needle actions particularly on needle that is continually agitated how can you fix that one up it is the case that most needs 3ga which however you cant run on it person with dirty needle has had his purpose shifted too many times he has lots of conflicts cchs run very gently would help you must be minimally random and maximally predictable excessive randomness is the main mistake of psychiatry the more drastic the case the more drastic the measures they use what insane people need is utter predictability and randomity at all just motionless objects and quiet space the crazier the person is the more predictable is the handling get quiet attendants spread people out so that they can ignore each other have some motionless figures around that will be there tomorrow allow mail or phones get some boulders food rest and predictability are the keynote you have business auditing someone who is really nutty they are bundle of alteris give them chance for the confusion to blow off and they will be ok it is not true that an index to insanity is constantly moving needle as an auditor you can create dirty needle in anyone just by not getting ruds clean being unpredictable in session forgetting things leaving them out and changing frequently without completing cycles but the pc wouldnt be driven insane and some insane people would have perfectly clean needles you could sit them down find their goal and audit them on out to clear this is true because insanity is specialized condition it is the sensation of trying to reach and not being able to you can turn on this sensation in someone by saying get the idea that you must reach but you cant reach and that you must withdraw but you cant withdraw if he gets these ideas he will feel stark raving mad for fraction of second insanity is more of sensation than anything else total unpredictability produces almost the same effect 208running havingness tends to keyout circuits although not invariably predictability also does this so if the auditor ran smooth gentle series of cchs circuits would key out and the pcs needle would clean up if this doesnt happen either you are not being predictable or this person needs to confide in you and you need prepchecking the highscale companion to cchs or he needs rudiments and havingness if you have audited the pc for four to five sessions and his needle is getting dirtier you have been auditing on too high gradient of unpredictability if you are running cchs and prepchecking you will have to undercut it by dropping back to model session cchs and havingness with complicated actions on the cchs the dirtier the needle the simpler you need to get decide to get simpler after about three sessions your concentration should be in the direction of clean needle if the needle is getting dirtier as you audit the pc suspect the meter first assuming that you are reading it right and doing perfect model session and ruds evidently the meter isnt getting the rudiments in maybe the leads are disconnected or the battery may be down or the meter may be broken this is the test say to the pc do you have ptp you see the meter is clean ask the pc if he wanted to say anything about that if he has generally got something to add the fact is that your meter doesnt go as far south as you have to go to get rudiments in auditing with rudiments out is the only thing that will dirty up needle after session where the rudiments are actually but unobservably out the pc feels as roughed up as violin being used for canoe paddle and after session where the rudiments were thoroughly in the pc feels sleek as cat who has been fed fish if your meter never detects anything reactive on pc it isnt sensitive enough this can happen when the pc is near clear also when there is not enough reactivity left to show on the meter at this point also you have to ask the pc if there is anything else oddly enough you will still get reads adequate for goals if you run pc with rudiments only partially in the pc will wind up rough if you run session with rudiments thoroughly in the pc winds up very smooth the needle gets dirty because circuits are pulled in circuits are pulled in because the pc is way back on the track and low on havingness you get the pc out of circuits and up to pt by running extroversion processes and bringing his havingness up the worse you audit the pc the lower his havingness will be and the more you will get circuits keyed in and the dirtier the needle will get 6206c26 shspec165 prepchecking prepchecking is based on fundamental of dianetics which is that related incidents form chains on the time track the time track is consecutive occurrences in time recorded in pictures which classify themselves in chains picture persists because of the violation of purpose involved in the incidents where the pc intended one thing and got something else alteris is violation of purpose eg going out to hang someone and being hung or going out to kill the mayor and electing him pictures are held in place by this violation of purpose when you run out the basic purpose intention the pictures will fold up cf expanded dianetics the pictures hang up in the mind classified in chains each of which has basic and basicbasic the basicbasic is the first time on the track you did or experienced or decided that kind of thing but you can have basic on each chain in each lifetime there is basic picture on chain there is basic purpose on chain which the chain violates and that is what hangs the up you need that data for 3ga but nor for prepchecking all you need to know to prepcheck is that there is time track with classified chairs on it the chain will free when you find the basic on it it doesnt have to be basicbasic recent thislifetime experience is all you need if you go back to basic purposes you will get into 3ga before you are ready the basic is generally in childhood this life occasionally it is in prenatals or even past life charge can remain on the chain when the basic is longer unknown this is why the what question will be null if you have gotten all the way back zero questions will come live as his responsibility rises prepchecking consists of locating chains of sufficient charge to aberrate the conduct of the individual then it provides system that knocks out the basic on the chain the withhold system see pp 186 and 237 above the charge is there in pt because of the pcs misassociation of the past with pt this is misidentification all this is in dmsmh so is 3ga as the basic purpose of the individual 209dmsmh p 238 and science of survival book ii p303 even at the age of two or three years an individual seems to know what his basic purpose is in life later this becomes corrupted by individual and social aberrations but is recovered in dianetic processing possibly past lives have something to do with forming basic purpose originally we ran the withhold system on the incident closest to pt after finding reading zero question the zero questions are found in sec cheeks of which there are many if you get two reads on zero question you had better prepcheck it there is danger in being too fundamental in doing prepchecks for instance if you got zero question by doing dynamic assessment you may run into the gpm which you dont want when you get an incident that is an answer to the zero question and the read is still there after the pc tells you about it you formulate what question by dibbling and dabbling around until you find one that reads the same as the zero question this is the weakest part of the prepcheck system when the what question has been found it is now time to let the pc get it all off using encouraging halfacks until he runs down then send him earlier you know the earliest is something he cant just spot easily so you dont ask for that you ask for earlier until he is as early as he can go without much assistance or using the meter the pc uses earliest the auditor uses earlier the earliest incident the pc can recall is the barrier to earlier memory there is always barrier incident here is where the auditor starts using the withhold system when he has done it couple of times he has blasted the track open more so he can find an earlier incident then you use the withhold system on that one to get out all the unknowns then test the what question on the meter if it still reads go earlier again keep using the withhold system to open up track finally the what question will be flat so you get middle rudiments in then recheck the what question the crimes one is looking for need not be sordid or highly reprehensible ones though people who have been psychoanalyzed often try to come up with spectacular believing that that is what is needed to clear it if your pc does this be sure to add the end rudiments question about halftruths etc to your middle ruds auditors are prone to the virgin complex the auditor wishes to think that he is the first one the pc has told things to so he may go for the really sordid stuff that he pc wouldnt have told anybody else if you go at this without prepared list like sec check the pc will surely give you the least aberrated chain which is the most known to them if cleaned up this chain will produce the least case change the pc will give you this chain because it is safe one pcs like security this is why lists of arbitrary questions are more productive of case gain than more general prepchecking you can also use the rudiments as zero questions along with finding goals or auditing or whatever he does lot eg his job as long as he doesnt tell you that that is what is wrong with him if it is as advertised it aint the balance and the delicacy of auditing is getting the pc to talk to you about things that he doesnt know he should talk to you about and preventing him from rambling on about things that wont advance the session without letting him see how he is being steered naturally he will tend to bounce off things that are aberrative they are there because he hasnt asised them which he has avoided doing because he doesnt want to confront them you have to let him discover that he is confronting something auditing in this manner will make you look clever to the pc as if you knew just where he was heading you do because you are traveling on series of fundamentals you are only trying to pull up basic on chain of incidents than were wrong conduct on pcs part he knows they are wrong conduct so he has them buried you dont want to make him guilty you only want to clean up the chain every now and then you will hit something that is real pay dirt for instance when the pc has occluded the top of chain the rest of the chain will be really hot it is symptomatic of charged chain that the incidents are out of sequence all mixed up as the pc straightens it out the time factor unscrambles as you go earlier you find that the incident he thought was earlier is really later these incidents are mainly locks they are all overts clearing person with prepchecking is not possible however hundred hours of it would go long way if you go on prepchecking forever you will get more bank appearing because you are not on the pcs goal line prepchecking will make 210for more sanity than any psychoanalytic system ever developed the earliest version of this was straightwire and spotting someone who had an aberration or difficulty similar to the pcs that was fabulous when it worked which wasnt always 6206c28 shspec166 rudiments part of the data on this tape is contained in hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments how to get the rudiments in here is why you have difficulty with rudiments when you do let us consider an emeter on totally arc broken pc it wont read the gradient on this is the more arc broken the pc is the less the meter reads it should go by the opposite gradient the more the arc break the greater the needle response but it doesnt the fact is the more the rudiment is out the less the needle responds in session you often find the second third and fourth ruds out when checked later this is because when you dont get rud in the later ruds dont read well auditor can blunder by not checking what he is trying to put right after getting something answered for instance say you are putting havingness in in beginning ruds you run the pc on some havingness then skip checking the question tell if it is all right to audit in this room on the meter the omission of that step throws the remainder of your rudiments out you would be amazed at how many answers the pc has that he never has chance to give you all of which become missed withholds he only stops giving you answers after you have made flub on metering rudiments there might be several ways to get ruds in the current one is to ask get the pcs response and test it on the meter if it is clean leave it this works fine as long as you never miss if the pc is bit arc broken and you dont get response you say it is clean and from then on you have had it that is the frailty of that system there is another system ask the ruds question indicate that reads what was that the pc answers check the question if it is clean ask the pc do you agree that that is clean that gets you off the hook somewhat another system is the one that used to be used in sec checking ask the pc the question until the pc runs out of answers then check the meter if there is read get what it is recheck if it reads say there is another read here this is the correct phrasing while it still reads will make the pc wrong and arc break him this system prevents missed withholds from developing because it gets the pc talking to the auditor about his case you get more fundamental read that way but you will have to steer the pc because what you have got is unknown to the pc you are plumbing the bank the disadvantage of this system is that some auditors cant leave the middle rudiments alone they spend all their time on them in goals session you should be getting middle ruds in only when everything goes null and you are getting reads of any kind on any goals you wont go over several goals without getting read unless the middle ruds are out dont try to cure nosituations if the pc says something while you are nulling the goals list just use tr4 be sure you acknowledge him or you will have to put in middle ruds because he will feel you missed withhold you expect the goal to read at least once on your threetime repetition get middle ruds in when you get consecutive xs on listing you put in middle ruds when the pc runs out of items you do it when you change from one list to the next also but the important time to put in midruds is when one of the fourlists is shorter than the others and the pc runs down you use midruds as booster in listing or nulling and to test flatness of what question in prepchecking in you overuse them you will drive the pc out of session because it is noauditing situation so using the sec check system to put middle ruds in can overdo the amount of time spent on mid ruds but this system will get out the unknown rud that is the real killer watch out for the pc who says also dont get caught up in repetitively asking ruds questions against the meter three times maybe but if they are that hot the pc can find the answers this system does get the pc into session if not used senselessly and at length in the middle of goals listing the best time to use this system in prepcheck session is on beginning ruds to be sure everything is grooved in there is problem there lrh cant say there is one perfect system there are number of types of pcs but all pcs agree that auditing is scarce and that it must take place and be effective so any system that wastes auditing time or seems to will rut ruds out so ordinarily in prepcheck 211system get beginning ruds in really well using the sec check system but polish off middle and end ruds routine three is not as interesting to the pc as prepchecking though it is important the pc is anxious during nulling more than interested so dont use the sec check repetitive ruds system on routine three the pc is impatient he hears the padlock rattle if you have to use an extraordinary system to get ruds in the pc is too nervy for routine three anyway the system is just too time consuming for any pc in the middle of routine 3 he should already be in shape to stay in session when you put him on routine 3 anyway dont give ruds that much importance suppose your pc always has latent answers after you have found the rud clean in this case you can say we have the significant withholds off of that or that is clean of important answers or at least we have the reactive answers off it you want to indicate that there is needle response not necessarily that the pc may have more answers however you dont want the pc to carry on after it is clean nor to invalidate his having thought of something the pc can get whole theory worked out on how some thoughts arent important and some are reactive etc etc if you are going to make an evaluative statement at least make it an accurate one 6206c28 shspec167 question and answer period there is possibility that person with nice clean free needle is at mockery level where the needle appears clean but the case is really nowhere this case will rise up into trouble even if starting pc wasnt at mockery level you would still want to run some model session and havingness sessions before going into 3ga so that he would get an idea of what auditing was the anxiety factor will otherwise get in the way you could run ruds and havingness then give him prepcheck session even if it were only grooved in the direction of goals then you could go on to his goals list just be sure it is not the dead thetan case which will blow up in your face if you do 3ga somebody invented method for doing cchs where they started asking did you notice that physical change all the time it got to be quite method it is an evaluation the whole point of cchs is to get the guy to look if he looks he will exteriorize from that particular somatic this is deft delicate action the auditor is undertaking not sledgehammer procedure or rote activity pcs will put the process on automatic and go out of session running like woundup doll unless you stay in 2wc with them in cchs the auditor is only interested in physical originations on the part of the pc because cchs are physical not mental processes you count on the fact that he has originated something at that point if you can bring him to observe as live being he will get better and better but if you tell him he has got to observe he wont he will feel bludgeoned and criticized the old drill that you use is fishing cognition this is called training 13 see hcob 11jun57 training and cch processes pp1617 if you dont succeed ok you didnt succeed an auditor in his desire to make somebody well often pushes the pcs teeth down his throat he gets anxious to have beneficial effect and starts pressing when he does this he drives the pc out of session by adding note of urgency or impatience this puts the pcs attention on the auditor what if the pc is responding to someone elses voice and the meter is responding to hearing another session in progress in this case the beginning ruds must be out your pc is not in session with you if he reads on word mentioned by someone else in the vicinity to handle it you have to get the pc in session this is best done by ending that session taking short break and restarting making sure you get the ruds in poor insessionness used to show up as superlight overts gotten off on sec checks like i thought of stealing paper clip that is symptomatic of confidence wobbly model session and ruds not gotten in but session started over outruds you have to learn to be so smooth and so predictable that the pc would never think of doing anything else but respond to you and read on your meter when you call pcs attention to physical origination by asking whats happening and the pc says oh nothing you should just acknowledge and go on then the next time you have him in prepcheck session you get off suppression you can remedy this situation the pc is giving you social response he may feel that you are critical and so is making nothing of his reaction one approach is to vary the question eg one could ask how are you doing instead 212a compulsive outflow in itself is not dangerous unless it runs the pcs havingness way down you want to use tr4 since not all his answer is relevant you have probably slipped up earlier by not acknowledging when he did answer in the early part of the outflow you now have to use tr4 get in understand acknowledge and return him to the session good method of handling that is to say when did that occur to you in this session he answers you acknowledge and you go back to the process when pc is properly acknowledged he has found out that he has reached you and he will stop talking so if you pick his hand up and put it on your shoulder as he runs on he will shut up he has reached you you are not trying to reach the pc you are trying to convince the pc that he has reached you you could probably stop war if you could convince the enemy that he has reached you war is saying you cant reach us but we are gonna reach you all war propaganda says this which only tends to just keep things going if the pc answers the auditing question and you acknowledge and the pc goes further than that you should consider that the pc has originated if the pc is originating he has an anxiety about reaching you so all you have to do is to cure the anxiety and there you are there is havingness process based on this principle that you can use with cchs it is quite simple repetitive touch my noncharged body part every now and then the auditor will get love turning on in the pc you have to run this out since you want to get rid of its misemotional connotations you would run this early in auditing and once per session it is good way to handle malefemale anxiety you could use this process for when cchs go roughly some auditors have pcs going out of session when running cchs this is mark of rough auditing nice easy cch run wouldnt need any rudiments but if rudiments do go out in cchs you are up creek because ruds violate the physicalprocess idea of cchs so this cchhavingness process would be way of handling this situation it would supplant all the anxiety about doing model session while doing cchs it is way of getting the pc to find the auditor this is an arc havingness process any other havingness would be risky it might not be the pcs havingness process dont waste time in auditing there is particular amount of courtesy in the reactive mind when i do auditing i do the essentials and not more than the essentials i get the job done you do want the pc in state where he will read on the meter my pcs dont have time to have ruds go out the time to put in midruds is when the goals stop reading at all on nulling say you call them each three times and nothing reads that is when to rut in midruds if you make the pc wrong for talking by putting midruds in you are misusing midruds and driving him out of session you are making him lose interest and arc breaking him then the meter wont read well the current test of completeness of list in listing goals is ta action on listing the tone arm has certain tendency to drift if the pc were to sit there with his hands on the cans and nothing else going on in an hour the ta would drift say from 275 to 30 lots of ta motion is 75 divisions in 20 minutes little ta motion is 25 divisions in 20 minutes none normal drift if nothing were happening 6207c10 shspec168 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part i see hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments and hcob 3ju162 repetitive prepchecking relating to this tape and the next we are back to basics today in auditing the forerunners of practically everything done today can be found in dmsmh and dianetics the original thesis see p 270 above suddenly also we are back to repetitive processes which auditors have always had success with except for the question of whether the process is flat in the 17th acc lrh had just lectured on comm lags the next day he asked how you could tell whether the process was flat one could answer the difficulty is solved with this method of using repetitive questions they are flat at precise point ones troubles can come only from not reading the meter or not believing it either will bring about an upset pc model session repetitive per hcob 4jul62 bulletin changes significant change is havingness or the room rudiment being dropped from beginning rudiments although retained in end ruds see also hcob 23jun62 model session revised has all ruds except havingness as auditing questions to be handled repetitively you would think that slugging the pc with this many processes in one session would be catastrophic it is if done poorly if you overrun by one question the pc is in the soup likewise if you ask one question too few you get missed withholds so either never 213ask for ow or do it right you cant avoid the fact of missing withholds matter what you try you can miss withhold just by walking in the room so you cant just not ask questions and if you ask question you must ask exactly the right number of questions some cases one in twelve even think you should know everything they are thinking in these cases any question you ask shows that you didnt know so you miss the withhold see hcob 12jul62 motivatorish cases this is the theetieweetie case the way someone got in that state was too much pretended knowingness on the part of others plus overts against questions if this type of person exists or if many people get into this state and they do and if man keeps being active while being secretive which he will then it is inevitable that you will miss withholds an people so you must learn to run ow and repetitive processes perfectly not just fairly well it is rather easy to do repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking perfectly the only problem is that with some cases you have to add to another to the done question otherwise the pc will give motivatorish answers which spins him in and the question will never clear auditing is as successful as it is predictable to the pc auditors get spoiled by howling success following an unusual solution this includes lrh such success can hang an auditor up and get him stuck in the win the more we learn about the mind the fewer unusual solutions we need and the more textbook the solutions become this is measure of an auditors understanding of what he is doing if he wins with an unusual solution it wont give consistent wins as time goes by he may get so many loses that he ultimately stops auditing the closer we get to clearing the fewer unusual solutions we look for to clear everybody you have to know how everybodys mind works weve got that at this point we only need to modify the tech to make the result easier for all auditors to get two things monitor our tech 1 the results 2 the ease with which auditors can be trained up to where they can obtain the results the ease of application of the processes the problems are these pc is built like universe there is pride postulate on top of which mass accumulated human being is determined to be such merely by having human body doll has the same kind of bank as human the pcs bank is not native to the corporeal self he is packing around as an identification card incidentally doll bodies rot drunk by inhaling alcohol vapors actually drinking would wreck the machinery we dramatize this nowadays with the brandy snifter any mass accumulated to the pc accumulates on his prime postulate the prime postulate is the basic purpose or goal of person there can be secondary prime postulate in any lifetime it is the alteration of the prime postulate that occurs in the course of trying to put it into effect that causes mass to accumulate from the shift of attention and direction that inhibits the persons ability to asis change of attention is change and energy is change there is lot to be understood about how mass evolves out of alterisness if something goes from point to point b with change point must be point b by introducing space you introduce via space is via that causes and necessitates change in or of anything occurring within it that is one of the first things that happens in the course of building universe once you have time shift of attention causes motionlessness in time accumulation dissipation interchanges of masses dislocations in space etc after awhile we get an individual who obsessively changes there are two things wrong with human personality 1 too much constancy 2 too much inconstancy auditors do these two things they resist change even when it is sensible and they obsessively introduce change when it is not required constancy without understanding without reason is simply characteristic of mest so is change one should understand why one is being constant before being constant one should also understand what he is undertaking before he introduces alteration 214unlike life oddly enough auditing does not necessarily bring about its own track and its own mass because it is short track and it is singularly deprived of duress it is not something to worry about unless done in knuckleheaded fashion which puts person beyond help that would be crime you could audit someone badly enough it would probably take auditing him on the wrong goal to kill him perhaps but it would take some doing in prepchecking we had problem there is problem of alteration and problem of too great constancy one of the problems is that an inconstancy of approach by the auditor causes more trouble than an unusual solution heals buttons can be wonderful in the right circumstances but if the auditor is inventing them intuiting what is needed they can improve the pcs case but they lower his confidence because he cant predict what the auditor will say next the pc keeps coming out of session with his attention on the auditor this violates the definition of insessionness if you have constancy that works the four midruds that takes lot of edge off the case there could be more but what you are trying to do with model session is to make the pc auditable and to cause him to continue to be auditable the virtue of model session lies not in its processing value but in its predictability value and in the fact that it takes the edge off the things most likely to distract the pc hidden in any case is basic purpose prime postulate and earlier prime postulates it is amazing that we even have processes like model session and prepchecking that do something for the case over the top of those goals it is incredible that these processes make the pc feel better all the auditor wants them to do is to smooth out the needle so that he can find the pcs goal the conflict of goals is the senior aberration on the case any alteration of goal adds mass to it and the bank it is amazing that you can handle handle case phenomena with other processes assists etc but you cant solve the case permanently without recourse to goals it is difficult and sometimes impossible to help someone who has overts against that which is trying to help him you have to set the pc up by getting them off dont get spoiled by having good luck with one pc most require setup the other problem is metering you can ruin an emeters effectiveness on gradient by not quite really cleaning ruds as you hit them by neglecting instant reads an inexperienced auditor who overlooks the tiny reads that occur on ruds questions can easily and shortly get the pc into barely readable meter which only reads on the greatest of greats the auditor misses withholds from there on out that is the problem ending cycle too soon on ruds because of missing reads the other problem is being too careful and cleaning ruds that are already clean model session run strictly by the book is still not muzzled session the auditor still must maintain 2wc with the pc and can make sure the pc is content the rud is clean too many auditors withdraw from the session leaving model session to do the job and the pc wondering whether we are alive at all an advantage of repetitive rudiments is that only one skill is needed for repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking one of the problems is teaching number of technologies or procedures it is better to have one done superlatively than ten done indifferently repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking tend to get the pc talking to you cheerfully and happily blowing things and feeling better if they dont you are probably doing something unusual with them 6207c10 shspec169 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part ii repetitive process is one that is run over and over with the pc answering and the auditor acknowledging it is run to precise flat point when used with ruds and prepchecking you run it to clean needle and further beginning ruds would always he done repetitive early in auditing you would also do middle and end rudiments repetitively it is kind of prepcheck in disguise thereafter you would run middle and end ruds as fast ruds you would normally run the random rudiment missed withhold as fast rudiment not as repetitive rudiment you may have to fish around for it be very sure you get it answered the repetitive rud approach was first used in sec checking where it was quite successful prepchecking using the withhold system running chains was too hard to teach auditors also this system is hard to use with poorly reading arc breaky pc it is not as successful as repetitive prepchecking the average auditor gets more done with repetitive prepchecking and the pc gets into session better with this method dont use more rudiments than you find in model session though 215you can make them understandable eg to child if you seem to need more rudiments you still have the solution the arc breaky pc comes to pieces on ow so ow is added to model session it can be used when the pc is so involved in some upset that he cant pay any attention to the rest of the session his attention is so fixated that any change of his attention will lead to arc breaks and upsets the other time ow is used is when pc is seriously ill too ill to be audited this situation is handled with general ow as the first rudiment general ow goes into model session right after start of session the commands are what have you done to another withheld from another it is not run against the meter it is run against the pc it can get his ta moving some pcs with highly automatic bank with everything grouped and all in motion will give you multiple picture reaction when you ask them one question the pc goes all over the time track this is not very common but when you run into it it is hard to control the pc and they cant run well on anything except ow the pc who complains of auditing result is likely to have an automatic bank you will find this out if you ask what is happening when you give the pc command however these pcs will respond to ow and get excellent ta so if you notice that you had gotten good ta on ow just move it into the body of the session otherwise run it until the pc feels much better and then do the ruds if you notice that you had gotten ta on ow when you never had much on anything else resume the ow you cant really run the ta out of it because of the breadth of the question if the pc comes into session arc broken all that would happen if you asked are you willing to talk to about your difficulties would be screams and snarls letting the pc commit overts against the auditor you dont ask what have you done to etc because you may be allergic on his terminal line besides this would be putting the pcs attention on the auditor but you can run general ow if the pc seems to be withholding things and having hard time you can use missed withhold as random rudiment thats what random means can be used at any time checked against the meter so you can use ow and the pc will eventually settle down and look calmer then go into your ruds if one of the questions may have read when you checked it and you are not sure dont pretend give the pc the rfactor that the read is equivocal and recheck ideally your metering should be so good that you use the ta to control the needle so that it is sitting exactly at set exactly at the end of your question not still bouncing back from somewhere else never try to read needle on fast rise always distrust fast rises goal doesnt have enough impulse to read down against fast rise it will show up as tiny slow if you see it read at all the needle that is flying around has inertia and slight read can get missed so be suspicious and dont hesitate to call read equivocal and recheck be sure it is clean before you call it clean or the pc will know that he is getting by the meter and will read less and less on the meter you will then have to go back over all your earlier zero questions and see that one gave tiny read dont miss it this time clean them all up and you will build the case back to reading well the only time in rudiments that you ask pc to amplify or reneat his answer is when you didnt understand it if you fake an understanding you are disturbing the knowingness button this button is the most serious one you can push in case dont fail to understand the pc while acting as though you do the onus of understanding and of making something understood is on the auditor tr4 is not q and you are asking for comprehension so that an asisness can take place you ask rudiment question until the pc has more answers without checking the meter if you get read on checking the question you use it to guide the pc who doesnt know what it was into seeing what was still there after getting the pcs answer you then leave the meter until the pc says again because he will now give you all the locks when it is clean ask do you agree that was clean and tr4 whatever he says dont go back to the rudiment if he says he doesnt agree the exact same procedure is used for repetitive prepchecking it depends on the mechanism of cycling on the track to pick up the basic pcs will stay in session quite cheerily with this it takes longer than using the withhold system but it is much easier and more certain as long as you clean all the reads you get the pc will be cheerful and easy to audit if you miss few the pc will become nattery and hard to audit by virtue of not reading well 216if you make the opposite mistake of asking the question again after it was clean hell hath arc breaks like the one you have thereby set up this is because thetan is closest to nothing and you have given him nothingness withhold missed withhold of nothing that is very upsetting to thetan because 1 there is nothing there so he cant spot it or asis it 2 he is closest to nothing himself so he feels as if he himself has been missed you didnt buy nothing so nothing is unacknowledged so therefore he is unacknowledged so dont try to clean read that is not there this system of repetitive rudiments and prepchecking has liability it pulls the pc thoroughly into session and builds up fantastic arc between the auditor and the pc then if the auditor speaks his mind inopportunely or goes on automatic the arc break will be magnitudinous just because of the degree to which the pc is in session this system was invented because due to the fact that pcs were not well in session auditors were having trouble getting pcs to read on the meter auditor tr1 also contributed to the problem commonly and in social context meter is inoperative the pc has to be in session to some degree for the meter to react at all social conversation wont activate meter the better arc you have with the pc the better the meter reads meters are not like lie detectors lie detector reads because of terror an emeter reads on arc the pc knows that it doesnt matter what overt he gets off you are not going to turn him in if you miss reads they operate as missed withholds and the pc ceases to read well the repetitive system gets the pc talking about his case before you read the meter so it will work where nothing else does 6207c12 shspec174 meter reading scientific research follows certain laws and we have been rigorous in following those laws in scientology when you can get research problem down to one variable voila you are there during the last couple of months having observed that auditors werent uniformly getting unvarying results lrh took every variable out of technology that he could stripping it down and testing it to the point where we now have model session and repetitive prepchecking the meter once developed had to be refined and it was yet pcs were still wobbly at times so last night lrh watched three auditors to see what they were doing and found the one variable the meter read it works out this way all you have to do to louse up session is 1 clean one thing that is clean or 2 miss cleaning something that reacts there is little to choose as to which is the most serious person has certain knowingness matter how occluded and packed in he is the thetan always knows there is instinct as intuitiveness he knows you cant fool pc an auditor who tries is misguided pc knows when question is hot even if he doesnt know the answer he also knows when question is cold he has somethingnothing sensitivity he requires help to know what is there or to get high degree of certainty that there is nothing there his intuitive feelingness is not articulate and there is need to transfer it over into an analytical knowingness when you invalidate the knowingness of thetan you will get trouble the thetan can put up with this but he doesnt have to like it he doesnt like it even though he is used to it and has put up with got of it and been overwhelmed by it he has used it as pitch on others and to overwhelm others pcs arc breaks with his auditor are much more serious than his arc breaks with others you have heightened the pcs intuitive feelingness by putting him in session now if you tell him rud is out when it is in or in when he knows it is out he has long way to fall from his heightened in session awareness and elevated tone level it is severe shock and he gets an arc break he is now out of agreement with the auditor to the degree that he was formerly in agreement if youve got an agreement thats built as high as the empire state building the first scrap of disagreement will appear 217as high as that the pc will feel awful he is finally on the road to truth after all the trillenia and here is falsity it is very upsetting cleaning clean is the mistake that is most mysterious because the pc cant find what is wrong because it is nothing you can flub once on trs and still have the session going ok but if you leave one flubbed read your session will go to pot if you are accustomed to auditing with sloppy metering you have completely different idea of what auditing is like the things that are supposed to be in session arent there and auditing is basically protest not letting the auditor get too close auditing is as fast as pc is in session since the more he is in session the more easily he blows things pc is there to be audited and is very persistent as thetan thetan can he squashed and overwhelmed yet he never stops trying this is very noticeable in handling children thetan will keep reaching using disabilities to do so if all else fails if you set up perfect session and then and wild wrongness at some point you catch the pc off balance and he goes into action reactively he is powerless to stop himself from acting it is as if you had the bank all stretched out like rubber band and someone suddenly let go of one end he is in mess he gets overwhelmed and starts dramatizing whatever is handy namely one of thousands of instances where he is still trying he will take such an incident and use it against the auditor this can get rather subtle the pc can convince the auditor that he has obtained results but then let someone else see that he hasnt made any progress he does this in such way that the auditor will find out about it it is good to know that meter reading is all that is wrong auditors have learned trs model session and repetitive prepchecking fine and we have taken havingness out of beginning ruds to eliminate that source of difficulty when we found that havingness takes the pcs attention off the bank and extroverts him which isnt good for putting the pc in session it is better to use ow to get his havingness up this also puts his attention on the bank your problems with pcs are the same old things communication control keeping the pcs attention on what he is doing getting your question answered etc you have mastered these things then sometimes had them deteriorate at which point you have been persuaded into unusual solutions q and doing something else getting anxious etc the pc is out of session its baffling what happens to cause this outofsessionness you missed meter read this wrongness may be missed by all the instructors and supervisors who see all the wrongnesses that follow from it and correct them to result lots of other wrongnesses may get located but they arent really what wrecks the session the ultimate session wrecker is the misread meter this arc breaks the pc all to hell he will start reading on arc breaks not reading because of arc breaks etc and you wind up with dogs breakfast this results from the calling of reads that arent there and missing the ones that are there the missed withholds and the missed withholds of nothing if this goes on for many sessions the pc goes on selfaudit because he doesnt trust the meter the pc cant have an auditor because he cant have the meter so he audits himself he gets anxious he keeps his own rudiments in like gopher sitting at the edge of his hole ready to duck the pc is running the session on himself purely because of bad meter calls so metering above all must be perfect there is tolerance whatever in it you must not miss single read meter reading must be perfect or you become dangerous auditor dangerous auditor is one who might miss read just one in session if read is equivocal say so and check again 6207c12 shspec175 meter training auditors make mistakes reading meters while the basic reason for this is in their banks poor metering can be countered educationally the first requirement for accurate reading of meter is good eyesight the first thing we find wrong is that the auditor cant see it may he necessary for him to wear glasses unpopular though that is amongst scientologists when case assessment form on new pc we should take something with extremely small print like railway timetable or the stock market report in the newspaper and hold it as far from the pcs face as meter would be and have him read it if he can read it make note on the assessment form that his eyesight is good with glasses if that is true if he cant read it put down eyesight poor this will make ds of p and ds of t aware that his metering may be suspect when he starts to audit check eyesight again when doing 218practical sections on auditing courses since persons eyesight changes with auditing recheck the eyesight if as an auditor he gets crammed for gae lets assume that all auditors who goof have something wrong with metering how wide is present time this is the next area to look into one could have an awareness of present time as much as ten minutes wide lrh has this at least for movie and tv plots clear can tell fifty to hundred feet before an intersection whether there is anything coming he may find himself seeing the truck coming around the corner before it does he is not looking around corners he may think that it is new linear perception but it is not its just that pt has gotten bit wider than the instant that most people perceive he has wider fringe of knowingness really sharp athlete also has wider pt for instance sam snead can look from the point of driving the ball to the point where it lands and know where it lands as he hits it great athletes control both ends of broadened pt so you get holeinone perfectly placed serve etc they are always exterior and the axioms seem very obvious to them they dont think of their present time as continued motion motion doesnt happen randomly in their pt they think of it as continued control when they are doing something they are controlling all the motion in that present time because they are in that present time and they have the width of that present time to decide it is as if at the end of two seconds they could undecide what they decided at the beginning of the two seconds so they have tremendous judgment they know which decision is right because they saw it happen they can perceive both motion and stillness as total isness then theres the guy whose pt is one thousandth of second wide he is in continuous anxiety and regret it is always all wrong that is crazy mans present time he doesnt even know if the bed will continue to sit on the floor you only get the idea of continuance by perceiving across span of time not by comparing different times the less pt person has the more trouble he has with the perception of motion and stillness so you can run look around here and tell something you are absolutely certain will be here in one second and keep increasing the timespan you could drill the persons perception into broadening of pt you could also run look around here and find something thats having an effect on an effect or look around this room and find something thats having an effect on something else the latter will occasionally turn on very widened pt such processes are really drills rather than processes an auditor needs to have broader pt than most if he is to be able to spot speeded rise for instance reading meter is spotting motion nomotion and change of rate of motion when it exists this is beyond perception it is matter of consecutive awareness there are three moments that must be perceived to find out if needle is still 1 the moment before it wasnt moving 2 the moment it is still it isnt moving 3 the moment after it will not move you need comparison you are not just looking at one moment moving needle requires only two observations two moments of awareness thus it is easier to read than still needle for instance sitting pheasant is harder to see than moving pheasant not because motion attracts the eye or some such reason but because motion requires only two observations to perceive while stillness requires three motion takes part of the responsibility for directing attention whereas stillness takes responsibility for directing attention in perceiving motion all you have to do is to observe that something was in place and is now in place how narrowly can places and b be spaced and still have perceptible motion between them one tenth of the width of the tip of the needle apart the next question is what section of the present time you are in do you require to perceive an action or an inaction this opens the door to the solution of this problem broadening pt is best done by clearing but it wouldnt work to insist that auditors must be clear before they can clear someone actually clear raw meat with comprehension or reality on what has happened is enormously inferior to someone who has the data and goes clear training gives subjective reality on what it is like to wrestle with the problems of clearing someone trained individuals have capability to understand people while clear raw meat is likely to be very impatient with people raw clear will also ask the damndest questions he is very oddball and unpredictable this guy has been launched 219into the atmosphere and expected to fly without knowing that he is in plane it is better to go clear with the data you get more comprehending people that way because it takes more time to see stillness an individual has less tolerance for it hence person is impatient with observing stillnesses his continuance has to be too great stillnesses absorb time they give sense of foreverness something that moves does not have to have such continuance however the period of time required to perceive motion or stillness can be shortened until the person can observe in the tiniest narrowest pt three moments stillness or two moments motion of time you do this by practice and drill if persons span of pt is twentieth of second long he would need to be able to perceive an instant of time that is longer than sixtieth of second in order to be able to observe three moments in time in his pt and therefore to be able to perceive that the needle is still he must be able to perceive an isness that is only sixtieth of second long the amount of pt someone can observe can be tested with camera you could set the lens wide open and vary exposure time the less pt span they can observe the smaller the diameter of lens that they will be able to perceive at given speed suitable target would be to get to where we can perceive an isness in hundred and twentyfifth of second people can be drilled to get up to this speed without broadening their pt you could do it gradiently by flashing say slide of chair for one second over and over until the students can actually tell you all about the chair then cut it down to half second quarter of second etc until you reach hundred and twentyfifth of second the student will gradiently improve until he can get everything in the slide in hundred and twentyfifth of second the name for the viewing device is variable speed tachistoscope the navy used this system during world war ii for an aircraft identification drill it is now being used to teach reading and to improve reading speed even without these devices you can learn to read meter this is necessary and now we know that it will he done the result of the training should be an auditor who can tell that still needle is present given only twentieth to sixtieth of seconds observation time the old saw about the eye having shutter speed of about twentyfifth of second is stupid lie there is thetan in back of the eye who has width of pt and who tends to fixate on what he considers an observable moment 6207c17 shspec170 emeter reads and arc breaks meter reading has been exposed as the one point that must be done perfectly there is tr4 phenomenon connected with the meter the meter read wrong at all operates to throw tr4 out in the session the pc has an answer which the meter hasnt acknowledged as far as the pc can tell so he gets mad at the meter really but not knowing what to get mad at he misassigns the blame and his anger to something else the pc has had withhold missed or the auditor cleans clean he calls read where there isnt one and the meter starts reacting on the pcs arc break incidentally the wording of listing lines has been amended see p 259 for original wording on wantnot want the wording has to use the exact warding of the goal eg to catch cats not the goal to catch cats and on opposenot oppose it has to be the participial form eg catching cats precise english is very junior in importance to wording it as given by the pc in the metering errors mentioned above only one thing is occurring you are violating an old overlooked law that you mustnt acknowledge lie or accept lie as truth what is this about it is about prime postulate see the discussion of the first four postulates on pp 1415 above 3ga demonstrates the similarity of construction between reactive bank and universe universe is formed by prime postulate which then alterised makes matter energy space and time the pc has basic purpose or goal indistinguishable from prime postulate therefore prime postulate or the pcs basic goal or purpose is the basic building block of the reactive bank the primeprime postulate would be the basicbasic of the goal or purpose on which all else would be stuck cf 220expanded dianetics you wont get it on the first try you cant just date it on the meter and have it blow because it has occurred earlier and has gotten mingled in with later occurrences so dont worry about it just take what you get on goals list the keynote of the reactive bank with all its masses spaces and everything else in it is alteris which suppresses down into notis this forms the mest that is contained in the bank the same mechanism exactly applies to the formation of the physical universe thus the field of the mind is parallel to that of the physical universe but the mind came first and thus formed the universe it is fantastic for being to discover this because this discovery is in violation of the principle behind the formation of matter space etc this discovery reverses the downward spiral what starts the downward spiral and makes it denser is acceptance of alteris as fact this is something every thetan knows way down deep he must not do and what every thetan that ever got in trouble has done thetan gets nervous when he starts to suspect that he has been accepting alteris as fact if he accepts too many alter ises as fact he goes into an overwhelm he is overwhelmed by lies the priests of muggy muggy god made out of mud can make lots of converts using this principle if everyone protests muggy muggy the lie enough and if the priests can collect to themselves enough motivators in other words if they can can get the people to commit enough overts against muggy muggy muggy muggy overwhelms the people this is how you get zealots fanatics and atheists they all form chaotic mess resulting from fighting an alteris of the facts religious mechanisms have been the most powerful source of alterisness of mind and forms they get protested against most strongly and thetans get overwhelmed by them most easily the biggest alter is you could make is the misassignment of source of creation or alteris of thought these exist in the seventh and eighth dynamics the most fruitful source of lies and commotion is anything that has to do with creation false assignment of the source of creation produces randomity all out of proportion to the act of making the false assignment this act is in itself the father of all chaos being almost on the truth makes it very bad the most powerful protests follow the most extreme alterisnesses hence the violence of religious wars if you misassign the source of any part of cycle of action in fact you will get grossly disproportionate upset try going to museum during an exhibition of rembrandt and pointing out all the picassos people will argue with you and get very misemotional etc any chaos in the universe will be found to exist by reason of misassignment of who created it for instance george washington is thought to be one of the sources of of the us government yet the fact that he actually tore up the minutes of the constitutional convention is virtually unknown this is what is wrong with the us there is lot of missing data concerning its source we dont know what the basic purpose of the founding fathers was basic purpose alterised creates mass and degeneration of tone people who think lrh has alterised scientology and dianetics dont realize that we are operating on backwards track cutting into the most fundamental fundamental we can cut into regardless of the forward progress of time we are swimming against the timestream suddenly on isolation of importances we are back in the early fifties with basic purpose and prime postulate this is all book one stuff see p 270 above weve gone down some blind alleys like 3dxx if you do 3dxx line or prehav line you are listing wrong things which just adds more alteris to the bank 3dxx was the ridge that lrh found before prime purpose 3dxx was alterising the pcs goal we have gone forward on the time track and at the same time we have run the fundamentals back now we are at fundamental that runs out everything that we have put on the time track unless you follow some such pattern as this pattern of scientology research you cant backtrack the complexity of structure of mind or universe to simplicity sufficient to do something about it thats what we have done and we find to our great surprise that what is wrong with the pc is his prime postulate his goal thats unexpected thats weird complete whizzer george washington is not what is right with the us he is what is wrong with the us similarly pcs goal is what is wrong with the pc if the individual is longer able to adequately do something its probably his goal itll be the one thing that kinda makes you sigh and that you retreat from goal itself isnt really what is wrong with the person it is really the alteris of his goal departures from his goal line his inabilities to commit this goal to action that is what gives him his bank if he never altered his goal he would probably he all right the pcs goal was selfpostulated truth that never got acknowledged but all around him lies got acknowledged and this baffled him 221thats really all the thetan is protesting truth never gets acknowledged and lies always get acknowledged thats the basis of thetans misemotions all thetans operate on these same buttons so when you make it clear in session that you are not acknowledging or taking up truth the pc gets upset thats cleaning clean read when you say he has something he hasnt got he gets upset he also gets upset when you say he hasnt got something that he has got cleaning clean or missing read is an alteris and an acknowledgment of lie nothing upsets pc or thetan more than this so misreading the meter is betrayal that strikes at the heart of his thetanesque soul he will try from then on to get the truth of the matter across to you you dont have pc anymore you have crusader for truth armed and mounted we mustnt have more alteris than weve already dot because that is how we got in this mess in the first place an arc break is an abandonment of truth and an acknowledgment of lies in session you are running extreme truth and the pc knows it he can feel it every time you misread meter you have entered lie into the session this is the thetans favorite bogeyman you have just hit on the issue of the whole construction and destruction of universes and of his bank and he doesnt like it being that way you have made the session agree with all the slave tricks that have ever been pulled on him when he thought you were his friend getting him untrapped so put in lie misread the meter and all hell breaks loose thats why it is essential to read meter correctly every time it is doable so dont worry about not being able to learn how 6207c17 shspec171 anatomy of arc breaks tr1 is based on the desire to get response from the pc if you dont want to know tr1 will be out if you misread the meter the pc will arc break but he wont assign cause rightly he will give you some reason for the arc break which in itself might be true ie real outness but the actual cause is earlier even if he says that it is that you missed read its an earlier missed read that did the damage there is always that much alteris in the pcs protest if you touch pcs bank you put him into state of alteris because he is in state of alteris already he will frequently do something other than what you have told him to do if you let him get away with it he will become unauditable therefore never ask yes responsetype question without asking what it was this way you spot the alteris the pc thinks he is doing what you said but you mustnt acknowledge lie by letting him get away with this the degree that pcs alteris monitors the degree to which they protest alteris or acknowledgment of alteris telling someone to do something without having control of him is asking for trouble you should go into this by gradients since you are asking for trouble if you try to control him at distance before he is up to it dont acknowledge an improperly done command it is fatal to q and with the pcs alteris the pc acts as though it will please him for you to acknowledge his alteris but it doesnt pc who starts giving the auditor orders has ceased to accept the auditor as the auditor because the auditor acknowledged some alteris awhile earlier note that this arc break or attempt to control the session occurs some time after the missed withhold resulting from some alteris both involuntary and meterread missed withholds result from wrong acknowledgment i would not q and with the pcs order i would ask when did you first think i didnt hear you or what happened earlier in the session the arc break could appear up to an hour and half after the missed withhold that caused it so dont expect when asking for the missed withhold that it just happened here is just what occurs arc makes up understanding if you fail to understand what the pc said arc breaks down this is bad tr4 at this point willingness to talk to the auditor drops out and so does interest in his own case because the pc feels that he doesnt understand as much about his case as he thought he did the greater ones understanding the easier it is to blow things the auditor must understand and the pc must understand for the pc to blow anything asisness depends on understandingness alteration always pursues failure to understand notisness accompanies the notion of incomprehensibility that is what happens with the insane they are notised because they are incomprehensible the deepest lie is pretending to understand the alteris all people have to do to make some advance is to come off their high horse and admit the lack of understanding and not pretend to understand when one snarls about pc just recall the first time one didnt understand the pc 222understanding is in the area of knowing and notknowing see pp 1415 above for discussion of the first four postulates that is vary highechelon pair of postulates they come right after native state so they are rather esoteric buttons for lot of people and can lay an egg but severed communication line with the missed withholds involved is very comprehensible hence the idea of missed withhold communicates well its mechanics are easy to handle one kind of missed withhold is communication intended and not received this is unacknowledged truth the inadvertent withhold that one makes the pc scream like banshee since it is right on the button of the creation of his mind and the universe for instance if the pc cant get its hot in here acknowledged he will try to make it stick if he possibly can even manifesting it physiologically the other kind of missed withhold is failure to find out something wrong the pc has put through lie which you have acknowledged either way the session blows up for instance the pc says i have never had anything to do with women in my whole life gin answer to question about women this is very low reality probably due to an original low affinity so you dont give an acknowledgment you dont buy that you check the question on the meter you cannot create an arc break by establishing truth only by refusing truth and accepting lies it is never wise or kind to permit someone to depart from truth in order to spare their feelings the emeter isnt liedetector it is truthverifier the auditor uses it to establish the truth if he can establish the truth of the situation and acknowledge it he will never have an arc break this requires that an auditor not be shy about establishing the truth even if the pc is protesting and blushing the only way you will come out friend of the pc is by establishing truth the idea that social lies are necessary is one of the mechanisms for making more bank actually if you told only the truth for twentyfour hours you would do very well you would have real friends but it requires strong man to enter into this because there may be repercussions the first part may be rough but eventually it has its reward the way down is stepping back from the truth if an auditor goes into session with social mores and kindness in play the session will go to pot you can build whole universe out of bad auditing because of alteris that is why your metering has to be one hundred percent accurate and your tr4 has to include understanding the pc pc will forgive lot of fumbling if it is clear that the auditors intention is to establish truth it is better to be knucklehead than to know it all you can even act stupid as way of making sure you understand an auditor must establish truth 6207c19 shspec172 the emeter the emeter was devised as an aid to help an auditor observe pc it certainly beats fingers on pulses the first mathison meter wasnt built as modified wheatstone bridge until emeters were developed people thought such galvanometers were reading sweat not thought because the earlier galvanometers were so insensitive engineers and electronics men in scientology have not always recognized the possibility of meter that directly reads electric thoughtimpulses not the physical results of these thoughtimpulses homemade emeters built by people who do know something about psychogalvanometers often have builtin lag which is meant to protect the movement the needle is damped down so reads are late you read sweat etc hence instant reads the first mathison meter wouldnt read on large percentage of people so lrh got mathison to expand it by the end of 1952 we had pretty good meter the very first meter had tiny electrodes little metal bars and didnt give mental reads lrh and jim elliot got the idea of using soup cans which did result in being able to get reads the emeter can detect whether pc is auditable it is coincidence that it just happens that when you can read pc on meter that pc is in good shape when persons needle is in constant agitated rockslam eg with real manicdepressive or schitzophrenic psychotic metered process works on them anyway cchs are all you can use fortunately they are available if you can read the meter on him he can be audited on think process eg prepchecking the meter ran us into complete culdesac we had had knowledge of the whole track before but the meter made it clear how many engrams there were this made dianetics look wrong as long as you audited only this lifetime you could make someone look very good but it was obviously impossible to run out every engram on the whole track because the number is infinite 223lrh in the past had refused to let pcs be subjected to experimental processes because they might get their heads blown off sometimes he used himself as guinea pig for that reason the board of the first dianetic foundation started to resign when lrh started looking at whole track they discovered at that point that hubbard could get mad his attitude was that one was going to say what could or could not be researched they decided that he must not be clear at that time which was the time of early research with the emeter and history of man 1952 lrh and msh went down to the library and started looking up words they came up with scio and ology this seemed to express what we wanted moving out of the field of the mind into the field of knowing the mind is only vessel of knowledge so new approach was required exteriorization started coming up lrh and msh went to phoenix one night evans farber showed up and wouldnt go away lrh finally asked him what he wanted and found that he had discovered the process try not to be three feet back of your head as an exteriorization process that was practically the end of the emeter because you cant read thetan who is out of his head lrh tried to develop thetameter the trouble was that it detected the auditor as well as the thetan who was the pc because it didnt require one to be exterior to read on it it was very simple electronically it used magic eye type detector in about 1955 or 1956 emeters went out of use they revived after the clearing acc probably in 5802c07 19acc15 help how to get started and 5802c13 19acc19 other processes the help button other tape titles from this acc may be more relevant but i dont have them in the us when lrh assessed people with the meter don breeding joe wallace pinkham and others were working on meters and one of them designed transistorized emeter in 1957 it was found to be very useful in clearing people it was used with fiveway help bracket to clear fifteen or twenty out of seventy people as long as lrh did the assessment we know now that the people who went clear were those who had beingness goal and chose the terminal of that beingness goal to run on the fiveway help they made first dynamic keyedout clear that is you could clear anyone with help whose terminal was also his goal the trick of assessment was to find the rock which would sometimes coincide with the wording of goal this got meters back in when it became clear that you wouldnt clear anyone without meter this was horrible because lrh had never been able to teach an auditor to use one not that he had tried very hard the step six phenomenon that was run into not long afterwards was the result of running someone on button that wasnt on his goal line not from creativeness beefing up the bank per if his goal was run out or desensitized you could then run any creative process with bad effect otherwise the button of alteration of creativeness can get activated which is the bankcreator see pp 285287 above when bank starts to go solid thats fun the difficulties of auditors finding correct rock loomed enormously we now had two factors that were missing 1 we needed technology that would unwind any accidental out of this package of clearing so there would be unknown data 2 we needed to get to the point where an auditor could interpret the data we did find the first british meters were copies of american meters fowler and allen built them at first with idea of what they were building one day lrh sat allen down and ran responsibility process on him on whatever he was looking at put him on the meter located his dead warcompanion that he felt he had overts on and found that he was looking at window surrounded by blackness he ran responsibility for this scene and got more and more room in the picture suddenly he got the whole sequence with full kinesthesia all sensations and more stuck picture lrh explained bits and pieces about the emeter to fowler and allen they went on to build the mark ii iii and eventually the mark iv with an improved circuit they also worked on an ot meter the job of the meter is still what it always was to detect what the pc has in the reactive bank it is incidental that the meter detects ruds problems or what the pc is thinking or doing or whatever what we need most is to know what he has in the bank so that the bank can be assessed the emeter has been designed and must be designed to detect the pcs prime postulate otherwise you wont clear anyone if meter wont detect prime postulate in an individual it is useless even if it could be 224used to get ruds in good meter must be very sensitive yet not pick up everything that the pc is doing physically but this has not been the main liability of meters the liability has always been auditor reading now that this has been singled out as the weakest point in auditing it can get fixed also more is known now about meter reads and auditor ability all the auditor is missing on is certainty on whether the needle read or is clean trouble with knowing when it read is solved by not looking until you say the last syllable and by drilling on when the needle is or isnt reading so all auditors must learn to read an emeter or they simply cannot audit you have to be able to detect the thing in the mind that is keeping the pc from being clear you ve got to learn to read meters good safe auditor can read meter an unsafe one cannot 6207c26 shspec179 prepchecking some of the data in this lecture is found also in hcob 30ju162 smooth hgc 25 hour intensive see also page 254 above for history of prepchecking ive just found way to use middle rudiments and make them double in brass and get the job done much better in prepchecking suppress suggest careful of invalidate and fail to reveal are powerful prepcheck buttons they should be used in the above order used in this order you have the midruds as complete prepcheck the middle rudiments were carefully sorted out of great number of buttons that could be used you could add another fifteen or twenty buttons the chart of attitudes see handbook for preclears has lot of them ruds are buttons that consist of just those things that can keep one of the other buttons from reading and which if present can keep goal or item from reading they are pretty powerful suppress if you got suppress off the case nearly everything would blow if suppress is alive you dont get read on the remainder of the buttons so run suppress before adding another series of anything suggest this button could be and sometimes has to be translated as isness that is evaluation per the auditors code 1 it says that something is it is powerful button because you say something is it will now read even though it wasnt reading before you say something reads which doesnt and the pc can jam on it and it will now read it will at least read on disagreement suggest neednt be used in midruds since auditors dont do it much save it for prepchecks invalidate if goal or item is invalidated it will read even when it is not the goal or item get the inval off and it will longer read suppress on top of inval keeps the inval from showing up that is why suppress goes first as button fail to reveal this button is off the line it gives you the dirty needle minute rockslam careful of this is another suppress with an added characteristic after the person has been having something little offbeat done for little while he can hang up in the thing if he becomes too careful of something or other he can also make an item read by reverse suppression by carefully not suppressing it ie by making sure it reads the order of the buttons would be suppress suggest careful of invalidate fail to reveal 225this is an optimum arrangement that puts the most important button last as far as session foulups are concerned this also gives you two cracks at suppression if these buttons are so strong they must have some value they make great prepcheck zero questions as lrh found more or less by accident while cleaning up pc who had been feeling poorly the procedure for the problems intensive is as follows see also p 134 above and hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion as well as the current hcob of 30jul62 1 sort out the chief selfdetermined change the pc has made using assessment by elimination or greatest read for purposes of assessment each change should be expressed in few words plus date 2 get the confusion that preceded the change and date it keep the pc to the just prior confusion this should be anywhere from five minutes to two weeks earlier dont let the pc go way back on the track 3 go month earlier in case he didnt remember the overt that started the confusion 4 prepcheck since the above date when you use the above procedure pcs are very willing to tell you things they have suppressed somatics come off also dont also check midruds on the period you are prepchecking you might think that you wouldnt reach basic on any chain by using the above method of prepchecking but since you are taking up the buttons in this sequence and they seem like such innocent buttons they clear away lot of track without your having to worry about fundamentals and basic omitting the withhold system left us with way to get to basic it appears that with this system you dont have to bother you could start in all over again if the pc had given it shallow pass on the first time through and pick up deeper fundamentals however the hazard in doing so is that you might be cleaning clean also be very sure not to leave question unflat that is very important since in so doing you could give him missed withholds and he could blow or create big storm and feel terrible for fiftyhour intensive you could also do prepcheck in this lifetime this system gets the pcs withholds easily and voluntarily just be sure to follow the rules and dont be an idiot make sure the pc understands the question to audit small child you might have to reword it to get it to communicate on any pc you want to be sure to communicate know what you are trying to communicate if you find the pc unable to answer or with very few answers dont blame it on the pcs caginess or unwillingness you have to more the communication so it does bite if you do that the prepcheck will unstack the bank in its natural sequence which is always desirable in sec checking and prepchecking it is very repetitive action there is another way to use repetitive prepchecking 1 sort out by assessment the persons selfdetermined decisions get the most charged oldtime problems intensive style make sure it is selfdetermined 2 date the problem 3 date the confusion prior to the decision found in 1 the pc will slide away from the prior confusion if you dont keep him looking for it dont let him find one five years before it is just prior confusion 4 date the beginning of the prior confusion and go month earlier 5 prepcheck it since date found in 4 pc tends to see himself as pawn on the board of life the liability of taking an otherdetermined chain is that you will get into chain of engrams this system doesnt handle engrams so watch it it is ok however to get sometimes coming off on dating the prior confusion if you let the date he 226few years earlier you will miss it the prior confusion is the period when he was creating the problem for which the decision is solution the sequence for this this mechanism is 1 the pc commits overts all over the place and has withholds missed on him like mad 2 this causes problem for him 3 he makes decision to solve the problem this is the selfdetermined change all this is part of an effort to make prepchecking beefier and more effective and farreaching you might feel shy of doing prepcheck if you werent pretty sure of getting good result somatics and conditions like postpartum depression will blow without your having to run engrams and getting the pc stuck in the incident the success you will have will depend on the excellence of your meter reading how thoroughly the pc is in session and how well you clean up each question prepchecking is relatively permissive system that gradiently lets the pc get himself into confrontable soup it doesnt overwhump the pc but it must be metered right 6208c09 shspec182 clearing what are you as an auditor trying to do you are trying to clear people you should recognize that all processes are subordinate to this end to be clearable person has to be auditable if someone cant talk listen or respond he is unauditable you arent concerned with states of insanity as defined by kraepelin this is subject that is subordinate to scientology we have used the words sanity and insanity for pr purposes but actually we have nothing to do with either there is not person on earth who is sane they are all batty or they wouldnt be here someone who is sane is someone who resolves problems for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics that is sane action and definition of sanity very few people apply that rule people fall into gradient scale of auditability that is what you should study if you are concerned with states of man person who isnt clear wont resolve things for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics even first goal clear wont ordinarily there is processing short of clearing that is worth long arduous hours now that we have 3ga so we become interested in auditability the trick at the moment is to clear someone while he is clearing someone else the struggle for lrh is not to clear people it is to get people to clear people people in the ruds and havingness group are there not because they are unauditable but because they are not able to audit well enough to receive auditing person to be unauditable has to be pretty bad off his auditability is determined by how many overts he is secretly committing while being audited the lowest level of auditability is the person who can be cleaned up who will keep his snoot clean long enough for you to clean up his needle below that level is the pc who will never tell you who wont cooperate or be frank with you at this point auditing ceases to the degree that the auditor cant get the pc to communicate it isnt that the meter wont read though that would also debar auditing almost anybody if not auditable is preparable he is still auditable on cchs and thus he can be prepared for auditing this would also apply to someone who is bleeding to death or in coma the unauditable case will get new body sooner or later so you can get him later if the technology is still there the only case that cant be reached is the one that isnt there and will never hear of scientology dont spend more time than necessary to get the goals any case that can be forced into groove can be audited the case that breaks your heart though is the one that appears auditable but is not really preparable we dont have the tools to handle such case at present the auditability of people depends in large measure on the sphere of influence of the scientologist the sphere of action that will do the world the most good is that of auditable cases they may be nutty amnesic spinbin cases but if they are auditable they can be straightened out some people have nutty idea and know it is nutty others dont know the one who has some hope who knows he can get better can be audited the one who knows one can be helped and that it is all someone elses fault etc may be lot harder to audit the bugginess of their ideas makes difference persons goal could make him sound batty but they could still be audited 227there is nothing wrong with somebody except that he has upped and got himself basic purpose for reasons that are unknown to him then when his basic purpose is disobeyed or blocked off you get bank developed at this point lot of other purposes he doesnt want get hooked on to the first and he follows those and he doesnt know who he is and he gets body etc etc it is incredible that clearing process to unsnarl all this was developed previous efforts at clearing peeled the guy away from the gpm but it was still there so matter how good the pc felt the chance was there that it could key in again the pcs goal is random chance factor for instance in running repetitive processes eg help processes communication processes etc the goal could be never to communicate to anyone or never to help anyone the index of how much good it will do to find and clear the pcs goal is the amount of case gain you can get on person who has had wrong goal found if you sit down with him on meter and handle that goal with the to be tiger drill reference hcob 29nov62 routines 2i2 321 and 3gaxx tiger drill for nulling by midruds see fig 10 clean it until all sensation and pain have gone gone off it you will see more case gain than you have seen for some time what is happening is that finding the wrong goal did keyin of what was there anyway it could have keyed in at any time now you clean it up and it has further effect on him this could lead to wild problems intensive 1 have the pc write list of all the problems that he has had this lifetime 2 ask him what decision would have solved the first second third problem etc etc dont date them they are really goals 3 dust them off lightly with the tiger drill it is little chunk of doing goals list and the pc will get phenomenal relief not that you would necessarily do this on someone it is workable because of the value of decision the bank is basic decision or purpose which has on top of it concatenation of purposes so every time he makes decision he adds look it is simpler though to just do 3ga in the first place and this is also faster and more to the point if you can clear somebody there is reason to do anything else what this means for this planet is quite amazing threequarters of asia became civilized just because of hope that this could be done the tiger drill small tiger uses suppress big tiger uses small tiger buttons invalidated plus nearly found out suggested protest fail to reveal anxious about mistake careful procedure if the goal reads check inval etc until null then checksuppress repetitively to null recheck goal b if the goal doesnt read check suppress patter to be tiger 228c null on this goal has anything been

there was thetan and he couldnt go forwards or backwards he had to stay there and he mustnt stay there the result was that he was overwhelmed he got further orders to evacuate then to advance then to stay there then he caught the barrage his own artillery shelled him he decided then to evacuate but couldnt carry out the orders he is there now in highly charged agitation rockslamming rock slam is cant go cant stay cant come cant leave mustnt be it is highly charged agitation originally while addressing goals on the twentieth acc this was such strong phenomenon that ron used it in assessing to go down the chain to find the rock hence the name dirty needle is tiny persistent rock slam lrh has been spending the past week or so studying rock slams in depth he happened to get criminal on the meter one with known overts against him he saw rock slam turn on and off on this one fact this was very interesting of course the criminal was trapped too in this case however it wasnt goals phenomenon lrh found that you can clean rock slam off missed withhold on someone and end up with dirty needle this is because the pcs attention is on the large overt the rock slam not on the auditor it takes superb tr1 to get past the noread that results from the pcs elsewhereness this was the first evidence that rock slam and dirty needle are signs of overts until the overt is handled the needle wont register the mechanics of failed to reveal is the still point following confusion you should audit the confusion you could only get stuck picture to move by asking what about that picture could you take responsibility for this works because responsibility takes care of the overt stills do not exist without prior confusions except in the case of goals postulates for this reason you can also unstick stuck picture by spotting the prior confusion and the overt the person did the person usually settled the confusion with an overt culture will get stuck and fixed following good confusion too pc will get chronic somatic following an overt or more likely series of overts that involve motion these overts were way of settling confusion politics is an aberration caused by the collective overts of the citizenry you can forecast the next governmental form by looking at the overts the citizens are committing because the government will try to bake those overts legal thus lessening the overt for instance criminal has come to the conclusion that property belongs to nobody he has to come to this conclusion before the 1917 russian revolution the crime rate was very high so the russian government legalized the idea that property belongs to nobody weekness or omitted participation would be the prior overt in socialized state because in such state weakness is legal and rewarded in politics there is only opinion and aberration wisdom 230in research what usually happens is that lrh falls over something for awhile he bumps into it until way to use it occurs auditors have learned to go to failed to reveal when dirty needle shows up failed to reveal is subsequent to an overt there is little to gain by asking for overts though it is too strong but the failed to reveal skims the top tiger drill is effective until you run into persistent rock slam or dirty needle ow has been put in to remedy this it works as long as you get your question answered when it doesnt work it is because the pc is doing something else with the answers if he is technically answering but not giving overts keep clearing the commands the pc may be trying to solve problem with the auditing question lrh found that he could turn on rock slam at will in anyone on goals chain 3ga as it exists is totally workable and will do the job the only problem is doing it faster we have already cleared firstgoal clear who had wild rock slam goals got picked off the top of the gpm to the point where the rock slam showed up this guy has gotten caught in the front lines with bunch of overts and he is sitting in ridge that has enough confusion and enough overts behind it to make him unable to move anyplace so there he is it would be faster to find the first goal if you could just bypass the first three goals of the gpm and only have four or five to deal with that is the proposed speedup we have run people to an fn on goal and found that they had rock slam underlying the fn if you overlist for fifteen or twenty minutes beyond the fn you get rock slam as the pc goes on down the goals chain the track is laid out in cycles made up of series of lives or types of lives associated and allied highly variable in their time element it is prime postulate new goal that starts cycle this is not solution but new game the pc goes along with this eventually the steam goes out of it and the thetan finds himself with interest and ability to get into trouble he goes out the bottom then perks up bit and goes off with new basic postulate any further postulate is solution to problems caused by the first one that is cycle those are pieces of gpm with an interrelationship if you can get the earliest you can find cleaned up the later ones blow easily since the thetan had less power to make them for this reason it is worthwhile to get as early goal as you can find that still reads and has some reality for the pc and which he can still run if goal will rocket read you can list it after you have tiger drilled it clean if it rocket reads you can list it through to fn then find another etc etc as you go further back it would be easy to find later goals but useful to find earlier ones thetan never gets so messed up that he fails to leave flag out on his points of aberration in early work it was noticed that the key engram of the pcs current life leaves out tag the tag is an innocentseeming and seemingly meaningless picture that the pc is frequently aware of for instance it may be picture of grandfathers rocking chair when you explore this you find the key engram similarly the key goal has rock slam left on it one way of finding out what subject it is on is by nulling several hundred goals culling the rock slams writing them down and seeing what the subject matter is test overts on and see the rock slam turn on the rock slam may wear out on some of these subjects those are the locks the real goal will have rock slam that wont weer out the charge manifested by the rock slam can be imparted to associated subjects that wont hold up and that will confuse you any branch of the tree looks like the trunk eventually you will find the trunk you can use the rock slam to find the goals channel by assessing the eight dynamics to find one that has rock slam or dirty needle if there is dirty needle at first you can cause one by having the pc think of overts against each dynamic and picking out the dirtiest needle you have to be clever to ask these questions without causing missed withholds get the pc to tell you few overts on the dynamic that reads dirtiest ask him what would represent that dynamic and get list of items assess by elimination looking for rock slam or the hottest item it is ok if at this point you dont get rock slam take that item and get the pc to list what goal might you have that would be an overt against eg the government write down any pain or sensation on the list keep listing as long as there is needle action when the needle smooths out the pcs goal is on the list if you are lucky if you are unlucky you will get nothing but pain sensation and stuck needle if so start with new dynamic assessment if you are getting cognitions that is good sign on some pcs this could be the only way to run goals on most it would be shortcut 2316208c14 shspec185 world clearing the subject of this lecture is forwarding scientology on worldwide clearing basis the activity of worldwide clearing is now understood but there will have to be an agreedupon and workable plan to deliver the goods hpahca is presently neglected sphere prepchecking is not an adequate tool to turn people loose with by itself we also have the very effective form of auditing with great therapeutic value that is goals listing not necessarily goals finding if someone is upset just get them to write goals list with some astronomical number of goals on it preserve it carefully for later use this sort of goals assistance will shortly be part of hpahca training along with prepchecking if the pc could also list items for goals he would shortly be in shape to learn to find goals alternatively st hill graduate in an organization could find the goals of everyone around once they had been set up by the hpahca item listing takes long time there could be 2500 per list so policy letter has gone out forbidding st hill graduates from doing anything except to find goals hcopl 13aug62 clearing that way the org can do clearing the staff could coaudit on getting goals and items listed and the st hill staff staff auditor could find the goals this would get staffs cleared now on to world clearing say you have fifty people paying certain amount per week they all want to be clear form them into coaudits three nights week or whatever get goals listed get items listed st hill graduates would find the goal and put the person back into coaudit within year they would all be clear second goals could be found next have them study the practical actions and get to look like auditors coauditing under good supervision the fee charged should be more than adequate to support the center or whatever what damage could this do the instructor would have to make sure that withholds got missed that could cause pcs to blow you will have to do some training at first at the same time get the goals lists made so that some progress is evident from the start you could take the persons auditing skill count for points towards their getting their goal found you might think that this would cut people off from getting trained not so at all people will decide to go get trained while waiting to have their goal found at the end of the year you will have fifty firstgoal clears the only limiting factor on the expansion of clearing by this system is the number who can go through st hill and that number can be increased there are lots of oldtime scientologists around the world lrh is now getting their names so that he can write them and send them to the nearest franchise holder this will give semitrained assistants people who will join in the coaudit etc finite auditing period four to five hours of auditing and several hours of training per day are required to accomplish this program that is the basic worldclearing activity central organizations have always existed for training and dissemination of information with auditing of pcs mostly for demonstration purposes now when pcs come in they can be handled with coaudit andor preparatory actions the trouble in any central org or any coaudit will be to keep up the quality of auditing and not to let it get slipshod that is always fight because green auditors can think up more interesting ways to do things and have more problems you can find what portion of central org the public is impinging on most because that will be the most scrambled and muckedup and offline the main danger with small staff is that the public will shove the timescheduling out you have to be mean on that point because the area the public is most messed up on is time time is the single source of aberration there would be aberration were it not for time keeping time controlled for the group with regard to course hours etc will actually result in your giving wins dont let guy sneak in late greet him loudly this results in less aberration and enturbulation in the group let them know you think scheduling is important and other factors will fall into place this is method of controlling people who are otherwise unruly lrh would never let himself be pushed into auditing more than five to five and half hours per day you also have to save time by having administrative people to handle the phone mail etc the people on the coaudit will string out in time depending on how much bank is in the way of their understanding the bank is composed of time at all so they get into its timelessness and have time to do anything people have different periods of time that it takes them to register the same recognition they have different reaction times they have different rates on different subjects and on 232different dynamics etc these rates are determined by where the goal sits that gets in the way of your meter reading some people are aberrated on the subject of meters and cant see the read on the needle though they may read books etc well very sane person has fantastic quantities of time lrh once flabbergasted someone by outlining program for this part of the universe that extended 5000 years into the future ive seen billion years planned out down to the smallest detail if there were time there would be motion havingness matter etc the more bank person has the less time he has for the longest period rock can sit there without any recognition at all for few trillenia speed of recognition depends on how much time person has pt varies from thousandth of second to more normal value of second or two expanded to ten minutes this would be frightening the number of mistakes person makes is inversely proportional to the amount of pt they have the saner and the freer person is the more pt he has the guy whose pt is thousandth of second never foresees the difficulty of doing anything and does the most impulsive and stupid things you ever heard of foresight is not really brightness but width of pt nothing beats looking your way out of things if you think being able to foretell the future thousand years ahead with accuracy would be boring how come you can only get excitement by being stupid anyway this gives you fast index on pcs coaudits etc this index is the amount of time it takes him to register to find out that something is there the length of time it takes him to absorb auditing information is the length of time it takes him to be reliable if you pair up coaudit teams on the basis of their recognition periods they will stay happy it will seem reasonable to both of them methods could easily be developed to measure recognition period how much should you teach your coauditors lrh would demand perfection in any coaudit the amount of gain is to some degree proportional to the amount of responsibility the instructor is taking for those people it is not very dependent on what process you are running you have problems of comparable magnitude ptp process responsibility processing use some processes that avoid ow your best bet though is to put them onto listing goals and items so they had better be started out on prepchecks and prepchecking if you have to keep them busy give them something to study listing for example utilize the available time in the most productive possible way it is not very tenable to singlehand project like this it is harder on you than you would think since you lack datum of comparable magnitude the communication channel falls off to the degree that an individual feels that he is outside the organization this makes the development of city offices rather than franchises good idea city office is similar to franchise but it is under the administrative direction of the central scientology organization via an hco area secretary it is set up by the hco continental sec the intention is that it will ultimately grow up into central organization see oec volume vii pp 154 158 162 163 165 there is necessity to make everything neat since it will blow up anyway it might as well be done neatly so that it can be put together again after it falls apart when expansion hits when increased comm hits network of comm lines it is not surprising if the seams leak so you have to be skilled in putting the line back again not in trying to hold it any central organization putting together clearing coaudit should do it perfectly then put it all back together again when it blows up you hold the fort with time good discipline etc and you realize that world clearing is done on the basis of somehow making it not as juggernaut rolling down the highway there hasnt been road you follow policy as far as you can and then you make it work from then on just dont scant technology dont fail to deliver the goods and make clears 6208c21 shspec188 basics of auditing auditors keep asking lrh for rules and more rules then they goof in session and ask for more it is strange that fundamentals usually come at high levels of training here is what an auditor should be able to do he should be able to get another being to be interested in his own case and willing to talk to him rules tricks rudiments and various other types of upsetpreventers are all contributive to getting this to occur the emeter is only contributive insofar as it applies to rudiments it is vital for 233assessing in rudiments you are trying to do with rules and the meter something that you cannot do yourself this wont work some auditors have only to sit down in the chair to have the pc arc break this is more true now than ever the difficulties the auditor encounters are his own difficulties and the mechanics he uses force the pc into session with an auditor who doesnt want the pc in session or who doesnt understand that the pc should be in session or why the pc should be in session the mechanics of rudiments and rules have made auditing so powerful that the pc is put into state where he is interested in his case and wants to talk to the auditor but the auditor thinks he is supposed to do something else and drives the pc out of session again so the pc arc breaks the auditor looks like an auditor and the rules trick the pc into session then the pc finds that the auditor doesnt want to hear what he is saying the auditor is auditing by some set of rules in fact there is auditor but the technology has created pc this drives the pc around the bend the pc doesnt know what is wrong but he feels that something is wrong we have been blaming meter reading missing reads this is just another technical rule someone who understood the basics of auditing and used them could miss reads and clean cleans and still have pc happily in session but someone who cleans cleans and misses reads must be auditing not by basics but by rules that force pc into session if there is auditor but only rules and meter the rules may be right and the meter wrong there is nothing else holding the pc in session so he gets upset if the auditor is not there and he misses something it is curtains so it is very necessary to know what the basics of auditing are the remedy for the above situation is that people are going to learn to prepcheck and to put ruds in without meters and to do this accurately this will make auditors they can do it because they will learn the basics of auditing why does auditing exist at all there are two articles in certainty magazine 1958 that take apart what psychoanalysis did wrong anyone that went into session in analysis did so accidentally basically the analysand never had an auditor he was also never brought back to pt at the end of session the basics of auditing include the mechanics of blowing something the reason why auditing works axiom 51 one underlying thread is the principle that after session pc should feel better even an awful goals assessment session that missed the goal should end up with the pc feeling better secondly the auditor must get off the pcs withholds the earliest part of auditing is the roughest part since all the missed withholds of life are still sitting there unrelieved it takes far better auditor to handle such case than to handle someone who has come up the line ways scientologists are not really harder to audit than raw meat especially raw meat that hasnt ever reached for anything you would be surprised though at who can go into session and who can be audited once in detroit the cops seized some tapes fourteen cops listened to them and twelve resigned from the force an auditor should be able to handle the pcs problems and to get clean needle so that the pc can be assessed and made to feel better an auditor should audit to get things done in session not just to audit auditing consists of getting something done by series of little accomplishments not by going through the motions you should be able to get pc into session without meter rules or anything some people have gift for this an auditor should be able to let the pc blow something by talking to him you would be surprised how rare this is you should also be able to get done what the pc wants done without q and people have trouble differentiating between tr4 and q and an auditor must be able to make this distinction he must handle the session and do things the pc wants done without q and you have to work at it to get in trouble with this q and is simple 1 not accepting the pcs answer questioning the pcs answer auditing isnt done by rules but by understanding people who q and dont want the pc to talk to them they use remark comment or request for more information to prevent the pc from just saying something and blowing the charge or the auditor doesnt acknowledge this is defensive mechanism 2 doing something every time the pc says something an auditor who always does what the pc says will drive the pc crazy an auditor who audits strictly by rules and not by understanding will 234never do anything pc says matter how reasonable or sensible it is which also drives the pc crazy there are two things that pcs do 1 they ask auditors to do things such that if the auditor doesnt do them the session will go around the bend 2 they originate auditors who are having hard time with pcs never differentiate between these two situations they dont evaluate importances they try to follow all the rules instead of helping the pc you dont take up the process that the pc wants run or the goal which the pc asserts but which doesnt check out on the other hand you dont ignore it when the pc says this room is so hot that i am melting open the damn window there is substitute for understanding and feeling of humanness obnose why does auditing work it bothers someone to be the only one who knows something he feels better when someone else can see it too he doesnt like to have only his attention on something it bothers him to have to keep it from other people when he puts something out and lets someone else see it and the person says that he has seen it and nothing else happens axiom 10 hasnt fired the catastrophic effect he expected hasnt been produced auditing of withholds blows the pcs certainty of consequences he gets off gross overt that he knew would kill him if anyone else ever found out about it and there is consequence the only thing that happened was ventilation having gotten off the withhold the pc finds himself with his attention freed up from that subject before it was stuck on keeping it withheld so he drops it like hot potato without going into the mechanics of asising we can say this if the horrible consequences that the pc expected on getting off withhold dont materialize his previously fixed attention is freed up auditors have interesting methods of preventing pcs from blowing things they use the meter they do something every time the pc originates if the auditor always does something or asks another question about it the pc isnt allowed to blow anything auditing works because the pc blows things if he isnt allowed to blow things he will blow up the point is to audit the pc not to go through drill auditors should be able to clean up dirty needle they should be able to prepcheck simply using pc indicators to establish cleanness of the question but dont try to assess goals without one if rules get in your way you probably dont understand the rules the reason for this emphasis is that 3ga requires superb auditor if it is to be done rapidly 6209c18 shspec189 directing pcs attention instead of reaching for an argument reach for an emeter to straighten out arguments put the person or persons on meter pull missed withholds on nattery person just sit him or her down as though natter had occurred and ask what have we failed to find out about you what have i failed to find out about you in this session have i missed withhold on you etc when you use an emeter get something done you can do great deal with it so use it to get somewhere the rules of auditing are to keep you from doing ineffective things men have been talking to men for thousands of years and the general result of these discussions has been nil how can we use talking in auditing to get something to happen the rules by which you audit are the rules of an effective path to an accomplishment of reaching someone bettering someone reaching an agreement and improving existence but it is highly circumscribed path there have been almost numberless efforts in the past to cure people or make them better almost all schools of healing have involved talking or listening there is an effort to reach axiom 10 applies throughout we can now make this same talk effective auditing has to do with the comm formula this is the most fundamental fundamental of scientology when someone says something and someone acknowledges it if the statement is true and the acknowledgment is received mental charge can blow deintensify eraser be eradicated it is on this fact alone that auditing works it isnt what is said it is axiom 10 the cycle of auditing follows this pattern 2351 the auditors question or command directs the pcs attention to certain area of bank causing momentary restim 2 the pc perceiving the area of bank that has been restimulated responds by verbalizing 3 when he is acknowledged and receives the acknowledgment he knows that he has responded 4 that area of the bank blows most auditing rules exist to maintain the purity of the auditing cycle the tech exists to determine what should be restimulated in what sequence if you have done the auditing cycle right and you know what buttons should be hit and what responses should be given then you only need add repetitive question and response and the proper sequence of questions each followed by the same cycle to obtain the state of release clear theta clear or ot that formula is the only reason anyone gets out there can be numberless departures from the auditing cycle other activities like selling and teaching have their own cycles which are different from the auditing cycle if the auditor has spent lifetimes being salesman he may use the wrong sort of comm cycle and end up selling the pc an engram or you may get someone who thinks forgiveness of sins makes people better this person wont use the proper auditing comm cycle he will do something else auditing is basically cycle of command that operates as an attentiondirector eliciting response from the pc and getting the pc to asis the restimulated area the pc knows he has done so when he receives an acknowledgment from the auditor that it has occurred that cycle all by itself is sufficiently powerful to get gains matter what words or process is used the mere fact of directed attention and the acknowledgment that the pc has directed his attention that fact by itself is therapeutic there need be significance in the command the repetitive action adds duplication to the formula this increases the effectiveness of the communication the person will become aware of the existence of another being he will become aware of mass and of whether his attention is easy or hard to shift his awareness will increase and his attention will become freer in essence those are your cchs it is the nonsignificance of directed attention the cchs present different ways of directing the pcs attention with minimal significance your worstoff pc does well on these because he discovers that there is matter energy space time and another being in the universe this can be great shock to him how does the great criminal live with himself by knowing that he is the only one that there is one else in the universe you cant tell someone in that condition to think of the significance of this or that because the significance would never arrive he cant duplicate it he can duplicate the fairly nonsignificant action of simply directed attention this is new idea in the communication cycle communication without significance beyond the significance of what the pcs attention is directed to linguistic analysts refer to the performance aspect of language apart from the mere significance of the words many an activity has directed attention but has not done so duplicatively that is one of the secrets of scientology processing and why it works this was not discovered before scientology because earlier practitioners couldnt duplicate you could run duplicative process on one object but two is better because it makes space and adds duplication you need to have two things to use you need two to make space we live in twopole universe you cant make space with just one spot you also need two things to have duplication this applies to op pro by dup the two points book and bottle give you space i dont care how you run op pro by dup run it you could direct attention repetitively in duplicative fashion or in almost any fashion and achieve renewed awareness on the part of another being of yourself and the world around him theres further significance than that and that is the whole result of the process this increased awareness improves iq alertness etc wherever you have communication line set up you have some kind of response system on this line and it will go through some kind of cycle knowing that different cycles of action exist you will see that the auditing comm cycle is unique and you will realize that the question or command directs the pcs attention by pulling his bank up around his ears the auditing comm cycle operates independent of the intention of the pc it is more responsive to the practitioner than it is to the pc any outsider has more control over the persons reactive bank than the person himself its on that fact that auditing 236is based the common denominator of the reactive bank is otherdeterminism so auditing requires an auditor separate from the pc to be very effective and when the auditor isnt following through the cycle of action of auditing then nobody else will adjust the bank for the pc an auditor who wont help the pc out by adjusting the bank for him is leaving him in the soup the auditor must control the pcs attention if the pc is to be able to asis anything in the bank otherwise the pc obeys the bank and auditing is not occurring there are good pcs and bad pcs there are only good and bad auditors the good ones know and keep in the cycle of auditing if the auditing cycle isnt followed auditing doesnt occur pc whose attention cannot be controlled cannot be directed into areas of significance that reactively dont want any attention directed there say the pc has goal never to look if you cant control the pcs attention you will never find it because the bank has more authority over the pc than the auditor does all goals lists contain goals of this character if you look over the goals list of pc whose goal is being easily found you will find an absence of those goals that command the pcs attention to go the other way you will find never to look or to be silent these goals cause trouble until they are located the pc whose attention can be directed by the auditor on the other hand will have great many of these there are good or bad pcs only auditors who do or dont use the auditing comm cycle and get it executed sometimes an auditor has to work harder than at other times thats all you should look over your auditing with the question is the pcs attention being directed by and can i count upon the fact that it is if you do this you will learn lot about your auditing and what is going on with that pc and the relationship between your auditing and what is going on with the pc 6209c18 shspec190 3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam the rock slam is socalled because it is achieved when the auditor is approaching what we once called the rock there is something earlier than the rock goal if it were called goal slam you would have it it is producing lot of random needle motion because of currents being set up amongst the items and identities that the person has assumed or fought in the process of executing the goal the individual has way to go towards or away from the goal he is in state of agitation it is thetan convulsion in the absence of slamming needle you may well see convulsions of the body when the convulsion gets to great degree of solidity this is surmise with some evidence behind it that is called an epileptic fit if it went beyond that to enter the physical universe around the person you would get other effects first the physical universe gets enturbulated auditors drop commands people have accidents further on you could get poltergeist phenomena you get enmest in any case what this is is obsessive and random motion or postulate that is in state of producing obsessive and random impulses when restimulated one may well get ones goal restimulated in the course of life so the rock slam is the goal track the pcs interest follows the track of the goal and therefore also the slam the pc is being reached as case when he is rockslamming dont arc break pc while he is rockslamming you wont get away with things that you could get away with when he wasnt rockslamming so your auditing had better be smooth the case will hang up if you bungle it during that time the pcs interest is very much on his case and the distraction is severe if you yank his attention out of session he goes from tone 30 to minus 80 with curve and it is hard to clean that up dynamic assessment is an intense activity and it should be so regarded by the auditor since as the pc goes down the track he is unknowingly running into all the items that you will later list you will find his detested person which will make him very happy you will take lot of edges off the case you will find the dynamic that slams and this means great deal to him now we find the item and here is something that is enormously significant to him it explains all sorts of things then you find the goal beside which all else pales this gives the pc gradient gains which is an improvement over ordinary 3ga nervousness can build up while you are tigerdrilling the 850 goal list the tension that built up when we were assessing by elimination was enough to break the pcs and the auditors heart the pc was so nervy and arc breaky he was almost impossible to audit 237if you tiger drill list the goals but not the goal are being erased as you go along and the pc feels better and better but this is still not good enough or fast enough there is such terrific attention line here that any little wiggle is superupsetting doing dynamic assessment by rock slam eliminates most of the liabilities it goes into the goal line not direct for the goal and it goes by gradient of interest with the pc an active participant making gains every few hours also successful dynamic assessment by rock slam makes the pc feel great the auditor doesnt really care about this because the end product is getting the goal the auditor can get distracted by the spectacular successes that he is getting but anything other than going for the goal is waste of time if you are going to get to be class iv auditor you have to do it fast to clear earth you have to be able to find pcs goal in week this is something lrh can do so you have to learn to be that effective this is an upgrade lrh wants class ivs to handle group coauditing to clear per the program for world clearing that is the only way to get it done as fast as it needs to be done this would produce fifty clears in one year when the technology is trimmed bit more you should be able to get it done in twelve and half hours but to do this you have to be pretty slick as an auditor there is point of diminishing returns where it is done so fast that it is unreal to the pc as pcs listing continues his interest in the goal ebbs and fades it is brought back by tigerdrilling it takes one minute on the average to clean up goal by tiger drilling at 460 down the list of 850 thats 450 minutes or seven and half hours plus rudiments to get to the goal that is not bad and that was the place where the second goal was found on one pc but the first goal is rockier to find many pcs will never find one without dynamic assessment by rock slam so we are looking for positive and efficient method of finding goals on all pcs in fairly predictable amount of time some accs found pcs running for six weeks without finding goal this was very disappointing dynamic assessment by rock slam has the luck factor of whether the list you are assessing is complete if item assesses out unmistakably the list was incomplete there is other reason we know that if we can get dynamic that rockslams when the pc considers committing overts against it we can then list what represents that dynamic on dwindling rock slam we can assess that list to get an item the goal will be an overt against that item in one shade of meaning or another as given on the list the tough point is the entrance point trying to find the first slam there is new caper the most detested person this is experimental at present who or what have you detested could get it but you may or may not get an item or what looks like an item short cut is to say what do you wish was not part of existence oil him up by getting list then ask what isnt part of existence this will serve you as an item if it will develop rock slam you assess it by consider overts against _______ you will find that the common denominator of all dynamics and items is that the person will not admit that they are part of existence they are things from which the pc has individuated so when you get the slamming item you might build it back to dynamic when all else fails by asking what part of existence does _______ belong to this could give rock slam when the list is assessed then you could list what part of existence does _______ represent this could give the dwindling slam the normal way is to ask what opinionated person have you detested assess the list with think of doing bad things to _______ get down to an elimination by rock slam get one person often the first on the list list what part of existence does _______ represent this gives list of dynamics on which there will be rock slams assess with think of doing bad things to _______ if you are lucky you will get an unmistakable rock slam on one dynamic then the list of the item will be dwindling slam down to dirty needle assess that with think of doing bad things to _______ one will fire well and now we have the pcs goals line on that item you list with what goal might you have that would be an overt against _______ that will go also by dwindling rock slam then list line six in high percentage the goal will be number 1 2 3 or 4 on that list just tiger drill each goal 238there is an action that must precede any dynamic assessment by rock slam the pc must first list 850 goals and find and list every goal ever listed on the pc and tiger drill the whole list first however you tiger drill the tiger drill buttons eg on the word suppress has anything been suppressed etc down to flatness or cognition this is must on anyone who has been audited much you should also be sure to get the pc to tell you the consequences of your clearing him it could be so horrendous that the pc will never give you his goal work the suppress and the careful buttons hard careful is especially likely to turn on rock slam when the rock slam is off the command you use to tiger drill early goals is in auditing on the goal _______ has anything been suppressed etc thus goal that has been buried will begin to read again you can also use since date goal was found on goal has anything been _______ dont ever discard old goals the case can be stalled from that point forward 6209c20 shspec191 listing lines the original four lines used in 3ga listing from goals want not want oppose and not oppose are augmented by the addition of create curious about desire enforce inhibit scale attached to each one making twenty combinations then each of these reduplicated in an effect form making forty listing lines in all pc was allowed to list only four items before going on to the next list this process was carried to the ep of fn at clear read for each goal found having large number of lines served the dual purpose of making the auditing question as clear and precise as possible and keeping the pc fluid on the lines before doing this listing you have to tiger drill the goal until it reads much more detail is given in this tape particularly concerning gain and sensation and their significance in listing goals what happens if you overlist is the following sequence 1 the line flows in direction where it isnt reaching anything and it is trying to come back that is the comm lag 2 he feels that you are getting him to reach too far and it is indescribable at this point he is fishing for the right item 3 if he goes on from there the backflow starts to hit he more than announces something than he invalidates it all these manifestations are just bank manifestations one problem that arises in selflisting these lines is that pain and sensation will appear on the wrong lines this occurs because in order to give himself the command the pc has to go into other valences and give the command to another valence this louses up where the pain and sensation belong he goes into the oppose to list the want and vice versa so he gets the sensation and pain in the wrong places just before the pc goes clear his ta wont necessarily be near clear read the last two or three days of listing are the tough ones the pc rollercoasters bit he gets very worried just before the needle goes free he is afraid he will have game if he gives up the goal you have to persuade him through this to the there is nothing there point where he is free to make some new games early on in clearing somatics tend to be dull and persistent in the middle of listing they fade in and out by the end they flash on and off that is symptom of winding up the somatics may make the pc resist the end of clearing because he doesnt want them beware also the pc feeling wonderful when he is not yet clear this is the manic phase he will drop he will also tell you that it is blown many times before he is clear but when he is really clear the needle is free and will stay free until you find the next goal he may start looking right away listing can be done by hcas class ii auditors see hcopl 21may62 training classes of auditors if they are wellsupervised 6209c20 shspec192 geriatrics gerontology never solved geriatrics but we have you should understand that one of mans longest searches has been search for longevity geriatrics is the study of living longer lrhs research at oak knoll naval hospital suggested that the mind could change the body more than the body and physical substances could change the mind you can always get function or thought to monitor 239structure but you cant always get structure to monitor thought medicos got this messed up because it is usually so obvious when structure monitors thought if you cut guys leg off you generally but not always see his thought change but if you dont get rid of the psychic traumas you wont change someones structure or function change the psychic condition and the structure can change these conclusions are very valuable in the field of geriatrics metchnikoff studied geriatrics as he felt the years creep up he found that theoretically sour milk could extend life indefinitely but he died before age seventy it is odd that there is all this interest in geriatrics given that thetan is indestructible this is actually interest in preserving the body which as it ages irritates the thetan by restricting his activity pc doing well generally looks younger one that is doing poorly looks older in the process of doing dynamic assessment on goals see previous tape you will see rapid change when you get the dynamic and the item and the goal as pc gets listed on the goal he or she looks younger if things go sour the pc looks older we dont know the theoretical age limit for body so we dont know how long clear should live it should be longer than normal anyway if you clear somebody around age thirty you will probably add thirty to forty years to his life if he goes clear at seventy or eighty you might add only five or six years probably the older they are the less you could add to the lifespan the field of geriatrics has the problem of researchers dying out without leaving records and dying out before the length of time it takes to produce results so the researchers are always getting challenged age is normally determinable by the condition of certain body parts functions and cellular structures if you were to examine someone physiologically then clear him then reexamine him you would find that the person was physiologically younger this predetermines that they will live longer people get interested in scientology when you tell them about its geriatric aspects you would think that insurance companies would be interested in the idea of changing someones lifeexpectancy but they are not they are only interested in figures which are based on expectancy of claim payments all figured out by averages etc since the risk is spread out amongst many individuals they dont care about making individuals live longer they could even be against it since it could cost them money so you can get reverse philosophy on this point socialist states and insurance companies realize that if we werent kicking off regularly things would be in terrible state but most people would be far more interested in living longer than they would be interested even in being healthy since being healthy would cost them service facsimile people wish they could live longer even if they dont believe it is possible just doing problems intensive would increase persons life expectancy most people are fighting living longer even if they say they want to lrhs experiments with horticulture using tomato plants produced some tomatoes that were kept in constant temperature and humidity and which were not injured in any way they grew to sixteen feet grew enormous numbers of tomatoes and lived longer lrh found that the life span and resistance to blight of tomato plant is directly related to the amount of punishment the amount of clipping handling topping pruning etc people thought he was interested in horticulture but he wasnt he was interested in geriatrics and longevity plant that is abused will become ill and will die sooner abuse determines 1 longevity 2 susceptibility to illness if you can delete abuse eg by running engrams you pick up the characteristics of not having been abused in the first place ie health and longevity this would apply equally well to human bodies dianetics also pointed to this conclusion see science of survival book ii p 23 in humans if you delete audit out abuse or the consideration that one has been abused you effect the same change in longevity as not having been abused would have made so in disseminating scientology you can talk about longevity and preventing illness on planet that is very fixated on bodies these are good avenues of approach dianetics corresponds to deleting abuse from persons life which is equivalent to avoiding abuse in the tomato plants depression gives rise to symptoms just like an illness you can as dissemination approach use maybe you are 240not sick maybe you are just depressed you use that instead of suppressed the person will get very interested then give him problems intensive his sickness will frequently disappear you dont tell the person that you will cure anything you are only interested in removing the suppressions of life we have to have bridge from raw meat to clearing and the bridge has to have reality in it the person must be brought to reality on the mind and life say you are running clinic giving problems intensives using repetitive prepchecking people will come out at the other end looking and feeling younger and longer sick this is an area that we have just neglected with our emphasis on clearing in book iii of dmsmh it says that if you can parallel what the mind is doing you can reach the mind and do something for it this is trick to parallel what raw meats mind is doing he is thinking how sick or well am i how young or old am i so how are you means how sick are you today common hidden standard is do i look feel or appear younger if most people are fixated on the body and they are you can use this fact to get in comm with them in effect you are getting guy in session according to the definition of in session before you officially get him in session age is normally hooked onto the body by the thetan himself using engrams and secondaries the limitation on what thought can do for structure is only the thetans consideration the reason you have trouble defining scientology to people is that there is datum of comparable magnitude in this universe so they always put up datum of incomparable magnitude and hang you right away in suppression and disagreement oh its like christian science you say right there you are hung with suppression of him it puts you into disagreement never let him choose the datum of comparable magnitude to scientology give him one his ruin himself what he owns his family his sick mother or wife his health etc this is what is really of comparable magnitude to scientology for him 6209c25 shspec193 current trends the main difficulty we are having right now is not clearing people 2500 years after it was proposed ss possibility clearing is not something you achieve because of faith or right belief or any such trap our only interest in discipline is in getting the job done we do need certain number of safeguards to see that it is done right since doing it wrong not only doesnt get it done but also gives the subject bad reputation people need to realize that clearing is precise activity not something done casually by the untrained lrh knows we are successful when we get attacked by squirrels and when we get counterfeited concept therapy is one such counterfeit picked up in 1952 or so the chief movers in that appeared at the clearing congress unfortunately the ethics of clearing are the effectiveness of clearing he who hasnt been trained cannot do it and should not try since he can bungle it you can have an unfortunate win when you have flukey lucky break we want technology that works on everybody dynamic assessments see pp 305308 above have this broad applicability it becomes unethical to clear somebody nonstandardly in order to keep the rules in use you clear somebody according to the rules and take advantage of every lucky break as long as you realize that it will probably never recur but dont go looking for the break and drop the rules broad clearing technology must be preserved as it is and safeguarded confusion occurs when an action that should have occurred did not all of sudden extraordinary solutions are being required whenever an extraordinary solution is demanded of you in auditing it is only because the usual has not been followed the unusual is demanded of you because the usual has not been done when you see demand for an extraordinary solution you should 1 fix whatever is wrong with the pc 2 get the auditor straightened out that is vital or the errors will just continue 3 find out who dropped the ball in training the goofy auditor and everyone along the line who certified him and get them to handle if you only handle the immediate situation and never handle the source of the confusion that confusion and worse will continue to occur 241when it seems that the situation is totally out of your control remember that you can always turn force around and make it serve you this principle is used in judo tennis players also do this this is trick that is particularly adapted to this universe so when you hear that ama certified auditors are going to clear the us army air force set yourself up as small civil defense rescue unit publicize what is happening be very prepared to scream set up this civil defense unit to take care of the emergency this may give the wouldbe malefactor second thoughts if you make it very clear to him that you are prepared to handle the disaster we are walking into an emergency situation the demand is going to produce an enormously confused area in fact it has already started to for lrh the same as it did in 1950 it will all come out all right as long as we hold to the standard and keep the show on the road and dont tolerate any bad clearing it wont come out right if we all say well my job is just to audit japan has just blossomed as new area of interest it is vital energetic country that will need translated material etc nation that is whipped in war will go from the force band into thought the thetan never gives up so conquest is still their purpose political philosophy will handle that situation they already have some communistic ideas along with an emphasis on individuation and independence buddhism was the first civilizing influence in japan suddenly now there is an embrace of scientology coming from the west with total impact 6210c03 shtvd15a prepchecking goal part i first part of this demo is occupied with lrh pulling withhold then he prepchecks the item murderer 6210c03 shtvd15b prepchecking goal part ii continuation of the above lrh prepchecks the goal to know good trs good example of absence of q and 6210c04 shspec198 modern security checking we have had dissensions and upsets over the last twelve years things now are more even and more easily handled but we still have occasional upsets there was an hcob on new style of sec check we have hcob 12sep62 security check again this involves looking for rock slams with commands with the wording consider committing overts against _______ this hcob points the way to resolved case and to peace and quiet while we get cases cleared for long time we have tried to find out what made some people nervous obsessed and prone to revolt and cutting their own throats we have wondered if there was some international group that was closely opposed to the advance of scientology the answer is communism has some goals which would make you nervous if you knew about them such as the goal to take away everything of yours this leads to total games condition socialism is also nutty it rewards people for not working it says if you are working real hard you should share with people who wont help you another antipathetic philosophy is that of the south american division into ricos and pobres capitalism has one small group owning everything democracy goes like this take bunch of uninformed people and take the mean of their opinion and say that it is valid and therefore disregard it and then do things and tell them its their fault its the perfect mechanism to prevent revolt better one has ever been invented its selfperpetuating machine that is pure idiocy you are given choice of voting between two goons you wouldnt let clean your chicken coop and then if everything goes wrong it is your fault all government is merely substitute for the disabilities of the individuals in the population in an absence of understanding of the human mind you inevitably have government and you have as much government as you have crime until the whole government is crime there is nothing government does that has not been done privately at one time this includes fire departments police etc police forces that are part of government have nothing in common with public safety the more government you have the less liberty you will have because government is nonproducer the laws that the government passes against crime apply to you who are in theory honest hired men next thing you know you havent even got yourself anymore 242but there is international group that faces and opposes dianetics and scientology except to the degree that aberration opposes sanity mediumgood auditor gets chewed up from time to time an excellent auditor never gets chewed up the only enemy of man is his aberration you just need to audit thats all if people attack you it is because you are not auditing them what they want is relief from their own misery and agony and you are giving them auditing once you have embarked on this sort of thing you are in for it if you dont carry through with it in the past when we have not executed our commitments we have been in trouble you have to make some kind of arrangement whereby auditing can occur pc who has screaming arc break can be smoothed out just by auditing him smoothly and well though true enough he has missed withholds for you to clean up pcs arc break over auditing auditing can also be conducted so as to amount to auditing of any kind making auditing occur and making it possible is an even stronger action than pulling missed withholds although that is necessary too auditing is pure magic the pretense of auditing without auditing is pure poison it is dangerous to be almost an auditor going through the motions of auditing without really listening to the pc etc pc will put up with relatively poor auditor but not with pretended auditor all the things you are having trouble with are resolvable with auditing therefore you must not fall short as an auditor in last nights tvd it turned out that the pc had set up the room in such way that the meter wasnt secure it bounced around and had to be fixed when it was fixed the pcs needle cleaned up the above truth applies regardless of the dynamic you are addressing you cant counterfeit the intention to audit if you have that you will win if you dont you wont even if the pc doesnt perceive the intention you should handle the situation by auditing put in the hope factor and the r factor and audit what causes the apparent revolt against dianetics and scientology when it occurs it is particular sort of missed withhold missed dynamic item or goal it doesnt much matter what it is the person is thetan who is basically good an appeal directly to the thetan bypasses all the garbage and secures his cooperation if you truly intend to audit him all the crimes wars and insanity in the world are not caused by the individual himself they are caused by the misapprehensions of that individual the greatest misapprehensions of all are his considerations of the dynamic and item as result of his carelessly postulated goal we are dealing here with human behavior if an individual exists and can be reached anything wrong he does thereafter is the result of his not being reached or audited here is what makes him tough to reach 1 his goal 2 his item which is his pet antipathy 3 his dynamic in which he has included all the badness of existence hes fighting against shadows which are quite real to him persons goal may commit scientology to the status of being in his consideration his oppterm whether it makes any sense or not to you the scientologist you cant predict this just from knowing the goal it involves the pcs interpretation of the goal and his track experience you match up to his oppterms in his universe rockslamming case is one who would get rock slam on consider committing overts against 1 scientology 2 ron 3 the organization 4 the auditor if you get rock slam on any of those four commands the person considers you an enemy he is not unauditable but the meter behaves oddly it is rockslammers who have made things unpeaceful for the last twelve years not governments psychiatrists or some international organization these people make up not more than twenty percent of an organization 243if psychiatrists or psychologists had come up with results like ours they would have published our case histories with graphs and all nevertheless they would undoubtedly rock slam because they have basic disagreement with what we are doing the psychologist has agreed that man is an animal meat robot there is an earlier fundamental that makes this lie psychology means study of the psyche if you talk to psychologist dont get into discussion about whether man is an animal talk about the derivation of psychology their fundamental name you will thereby blow off their disagreement with us and clear up something that was definitely antipathetic to themselves the individual existed before the goal the goal is less fundamental than the individual it is only the antipathetic goal that gives you trouble cf expanded dianetics evil purposes dont reward the rebel put him on the meter and check the four commands given above if someone rockslams on one of those dont hire him or enrol him on coaudit you could enrol him on subcoaudit hang the rock slam around his neck and he wont cause any trouble because you have asised the fact that he is rockslammer rockslammers will dramatize in 11 manner if you dont get them audited you get an emergency telephone call and they write down the message for you then as they leave the room their coat brushes it off into the wastebasket you dont see it but later on they can prove that they wrote it down for you they will also agree with you about doing all the silly things you mention and they will dissuade you somehow from doing all the right things knowing these principles you can understand human behavior much better in an organization clearing coaudit marriage or any other group you have surefire way of testing for the person who has to be straightened out it is the person who rockslams when the group or person is mentioned in consider committing overts against _______ it is not one bad act that makes rock slam it takes long accumulation of overts the thing that person rockslams on may be so suppressed that it has to be thoroughly tiger drilled see p 295a before it rockslams find and handle rockslammers neither snuff them nor let them foul up the nonrockslammers we are in the weird situation that if we lose everybody loses while if we win everybody wins so it is an overt act for an auditor not to pick up and pay attention to rockslammer because if he omits to do this he is letting the person lose and making it possible for everybody to lose the rockslammer will only win if you do something only finding goal will make rockslammer go straight 6210c09 shspec200 future org trends if scientology organizations did nothing cohesive and had central control but only had people doing processing and if combined with this situation there were other people with vested interest in making slaves we could get thrown on the dung heap and scientology could end up being practiced with electric shock by governments on the other side we could have completely different picture wellunified scientology with sufficient international esteem and force to overcome any attempt to use it wrongly buddhism for lack of plan ended up being an enslaver of people some thought needs to be given to scientologys future to make sure that scientology doesnt end up like buddhism in buddhism nirvana became like gpm look at picture of nirvana sometime it looks like someone surrounded with valences gpm lamaism with more ghosts and devils became like another gpm zen buddhism was based on the idea that if you are hit you know much of it is dramatization of axiom 10 the indian rope trick is mass hypnotism the east never had technology that did anybody any good they knew few answers but they all wound up in the soup so this is the first time on this planet and maybe in this universe when sentient beings could better themselves without worsening someone else we are looking at tremendous force not as in bullets but force of knowingness theta force in this universe one is used to seeing good people being squashed it starts to look like goodness is weak not force and that evil is strong that is this universes lesson but it is not true the reverse is true even though this universe would like us to believe otherwise and seems to provide numerous proofs to the contrary if you block theta comm line and tap it you can suck certain power off it that is residual in it but it will explode in very short order 244the way an organization gets in bad shape is by individuation an org commits overts against other orgs and gets into games condition with them then starts considering itself strange and different then it cant communicate anymore or function anymore this cycle is an interesting phenomenon which one can see every day overts are followed by the still after the confusion the withhold the quiet moment on the battlefield is the one that sticks so the stable datum is likely to be whatever someone thought after the fight was over this is not necessarily what holds it still at all one dramatizes the withhold it is not the overt but the withhold that is the source of action for instance bill shoots joe and doesnt tell the police he fires joe falls bill feels remorse and says i mustnt tell the police and that not the shooting is what he dramatizes as time goes on he is longer sure what he mustnt tell to get rid of the source of pronouncement of his guilt he commits more overts against the police his i mustnt tell the police equates to individuation from the police he also mustnt be joe the victim that is another individuation he might be able to tell you the withhold i mustnt tell the police but he will probably not be able to spot or asis the prior overt since it is at the level of action committing an overt results in an individuation the more separate we are the less we can communicate and the less we can understand if you want laugh get someone to explain something to you in an area that he has overts on using symbolic logic where instead of numbers you are using meanings all mathematics can be derived from arc in the absence of arc ie when there are many overts there is understanding or knowledge overts lower which lowers the other two r and c someone who is totally stupid in an area has overts in that area in the absence of arc there can by definition be knowledge you can always apply these mechanics backwards you can make someone feel that he has done something if he has withhold about it if we tell someone that we will burn him in the electric chair he will dream up crime to fit the punishment even if he continues to protest his innocence cf the jews in german concentration camps who felt they must have somehow betrayed their fatherland also if you tell someone not to touch something enough times he will start to believe that it is dangerous whether it is or not this is because you have told him not to communicate with it and the definition of dangerousness is not to be communicated with logic is twopoled there are two sides to an equation the mind also operates on twopoled basis thus when describing scientology to someone if you keep on saying that it isnt like this that or another thing he will get the idea that it simply isnt you have to dream up something scientology is just like so there will be datum of comparable magnitude you will find that the more arc he has towards the thing you compare scientology with the better he will understand scientology so the best strategy is to compare scientology to himself his highest arc terminal this will intrigue him at least you want things better right so does scientology you probably have lot of basic wisdom about life some buried but really there you have observed things scientology ia like you you like to be free scientology wants that you would be surprised how effective even so crude an argument could be with people it doesnt even matter if his understanding of scientology is correct or not he will get some r and c in the absence of any arc you have observation and knowledge of the object or thing something you feel something about have tiny reality on and have communicated slightly to the vicinity of that thing would be something that you would understand only slightly but you would know it existed there is an understanding that goes along with each step of the tone scale up to total arc which is total understanding this leads up to being part of everything which is the booby trap of nirvana the reverse of individuation is enforced association one can obsessively become something there is cycle here overts first lead to individuation then goes on through the cycle to obsessive identification with the thing overted against for more detail on this cycle see pp 242242a above pcs associate themselves with their own oppterms in varying degrees this phenomenon occurs throughout existence what you resist you become is here more accurately stated as that against which you have overts you become one becomes more and more individual and individuated up to limit at which point the harder one tries to individuate the more one becomes sort of fake version of that against which one has overts this shows up in dynamic assessment see pp 305308 and clearly shows up with the item this is how the person rockslams 245if an organization overts against another one it becomes more and more individuated until it becomes lowerlevel beingness thetan will run whole cycle this way that is why you get the dead thetan at 20 he is obsessively being what he was once part of we must keep the above mechanism of individuation in mind and look at the organizational plan that says that one scientologist is field auditor and another is staff member this plan gives us source of inadvertent withholds if we are planning anything broad in the way of organizations we have to eliminate any incipient individuation or we will get fake scientology scientology must be single org in which the members freely participate yet scientology orgs must never individuate from scientology they must never be allowed unhandled overts or scientology will crash like every other attempt to help man the hco 10 tends to further individuation since it makes hco different from the org philosophers say that every organizations ethic is strongest at its inception but actually there ia reason why its ethic shouldnt get much higher to accomplish this you must set it up such that organizations are not made different from each other in order to avoid the incipient inadvertent withhold which would lead to true scientology being in existence here lrh goes into describing at some length an ideal scene for lower level scientology organizations looking further ahead when you have cleared everyone the scientology centers will be political centers and scientology will be the government l ron hubbard type 3 idate91062

quality auditing and he clears as slowly as he flubs if all is not going well look to what is wrong with the auditor not the pc there is nothing wrong with pcs some pcs require more cleverness on the part of the auditor than others apparently the individuality of life was all attained by goals that doesnt mean people are individuals because of goals it means that they are odd individuals because of goals goal is symptom of individuation so each person acts differently in processing but there is goal too difficult to be found if you can discover goal never to be discovered why you have damned good technology auditing quality is not associated with sternness or immovability or with being able to repeat the auditing command or the idea that the auditor must always be right an instructor watching half dozen auditors may think that he needs half dozen new rules to overcome these students peculiar difficulties actually a11 he needs is tremendous ability to detect variation from the standard rule this variation is sometimes so clever and well hidden that one never spots it an auditor can leave the session on the forward track by leaving the pc at time point and progressing to point g as fast as possible the auditor is actually leaving the session by way of the future time track instead of the door the auditor is running the session process and the pc is still stuck in the first rud that the auditor couldnt confront and therefore didnt handle in an effort to avoid facing the confusion in session the auditor unwittingly refuses to set up session he ignores and evades some part of the session that he has had trouble with now the pc is trying to get into session while the auditor tries to run from the session the pcs who give you the most trouble are the ones who do the least they dont explode at you they dont walk out they are just never in session and auditing never bites they make forward progress the good pc is produced by an auditor who never gets the pc into session enough to arc break them everything is all sort of shallow dusted off but not investigated etc there was communication and understanding present the auditor was trying to avoid arc breaks so there was arc at the outset and the whole session was an arc break standard auditing is the cycle of asking the auditing question of that pc who is sitting in that chair getting response or answer from that pc which is then understood by the auditor and is acknowledged by the auditor in such way that the pc knows he did properly answer when this is interfered with weirdnesses creep in it is terribly simple cycle and terribly simple people such as myself dont seem to have too much trouble with it more brilliant people figure their way through and arrive at some kind of mutated answer to it that produces noauditing situation and how they manage to do this is the subject of an instructor this is the instructors nightmare the 246instructor must observe the departure from the simple comm cycle and get the auditor to see what he is doing the instructor has to point out to students their errors in such way that they realize that they are not doing what they should be doing where do all these oddball considerations come from apart from goals which is source that we already know about man can rise above his aberrations anyway he doesnt have to dramatize his aberrations to the full it is not good enough to say that his goal and his item oppose his being good auditor even though he will perhaps never be fully expert until these are out of the way there is another element however the auditor has fixed idea left over from some group or philosophy or activity about what is supposed to happen or what he is supposed to do to make something happen when he audits for instance he may have been part of society which supposed that there was reason why you couldnt decide to be anything you wanted to be and immediately become it according to this view all men were evil because they couldnt do this thats rather familiar one on the track this is weird way of making nothing out of thetans an auditor with this kind of background operates on the basis that the pc is weak because he doesnt just make up his mind to go clear and do it another oddball consideration is why should you ask anybody question they already know and they know you know wait minute those are the people who think that everybody knows all about them to whom every minute is missed withhold this is the consideration well that is obvious to so it should be obvious to him then there is the consideration that the auditor has to control the session and that that means never let the pc originate or never confess that you didnt understand the answer or never check anything the pc tells you is out like rud so this auditor is doing basic notis of auditing the whole time he is auditing and it will be found that he has never examined his fixed idea with this auditor the instructor must 1 find the fixed idea 2 get the auditor to look at it person can get the impression of knowing from an impact so if you have committed fantastic number of overts against thing you conceive that you know something about it but its an inverted knowingness its the total cycle of individuation and the pc returns on the reverse curve of inversion back to the center of impact see pp 242242a for more detailed description of this cycle at this point he knows that he knows but ask him say psychiatrist what he knows and he cant tell you anything that he knows if you kept it up things would get very interesting because you would deindividuate him out of an obsessed interiorization into whatever hes doing you would be reversing the cycle until he again knows he doesnt know when you try to teach such an individual something to know that room has already been rented it has occupants you cant because he already knowsat the level of impact and obsessive interiorization so you have to reverse that cycle and convince him that there is something he doesnt know this is the guy who greets everything you tell him with yes i know so you say to him everybody hates you and you will get yes i know 0h now wait minute well i knew if i knocked long enough somebody would open that door hello if you press such an auditor long and well enough as an instructor he will eventually cognite either that he knows or that he doesnt know and new piece of certainty will be added to his auditing dont leave these fixed ideas uninspected by the auditor just ask him to inspect his own considerations about why he is doing must do or should do what he is doing wrong take his cockeyed memorized answers acknowledge and then give the question again break down his machinery and he will finally see some screwy alteris that he has added into what he really should be doing ask him what puzzles you in session and you will get an item of alteris and confusion it is usually something he has added which wasnt taught all additives occur in the absence of understanding or the presence of misunderstanding idiocy equals all additives and understanding understanding is the reason for additives misunderstanding is the reason for additives know this 247misunderstandings get picked up on meters as disagreement nocomprehension of education by disagreement is fascinating approach hence while word clearing on meter you dont ask on spotting read what didnt you understand there you ask for the symptom of the lack of understanding what is the disagreement there in life with respect to knowledge disagreement occurs after the misunderstanding get the auditor to spot his disagreements and you will find his misunderstoods if you get him to give you twelve things in that bulletin you agree with you will inevitably get the twelve things they disagree with person cannot do what he does not understand increase persons understanding arc of what he is doing and he will do it better an auditor is not evil there is something he misunderstands or doesnt understand about the function of the auditor or the cycle of auditing action you cant understand psychiatrists because you dont realize that they havent any goals they arent doing anything that you would think they should be doing goofing auditor can get really wild in his computations you have to spot it and get him to spot it for instance you could get computation like this 1 im trying to straighten out this pcs mind 2 therefore i have to correct the things that they think 3 the only way to correct anything is to change it 4 so to change the pc i have to correct him 5 so i have to tell the pc something different every time he says something if you do not understand what is going on in session you wont be able to handle that session at the bottom of all error is misunderstanding you restore understanding of something by deleting the disagreement with it then you can study it and do things with it etc 6210c30 shspec204 prehav scales and lists lrh comments on z unit progress see hcopl 8dec62 training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units the shsbc at that time had new streamlined form consisting of v w x and z units with z being the most advanced unit the material of the z unit consisted of additional clearing data the form of the course and scientology plans auditing requirements were goal found on self and goal found on pc this would give class iv certificate if all check sheets complete class iii cert if unit complete and above auditing requirement completed class ii cert if unit auditing requirements met r212 see page 339 below cchs assists and prepchecking and only x unit checksheets complete also some general comments on rigorous training see also hcob 13oct62 processes any former data on the subject of assessing scales was prior to the experience of nulling goals we have learned that items can disappear from list without being out or appear on list without being in all nulling of lists is therefore to be done as follows we have scale or list from some source and we have lot of words verbs terminals or whatever old style assessment by elimination is superseded by new style that is much faster then tiger drilling the items it is done by reading each item in turn the ones that produce disturbance of the needle not necessarily an instant read at this point are in the time to judge whether it is proper read is when it is still in at the end keep the questionable ones in until you have eliminated most having assessed each line mark the ones that read matter how they read in this means that they disturbed the needle when the pc is in rock slam area the pc is all over the place the read can be early late etc for instance read could appear latent because the rising portion of rock slam could obscure the first part of the read if the pc is out of session you may get prior reads but goals almost always instant read in assessing scale the time to get picky about reads is when you have an item still in and it is one of the few remaining now you get nice about it rocket reads are consistent rook slams are not the item with the slam has far more authority than the auditor the to may sit there cogniting silently having forgotten the auditor altogether 248on dynamic assessment as you go down the list pay attention to the pcs somatics on the different levels you would be foolish to go headlong down the items list and pay attention to the somatics that the pc is getting you may find the pcs valence at one of these levels he is likely to hit an item which is where he has been for millenia and if you dont watch what you are doing you will go on leaving him there standard assessment by elimination is not likely to work except with really good auditor who maintained real two way comm with the pc inval or eval out ruds etc items on the rock slam chain must be right therefore the procedure must be revised the revised version is easy to do especially if you can see the meter read it does require precise meter reading the pc must know what you are doing and what you are trying to find or the whole list can be protest be sure you can read the list before you try to assess it so that you can give the items right if the pc is rockslammer on scientology and you give an item wrong the item could rockslam at the very least it can make the pc protest wrong or irrelevant item on list read back to the pc is being asserted by the auditor and protested by the pc therefore it will read the pc may get caught up in an oppterm and may get protest reads from that another phenomenon is everything on the list reacing that is bypassing the item all the items can stop reading too either one of these two phenomena indicates that the midruds of the session not the list are out one item in every now and then is what looks right if the midruds are out the pc is handling the outrud on down the list and everything can read on that outrud when this happens the auditors voice reading anything creates greater effect on the pc and the item has greater effect on the meter the pc is vulnerable as in bridge because partial win becomes missed withhold so the auditors voice matter what he says will produce reaction the pc really has missed withhold whichever rud is out if this phenomenon is increased further nothing will read however if you put session midruds in too often the pc will be driven out of session by cleaning cleans if you assess for awhile without noticing that nothing was reading when you see the column of xs the next time through call these items again to be sure this system is to prevent reads from being wiped out by outmidruds and to let you select the right item by tiger drilling see p 295a for tiger drill procedure it is best to err on the side of having too many items left in to be tiger drilled you should leave say five items in midruds may not be out enough to screw up the session but they may be out enough to screw up particular item so the procedure is 1 assess by elimination to few between three and eight items keeping midruds in 2 start tiger drilling using sixbutton tiger drill unless the pc is protesty in which case you can make it seven by adding protest after tiger drilling you are looking for slam if an item stays in with mere dirty needle circle it but dont necessarily buy it buy the biggest read you should get bigger read on the right item and smaller read on the wrong item after tiger drilling you dont necessarily do this with big polish operation because you dont have the same need to be precise as with goal just tiger drill it enough to make sure this should not take more than three minutes dont pay any attention to pain and sensation while you are doing this just dust them off if you cant make up your mind tiger drill them harder 6211c01 shspec206 the missed missed withhold lrh enumerates the many bulletins that have come out on missed withholds starting in february 1962 in spite of all this the subject has not been duplicated by students people keep picking up withholds instead of missed withholds all arc breaks stem from missed withholds i dont know exactly how to get this across to you except to be brave squint up your eyes and plunge get the missed withhold 249a missed withhold is withhold that people nearly found out about but didnt you want to find out what people almost found out withhold is something pc did and isnt talking about it is not missed unless someone nearly found out about it the missed withhold has nothing to do with what the pc did or is doing its not the pcs action it is the other persons action and the pcs wonder about it it often shows up as recurring withhold one which the pc keeps giving you the charge keeps coming up because of the restimulation as yet unlocated of someone possibly finding out missed withhold has nothing to do with the pc it is another persons action and the pcs wonder about it forget that it is even withhold you are looking for exact moments in the lifetime of this pc when somebody almost found out and hes never been sure since whether they did or they didnt we dont care what they almost found out we only care that they almost found out something that is the address to missed withhold its an otherpersonthanthepcs action its an other persons action the pc is stuck in the unknownness of the uncertainty as to whether someone else knew this blows when the pc spots it missed withhold is an overt and withhold plus mystery the magnitude of the overt has nothing to do with its evaporation the degree of mystery is what holds it in place if you want to know what is sticking thetan to something look for the mystery sandwich even overts themselves wind up in the mystery of whether you should have done it this causes withholding of further action all things boil down to right conduct so when you ask the pc for missed withholds be alert for whether the pc is giving you withholds or missed withholds the number of withholds person has on the whole track is undoubtedly staggering you dont need to get them all to clear somebody the whole anatomy of game is ow you gather energies by the mechanism of ow which result in solidmass terminals making game possible etc in spite of all that you dont have time enough to run nut all the pcs overts even for one lifetime general ow does have its uses it is useful for getting the pc into session and smoothing things out but it is generally too lengthy so to see case go sproing ask the pc for nearlyfoundouts when i tell you to pick up pcs missed withhold i want you to pick up another persons action not the pcs and it is best characterized as nearly found out you are running the almostdiscovered track youll never see anybody quite so upset as somebody who has been just barely missed look at pedestrian who was not hit or bear that is biting at bullet that just missed him or an exam that you failed by one or two points its the nearness of the miss that counts it is misestimation of effort or thought thetans main attention is on estimation of thought effort and look he wants to know how much look is look his certainties are all based on proper estimation of thought effort look etc when an error is made here it is upsetting how much knowledge is knowingness that is an estimation how much emotion does it take to be emotional enough to create the desired effect what is proper symbol etc you can estimate everything except how much mystery constitutes mystery because that is mystery you are now into the noestimation band and it is all mysterious the notknowingness of it is upsetting notknowingness that is probably known is especially painful because of the multiple notknow flows involved take notknowingness and play with it both ways they knew but they didnt or couldnt have known you know they knew but you know they didnt know the fourway flows of missed withhold are painful to thetan this is the stuff of which insanity is made insanity in the effort band of the know to mystery scale is cant reachmust reach insanity in the mystery band is diddidnt mustmustnt know that is what missed withhold is and what it is doing to the pc its just pure mystery mucilage and the thetan will stick right to it getting just the overt and withhold off when there is an added mystery of missed withhold doesnt produce an asisness of the section of track where the pc is stuck because the pc is not stuck with the overt or the withhold the pc is stuck with the almost found out so of course nothing asises if you only get the ows and you get recurring withhold you could get remarkable results running get the idea of people nearly finding out about you you could run this on three flows this process would free up track that the pc had never seen before but which had been right in front of his nose so when pulling missed withholds it is not what the pc did which is of interest when pulling withholds get the name rank and serial number of the person who missed it i couldnt care less what was missed i dont want the pcs action i want the pcs guess about the other guy get who the pc thinks might know etc etc if you have gotten off his overts on something and he still feels bit weird about it you are apt to think that he must have more overts so you keep after him for more this will send him around the bend since you are essentially cleaning clean you have to find 2501 who nearly discovered the overt 2 when 3 how often this is what is needed to complete the cycle that was started when the overt was almost discovered just as far as time is concerned it is mystery sandwich the thetan is wondering whether certain punitive track is going to happen it doesnt so that time doesnt exist the result in the creation of mockedup track that never actually appears on the track and therefore hangs up in time not dropping the other shoe is like producing missed withhold so you dont ask what have we failed to find out about you ask what have we nearly found out about you and when did we nearly find it out the first gets withholds the second gets missed withholds the worst type of missed withhold is where the pc is asking himself which one of my crimes did he maybe discover 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth it is very difficult to go around remembering all the time you get stuck pontius pilate asked what is truth truth is very near ultimate in its most severe interpretation lots of people have stated what truth is without realizing that they are putting an absolute where there is actually maybe truth is relative commodity the best approach to truth is contained in the mathematics used in connecting telephone switchboards they dont select out subscribers with arithmetical truth arithmetic is theoretical truth it is only theoretical because there is commodity connected with it it is truth of symbols errors only turn up when people say the symbols mean something in reality two apples minus two apples equals apples is magicians trick apple is relative thing there is still something of an apple you can say well there are apples on the table after you take two apples off that is true as long as you accept time as truth which is adventurous the statement is only true for one particular time and place yet it passes as truth it is truth but relative one thetan since apples came into existence has utterly asised an apple so two apples minus two apples equals apples is only relative unless it presupposes some kind of magic we have become used to accepting such things as true the abstract 220 is true but it is true only because we have set it up that way the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desperateness it is an adventurous step philosopher who seeks to discover and teach truth is taking his life in his hands as well as the lives of many others therein lies his responsibility it is adventurous because it is the only track you have to go the whole way on there is short stop on the way to truth you have to walk to the end of the road otherwise all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you there is such thing as relative philosophical truth that is safe if it doesnt approach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses if you address the subject of the physical universe through the physical sciences you will find weird things in your path the savants of these sciences use the phrase exact science with great impudence considering the complete difference between what is given as truth in two different fields like chemistry and physics there is an article in the encyclopedia britannica at the turn of the century that wisely said that people wouldnt find out much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis that preceded time and space physics has gotten the world in trouble by building weapons that can be used by men who arent sane there are workable truths which gives the exact sciences bloated notion of themselves because they deal in workable truths in the field of the study of man people try to use as workable truth the notion that one can do anything about man because he is merely an animal this idea started as revolt against religions control of mens faith psychology is study that is peculiarly religious and was so until 1879 when wundt theorized that man has soul up to that point psychology had been religious study looking at the will reason etc somebody moved in on it in the spirit of revolt just as the advances of the exact sciences have here and there down the track blown up religion so the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in total falsehood concerning the mind at the same time they have developed an unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the road to truth and not going towards truth 251gautama siddhartha discovered how to exteriorize without discovering the laws governing it or how to let someone else exteriorize at will how many hundred million people did he condemn to slavery by not walking all the way down that road because halftruths have been used and misused ever since knowing this it takes brave man to go in that direction he knows that the traps and upsets of existence are composed of halftruths and that all efforts to enlighten can be employed to enslave and entrap by the fact of twoway flow aesops fables originally had morals they were just amusing stories this is pertinent to what you are doing because in the microcosm of single person you have the macrocosm of the universe the universe proceeds from basic postulates you can go on from these basic postulates to spot the goals of gold and lead and the methods of livelihood of quartz and schist they arent alive but they follow behavior pattern all flies wash their faces in the same way it is wonderful the way some postulates stick moss or man you are looking at the same cumulative structure based on some intentions and dedications you could reanalyze the world of chemistry or physics on the basis of postulates and intentions one of the booby traps of studying science is the sort of statement typified by nobody knows what electricity is this is in fact just remark not even postulate but everyone takes it as truth so they go into agreement with it and therefore are debarred from discovering more truth people have been telling other people for long time that they cant find out about truth the idea of the unknowable has some use but only to let people see that you dont have to know all about something before you start to find out about it emmanuel kant used the concept of the unknowable differently he said that the unknowable would never be known by anybody well how did he find out about it even by philosophic examination it is preposterous if you cant experience it at all how can you know it exists to be notknown there are some roads that are agreed to be closed for instance there is an idea that it is bad to know about the human mind some things it is better not to know if you are alive you know something about the human mind what is really dangerous is to find out nothing more about it in the last few days the cobalt60 was close to spreading across the steppes of russia and the plains of the us because of what because it is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree but they recognize what is really dangerous if you know of the existence of something it is dangerous not to know all about it people concede that they dont know anything at all about it that is an idiotic premise in the field of the mind they are already aware of the existence of figure think calculate in other beings so they are already started on the road to knowledge of the human mind it is very dangerous to go further so the search for truth isnt the province of few everyone has started to know something about it but not to know more about it than they do will cause them to die that doesnt even seem startling it is so accepted if group decides to go all the way on the road to truth the more they know the less dangerous it is what is really dangerous is to suppose that people think and to know nothing more about it than that it is also very dangerous to be spotted as one who is walking towards truth unless you go the whole way it is booby trapped everyone is very suspicious of anything being known because people who have jumped up and said something was known have often lied if they pretended to know more then others they have committed overts if they found some partial truth and never got any further but instead spread bricabrac in all directions as the true wisdom they have committed the overt of consigning perhaps billions of people to slavery so there is substitute for walking the track lrh has never doubted that he would bring off this study though he has often wondered whether or not the time factor would upset things we needed few clear years if you have reputation for knowing you enter into mechanism called the missed withhold if you seem to have the gift of knowing about the mind people think you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves first dynamic truth this includes their own aberrations their ideas about rightness of conduct etc so you run into missed withholds scientist wants to get away from right and wrong because he is blind to the possibility that there could be an exact right conduct the idea of right conduct has been particular concern of eastern philosophers it has been ignored in the west all considerations of behavior and the ow mechanism are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct in back of the ow mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist this is the saving grace of any race of beings survival is the monitoring factor of rightness of conduct the behaviorist would try to tell you that right conduct is first dynamic matter that it is not survival but selfpreservation this misses the boat person commits overts not because of self preservation but because of survival that is his rightness of conduct the difference is that in fact one acts out of more than one dynamic right conduct is always group activity not an individual 252one matter how much person speaks of integrity to himself his ideas of his own rightness are based on the concepts of the group to which he belongs so we get third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all ow and missed withholds the only thing senior to ow is the pure mechanics of existence as given in the early axioms those early axioms are very close to absolute truth thought absolutes are unattainable because the only absolute is static and that is nothing hence it is unattainable because it cannot be had the aberrations person engages in are his efforts to discover right conduct with the handicap that mores change from group to group and lifetime to lifetime so there is road to truth on the subject of right conduct if you realize that thetans aberrated condition results from 1 search for right conduct 2 an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct 3 the breaking of codes of right conduct then you are walking the road to truth moral statements are the entrance of arbitraries into conduct not truths this fact is unknown to legislators who always try to say that their laws are true but in making the laws they longer even consult the customs of the people but instead try to reverse the social order however laws which dont evolve from the customs of the people 1 operate as total tyranny 2 are totally unenforceable prohibition was good example of this fact this concerns you because you are in the business of determining truth from right conduct or now imsupposedtos people think that right conduct is truth they think they have some data when they dont your period of peril is past there was time when taking you as unit of truth there was question whether or not your state of understanding of yourself could be materially improved by study and processing however it is now clear that if anyone will sit still and if the auditor does the right processing this will occur we started out with everyone stupid as hell on the subject including lrh originally now we have gotten to the point where someone can know all about where he has been what he has done and where the axioms look to him like clearlystated obvious things we are essentially in the business of individuals dont forget that matter what you are trying to do or handle whether it is world government or whatever it is you will never in your whole history handle more than sn individual if you fail to handle an individual then you will have to set up all sorts of groups and laws to do it the raison detre of most earth organizations is the fact that they could not handle an individual this brought about their construction not their demise this isnt true of all third dynamics only the aberrated ones here on earth this is actually an inverted third dynamic they couldnt handle the first dynamic so they developed an organization not to have to do it despite that scientology is the one activity on this planet that doesnt follow this rule there still tends to be an organization that gets pulled in and grows up around lrh at times this organization fails to deliver service due to shortage of time or material or personnel but on the whole we are handling the individual russia shoots individuals and loves the masses this is aberrated you can handle the individual if everything you do is individually tailored to serve his needs so he is not overlooked whenever you fail to handle an individual you set up an upset so you will set up an organization laws and all sorts of ow to do it we are probably the only organization today going in the direction of clear third dynamic we use ow only to park an individual until we can handle him there is truth in the mass of things and truth in moral codes truth isnt to be found there only agreements there is truth apart from the individual if there is any truth you are it if there is any truth to be known you will know it when someone almost caves in because you have confronted him and made him wonder what you do know ie when you have missed withhold on him your only mistake is not to reach him as truth you are at that moment confronting the road to truth and you have got to travel it because you have already started to there will be many pc that you will start to process many person that you will tell about scientology of whom you will say why did i get up this morning if someone says i heard that ron doesnt believe in god the wrong thing to do is to unload jump off the road you handle it all your disasters anyplace will stem from the instant you backed off turned around did something else and set up an organization to 253handle this jerk you will only fail when you dont try because if you make some stab at it he wont go away you will be surprised to find that you will pick him up somewhere down the track many times you will think you have failed when you havent the only mistake is to try to go backwards on the road to truth that is dangerous if you fail to stand up to someone who is mad at you because of his missed withholds or to the guy in the pe course who says it cant be true because ron doesnt believe in god that is when you fail catastrophes occur people get mad at you you cave in but that can be changed or handled if you fail to handle an individual you end up setting up an org to handle masses but not individuals individuals only stand up and yap in order to be handled there is truth to be found and there is road to truth you have that in you and every time you look at human being you see it in him rut you dont find truth in the mass of things and in moral codes since you understand what human nature is about the more you know and understand it the less these factors like having to handle banky individual will trouble you but every little fellow has started on the road to truth his only stupidity is not to keep going we are almost there the main road and the thorns are behind us we only retreat from our position to the degree that we dont realize that you cant start case you cant embark on clearing planet or an individual and do it diffidently without to some degree seeing it through to final conclusion your only disasters will stem from failure to follow that road all the way through 6211c13 shspec210 the difficult case problems intensive see p 292 is apparently capable of producing book one mest clear if it is done right it has done so on couple of pcs if this is not happening elsewhere than at st hill it may be that people elsewhere dont know what free needle is peoples tas have been gotten to clear read with mention of fn so pay some attention to this it could be that it was happening without being reported the aspect of case depends on the way the case is handled generally how the case is handled has great deal to do with how rough the case looks say case and case b are similarly tough cases if case gets lot of usual actions good hope factor good rfactor and case b gets unusualness and wrong actions case will run easily and case b will run rough and break anybodys heart psychiatric classification behavior in life etc have bearing on how hard or easy the case will be to handle the same goes for scientology classification schemes we make our own tough cases the black v theetieweetie etc it doesnt matter the length of time to handle the case doesnt compare to the state of the case all cases are hard actually some are made more difficult by preconceptions and classifications that dont really apply the technology has bypassed the difficulties the case that you will have trouble with is always spook and surprise to you it is not the psychiatric disaster case the tough ones are the ones who look sane and able and lie like hell because they dont do the commands they get upset if you keep at them to see if they did the command that just makes them feel accused and they get harder to audit you can spot this kind of case by observing that after short period of modern auditing the case hasnt recovered this case either 1 hasnt done your commands or 2 you havent audited the case this case interrupts the auditing cycle the most extreme example of this kind of case is the individual who cant communicate at all or the case that cant hear or that has command of the language that you are using but that is simple you recognize the outofcommunication state that he is in and know that you would get nowhere with subjective process like straightwire but you miss the case who ostensibly speaks and understands english but never answers the question or executes the commands there is actually gradient of this which at its top level includes every case sooner or later any case wont do the command the spook is the one who never does the command and always does something else what is happening is that he is on circuit he is being wired set of valences the pc is out there somewhere and has nothing to do with the auditing at all 254dont let your pc sit there in sort of comfortable relaxed puzzle find out what is going on but dont chop up the pc auditors sometimes sense that the pc isnt executing the command and they start harassing the pc chopping him up because they know something is wrong they dont feel in good 2wc with the pc so you move in and get insistent with the pc then the ta moves even less this case is the last one in the world to admit that he is not doing the command he could even get ta say he is running the command through an electronic incident because he knows that if it changes he is better how do you handle this case you watch the ta while you are running the pcs right havingness process or you can run another process that has something to do with the physical universe like op pro by dup scs or cchs if you get good ta with that flatten that the reason you dont notice the ta is that the pc is off the meter but if the pc gets lot of ta in the rudiments and little in the body of the session you know at once that the pc never does the auditing command it is selfevident that this is the true state of affairs if you run the pt environment eg with look at the _______ and the ta moves while problems intensive gives zilch ta here you will see that the pc can get ta such people have short span into the past reality on what went on in the world ceases five minutes to five days ago or so in the body of the session you are trying to send him out of pt if all pcs were like this tough case we would clear people with ruds since ta action gives direct index of case change if you dont get as much ta action in the body of the session as you do in running the rudiments please realize that the process is not running ta motion mirrors directly and immediately the amount of change which is being secured it is direct index of how much bank is changing or shifting so you handle the difficult case by giving ruds and havingness sessions case with good reality on the bank wouldnt get good ta on ruds ta on havingness or any cch or contact process means that the pc is becoming aware of the walls of the room what wall indeed his concept of mass is being shifted by confronting his environment it is not bank mass that is giving ta it is the mass of the walls of the room the pc is in shape to be audited because where is he going to be audited from furthermore he doesnt have the stability of pt to audit against so any attempt on your part to get him to address the track throws him into confusion he cant answer the auditing question because he has point of reference cases are audited against the reference point of pt oddly enough the memory of eight million years ago totally depends on knowing it was sight million years from specific time eg pt guy who is stuck in an electronic incident of three million years ago will get ta when you get him to look at his immediate vicinity otherwise hs will run problems intensive from point three million years ago which is an unstable point so you are running confusion against an instability but two confusions never made stability case that is wildly out of pt seldom answers the auditing command or executes it and auditing depends exclusively on getting the command executed the auditing cycle must occur every time the auditor opens his mouth on recall time you communicated if the time he commed is up the track from where he is stuck he cant recall it because it hasnt happened yet so he has to do something else so for instance he mocks up psychoanalyst against the auditor or he holds the two back corners of the room he does these things because he doesnt want to wasts the auditors time ta action on ruds and on the body of the session is the only reliable indication of this type of case in this situation it becomes important to prepare case dont try to plow the ground with cadillac it is the wrong vehicle if the pc isnt doing the command dont harass him do objective processes when the motion goes out of the ta do the body of the session with subjective processes the gradient scale of toughness of cases is proportional to the amount of ta they get on pt or nearpt processes ruds and havingness to get good reality on this point take pc who has been having an awful time with 3gaxx and run some ptps or some such and watch the ta fly first mentioned in tape 6210c23 shspec202a 3gaxx also mentioned in tape 6210c23 3gaxx following the rock slam and 6210c25 shspec209 3gaxx secondary prehav scale these tapes are confidential the process lists and handles some types of implants it unburdens the case and locates goals see also pp 332335 below and hcobs 8nov62 listing pack ii and 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases for more on 3gaxx running the pc must be there before you audit him the auditing cycle requires the presence of the pc so give him lots of ruds and havingness and problems intensive on closetopt problem he can confront 255this type of pc will get sensation on list all right because he would get sensation from two days ago it is that unreal he has sensation because he is in the middle of confusion with referral point pt how do you expect him to be anywhere but in confusion thats what sensation basically is the pc in confusion give him pt then you can run him 6211c13 shspec211 entrance to cases lrh starts by referring to recent bulletin hcob 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases the subject of entrance to cases is becoming broad and encyclopedic there is new routine r321 see also p 356 below the original 3ga was highly workable but insufficiently delineated routine 321 is 3ga plus all the improvements like tiger drilling it would probably work on any case that was wellprepared but we cant count on case being wellprepared preparation would be done with cchs and prepchecks there have been frailties in the preparation of cases that have made it necessary to develop things that werent really vital we rediscover havingness every six months it seems it has been six months since the last time matter how tricky your auditing question is if the pc isnt there it wont reach him or alter his case unusual solution will get to him either so when faced with the unusual do the usual the very ordinary the tricky developmental work has had uses and has brought us forward on wellprepared case tiger drilling the 850goal list is easy the pc doesnt protest all the time the pc who is not well prepared isnt doing the commands and has dirty needle he never completes the auditing cycle the reads you get while tiger drilling arent coming from the po confronting anything they are coming from some automaticity even if the case is wellprepared you could still have difficulty doing r321 the goal could be absent from the list or on the list but so unreal to the pc that it would never answer up if confronted so you need process that overcomes the pcs enturbulated pt environment etc this process is 3gaxx 3gaxx is designed to totally grab the pcs attention and interest and to keep it where the rock slam is it will always be true that rock slam will produce interest it is sort of forced in sessionness interest follows rock slam you are overwhelming the socalled natural defenses of the mind you use the rock slam channel find the goal find the pairs of items all along the channel by their rock slams you can pretty well overwhump almost anything in the pc if you can get on the trail of rock slam you will be asked to do miracles to audit in noisy environments on poorly prepared cases for that you need very powerful processes 3gaxx is what you need it is designed to capture the pcs interest so much that he can only tell you what is in front of his face there are three bank elements that are handled in 3gaxx 1 the rock slam channel 2 the goals channel 3 set of pairs that lead from the dimmest beginnings of the gpm up to the tiniest pair in pt the route between these pairs is travelled from pt back to the beginning the procedure is to 1 find the goal and then 2 find items that have built up by the existence of this goal this is path marked by rock slams 3gaxx has rules such as the rule that the pcs interest follows the rock slam since this is true the pc has choice but to be in session suppose the pc is protesting midruds whenever you get off the rock slam channel this would be because he is only in session as long as you are on the rock slam channel where he cant help being interested it could also be because he has been beaten with midruds to point where he cant stand them when you are getting his prehav level items by listing ww would prehav level the answers come ripping off his circuits when havingness is low circuits key in someone who is in indifferent contact with pt has his circuits keyed in circuits are gpm items or their cousins aunts 256or uncles 3gaxx deals out the circuits that the pc would normally be using anyhow so he has choice but to give them to you and thus you do get an auditing cycle you start out with dynamic assessment see pp 305308 for the general procedure use these questions 1 what isnt part of existence 2 who or what have you detested 3 who or what would you prefer not to associate with in listing and nulling these follow the rock slam note these commands might be the precursors of later pts rundown tech lrh recognizes the enturbulative effect of environmental factors on auditing though as yet there appears to be official form of ethics handling there seems to be an attempt to handle all of it through tech so you are doing 3gaxx and now you call his attention to pt to get midruds in and you have godawful time nothing quite cleans up if you have goofed and invalidated one of his items you will really be in the soup since he is allergic to pt which is where he would have to be to clean it up so process as beefy as 3gaxx must be done with expertise particularly when used on pc who is not well set up for it you have leeway for error when you have overwhelmed the natural defenses of the mind that is why untrained auditors shouldnt try to run these highpowered processes with r321 you can find the pcs goal whether he is ready to find it or not by entering the case with dynamic assessment by rock slam an additional method of entering the case is roll your own prehav see hcob 7nov62 roll your own prehav the prehav scale to be exact must be given by the pc in his own words so find the prehav level and ask the represent question get list and find the item which will be his perfect individual prehav level this procedure gets rid of the necessity for huge long assessments and you will probably wind up with rock slam this way you will list who or what would do that and get terminal or oppterm it doesnt matter which the assessment can be done simply by calling each level assessing by elimination down to few items tiger drilling those items to one and saying consider committing overts against _______ this should turn on the slam so you get the item which is the protagonist or antagonist in the game which pursues from the fellow having had goal in the first place they are like pair of dumbbells there is also another pair of dumbbells the notpair pinned to the positive items electronically eg ww would smoke ww would not smoke ww would oppose smoking ww would oppose not smoking you can however safely ignore the negative items you could find the item get the oppose represent oppose that represent that etc etc you are not trying to clear somebody this way although you could theoretically by going back item by item down the rock slam channel it would be hard though lacking the goal it is easier to go down aways pick up the goal and then list it unburden the goal then find it and work with it if you kept discharging the case and at the same time disorienting the case you would get further and further from finding the goal you would really just be enturbulating the case say if you kept giving the pc items that didnt slam he would keep getting fuzzier and more confused this could occur when you went by detested person etc see p 333 see also p 243 above there is pair there which you have ignored if you go on to the dynamic assessment and the represent etc so your rule is to make pair when you get an item that rockslams you oppose it if it is still hot you represent it this isnt all that smooth when the pc is not clear the items can be out of order you have to pick your way through it the test by which you go is what is still slamming it will slam if you run get the idea of committing overts against itwithholding from it if it still slams it hasnt been opposed even if you think you got the oppterm 257the gpm straightens out only because you have gotten the pc to recognize the matter energy space and time that the item consists of it has been recognized and placed where it should be placed the pc has seen what it is opposed by and has gotten sensible about it this goes back to the earliest laws of the mind that lrh formulated namely that things are composed of 1 identities 2 similarities and 3 differences this is from dianetics the original thesis and dmsmh gpm is in state of total identification when you first greet it every item is every other item when you list you are bringing about similarity from an identity by causing the pc to find the item they the other items were all pinned to in the first place differentiation takes place and the thing starts blowing apart just calmly finding that the pc is rockslammer and telling him will make him significantly saner right there he was mad at the whole environment now he knows what hes mad at specifically eg scientology ron etc now if we find who or what was mad at whatever he was slamming on scientology or whatever we would have pair that would tend to blow because slam is the meter manifestation of games condition its the unsuccessful effort to withdraw from the thing he must attack it takes two items minimally to make package one stick wont burn it takes two to make fight every package has at least two items and really four including the not pair ie you also have to find out what wasnt against scientology and what scientology isnt rockslammer is only bad off before he has been detected when he finds out what his target really is scientology and then finds out what would attack that target he will feel better he will start to shed that valence and he can be someone else but the more rock slam you leave behind you by leaving items the more the rock slam will diminish the pcs attention is on those bypassed items and he cant confront the items ahead of him since he only slams on things that can become real to him the slam fades out so you had better get all the things that he can confront if you have available parts of his line plot with unopposed items you can free up more of his attention by filling in those blanks so heres why you are doing 3gaxx you are releasing sufficient attention from fancied opposition in the environment so the pc is not distracted and going backtrack from the ruffled point of the environment as you go on he will get less and less confused and more and more able to find his goal eventually you find the goal after you have hatful of items by variety of methods you could take goal like to dance on eggs that fired only three times but which rocket reads once in awhile you can do represent list on that goal to get similar goal and pull apart goals you can list for the goal that given item would have cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown but unless all this improves the pcs presence alertness and available attention you would do better to just give him problems intensive and cchs 6211c15 shspec212 terminals there is an item on the bulletin board about nixon we really clobbered him i hit him because he hit mary sue he was using the us secret service as sort of private gestapo all over washington which didnt seem right you will notice that after country has defeated country b customs of country b will show up in almost anyone will take on the color of his oppterm this is horrible but true people tend to think of themselves as the cowboy in the white hat and the oppterm as the cowboy in the black hat however the only real to tell whether you are dealing with terminal or an oppterm is whether it turns on pain or sensation pain shows that it is terminal sensation shows that it is an oppterm some people get tangled up because they consider themselves to be the guys in the black hat if you get terminal on the oppterm side or vice versa the consequence is great confusion such an item combination terminal turns on pain and sensation this is deteriorated package mark it in the center of the line plot its legitimate it is new terminal that has attributes of both terminal and oppterm sort of end of the road combination terminal which is lock on both the terminal chain and the oppterm chain 258in national life you get succeeding generations of politicians performing as combination terminals the us defeats germany then somewhere up the track there is tendency towards democratic fascism in the us it is ok for democracy to exist as long as we can also operate gestapo its that sort of thing that i tend to keep an eye on you may not realize it but you are all members of secret society you have been for very long time it is the spg you can enlist anyone there are dues only performance is required it is the society for the prevention of government it is interesting that man hasnt yet realized that government is the cause of his wars pure government attacks an sp government thus producing combination terminal the pure government henceforth isnt so pure keep this up and you will get what we have in the way of government lrh recently received an invitation to be part of group that is supposed to figure out what should be done with governments and man and atom bombs all the group is doing is meeting in the hope that someone will come up with solution all they are doing is to get people in communication they havent approached governments the reason why government occupies so much of peoples attention is that governments have spokesmen and salesmen while individuals do not democracy is highly publicized but in democracy everything is the peoples fault so the head of the government has responsibility but the people have real choice this is real mess with salesmen you get more and more government individuals become less and less the end of this process is totalitarianism the only reason you collide with government is that you are selling the idea of the individual you see that bettering things by handling the individual is workable system so you push it this puts you up against the government because it is for the government this makes you revolutionary in totalitarian world whether you intend to revolt or not the perfect reply to communist is to tell him that you are an anarchist that is the one thing that he cannot handle he is claiming that communism wants to do away with the state and you force him to say that government is necessary thus you turn him into conservative anarchy has always been rampant in countries just before the communists took over anarchy is the one thing that the communist fears he has so many overts on anarchists that they have almost become sacred to him similarly the us government is becoming more and more communistic eg with its tax laws things wont get straightened out in the political arena they will just get more and more confused you can predict the politics of the future by looking at the opposing sides and combining the least desirable characteristics of both combination terminals in politics occur because the least admired characteristics tend to persist that which is least admired tends to persist we are going to get the worst of russia and the us combined into super state unless we stop it this is also the fate of any individual livingness alone will not lead to new highly desirable state because the above mechanism will occur in the course of handling cases you will get look at the eventual fate of any individual you process in the absence of further processing suppose you could locate the chief terminal and the chief oppterm in an individual without in any way relieving them you could take the least desirable characteristics of both and get the combination terminal the person would become in few generations those terminals and oppterms that are near the top will produce new pair but first they will produce new single terminal the new combination terminal as the gpm flies off you will see that this had been taking place the freedom that is there to be freed is fantastic because all cases are in very deteriorated state when we first discovered the tremendous power that the basic postulate of an individual could exert over him in the course of creating the sections of the gpm we tended to see it as something brand new despite the fact that it is mentioned in the definition of the first dynamic in dianetics the original thesisi the dynamic of self consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual to obtain pleasure as an individual and to avoid pain it covers the general field of food clothing and shelter personal ambition and general individual purpose p 31 see also advanced procedures and axioms p 42 and p 270 above thetan does various basic things following the laws governing theta as formulated in the axioms however he also splinters off and postulates some portion or specialization of them he tries to go forward with this specialization as an individual purpose and trying to effect this purpose moves on with lot of accumulated mass and things like terminals oppterms combination terminals items upsets etc thus the thetan builds up section of the gpm then he postulates something else and 259builds up another section of the gpm that dwindles out it gets blown up thoroughly and the thetan gets sort of out of it he forgets it utterly then he makes up new individual purpose actually all these purposes are in controversion to the basic laws of this universe theta and the purposes of thetans and if there is any reason why it builds up mass it is that it is an alteris of the axioms the thetan is an individual already in games condition with his fellows and the universe then he decides to be even more individual and makes basic postulate it is this basic postulate that we are dragging up as goal this postulate is counter to the agreements on the structure of the universe as contained in the axioms so the thetan is now individuated out to the degree that he has pitted himself against the whole lot what we are finding out as we find items turn on somatics and clear the individual is that he hasnt gotten away with it there is the gpm and it is killing him he cant even execute his individual purpose or goal because it fights his own more basic agreements postulates etc he has called himself liar by violating these agreements eg the axioms and thus he has departed into super individuality as the individual goes forth postulating new goal he is flying in the teeth of all his former agreements so now he gets to point where he explodes out of the bank then he postulates new individuation new basic purpose he lives this one out when he finally gets out of it he adds it to the old stuff that he has accumulated each new purpose gets messed up faster and faster he finds more and more things he cant do and that he can longer confront eventually he wont even explode out of the mass anymore one day he says row come its all black and he wont get out of the gpm again this is hell an oblivion of total pain and sensation whats hell in religions theyll have some metaphorical method of trying to communicate but if they were talking about hell this is hell they recognize there is something waiting for them in the future and they try to shorten it up and say its the next life and this time youll die and youll go to it well thats just enthusiasm the only alternative to this grisly picture is scientology but people have been saved before too many times on the track eg by the autodafe of the inquisition thats why they are decidedly reluctant to be saved by scientology someone who gets mad at scientology and refuses further processing is fool he isnt aware of his future of total pain and sensation which is hell but thetans have long history of being sold pieinthesky so they are likely to be skeptical about what scientology has to offer someone who has been sold on heaven and hasnt found it and who knows that hell is possible begins to regard the idea of freedom with some doubt he has been straightened out before and has been cheated this area of betrayal comes up in the course of clearing someone the offer of help restimulates this area and the pc will fight help all the way until he gets reality on what is happening the kindest way to handle him is to give him fast reality on the fact that you mean business do something for him subjectively so that he will realize that he is on some kind of real road to truth the pc whose trust level is shot alterises commands doesnt answer etc the auditor can feel uncomfortable about this the healing sciences havent helped with their general ineffectiveness in most things wonder the pcs trust level is so low this is the main thing that gets in the way of dissemination the individual has fought the physical universe and the laws of the physical universe after agreeing to them he now alterises them since those laws concern matter energy space and time he starts accumulating mest that is what puts mest in his bank then he makes an individual purpose that has nothing to do with these other purposes he tries to go up against these other purposes with this individual purpose that causes lot of mass to accumulate then he does this again and again etc all this is true but this activity must have been based on very low level of confidence and trust anyway to have gone to all this trouble with all the individuation etc the thetan must have had very low level of trust and confidence he must have thought that what was going on was detrimental or he wouldnt have taken all this trouble to individuate from it most pcs are mad at the physical universe to some degree now here is something ive never told you before but it follows from the sixtyfour lectures of the 1952 philadelphia lectures the physical universe will stay there for the individual until the individual 260gets back to the first individuating goal that he made after agreeing to the axioms at this point you would think that the pc would hit total ot but he wont he still has to handle the axioms you will now have to back up through the axioms the pc at this point in processing would start telling you about the axioms even if he had never heard of them they are getting ready to blow the individuals agreement to the axioms his contribution to the axioms to that degree is in all probability his first basic trust you may have to go back to the axioms and run them sooner or later the pc will collide with them going backward the purposes that you will run into at first are all purposes that are individuations from the basic purpose you have to go long way back to pick up more than the first dynamic even today the fellow is generally on an inversion of the first you will find that there are seven dynamics that will invert on you you must reverse the inversion process before the pc gets to straight first dynamic he then has to go quite ways before he gets sight of the other dynamics that is what you are tackling in every pc there is deteriorated trust in everything not only in his fellow man but also in organizations group activities and any effort to do something for him he starts to get nervous when you start to do anything for him because he knows that that has always been dangerous for him you are reversing his experiential track so he is going back into areas that he thinks are dangerous and thinking these areas are dangerous he is nervous this applies to every pc what is important is your skill as an auditor the smoothness of your model session the positiveness of what you are doing the fact that you can produce result in the pc in which he has reality these things make him realize that you are going in the direction of freedom the pc may be so downscale that when he sees that he is going towards freedom he cant have it because it looks too good and you get into another wriggle wraggle you can add to the above phenomenon the idea that if you existed and if you freed man and did things for the physical universe then this person couldnt execute the first goal you will run into in processing him this goal one is not the first goal that the pc made it is the first one you find with this addition youve got rockslammer his distrust is not built just on goal one it goes earlier and is built on the quicksand that everybody is made of to handle him you have to find the oppterm to what he is rockslamming on then it tends to blow up his whole viewpoint on the subject of scientology will shift see hcob 23nov62 urgent routine 212 opening procedure by rockslam an hparca skill this bulletin gives r212 procedure at this point r212 is also known as 3gaxx for rock slammers evidently it is form of 3gaxx that can be done by lower than class iv auditor many other bulletins and tapes on r212 follow soon as your auditing is less than perfect you rekindle or permit to remain all the morass of distrust that has been generated down the track all the betrayals of promises of heaven all his experience of hell you can flub little but if you let the case drift too far out without win and you will key in the whole background of there is heaven and you will pay the price the individuals reality on hell is much greater than his reality on heaven thus the longer you take to produce result on pc the harder it is to get the result because of the distrust factor you cant say positively that person isnt rockslammer because he may have to be processed awhile before it shows up some rockslammers are below being rockslammers at first the pc may at first simply be nattery and then you have to rely on intuition there is absolute test of absolution except persistent case progress rockslamming relates to the degree of overting in your direction and his belief that if you did not exist he could achieve his basic goal once you discover and he discovers that he is rockslammer the discovery of it tends to pull its teeth all you have to do is to list the oppose list to the thing on which he is rockslamming and it will blow up in smoke if its an auditor write an opposition list to an auditor and get the first pt package capable auditor should be able to straighten this out in two or three hours you can list goal against any terminal or oppterm that rockslams sometimes you will wind up with the persons goal if so opposition it unhandled rockslammers will frequently become combination terminals squirrels for instance combine scientology with something else because they realize that they are as crazy as loon to be attacking it 6211c15 shspec213 clearing technology 261we are pretty well there technologically although things can still be sorted out and neatened up more data keeps appearing of course when you are on top of the mountain you can see alternate routes up just dont forget the way you got there and could get others up one reason you dont like to see long goals lists is that you dont like having to tiger drill every goal it takes an average of minute per goal even when the case is running well if the case is not well prepared the pc will have persistent dirty needle we used to call this the pcs needle pattern it means that ruds are out and it is not ok this dirty needle that you see on goals lists wont clean up with midruds persistent dirty needle and dirty read an instant read that goes bzzzt on the needle are not the same thing if ruds are in and the pc is wellprepared dirty needle means the list is incomplete or you could have listed from the wrong question eg the wrong prehav question actually if you use the right question and the item is on the list even if it is the pcs first list when you null it the dirty needle if any disappears after pc is prepared the only reason thereafter that dirty needle occurs and midruds dont handle it is that the list is not complete the item is the missed withhold that dirties the needle therefore assuming prepared pc there are two variables that cause dirty needle on nulling 1 wrong question 2 list incomplete this makes it little more difficult you may have to use trial and error to discover what it is details on assessing goals there is new experimental process you can assess the long list of goals then only tiger drill the ones that stay in after the single assessment the pc should let the auditor know if pain turns on pain goes deeper than the meter and it may indicate the presence of the item when felt or few items earlier on the list you can get the pc to list goals from terminals and oppterms using the commands what goals would terminal have and if you were oppterm what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve just having the pc write out goals list is very therapeutic even on raw meat reading something once has minimal restimulation beyond three times you have started running process so you can go over goals list once and the only thing hot enough to give the pc somatics will be the goal so watch for the somatic while on that assessment another method of goals finding is known as the prepcheck you will get an early mest clear with enough use of the method described in hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what lot of people sit around not looking they do not look that is their motto problem that has shown up is that after two or three problems intensives the pc keeps saying that such and such is his goal and he wants to know what to do about it in other words you tiger drill the pc until his goal reads the vital part is to assess the right problem if you run the right one smoothly run it dont q and keep ruds in the pc will tend to go mest clear and the goal floats into view it could take four or five problems intensives this would be very simple way to do it it may not work on all oases maybe if we added routine 2 button or two to the problems intensives using roll your own prehav against problems intensive we might find the goal this way the only thing wrong with problems intensive is to find truly selfdetermined change on the queen elizabeth reg thorpe was auditing lrh and lrh only found two real selfdetermined changes this lifetime so we can assume that most pcs are answering fallaciously we should realize that there is trick built into the problems intensive you get the pc to give you change that he believes to have been selfdetermined then you find the prior confusion and the determination for that change so there is probably something wrong with the question there shouldnt be trick to it you should just use change not selfdetermined change we formerly asked for selfdetermined changes so as not to have him give engrams however the prepcheck buttons are powerful enough to run the pc through engrams he wont get stuck in an engram anyway if he doesnt have missed withhold that is what sometimes makes pcs curl up in ball and go into an engram while you are tiger drilling the missed withhold pull the missed withhold and he will come right out of the dramatization the pcs effort to withhold is what pulls him back into the incident because he cant be in pt 262so you could ask for times you decided to change then the pc doesnt have to tell you lie to answer bad assessment can give you ta so in handling problems intensives keep your eye on the ta you should get ta in the first twenty minutes on the first button if not drop the first change and do new assessment 6211c20 shspec215 fundamentals of auditing there are probably thousands of rules you could go by in auditing but the way to audit has only few fundamental basic rules without which auditing does not occur these are the senior data of auditing 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you violate those and you have had it matter how many other rules you are following never neglect those few little fundamentals an auditor can forget about communication and sit there as an individuated island in this case matter what is right about what he does he wont be auditing the pc dont be first dynamic using communication to audit book or nothing if the auditor and the pc are group and if they are in communication and the auditor is auditing the pc in front of him then auditing will occur and results will be obtained one day all of sudden long blue spark hits you and you say to yourself maybe if i ask the pc i can find out and communication starts to occur what st hill graduate misses when he gets back into the field is any feeling that auditing can happen people dont know that there is right way to audit also st hill graduates have gotten over being nervous or selfconscious about auditing if you overlook these few little fundamentals of auditing you then need thousands of rules to handle whatever comes up there is right way to audit described above relatively muzzled auditing uniformity of sessions these are desirable if an auditor is going to add bunch of nonsense into the lineup but muzzled auditing is just curative measure to prevent people who dont know the above basics from adding nonsense that has nothing to do with auditing the other part of the situation is that the human race knows nothing of third dynamic activities or communication what passes for communication in the wog world is unduplicatable there are completed cycles of communication and communication consists exclusively of dispersed mish mash of invalidation and evaluation the rules about q and tr4 and host of others are to keep these aberrated habits out of the session if you didnt have tr4 the green auditor would slip right into thinkthink figurefigure evaluation invalidation etc none of these have anything to do with the communication cycle compute should not be part of the doingness of the auditor cf the old definition of an auditor one who listens and computes in hcob 26may59 man who invented scientology the answer to the pcs origination that black is white is thank you it is not oh it isnt or thats neat thought or whatever every time the pc asks you to do something it is because you have done instead of acknowledged when the pc originated the pc has begun to control you you have driven him out of session and into thoughts about the pt environment by not letting communication cycle occur to the degree that you break down the communication cycle you break down the third dynamic activity you individuate the pc and after that he starts running the session he has gone on selfaudit you will have trouble with the pc in direct ratio to the number of times you have not permitted the pc to originate because the pc is aberrated it is very easy to individuate him it is quite trick to keep the pc from individuating and going on selfaudit as the pc gets better he is less susceptible to individuation his thinkingness should get more under the auditors control as he goes along if the pc gets interrupted by the auditor such that his communication cycle keeps getting messed up his thinkingness will get less and less under auditor control the number of times that you have to get the midruds in is direct index of the amount of thinkingness that pc individuated from the session 263has been engaging in that is how the auditing third dynamic gets broken down into two first dynamics two first dynamics do not make third dynamic they make games condition an auditors perception is not the perception of an individual looking at another individual it is third dynamic perception there is knowingness about whether the pc is in session or not that an auditor will have when he is genuinely perceptive or intuitive an auditors perceptivity is bad to the degree that he departs from the third dynamic back to the first dynamic thetans communicate on the same wavelengths used in space opera you can spot an arc break before the pc knows he has it if you are attuned to this form of communication you used to know and recognize other thetans by their feeling or wavelength and not by their bodies dolls know each other despite not having names as rule it is done by direct perception you can forge passport but try to forge wavelength this is not mest communication and it doesnt require or use mest or even wavelengths as via esp investigators like rhine err by testing esp against mest and by entering proof into the computations proof is one of the most aberrative buttons on the track if you walk through forest with gun concealed in your pocket you will not see bird or squirrel why because you are emanating menace as long as you have the gun and the game gets the communication even if the scientist doesnt the animals dont have to see the gun some thetans evidently emanate more than other thetans this is also true of pcs you apparently get more of relay from some than from others this is fascinating subject as long as you dont pull it down into mest through the button called proof we tried to process people along this line the biggest indication we have that it exists is the effect of auditing on unaudited third parties say pc is having trouble with person b we process he doesnt have any communication with b yet the problem with b evaporates furthermore frequently b often then tries to communicate with this is so true that you could legitimately chew out as auditor for not having solved bs problem with similarly an ri will always produce trouble for you if you are deathly afraid of oil companies rest assured that you will get bum stock short changed etc process the pc and the oil company will stop giving the pc hard time there is then perception factor but when the individual is in games condition on the third or fourth dynamic say with women he cant perceive perception cant bridge across games gap so the auditor makes mess of it every time he audits women ones perception in such case inverts and one reads good wave as bad one or vice versa the auditor cant perceive what is happening so he dubs it in he writes script in session he thinks and figures etc the pc is an enemy and therefore the auditor doesnt dare to confront or read him the more the auditor is in this state the less reliable perception there is and the more substitute perception you will find taking the form of think think substitute perception look dont think direct perception only gets invalidated by those who are to some degree in games condition with what they are trying to audit or perceive they cant confront so they cant perceive so they do think instead of look they figure it all out you have to figure out the way the gpm goes it is complicated and aberration doesnt emanate so you need the meter as an aid but as far as the pc is concerned you should be able to read him pretty directly but if you cant confront him if you dont want to if you dont want anything to do with him you are going to get substitute in there and that substitute is think and youre going to go into consideration of what is going on and you get script writing at its worst the auditor sees an arc break when there isnt one he doesnt see one when it is present etc tension and complicatedness in session divides the auditors attention and cuts down auditor perception thereby impairing his performance if the auditor takes some weird action you know that his perception dropped out the session will be as clumsy as with the sort of limitation of perception that occurs when one gives demonstration session and has ones attention split up lrh has experienced that he flubs in tv demonstrations more often than normally so that gives him some reality on what less perceptive auditor lives with 264when you dont acknowledge the pcs origination he will cut down his transmission power which will make it that much harder for you to perceive him he will also go off on selfaudit so you get two individuals conducting disrelated activity one fellow is busy nulling the list and the other fellow is trying to keep his rudiments in the pc tends to individuate to the degree that you q and with him and prevent him from blowing something by not just letting him get it off and acknowledging lot of auditors think that if the pc mentions something it means that you have to do something about it so that the pc can blow it the fact that you say or do something in response to pcs origination or anybodys origination tells him that he hasnt gotten it off he hasnt blown it it is all communication activity when something is fully communicated and the communication cycle is complete it is blown the degree that pc cant blow things is the degree that he has been q and ad with after you have and ad three or four times in the session what is the use of trying to patch it up now you have to have rules to cure the arc break what the hell were you doing getting an arc break in the first place the rules for getting out of swamps are lrhs and with auditors who got into them through not knowing fundamentals an arc break occurs fifteen to ninety minutes before most auditors perceive it and then they try to clean up the arc break that has just happened which is the wrong one to be cleaning up it is inexcusable for the pc to find out that he has an arc break before the auditor does where is the auditor what is wrong with the auditors perception when the pc mired as he is in the bank can perceive better than the alert auditor the pc never forgives this because it proves to him conclusively that the auditor has individuated and that he is not in third dynamic situation and doesnt have an auditor it is unforgivable because the pc doesnt forgive it if that is what your auditing is like you wont have sessions you will have dogs breakfasts but if you are alert you will find out ages before the pc does that something is wrong dont harass the pc when there is nothing wrong but if your own perception is up and the pc doesnt feel right to you just get in 2wc with him to find out how it is going and persist enough to be sure without badgering him there is nothing wrong with making mistake in session the only thing that is unforgivable is for the pc to catch it before you do perception then comes above technical perfection because you can always handle mistake if you find out about it before the pc does eg the auditor says is something going on there just light 2wc the pc says auditor well did you have thought of some kind there pc i well actually yes you used the wrong command that is ok because you spotted it first before it turned into an arc break that the pc incidently would have attributed to something later in the session if you hadnt spotted it at its inception if the pc could be relied on to spot the correct source of an arc break by himself he wouldnt need an auditor at all because he would just blow his arc breaks by inspection if he has got one he has misassigned it qed the degree of the apparent arc break is related to the number of unobserved arc breaks that have preceded it the first arc break in session is always quite previous to where the pc thinks it is this is true of lists where the pain turns on before the pc notices it the pc is always late because the bank is instantaneous and he isnt he wrongly attributes what is happening to ask him to think anything at all is miraculous if he knew what was going on he wouldnt need an auditor the communication cycle of homo sapiens consists of 1 i originate 2 you invalidate 3 i notis an auditing session is based on far simpler communication cycle than homo sapiens imagines you have to audit the pc in front of you not the meter the final step of matching up the items must be done by the pc not the meter if you go on the basis of if the pc said it it isnt true you are again being homo sap there are some things on which the pc isnt right he is never right on misemotional point but on what the score is and on whether it is the right item yes he can tell you that correctly you could assess list without the meter if you did it very carefully asking the pc where the pain was 265there is substitute for putting the pc in session and auditing him if you get tangled up in all the rules it is just that many rules between you and the pc that are forbidding auditing if those rules are used to prevent third dynamic to interrupt or upset communication cycle or to get out of auditing the pc in front of you then those rules are not for that session there are many styles of auditing but there is substitute for auditing what is auditing to the pc it is alleviation of his upsets and reaching his basic purposes and doing down the gpm he wont let you near his bank and he wont forgive you if you dont run it out nevertheless if he is making gains and getting someplace the pc will take anything off of you on the other hand your auditing could be the last word in technical perfection but if you are not using it to get somewhere with the pc he will be arc broken all the way there is right way to audit it is directly straightforwardly the good auditor uses the tools that he has to get something done the bad auditor doesnt know that there is right way but thinks that there are thousands of right ways and that he has to dream up new one in session that is just another way to figurefigure your way out of giving session the more you add to the basics of auditing the less it will work the auditor who audits smoothly by pattern gets the most done rules are valid but should never interferes with the three basics discussed in this lecture 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you 6211c27 shspec218 routine 212 part 1 poor r212 the first and fundamental error of r212 showed up lrh made mistake by giving some leeway on list one dont add motivatorish items to the list the list must contain only nouns verbs adjectives or adverbs when lrh expanded list one it escaped his notice that lot of practice with 3gaxx would invite lot of things to be entered onto the list by the pc even though r212 says that it is not the pcs list so list one issue two must contain only scientology nouns r212 is to put the case in condition so that it can progress towards clearing as well as being in itself clearing process what we are fighting in clearing today is slow progress with r321 you will sooner or later get the item that is holding up the case see p 332 above but with r212 you will get it sooner you are looking for the items that pin the pc to present time you want to eradicate the items that have been keyed in by present time which now hold the pc in ptp in r212 you dont just oppose any item that once rockslammed you always start from scratch matter what has been done previously you take list one even if it was done before start with the first list find what rockslams oppose it etc the main discovery is that any time you get whisper on list you can represent it and get rock slam on it the rationale of r212 is that as long as the gpm is keyed in in pt the pc is left with full ptp and will show case gain you dont have to find his goal to set him straight this is all based on the observation made in 1949 that what needs to be run to resolve the case always has little tag sticking out like taximeter flag there are lots of these little tags sticking out but most come out easily and can be thrown away however every once in awhile you get one that is tied to something it was also known that case gain wont occur over ptp the gpm would be the biggest ptp person could have the only way you get rid of it is to identify it very thoroughly in its various parts this is what the tag gets stuck in if part of the gpm is in pt walking around and the other part is buried in the bank the pc will go around feeling that it is the visible part that is keeping him from getting clear he never looks to see what is opposing it and that item will remain so undisclosed that the person could go all the way to clear and still have it he might by fluke key out the rest of the gpm and still have that buried part of the gpm pair this gives you bypassed item par excellence the probability that he would go clear under these circumstances is very miniscule to be sure it takes awhile to build up rock slam it is not from pt directly that the pc gets the rock slam it is from confusing pt with some opposition mass in the bank the pc hasnt even seen the terminal in the bank that faces the opposition mass he has made mistake he has mistaken something in the environment for an opposition mass in the bank and he cant see his terminal in the bank he thinks 266he is opposed to something in pt when it is just an oppterm that he has confused it with he is in this oppterm but he never puts it on the list so it never blows and he doesnt opposition it you will get recurring item as the pc lists it recurs because something is missing namely the other half of the package the half that he is being person doesnt look at things that he is stuck in that is how the bank accumulates the person is too close to it to look at it the recurring item lacking an oppterm to balance it creates ptp in itself with this condition the pc will make little or case gain if the pc werent pinned to pt he would still have this trouble it is part of every case to some degree let us define rockslammer as anyone who slams in pt on any item that is part of the gpm at first neither we nor he can determine which item he is slamming on one fine day you make list on something and it doesnt immediately go out on tiger drilling the tiger drill is what saves our bacon it tells us whether the worm is still in the ground in r212 you pick up the trace list it out and get slamming item if the item was accurately assessed and if it doesnt go out with the tiger drill then it must be stuck in the gpm therefore you can represent it and you will get slam so one fine day he accidentally puts an item on his present time environment list now he is longer able to not confront it when you oppose it he now doesnt feel bad about it you have discharged the mass here is another place where r212 differs from 3gaxx r212 deals with the tags the locks to pt and blows them on r212 the items blow up and go pffft on 3gaxx items stay in there in concrete and brass because you are diving into the bank to find the fundamental goal you are reaching for deeper items 3gaxx delivers goals but not pt when you have an item that is in pt you will get more fireworks the amount of case gain that you will get from r212 is sometimes fantastic all the pcs lifelong worry has evaporated watch out for doing misassessment on list 1a and getting deeper than you intended this is not likely to happen on list one where he doesnt make the list if the question was in pt what have you been upset about and he gives you something like dragons or spaceships just pretend to write it down dont put it on the list you will get terminal and an oppterm from such an item but they wont do the pc much good in pt you could use them to get goals but that doesnt get rid of ptps you could get big read on an item like this bigger than you would normally get on list one or list 1a if you take up dragons you are not handling any pt restimulation you will be led astray if you dont keep in mind that r212 is an effort to locate one of the gpm items as it seems to be in pt to the pc and find its oppterm and if you succeed youve taken away the ptp the ptp is below the pcs recognition of what it is that he is worried about which is why you wouldnt get the ptp by running ptps there is heavy charge on this anything with rock slam has heavy standoffishness connected with it rock slam item is like guy at night shining flashlight in your eyes you cant see who it is and you dont want to look at it but you have to the pc cant look at rock slam item and he cant look away from it unless you get it out of pt he doesnt have enough attention units to look at the bank if he can be sufficiently aware of the piece of the gpm that is in pt to be nervous about it he can cognite on it other things equally part of gpms are so buried that he cant even slam on them they are too tough for him they wont read or be real to him until later when the case is unburdened more person whos getting off motivators is being an oppterm to himself hes out of valence hes not even in his own terminal line he will therefore turn on sensation all over the place the terminal is always at cause if you try to list something causative for the oppterm eg who or what would the oppterm oppose or who or what would the oppterm do something to instead of ho or what would oppose the oppterm you will get total stuck needle misemotion etc this is the wrong way to phenomenon if you get rid of problem on which the pc has great reality the pc will have tremendous resurgence when you do skilled r212 that is the result that you will get even though the pc doesnt even know that he has the problem in order to handle the problems in his environment he must not have problem on scientology the session is closer to the pc than the rest of his environment therefore in doing r212 you take his scientology problems away before you take the other environment problems away get them out of the way and watch the pcs relief if you arent seeing it you are doing something wrong 2676211c27 shspec219 routine 212 part ii lrh has been auditing r212 for about eighteen months now and he has made all the mistakes the procedure as now released is the nomistake way to do it as an invariable action even when it is done perfectly it will occasionally lay an egg why because you might pick up an item on the first assessment that isnt part of gpm and the cleanup that it gets on tiger drilling may not clean it up entirely in that case you are currying dead horse ie you are not going anywhere the source of the dead horse is some withholds or something on the item when it is not part of the gpm what is dead horse it is list whether represent or an oppose list that contains wide slams after you have gotten midruds in for the session if you have gotten nothing but dirty reads and dirty needles and nothing has slammed by the time you get up to fifty items you will lay an egg the best thing to do is to carry it to fifty items and if there is slam abandon it the likeliest way to get dead horse list is wrong assessment the auditor doesnt check if he is in doubt about read he missed reads arc breaks the pc etc you can also have an item reading on an arc break because the pc doesnt understand the word the emeter is reality indicator another way to get misassessment is for the auditor to misduplicate what the pc said on listing and to write down something else then when the auditor assesses it the pc will protest it since it is not what he intended if you dont understand what the pc said you have to get it understood even if he arc breaks every time you ask him the way you ask pc to repeat something is to take responsibility for not understanding in way that doesnt challenge the pc you can ask him to spell it thats fine unless he cant spell do not repeat the item after the pc it will drive him around the bend it can make him feel like he is spinning and it tends to shut him up dont ask did you say _______ that causes him to protest and can leave mark on the list it also looks like you are correcting him also never point to an item on list dont ever point towards pc anyway cf not pushing in anchor points the thetan will put his theta beams against that finger and his theta beams will get bent this includes pointing to list items it makes wrong items stay in pc must be able to put anything on list but he must never be allowed to take anything off if he wants word changed take it down and add it as new separate item eg the pc says oh that should be cow and not the cow acknowledge and add cow to the list at the bottom of the list and leave the cow on the list if you null list that has given you persistent dirty needle and then oppose that you wont wind up with much the invariable actions of r212 eliminate that pretty well if you are listing on list and nothing is slamming get your midruds in but dont get them in when the pc originates if the auditor isnt sure whether or not he is doing it right and has guilty conscience about it that auditor is very vulnerable because he thinks he might be committing overts therefore he tends to withdraw from his pcs even an auditor who is doing letterperfect auditing can be shaken up by pc who snarls about midruds being put in treat this as an origin when the pc is protesty keep him talking dont punish him with the missed withhold question but get it handled sneakily by finding what you havent found out about his state of mind or something then go ahead and get the midruds in that is the way to handle this situation not with q and the next big source of dead horses is an incomplete list if the pc says that last item he gave you is it that is sure sign that the list is incomplete and that there is slamming item coming up dont quit listing when the pc tells you that the last item he gave you was it what he means is that is the last safe item the list is incomplete and the rock slam is just over the horizon and the pc has chickened out dont ever quit until the list is complete the pc will never forgive you for not getting the item however much he protests further listing so get the list done that is the only road out unless the pc has legitimate beef for instance if the pc insists that an item is reading on protest check protest clean it up and recheck it dont take items from what the pc is giving you as protest or 2wc that is robbing the pc in the process of listing list you are liable to run into dwindling or sporadic rock slam if you dont get an item that slams while listing you dont have list the classic dwindling rock slam is common dont stop listing just because the rock slam stops you can get midruds in and ask the question you are listing from to see if it reads that is not certain but it is good indicator the proof that list is incomplete is that when you are nulling and the needle is dirty when you ask did you think of something the pc gives you something that doesnt clean up the needle if you find 268yourself having to keep using this question to clean the needle it is an indicator that the list is incomplete it also invites more items the pcs arc breaks about not completing the list do not stem from the auditor or auditing flubs they come entirely from the pcs unwillingness to confront when list is complete the pc will be willing to go on listing forever he only balks when the list is incomplete so any balk by pc is an indication of an incomplete list so you keep going on list until you dont have to get midruds in to null it on assessing list two consecutive items in almost always means that the midruds have gone out the list will be more than ten to twenty items long but some pcs go for long lists 500 items or so 80150 items is more usual anything that restrains pc or keeps him from giving complete list will wreck r212 as well as 3gaxx the more you harass or worry pc the less you will get done dont ever yap at pc about his dirty needle it does good never stop pc from listing you can get as many as three dwindling rock slams from one item there is an accidental on list one since you didnt just do list midruds arent in so get them in before you assess list one one reason not to let the pc add items to list one is that once you start the pc is listing and you will have to let him list it out or you will have dirty needle so just dont start in r212 what you are trying to do is to find tag first in scientology then in the present time environment off of gpm that is hooked into pt by the nature of the bank you are doing this because if it is there the pc has chronic ptp recognize that the other side of the package the side that opposes the pt item is keyed in all the time recognize also that it is lie to say that it is in pt it is only keyed in to pt the moment you start your represent list the pc will fly out of pt thats fine on represent what else is there to list on the represent list very likely the pc will go back track recall 1 identities 2 similarities 3 differences the pc has the gpm mass identified with pt item the ptp is in pt because of aaa the gpm item is identified with the item in pt minds being what they are when you represent anything you are peeling identifications off of it this is not true of opposing listing is auditing by taking anything someone is worried about and by representing items the pc will see similarities instead of identities get the represent off first that helps him differentiate you could do this as an assist not even on the meter using eg what does bellyache represent to you also many pt items dont have opposites you need the represent step for them also in fact any time you say who or what would _______ you are really doing represent list so it is therapeutic because it separates out items it separates what is true from what is false the more identified person is with something the more items will come off of that thing as you list or null you are auditing like crazy this is solid auditing and about the soundest and most condensed auditing you can do it produces the most gain per auditing hour so long lists are lots of auditing every time you null you are differentiating done right getting items it is fantastic 6211c29 shspec220 r212 theory and practice part i there are many indicators and few stabilities about lists there is only one absolute rule about lists that we have as stable datum list must be nullable there is difference between an indication and rule the following gives some indications first of all where there is rock slam on the list you have dead horse list dead horses consume most of the auditors time in r212 so this is of interest but if after fifty items with rock slam if the pc is still interested go on to seventy or eighty if there are rock slams by then unload list with slam wont produce an item on the other hand rock slam on list doesnt guarantee that you will find an item 269a nullable list is list that you can go down without getting midruds in every eight to ten items to clean up dirty needle if you find that you have to put in midruds this often that is an indicator that you may be on dead horse the study of what makes nonnullable list is point of orientation from which to study assessment there are three sources of nonnullable list the first is wrong source the thing from which the list is being listed is improper there is way to establish this on an early list one assessment the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it it can also be wrong source because you are opposing the wrong item maybe it rockslammed and turned on sensation you list from it then when you null the needle gets dirty even after you have extended the list it could have looked perfect when you listed it and still not be nullable what happened was that the items rock slam wasnt solid it was lock on the gpm rock slam needs something to lean on for you to wind up with something by using it when you have reliable item wall to discharge against you will find the opposed item if you have clean needle on an item that is not reliable item if you oppose it the list is never going to end you are cutting out paper dolls from the gpm you are just picking off locks from the gpm if sensation turned on however be sure to continue to list until the somatic turns off even if the list goes nowhere you can settle for light case of sensation get off the horse and find another item from your list one dead horse lists do produce some gain pcs can cognite etc dont stay with it forever unload when the pc feels pretty good if the pc has interest gets cognitions and has rock slams this guarantees that the list is dead horse however the presence of these indicators doesnt guarantee nullable list another way to foul up and get nonnullable list is to audit the case in the presence of tremendous missed withholds thats rare getting ruds in should be enough to handle this situation actually it is really the missing item that gives the pc feeling of having missed withhold the third source of trouble is the incomplete list an incomplete list may look like nonnullable list if you find this to be the case unload it is rule that list must be nullable so at the point where you find that list is nonnullable go back to list one nullable list is one where items go out easily and the needle stays pretty clean and cleans up easily if it gets dirty during nulling it is good idea to check suppress about once page as you null because suppressed list acts like complete list you dont have to go over what you have nulled if suppress reads just clean up the suppress button get used to how many items need to be listed before you get rock slams this depends on how identified the case is the more jammed up and messed up the pc is the longer the list will go the odd case that is very heavily identified may go 150 items before rockslamming another lighter case may go fifteen or twenty items the ta doesnt necessarily indicate the degree of identification mass doesnt necessarily equal identification and some items are massier than others what if the pc has an item solid steel the dead thetan case will require lot of listing he will need represent lists by the carload getting rock slams the pc will feel better and eventually the list one will get hotter and hotter the mechanics of it are that essentially we have new therapy listing is auditing lrh knew that listing on goal was auditing now it is clear that listing in general is auditing listing an opposition list to anything that continues to rockslam ie reliable item is auditing the more magnitudinous the read the more reality the pc has on the thing anything that reads is safe to list you could develop process for say sick pc you could find out what is bothering him he says my liver you check it for read if it reads you do represent list with what would represent liver to you pretty soon he has more liver trouble you could even assess it by interest without meter the thing that combines interest and reality is the rock slam it is also ridge wherein everything is identified the dynamics are collapsed eg the food faddist when you hit the button you get an automatic release it is not that the pc is thinking so to summarize what makes nonnullable list 1 wrong source faulty assessment eg of list one 270b the thing from which the list is being listed is improper this may not be auditor error on early list one assessments thereis way to be sure that you have the right thing to oppose or represent the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it c using nonri to oppose it could look perfect when you list it and still not be nullable 2 auditing the case in the presence of many missed withholds this is rare 3 list is incomplete an indicator for nullable list is that it comes out with interest and positiveness so the rule is that list must not be continued that is being invalidated by the pc that is overlisting another indicator of overlist is comm lag or groping for items that is danger sign dont worry about these phenomena in r212 but do pay attention to these last two when listing goals invalidation is not ok in any case inval is preceded by comm lag and then the pc groping for the right way to word it all will produce nonnullable list from that point on so the signs of overlisting in order of appearance are 1 comm lag 2 groping for items 3 pc invalidation of the list the invalidation can be fairly faint just questioning doubt hesitancy about the items the list might have been nullable earlier you can try to null the earlier part list is not nullable if 1 it does not produce rock slam and 2 if it is being delivered by the pc with great uncertainty however the most uncertain person in the world listing from proper source will be the most certain person you ever saw good indicators in listing are 1 interest 2 certainty 3 rock slams bad indicators are 1 rock slams 2 uncertainty we arent too concerned in r212 with whether we get an item or not many cases are below rockslamming so you just keep assessing you keep listing the pcs outofsession appearance is concern of yours as long as he stays interested while he is in session he may well get fancy somatics if you quit in the middle of an opposition list just complete each cycle to the best of your ability some pcs will run fifteen lists off of list one with rock slam then get one on the list itself which continues to rockslam make sure the pc isnt thinking of items and then suppressing them all the items he thinks of should go on the list r212 is itself therapeutic activity if we also get reliable item slamming persistently and get the opposition list listed to an ri the pc will feel marvellous how often this happens is monitored by the accuracy of the auditor an auditor who is doing it all right should expect to be dead on the beam about fifty percent of the time this is due to the aaa factor if you are batting fifty percent ie half of the represent lists you do wind up with an rl and half of the opposition lists get an ri you are good poor auditor may get an ri ten percent of the time and someone will have to straighten out the case sometime but the case will feel better and make gains fifty percent of the time there isnt reliable item there to get so when listing you are only being therapeutic the pc will feel almost as good even if there isnt an ri from the gpm on his r212 list 2716211c29 shspec221 r212 theory and practice part ii r212 bridges over easily into 3gaxx step four of r321 but the purpose of r212 is to cure the great big ptps that are impinged on the gpm the pcs bugbear that which he must destroy is half of dumbbell package of the gpm the pc looks only at one side of the package he never says who am i everyone accepts this because the pcs objection to the other side looks reasonable the green auditor in particular is likely to think of course and pay further attention to it because it doesnt seem aberrative this is clearest when rockslammers cant find rock slams on other rockslammers this reasonableness is your most fruitful source of error this is sort of mutual outrud tacit consent the mechanics of the situation is that whenever person has his attention fixated on some pt thing that thing represents piece of one side of the gpm its opposing piece or side lies hidden rockslammer is dramatizing the other half of the dumbbell the first half is being represented in pt by scientology the pcs wife the boss etc the pc never asks himself what would oppose _______ because he opposes it and he has keyed in some unconfrontable terminal but the pc is being audited over considerable ptp his fixation prevents him from going back track he is dramatizing the other terminal the thing he is fixated on in pt is not part of the bank it is substitute for lock on the gpm item that keeps the gpm item in continuous restimulation therefore because one side is restimulated hidden and out of sight we have the pcs terminal the pc never recognizes this but he does dramatize this the rock slam on an item means overts against withholds from fixation on reality on and games condition with the item so we find that the pc gets sensation when we call the item we list who or what would oppose _______ and we get rockslamming terminal if the original thing didnt rockslam we do represent list to get something that steadily rockslams either way we get package that will discharge you can do other things with the package you could represent each sending the pc deeper into the bank or you could get goals with the items you find why is it called gpm it is mass which is composed of identities which oppose identities and they are so delicately faced against each other on the track that they dont slip neither has ever overwhelmed the other they finally make up big black mass the identities in the gpm are round black ridges they are black they are round they do have mass they do oppose each other this is not allegorical the anatomy of problem is item vs item postulate vs postulate it is game where you have two sides equally opposed problem doesnt become problem until one is unable to overwhelm and wont be overwhelmed it is matter of balance dont underestimate the age of pair of items in the gpm the whole thing is built basically on the alterisness of goals it has gone on for trillions of years you may say why not resolve it all by just finding the pcs goal because it doesnt immediately resolve the pt items thats why so you are trying to audit someone with screaming ptp the bypassed items are primed into pt and are beyond the pcs reach or confront so the pc doesnt list to free needle after you get the goal the opposed items could have been there for trillions of years the game before that likewise etc it takes long time to get in that condition the pc has lived many lives corresponding to each pair to the main pair are accumulated thousands of lesser ones also opposed in groups of two the gpm would be easy to plot if all the pairs were neatly aligned in the bank on neat time track but the pc is case of scrunch the reactive mind has time this is also one of the highest characteristics of thetan thetan has time the bank is the lowerscale mockery of this to the pc the whole of the gpm is now so when you null things react in this instant hence instant reads the analytical mind would require time so analytical reads are latent the most aberrative thing is time to the bank hundred million years ago is now so if time is all the same what differentiation can we use to work on in theory whenever you say boo to the pc the whole reactive mind reacts but this is an unattainable absolute nonsensical statement in actual fact the situation as we look at the meter is only saved by the reality of the pc the meter reads on what the pc has reality on not what the pc is momentarily in 272there is free track alongside the gpm and the pc can move along it dianetics is the study of that free track free track is timed the reality of the pc is governed by the pcs tolerance of force thing reads because it most closely approximates pcs limit of reality on force you can always run against the ceiling of that limit that ceiling is marked by the rock slam that is how much force the pc can confront person is as sane as he can tolerate force not use force necessarily tolerate it if you run around banning bombs you wont get much support because the bulk of the population dont believe in them there is too much force to confront in one of them so people dont confront them and they are not real if the populace could tolerate force they would long since have torn the governments of the us and russia to shreds wars occur because people cant tolerate force so they have reality on what they are doing they dont know how much force they are going to turn loose it is an irresponsible action the amount of force person will throw out is measure of sanity but how much he can confront is as the person comes down the track through the gpm he has become less and less capable of tolerating force so the pt terminals and oppterms usually seem quite insurmountable to the pc until they are audited on r212 all pcs suffer from some reaction like this they think that there is more to it than there is that is one of the guiding idiocies of thetan for instance pc will think that he has some huge dramatic withhold to account for the fact that his ruds keep being out then he finally spots the withhold that he thought the instructors tie was crooked drama ie dramatic heavy events in pt seldom has anything to do with the degree on enturbulation of the pc he is trying to match the significance in pt of the drama that does exist in the gpm auditors do this sometimes they hound the pc because he has dirty needle pcs have been good for hundreds of years underlying it will be the reverse but it takes some time for the pc to confront this fact you do find dramatic stuff in the gpm magnitudinous overts etc but you dont pull them out bit by bit they come out as packages pcs try to match up with the gpm it restimulates them to believe that they must be guilty of something but they cant put their finger on it it is in the gpm if you know this you will realize that some of the tech for freeing people on this planet is utterly outrageous what we are doing is quite fantastic pcs can get quite upset doing this ie being audited so it requires an auditor who can go steadily on to complete the job there is room for an auditor who quits because the pc twitters or gets somatic he has to complete the cycle of action that is in progress we could clear somebody albeit slowly by continuing to find and oppose ris more importantly as you go down the rock slam channel the pc will eventually find his goal but goal is senior to items it is easier to find the goal first and then from it to find the ris you would now be doing r321 so r212 cuts into r321 at place determined by the extent to which r212 is run you could go into 3gaxx using the prehav scale to get more items if you did r212 and had the case flying you might find the pc coming up with his goal after six packages had been found if you have pc who is very stacked up and identified it may take good deal longer you could just keep finding items until the pc goes clear doing nothing with his goal of course if you ignore it and dont acknowledge it he is thrown into protesting the goal and he wont go clear when the pc may have had wrong goal found andor run you must get rid of the wrong goal as senior action to r212 since that is now his ptp you run wrong goal with big tiger see p 295a above if it has just been found you prepcheck it if it has been listed when you have pc who has had bad auditing and has been all fouled up ever since that session do r212 it will handle it an item was loused up not the pc items are senior to any other auditing except goals r212 is also usable as an assist if the pc is bothered by something you could ask what illness of yours have you been interested in the pc answers my lumbosis you ask all right who or what does your lumbosis represent to you that would use the principle of r212 the question could be unmetered and unnulled if the pc is interested in it it is identified like mad he must have an aaa about it if the pc has psychosomatic illness he must have the past in pt therefore there is instantaneousness connected with it therefore it has some connection with the gpm if the pc has an engram chronically is restimulation one tag end of it must be headed into the gpm otherwise it would destimulate in three to ten days after going into restimulation to do an assist on chronic somatics ie timeless somatics that didnt disappear in three to ten days the first thing you have to know is that they are hooked up to the gpm the gpm or any part of it can never be educated out of anybody that is the source of repetitive criminality nothing will cure it short of 273getting rid of the gpm the criminal has been criminal longer than one life hes straight in the middle of an identity of the gpm he knows what stores are for to put in trucks at night he cant be handled by dogooders some processes can key out the valence remarkably enough that we can have mest clears is fantastic luck matter energy and space are also in the gpm probably the gpm has mass simply because time is nothing but the energy space and matter isnt nothing yet this makes an interesting mathematical proposition if time were actually zero there would be matter or energy and possibly space so there is only an apparency of time in the aaa nature of the bank and although there is an apparency of matter there is mass there is an apparency of energy and space but in actuality there is energy and space so matter energy space and time are in the gpm whenever you restore any differentiation even from identity to slight similarity you get more matter energy and space because you get more time things cease to read instantly and you start to get prior and latent reads the case that has been dubin case may get very upset to find himself going black as you get more differentiation you get more mass smooth auditing is essential in handling the gpm otherwise the pcs ability to confront the increasing matter energy space and time in his bank is repressed so he would tend to hang fire auditing could take the place of the ptp some cases see that they are being asked to confront more than they care to they will turn off the reality that has been turning on and momentarily get worse the more the pc lists the more matter energy space and time is materializing probably the only thing that permits the process to work is that there is more time time permits escape from the pressure of the increased mass etc as past time becomes differentiated from pt so the pc is not so stuck in the mass energy and space 6212c11 shspec222 r212 data much of the data in this lecture is given in hcob 15dec62 urgent r212 the fatal error and hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance dont overuse 2wc eg did you just think of something in midsession have you thought of anything tends to put responsibility on the pc this tells him to selfaudit if the pc says that he has forgotten something dont say what was it give the missed withhold question cleaning needle is just fundamental auditing you could do it thoroughly with an eighteen button prepcheck in auditing or even just suppress and invalidate as prepcheck assist you could assess the eighteen buttons and run what reads best that would clean up needle very high ta will also be brought down with this basic stuff dont spend lot of time fixing up the case before you audit it you can also clean up needle with r212 if case doesnt move on r212 assume that he is rockslammer and take the largest read on list one and oppose it or just do an oppose list on scientology cf the green form handling what are you trying to prevent there is disgrace in being rockslammer some people have lied about whether it was pain or sensation so as not to seem declasse so lrh checks untruth because if you write backwards list it is useless as well as hard on the pc there are two ways to approach the persistent dirty needle if you dont have someone to do r212 pull missed withholds etc do prepcheck of sorts to clean the needle and teach the auditor to get missed withholds if these attempts to clean the needle go on too long there is point where the pcs anxiety about auditing dirties the needle so dont overrun this repair action noauditing can be counted on to dirty needle the pc can also get anxious if nothing is reading on nulling he can be afraid that you are going to go into midruds and get dirty needle from that the first symptom of session blowing up is the pc getting little bit critical of the auditor this is the only thing lrh stops at when putting in midruds it is always the sign of an ow underlying it to neglect it lets it multiply into screaming arc break later so pick up critical with missed withhold at once this is fundamental any indication of missed withholds makes lrh go after them you dont use missed withhold to punish the pc but to prevent the pc from blowing up 274in r212 one mistake you can make is not to know what rock slam looks like and therefore to neglect rockslamming item the auditor knows that it reacted so he represents it this isnt invariably disastrous the command value of rockslamming item is terrific but the pcs attention is not on the slamming item it is on what opposes it in the gpm so when you do represent list it takes the pcs attention off the item that claims it and it drives the pc around the bend if you really get mad at someone when he is rockslamming on something represent it instead of opposing it he will practically go out the bottom another goof would be to null the opposition list just to the point where all the reads are gone without finding the item then quit just short of getting the package this leaves hidden pair in pt the pc will feel better but there is still something there nulling the represent or oppose list makes it easier for the pc to extend it you can get to point where list can be nulled even though it is incomplete just continue the list and you will see another rock slam turn on and the rock slam on the original item you were opposing will come back another error that people are making is abandoning lists that had rock slams on them they can get into this mistake by representing instead of opposing rockslamming item the list will go nowhere because there is nowhere to go except to the original item sometimes an item which didnt rockslam at first will unburden enough when you start to represent it to start rockslamming so check for this when the represent list gives dirty needle and item the less attention one has in pt the more one is likely to go down the tone scale as the pc takes his attention off past incidents to handle pt these past incidents collapse in on him and he dramatizes this is applicable to the fact that we have found the worst attention trap there is ris represented in pt the rock slam is caused by the fury and franticness of the pcs attention and opposed attentions never fail to pair an item once found if you only find one item of rockslamming pair especially if you do this several times after awhile you will get rock slams that amount of attention is absorbed in the bank and all you will get will be dead horses thenceforth this isnt terribly serious since we can take the folder and go back to find the incomplete packages if you dont do this the packages can add up to point where the pc wont go clear an auditor who repairs situation like this gets all the residual gain the pc will already have gotten gains he will have felt much better even before the repair it is not dangerous to put r212 in clumsy hands as long as good records are kept and common ordinary good auditing gets done doing r212 right is last in order of importance if you simplify this down to the bare minimum omit midruds and anything at all complicated you have r210 to be run on heavily supervised coaudit basis the only place you will have trouble is deciding whether to represent or oppose an item that rockslams cyclically so you dont know if it is an ri learn what one of these cyclic dirty needle opposition lists looks like then you will know what you are listing 6212c11 shspec223 phantom rock slam the phantom rock slam is special manifestation of r212 this is not rare manifestation and it causes trouble there is rule about this you mustnt grab rock slams from ruds get them from r212 or case records eg old sec checks list ones the phantom slam will attach itself to various terminals and anything and everything in rudiments you can wind up with this peculiar phenomenon opposing something that isnt rockslamming item when this happens in r212 you may get rock slam in the oppose list but it will be cyclic proposition the rock slam becomes dirty needle becomes clean needle every two or three pages this cycle never ends the list is unnullable this phenomenon is peculiar to the opposition list you could make this happen by taking list of unreading items and insisting that the pc oppose one of them the pc will go ahead and do it but the list is unnullable in r212 it is an enemy that is helping the pc ie scientology an auditor etc anything from list one that the pc rock slams on therefore the pc cant accept the help the enemy is right here and now in this session list one is also right here and now it is what is being used on the pc auditors emeters sessions etc if list one isnt used these things are never located the most crude manifestation of failure to locate rockslamming items to oppose is the phantom slam which comes and goes you will only get dead horses doing lists from other sources if the pc is on record as 275having slammed on list one but you cant turn on the rock slam now tiger drill three or four main points of the list until one ticks then go ahead and oppose it it will turn on continuing rock slam and get you reliable item the case that slams on this and that is the puzzler it confuses the auditor you eventually realize that the rock slam has nothing to do with what you are listing or nulling it turns on incidentally it will turn on more powerfully on heavily charged list that has some rock slams on it anyhow the phantom rock slam is generated by some tiny withhold and not by some item on the list the test of the phantom rock slam is do you get one rock slam in nulling that stays in or does the pc rockslam on ruds or midruds especially since big midruds the latter is more powerful rudiments action than is in regular model session if you see rock slam turn on during ruds action with timelimiter like since your last session you have phantom rock slam sometimes the pc graduates upstairs to having phantom rock slam as his case unburdens the rock slam can be absent at first then it develops first into tame rock slam then gets frantic then cools off again as the case unburdens then when you hit the item it is there again in force and blows the rock slam tends to stay the same size but it changes speed phantom rock slam is any slam that turns on in ruds or general ow it is caused by any withhold the pc has from you or the remainder of the dynamics every now and then you will be fixing up someones line plot done in coaudit or something and out of twentyfour packages only one will rock slam you may think well the charge is blown it was phantom slam all the way fortunately there is solution phantom rock slam is turned on by something in the immediate instant pt of the session it is turned on by something immediately in or in the vicinity of the session something right here it is not fight with the d of p because he is down the hall the way you smoke one out is to get every possible element of which the session consists with the pcs help you make special list which must include every part of the pc his name myself badges symbols tables etc cf the expanded dianetics present time environment list with this list you will get the ptp that is right present in the session the phantom slam will show up on the list the pc wont help much because since he slams on the item he cant see it he has overts on what it will be so he cant perceive it so you may have to suggest some items the majority of items will probably be first dynamic items the item could be but it could translate as my mind or some such thing but as you continued to get more and more packages the item would gradually change in character eg to include more dynamics the rock slam gets gradiently more sudden and more constant finally the pc could just blurt out the item the only test of whether you have found the source of the rock slam is that the rock slam doesnt recur so you cant tell for several sessions whether you have got it so the phantom rock slam item is an even more immediate version of the list one items it is something so much in pt and so disturbing to the pc that it is total ptp very screaming one because it is so close to the session this ptp blocks him from getting gains it was in 1956 or so when lrh isolated the ptp as that which prevents case gain the gpm was discovered via the ptp the closer to auditing and pt the ptp is the less gains are obtained from auditing that is why list one is cure note that we include other dynamics besides the first dynamic in list one there are other dynamics in pt you can point at the pc and say or point at yourself and say we to get the point across ordinarily careful attention to list one will get the phantom slam and clean it up so the proper procedure is 1 complete running list one 2 make session list one if you run into phantom rock slam after completing list one and cleared up all the slams on it what you should do is to go over with the pc all the parts of the session so you can locate the insession rockslamming item keep your eye on the meter so that you can steer him and pick up something he thinks of that turns on slam 3 just go on finding reliable items do this to the best of your ability dont buy anything that doesnt stay in pretty well and make lists long enough to be complete get your packages difficult though this may be you will see the slam turn on more frequently and get progressively less frantic until one day the pc volunteers the item which slams beautifully and can be opposed 2764 pick up all past incomplete or dead horse lists go back to all those lists that appeared to give lots of bonus packages and ris now you will be able to find some ris r212 should have positive result everything shouldnt just go up in smoke here is another point you can represent massless things ideas conditions etc and you will get nice massy rockslamming items but if you oppose significances you can get in trouble if significance rockslams you do oppose it but you are actually opposing nothing an idea so get the item the identity that opposes the significance eg mouse could oppose attack then oppose the item you got eg mouse right back to get second solid item eg cat with which to make up package otherwise you dont have two terminals this is the original 3dxx list long enough on the oppose list to the significance to get the item you can have package consisting of significance opposing significance but it is not much of gpm package significances easily go blank so the rock slam can wash out doing the oppose list the rock slam isnt really gone it is just submerged complete the list with mass when you have the item opposing the significance see if it has pain or sensation connected with it so you know which way to oppose it then oppose it and get the other mass rule if the list is nullable and rockslamming you can find juicy item on it list can be nullable and still incomplete dont use invalidated items for anything if the pc is invalidating the items that he is giving you yes thats valid test but dont use the invalidate button for other purposes than to clean off real inval dont use it to keep from having to complete the list pcs may try to get out of completing lists by invalidating items just go on and get the item after you have finished nulling the list or checking midruds sometimes pc cant give you more items until you have finished nulling the list the basics of auditing cover most of the difficulty person will have the danger of r212 is that the auditor can get result that he and the pc are happy with without doing it right and getting all the available gain the residual gain is 1000 worth 6212c13 shspec224 r212 data needle behavior clean needle is free flowing needle slow pleasant rise or fall which does nothing when the auditor is doing nothing it has trace of irregular or reacting motion on the meter clean needle is like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue flawless midruds will give you one it flows at uniform rate of speed the pc may have an intransigent dirty needle but after you find the first ri you will get clean needle the only problem with this is that you have to assess over filthy needle dead horse list does minimal amount to clean the needle cleaning needle is not the same thing as cleaning read off the needle you will see clean needle when you have finished list before you have done anything else it will be slowly flowingly rising or more rarely falling this is particularly visible on mark v emeter that is what you should have before you start nulling so as to be sure that you can null if you put big midruds in faultlessly without missing read or cleaning clean clean needle is what you will see r212 is such good process that it shows up any flaws in the auditors trs model session or metering you cannot use pc upsets as an excuse there is only one point in running r212 where things look awry about half or third of the way through list when the list is getting hot and the pc doesnt want to confront the next string of rock slams or when the auditor tries to null an incomplete list and finds the needle frequently getting rough in these situations the pc will undoubtedly get somatics misemotion etc that is usual the final check for completeness of list consists of asking 1 is the list complete 2 are there any more items 3 have you thought of anything else that should have gone on the list 4 could there possibly be anything else on the list 277if you get any reads on these questions the list is incomplete the reverse of clean needle more or less is needle pattern chronic needle behavior that pc exhibits while the auditor is saying and doing nothing needle with reaction on it is dirty needle it doesnt look like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue any ticks any roughness any slight speedups as it goes dirty needle is any needle that departs from the appearance of clean needle it has nothing to do with the auditor he is doing nothing if in midsession with an auditing cycle complete it is doing anything that has any irregularity if it of any kind whatsoever that is dirty needle and your midruds are out watch the needle for count of five doing nothing and that whatever you see is the state of the needle it is not how sticky or unsticky the needle is it is whether the needle is ticking at all or halting at all seeing this the auditor is expected to get midruds in not to do so is goof raw meat pc or pc who has had previous bad auditing and has filthy needle presents problem on such needle you cant expect much until you get your first ri that is the easiest way to clean the needle except that you have to assess accurately through dirty needle that is your most critical time in auditing it lasts only as long as it takes you to get an accurate first assessment it should take you only the first hour of auditing assuming that you dont get lot of dead horses if you get hot item just listing it will clean the needle you dont even have to null to clean it after you have the first ri you should be able to get midruds in pretty fast the pc will probably rockslam on list one anyway needle characteristics tend to become misinterpreted for instance people have failed to recognize rock slams rock slam is simply slashing agitation of the needle dirty read is buzzing agitation of the needle rock slam always has slash in it rocket read takes off it always goes to the right it takes off with very fast spurt and does very rapid decay like bullet fired into water its very fast it goes pshoo it looks like its got all of its motive power from its first instant of impulse with additional motive power being imparted to it by anything its kicked off and it has further kick so it just rapidly dies out how wide is it thats silly question ive seen them from sixtyfourth of an inch to dial wide you see they are any width rock slam can have its first slash mistaken for rocket read if the auditor has never seen rocket read but the rock slam doesnt go in spurt it is uniform and has power put to it the whole distance of its slash it doesnt decay it stops suddenly most commonly the first slash is to the left just one slash to the left is enough to identify it as rock slam even if it doesnt continue it can be awfully tiny too the first stroke could be sixteenth of an inch followed by dirty read rocket read should never be confused with even onestroke rock slam because of its rapid decay but dirty read is different it looks like an electric buzzer going it doesnt look like anything slashing and rock slam always slashes dirty needle is caused by big midruds buttons being out every pc has favorite button as you find out when doing an eighteenbutton prepcheck if you go beyond eight or nine buttons to get big midruds in you might as well do full roll your own prehav see pp 333334 above except that you are now doing routine 2 see hcob 5jun61 processes allowed and p 34 above instead of r212 the only trouble with routine 2 was that its results werent lasting good though they were at the time you have to find items for the benefit to last it is the need for mass that requires r212 item 1 is held in suspense in time because it is held in balance against item 2 which is also held in suspense in time this configuration can be unsettled somewhat just by running item 1 the balance will stay out but full benefit ie ten to fifty times as much benefit will result from running the whole package if you leave too many of these single items around the pc doesnt know what he is leaning against now and he doesnt think that he has gotten any gain even if he has after about six unfound items the pc will start getting nattery therefore you will get only soso gains on r212 if you dont really find both sides of the package although you may think you did you can get lots of gains if you go back to the lists that didnt end up with an ri and extend them to get the item you will get gains if you represent an item that rockslams or if you fail to complete your cycles of action in fact you will get adverse results especially if the pc was very interested in the cycle you were on you must have clean needle before you nul mark v emeter expresses clean needle much better than mark iv it expresses ruds in pc when the slightest little thing is out the mark v just 278doesnt look clean it gets less flowing less right the mark v just amplifies the mark ivs tiny little ticks it is not more sensitive it is just easier to read you can harass pc in trying to clean up needle to the point where the needle gets dirty especially by asking supergeneralized question like what are you thinking about if the pc knew what he was thinking about it wouldnt make the needle tick therefore it is useless to ask this broad question to clean the needle you will do better to get in midruds on heavily charged list the pcs think influences the needle more than on lesscharged list if the needle has been clean then slowly dirties up dont leap to put midruds in the pc will feel interrupted and protesty if you do this when the needle gets dirty you cant always put in midruds or you get noauditing so when the needle was clean and gets dirty during nulling slowly twist the list around and show him as much as the needle has been worse on and ask which item he has had thoughts on get his suppressed and invalidated items cleaned up and go on nulling the pc may get allergic to this after while but this is not as bad as running midruds all the time the rud that goes out on checking especially goals checking is anxious about getting needle clean is an operation that takes all reactions off the needle when the auditor is doing nothing if the list is complete but the pc has some minor withhold from the auditor the withhold will cause him to be individuated so he will think things as you assess which because of the missed withhold will read and make items appear to read that are not reading you will have to clean them up also pc with an incomplete list essentially has missed withhold hence he has dirty needle and the needle reacts on everything the auditor says the pc is vulnerable to auditor actions because of the inflow of the withhold he isnt critical yet but he thinks extra thoughts he is individuated high sensitivity picks up all the analytical thoughts of the pc really severe arc break will give you very nice flowing needle also 6212c13 shspec225 repair of r212 some of the material in this tape is covered by hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance there is law embracing your disheartenment the more you goof the more disheartened you will get we are longer dealing with process that has to be tailored to the pc so any problems have to be with the auditor someone has to be shoved through it to win as an auditor so that he has reality on the workability of the process this is hard to confront it is like someone saying be responsible r212 produces results when it is done right or even not quite right when you first look at it you will think that r212 has hundreds of variables training auditors in r212 is based on the idea of walk before you read book on walking the only liability of this teaching method is that you need someone there who can untangle the inevitable goofs when several have gone by and the pc has gone weird the whole technology of straightening out goofedup r212 is to do it right the only crime is to lose the session records one way to lose them is careless labelling eg pc name or date or page number you need to know what went on and what the items were etc let anyone do r212 as long as they keep the papers this applies to goals dont lose old goals lists there was place to write goals in handbook for preclears those goals could very easily get lost r212 lists are even more important than goals lists since you can get back to goals with r212 if need be so mark down what happened especially if something rockslammed pain and sensation are less important to note note what happens to items when tiger drilled auditors reports are less important than lists they can be used to summarize not to keep track of ta reads needle behavior on lists is what counts give detailed report of results not session actions in the auditors report form dont get the ideas that there are lots of rules covering lots of variables in r212 one thing that will louse up some but not all cases is to represent rockslamming item instead of opposing it especially list one item you never represent rockslamming r1 the pc will go along with it the idiot but he knows that he shouldnt take his attention off the rockslamming item itself for second you are pulling his attention away from where he thinks he must remain with fixed bayonet so when fixing case check to see if that has been done 279when repairing case take repairing the first list one mistake as priority action because it has more bearing on the session the worst goof on list one is to represent what was rockslamming and should have been opposed it is less awful to oppose something you should represent complete opposition lists which way an item should be opposed can be problematic the closer things are to pt the more likely they are to be coterms therefore r212 has more coterms than 3gaxx being closer to pt coterms are opposed both ways who or what would coterm oppose and who or what would oppose coterm you can swap it back and forth half page each one side will run more smoothly after awhile and that is what you use opposing coterm can be tricky the commonest goof is not completing the list but trying to make it oppose instead this coterm thing is one thing that that makes it hard to complete lists represent list that goes nowhere can be dumped with small liability the item will be found later somehow there are lots of rock slams in the bank but opposition lists must be completed if you represent something that didnt rockslam you should check if you having any trouble with it to see if it is actually rockslamming what you are representing might be the item suppressed and your representing it cleans it up so it now rockslams like prepchecking representing is powerful auditing on the other hand when you start to oppose something you key it in therefore you must complete oppose lists on r212 the commonest goof relating to this fact is failure to oppose something both ways to the method described above for handling coterms is not infallible the item might not be coterm wrong way to it might be an item that is deaded down never rockslammed or wrong source if it is wrong source it never becomes nullable nullable is different from item capable of being found on it nonnullable means list where the needle wont stay clean enough on it to null it so extend the list the trick in extending an oppose list is to do it the reverse way to the other direction this will prevent list from becoming 1000 items long with ris if it is wrong way to on oppose never renull extend the list and null what you now have this because an incomplete list is the commonest error in listing if you nulled it to nothing and ran out of rock slams it is incomplete so get more items your auditing could become good enough for you to be able to null list that isnt complete to nothing if you continue the list you will find that the rock slam will turn back on on the thing that you are opposing and you will get reliable item in repairing lists get old cycles of action done in order from first to last starting with oppose lists then doing represent lists always begin with scientology list one so start with the first goof made on list one this usually involves getting the rockslamming item that was missed and opposing it in any new group on r212 there will be people who tell you that it doesnt work this is the not goingright type of case there are two possible reasons why the case is not going right 1 rock slam on list one was missed and not opposed or 2 somebody shifted the cycle of action opposition cycles of action are always more important than represent cycles so get the earliest and come up the track consecutively unless the list one was done as later case action in which case you fix any goof there first fix the first goof on list one first so the order of repair is 1 first goof on list one 2 rest of list one goofs in chronological order 3 first goof on r212 oppose list 4 rest of r212 oppose list goofs in order 5 first represent list goof 6 rest of represent list goofs in order then there is the dead horse case on which one can find rock slam this could be an incomplete cycle of action case you should look for the following in such case 2801 failure to oppose rockslamming item particularly on list one list one must be in restimulation for the case to now be laying dead horses 2 failure to complete the oppose list if the item was opposed 3 auditor needed white cane he didnt recognize or report rock slams that were there particularly in coaudit to determine whether this is the case you have to observe get one of the dead horse lists extended and see if it rockslams or extend it yourself and see 4 representing something that would become dead horse you will get complaints about cases rockslamming too much to get ruds in the best way to turn off the rock slam is to represent something that would become dead horse the rule is that case will continue to rockslam only when the subject that the rock slam is on continues to be addressed by the auditor if you are listing one thing the pc doesnt rockslam on something else you dont even get phantom slam on an uncharged list the list has to be hot to turn the slam on you can get confused as to which item is slamming as the rock slam turns on and off the phantom slam has this characteristic it never obeys the auditor it turns on and off but it cant be controlled the pc in such case cant be controlled either he is never doing what you tell him to do but rockslamming item on such case will obey the auditor the item will slam as long as the pc thinks about it then stops when he puts suppress etc on it if you get these buttons off it will slam again however you can kill an r212 item with tiger drilling it should be done briefly because the items are in pt so in patching up case look for 1 list one errors 2 oppositions it is lucky that case patchup is so simple since the number of possible errors is almost infinite however there are not infinite numbers of special cases on r212 the commonest mistake is for someone to go on and on representing and never check whether the item they are representing is now rockslamming it may well now that it has been unburdened so check it from time to time especially if it wont null false reports will give you the least difficulty except for cases where pcs tell you that they have pain when it is really sensation they will also lie about the fact that they have been invalidating items getting clean needle before nulling pulls all that up running the case parallels repairing the case doing r212 follows the same order of importance as the repair priorities an embarrassment you can get into is getting rocket reads instead of rock slams on r212 first be sure it was rocket read rocket reads take precedence over rock slams so just oppose it since the pc can use rocket read item to find goal with the pc may be continually intruding his goal at this point fine get it checked out dont leave it in doubt when he gets his goal he can run r212 better this doesnt mean that he can be run on his goal complete r212 first the case that is being cleared over the top of an r212 ptp wont stay fning even if it gets to an fn eighty percent of all cases that have tried to go clear have hung up here so it is very 6301c08 shspec226 r210 and r212 part of the data in this lecture is also found in hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance 281in august i wrote jerk named kennedy this latest adornment of the russian victory parade was offered help in the space race straightening up iq etc this lighthouse has twice asked for presentations of scientology weve granted them and they have done weird things like fire the guy who asked for them time rolled along the fda started sniffing around the government organized smear campaign in the press and they raided church seized philosophic texts and meters how did they do this they lied to the court they didnt tell the court who the warrant was for and they didnt mention books the warrant was signed by the president so ads are being placed in newspapers in the bible belt and there will be delay in the court hearing i frankly was getting worried wed been ignored too long we neednt waste time fighting the government it is its own oppterm what should happen when you find an item if you give the pc the wrong item he will have markedly more mass than he had minute before if the list is incomplete the pc will also arc break in the next few minutes and you will be unable to get him out of it except by completing the list with right item mass diminishes pc knows whether or not it is his item you are only auditing up to the pcs knowingness so if he doesnt know whether it is his item you know it isnt he has to be certain that it is right also when you package the item the pc must know that it is package if there is any queasiness about it it is out the pcs knowingness is paramount in getting the right item well done listing should produce an item that brings in vvvgis not just agreement routine 2 has little miracle to offer done this way the masses go pffft against each other the rock slams cancel out wrongly done r2 delivers more mass done right the pc has less mass it is question of havingness the wrong item has mass because 1 though it does have its own mass it is not the fundamental mass 2 you have told lie about it by saying that it is the fundamental mass more data on running routine 2 some day on routine 2 you will have the bad luck to have very suppressed pc he will suppress the item as he puts it on the list you will miss the rock slam and you will know you goofed and have to do something extraordinary the pc may arc break very thoroughly and auditing with ruds missed withholds etc wont handle it only routine 2 will fix it get him to extend the list get the item and the arc break will be gone the more unnecessary arbitraries you introduce into how something is done the more trouble you will have with it r212 began to handle rockslamming r212 can be done at several levels there are lot of results to be had even doing it wrong auditors have had more trouble with it than lrh expected there are three sources for the first list in r212 1 the pcs immediate session environment 2 the environment the pc lives in more generally 3 the various parts of existence if you already have the pcs goal you can ask who or what in pt would your goal influence to get rockslamming item you could get life and livingness sources by asking what is part of your life and livingness in pt and what is not part of it each could be complete list if one doesnt rockslam the other will often both will we have to find something that isnt rockslamming to get list when you are after part or consist of list because you only oppose rockslamming items if the pc rockslams on your life dont list in pt ww does your life consist of test the source of list to make sure that it doesnt rockslam you can even tiger drill sources to be sure if source does rockslam skip it for represent list also dont oppose some outoftheblue rockslamming item rockslamming source for list is always out of context of another incomplete list that you dont necessarily know the heading of rockslamming item is therefore not necessarily an ri it is not totally destructive to oppose such an item just dicey sometimes the lists you get when you do this wont complete or you will get lots of coterms if you found scientology rockslamming you could just oppose it as security measure but there is liability to doing this 282so avoid the sourceless rock slam as something to list from if scientology rockslams find something else to list from that gets at the same thing you cant do represent you have to find some way of saying scientology so you are not representing scientology eg rons work or mental activities or some such say four dynamics rockslammed therefore the source is an incomplete list you have to complete it but how you find something about scientology or the dynamics that is broad and embracive like mental activity or what isisnt part of existence then you get an item and oppose it your success is monitored by this do routine 2 right and repair it with routine 2 little routine 2 and lot of general auditing wont give much result r2 is more powerful because it is hitting at the pcs ptp and hidden standard he doesnt know what they are until you direct his attention to them you could ask what would some healing process have to do to you in order for you to know you were better the pc will consult with circuit and give you his hidden standard if you tried to list this pcs goals all you would get would be the goals of those circuits this is another reason why you cannot get the pc clear with these circuits and hidden standards in the way after routine 2 you will begin to get the pcs goals instead of circuits goals get few packages off and out of the way and the pc will give you his goal then you can run him on goals process and clear him but you have to clear up the pt environment first 6301c08 shspec227 case repair if you did the pure form of listing and opposing described in the last lecture you get less mass as result if you start seeing more rock slams than before and there is more mass on the pc you have been goofing the best visual indicator is the pcs skin tone if mass is increasing the pcs skin goes green or yellow or grey or black the eyes are also an indicator although they are somewhat less reliable because going through period of sen will make the eyes look seny but do note the pcs skin tone at the start of the session so that you can compare this with its later appearance age is another symptom the pc should look younger half way through the session even hair color will change it will get grayer or less gray weight will also change over the course of two to three sessions in the direction of optimum weight the meter should also behave better it should be more responsive there should be cleaner needle routine 2 doesnt do much for the ta position the needle is more indicative the pcs ta can sit at five with the pc getting better and better if the ta remains motionless throughout listing thats fine after awhile there should be some change it is not in the course of one session but after several eventually there should be improvement in high or low ta or the mass hasnt been cleaned up persistent low ta is worrisome seeing change in ta look for 1 wrong source or 2 list that should be completed you should be especially concerned if the pc was at 15 and didnt change after couple of packages had been found listing wrong way to makes the needle stiff and jerky on right list the needle should free up get clean and stay clean list can go clean needle before the item is on it so avoid short lists super long list say twentyfive pages is from wrong source or wrong way to five to six pages should do the wronger you are the longer it takes the right way goes fast when nulling list dont tell the pc that an item rockslammed until you have finished nulling then watch his indicators to be sure that it is his item dont shift his attention after telling him the item if he arc breaks when you have given him the item it is wrong and you had better get him to go on he wont mind if it was the wrong item if he knows it is his item and you try to make him go on he will arc break when do you repair case when it wont run right the commonest error in routine 2 is wrong source and the commonest source of that is an item taken from an incomplete list any item is viewed as coming from list even if it was never before listed the three areas that you have available to get items from are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence 283so if the pc has several rock slams on list one you know at once that list one is an incomplete list this gives you the problem of regress you are always starting from list that hasnt been written the auditors responsibility is to make sure that the list source question doesnt rockslam since if it does it is obviously part of list so he cant use it for represent or consist of list all lists start with represent list just because something slams you dont necessarily oppose it you might try to find out what the item is from by asking what list question would _______ be an answer to if you have been listing from something which when you check it now slams it is wrong source it is not that it is getting unsuppressed so what you want to do is to find nonrockslamming list question that produces rock slams there must be rock slam anywhere in the list question if you list from nonrockslamming source and dont get rock slams you can always use the negative version what doesnt _______ consist of if you dont get anything on parts of existence try what isnt part of existence you can also do this with list one if pc has his interest stuck on an item find what list that item was on and complete the list once you have got rockslamming item from complete list you can go ahead and oppose it what about case that has been run long time on wrong sources wrong way to and has lots of wrong items this is pretty sad but the case will still have been improved just repair it by finding the first incomplete list on the case even suppositional one or list one or whatever get list question of some sort that doesnt rockslam add to the list and try to tiger drill alive what originally rockslammed if you get rock slam while extending watch to see whether you keep getting them if you do it shows wrong source or wrong way to try it the other way around if it still wont clean up it is wrong source complete all such incomplete lists where you get ris oppose them and the bricabrac will blow off when repairing lists just examine the genus of the list and see if it needs completing get it completed to its proper item oppose it and package it up before this is done the pc will be interested in the item afterwards he will have interest in the item it erases he will cognite on it the pc may have trouble remembering right items wrong ones will be memorable because the pcs attention is still stuck there the purpose of routine 2 is to clear away chronic ptps and hidden standards so you can find and run the pcs goal having found his goal you may still need to use routine 2 to wipe out restimulated terminals when the pc caves in while running the goal you can use what does pt consist ofnot consist of or what does auditing consist ofnot consist of everything said here about lists also applies to goals clearing lists routine 321 for more data about r321 see pp 332 and 356 above more data is also available in confidential hcobs 7nov62ii routine 321 the twentyone steps finding goals and 17nov62 routine 321 one of the hardest things you will use to get rockslamming item from is goals list goals lists almost never run out of slams when they do though they behave like any other list remember that rocket read is senior to rock slam and that in other respects you trust it the same if you find rocket reading items on therefore incomplete list complete it to one rocketreading item the frequency of rock slam test is senior to the stickier needle test on wrongwayto having found an ri pcs needle may be fine but the wrongwaytoness of it will beef it up do it the other way if it still doesnt clean up and give one rock slam on nulling the source item must have been from an incomplete list so complete it be prepared to be wrong and straighten it out straighten up routine 2 thoroughly fix up auditing briefly you could also find one rockslamming item that never got opposed so oppose it you could take list one and ask what question would complete list one and complete it this would handle most problems 6301c10 shspec228 r212 the only commonwealth nation that has picked up on the fda raid was australia this shows the connections between australia and the us 284routine 2 has an important liability someone can be put off but good if you miss an item eg by giving the pc the wrong item since the missing item acts as supersized missed withhold you must get the item on the list or run into this missed withhold phenomenon on certain pc you may get away with having an incomplete list sixty to seventy percent of the time but the time you dont get away with it makes up for the lot the pc becomes unauditable he doesnt know why and he will just go round the bend further if all you do is to pull missed withholds without completing the list say you give him wrong item he may not arc break spectacularly then but his session goals in succeeding sessions will get less and less bright you should be able to see this as you go over the auditing reports and pick up the list where this goof occurred the pc will also be very massy arc breaky looking older darker skintoned etc he may also be arc broken when you tell him to complete the list this doesnt matter complete it anyway wrongwayto list doesnt produce the arc breaks neither does wrong source it is just incomplete lists so watch carefully when you abandon list or give pc an item if he goes out the bottom immediately or slowly repair by completing the list even if the pc has been doing lists off the wrong item for eighteen sessions on wrongway to list the rock slams keep increasing in frequency that is good way to spot one but beware of pcs wearing rings that can cause phantom slams on rightwayto list the slams will be less frequent from the third or fourth page on you may go another six pages before you get the next slam before the needle goes clean and the item is on the list if you give the pc wrong item he will do downcurve on the tone scale if the pc starts to go the slightest bit bis on being given an item tell him that you are sorry that is not his item and that you are going to extend and complete the list he should brighten up immediately thats all it takes dont ever shift pcs attention immediately after giving him an item watch him if it is the wrong item he will age subtly but definitively before your eyes you can watch his tone level go down by the second if you have handed him wrong item just tell him i dont think it was your item well extend the list and he will brighten up there are very few pcs around who are arc breaky as hell and have been for several years they can get audited but it is gruesome what is wrong with them is most likely an unflat repetitive process the omitted answer is the missed item of course there is list problems intensive approach sorting out when they were happy with auditing using the meter as necessary can be used in this case using suppress you can fish up what process it was theoretically then you could prepcheck it out but why not let him complete the process so when the pc is left arc broken with the auditing the organization or whatever find the unflat process and flatten it you wouldnt have to flatten everything ever left unflat it the unflat process missed item could also turn up on an oppose list to auditing but missed item could turn up on any case that you are doing list on so watch for it another source of missing items is failure to oppose this especially happened when the list one item was opposed but the item found from this was not opposed in its turn the rule is that anything that keeps slamming must be opposed so you could get two packages by the time you are through an item from wrong source will slam until you straighten up the source rockslamming item from right source should always be opposed routine 2 is like racing car it gets you there fast but if you drive it wrong you can really wrap someone around telephone pole so you have to be skilled at case repair this has become an important skill the reason the pc gets more upset if you try to pull missed withholds when it is missed item is that the item keeps getting restimulated but he cant give you the item because you are not listing the pc may not be enthusiastic about extending the list but he will do it and brighten up watch out for this situation if you had two items slamming on the list and when you null only the second one slams beware when you give it to him as an item watch his indicators for few seconds before you go on dont distract him at this point it will aggravate the arc break if it is the wrong item among other things if it is wrong backpedal gracefully and continue the list bit to get the item of course the list may go on for pages also 2856301c10 shspec229 how to audit for years we have had the problem of finding some pc who even when run on proper processes tears up the neighborhood this is the problem of the missed withhold that is all it is the biggest missed withhold you can have is the missing answer to the auditing question he didnt give you the answer he didnt put the item on the list this is such big missed withhold that if you always got it right you could virtually omit pulling missed withholds but you cant totally omit pulling missed withholds heres why among the manifestations of missed withholds are dopeoff and boiloff dopeoff and boiloff are only caused by missed withholds not by anaten contained in gpms anaten is contained in list but only acts on the pc when there is an actual nearlyfoundout in pt you have to keep the little missed withholds cleaned up because they are the ones that make the pc groggy and dopey not the missing items it is pt nearlyfoundout that makes the pc go under on an item or list it doesnt happen just from the list r212 pulls withholds by the carload on track if you miss package it is giant missed withhold and screaming arc break but if you see pc go even slightly groggy dopey slumping down and shutting his eyes etc on nulling pull up right there and get the nearlyfound outs you are after regular pttype missed withholds because missing item on list doesnt give the same dopeoff symptom having missed an item will give this other phenomenon body see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for the fifteen signs of missed withholds the expected behavior of the pc during l and n and receiving or thinking of items is wide awake though the pc could have his eyes closed this is terribly important during nulling when you are depending on the item rockslamming it wont happen if the pc is anaten meters dont rockslam when the pc is anaten meter will tick but you cant depend on it rockslamming when there is insufficient attention present to charge up an item the same is true for rocket reads in goal checkouts boiloff anaten etc were discovered in 1952 to be flow running too long in one direction missed withhold is restrained flow any effort to outflow by pc who has missed withhold is blocked and only causes further inflow the pc has stuck flow if the pc has missed withhold hes inflowed as far as he can go and hes very very prone to boiloff he is holding back flow so he gets stuck flow very quickly sometimes missed withhold from out of session is keyed in by withhold in session then the pc boils off in this case you have to run the outofsession missed withhold that is why missed withhold stays in as random rudiment it gets you out of more trouble than it gets you into if you broaden the missed withhold question to include the track then you will get the restimulated ones too for instance you might ask in the past week has withhold been missed do this when you cant wake the pc not all missed withholds are on the second dynamic if you start steering missed withholds by dynamics you will start more incomplete lists keep the question general the nearlyfoundout is lefthand button suppressortype button which doesnt necessarily read on the meter if you pull session missed withhold but the pc goes dopey fifteen minutes later prepcheck the nearlyfoundout button with or without time limiter left hand buttons are those that prevent things from reading eg suppress fail to reveal anxious about careful of nearly found out right hand buttons make things read eg mistake been made suggested decided protested invalidated protested follows on the heels of nearlyfoundout thus it is point where left and right hand buttons meet in coaudit watch for dopeoff and put in the random rud yourself dont try to get students to do it take for granted that it is something out of session that keyed in you can use is there anything we nearly found out about you the we limits the question or get the student to run the random rudiment muzzled and repetitive until the pc looks desperate and about to arc break then go back to listing which model session should one use as much as necessary more model session has these elements 1 adjust the pcs chair 2862 get can squeeze 3 give the rfactor for the session 4 give tone 40 start of session 5 find out if the session has started for the pc 6 have the pc set goals for life and livingness and the session what you do next depends on whether you are going to list or null today dont worry about ruds in listing session who cares what the needle is doing dirty needle can best be cleaned up by listing the dirty needle is probably being caused by thoughts about doing the list if the list is complete the pcs list will be clean in this case it is noauditing to do anything other than to null the list take chance on betweensessions outruds only get worried if the pc starts to boiloff get off missed withholds if possible if it is not possible the list is incomplete so extend it in listing session get goals set and go right into listing that is more effective in cleaning up the needle and having the pc in session then anything else if the pc wont sit there and list that is different if the pc stops listing it is either suppress or inval forget the rest of the ruds take any items the pc gives you on these buttons put them on the list and go right back into listing that was the purpose of the rud after all at the end of the session discuss where you and the pc have gotten to and where in general you are going close off the body of the session then check endruds at sensitivity 64 get the pc out of the auditing environment with in this session was the run all right get your question answered but dont grind the pc to death check protest if this looks necessary refer to scientology 88008 it talks about thetan in the physical universe all the thetan is doing is stacking himself up against the physical universe and batting around like bluebottle fly in cage if you want to free the pc from the session ask if the room was ok then you have got the thetan and the physical universe straightened up if the pc starts inventing answers or seems nerved up it is probably missed withhold you wont do anything about it then get can squeeze asking about whether the run was all right usually gets his havingness back up but if he is down on havingness dont work over ruds run some havingness for few commands to restore the can squeeze not to run the bank the best havingness processes are 1 feel that _______ 2 touch that _______ 3 notice that _______ only use few commands not more than twelve this is also good way to get the pc back in session then take up session goals not life and livingness goals take down whatever gains the pc mentions get asksay answer question if he has one dont start handling what comes up you are ending session dont press for more give the pc tone 40 end of session and have him tell you that you are longer auditing him give him an altered visual aspect also to keep him from going on running his case look more cheerful and natural ask for cigarette or something this is routine 2 model session using more than this minimum can get you into trouble for nulling session you can show the pc the list and ask for any major thoughts that he has had about it this practice lets the pc get off outruds on the list then you dont have to ask for them if the pc gets agitated in routine 2 session the first thing to assume is that there is something wrong with the routine 2 if the pc gets selfauditish or interrupts to get his ruds in just give cheery acknowledgment and go on dont let the pc obscure reads while listing 287if you are nulling just go down the list going bark bark bark if the needle gets dirty dont assume that it is outruds it is more likely that the list is wrong way to or from wrong source especially if your nulling was too brisk to give the pc time to think even more likely than the above is that the item is not on the list if list is incomplete pc wont register protest on the meter when you ask for more items even if he is protesting verbally you could also list for pages beyond where the list was complete then the needle can go dirty on protest but all other crimes fall short of not completing the list r321 requires more midruds than routine 2 see p 371 above for r321 as soon as you have ptps out of the road the case is ready for r321 find his goals nice as you please it is safer for an expert auditor to do goals on case than to do routine 2 an inexpert auditor is safer with routine 2 the list in pt who or what are you upset about would probably run more easily on pc simply in the form who or what does present time consist of cf expanded dianetics pt environment list this is the basic model but you could use who or what are you in contact with in pt on missed withholds realize that you can list whichever area is of most interest to the pc if you pick the wrong one of the three session life and livingness parts of existence to do first it can react like missed withhold make sure you get the universe where the problem lies 6301c15 shspec230 dead horses an emergency is an unpredicted event failure to predict anything else is life dead horses lists are problem often you do represent list and it misbehaves it is hard to complete it cycles the essence of cycling list is that the needle periodically goes beautifully clean then dirties up again when lrh first noticed this he didnt understand it was like list wrong wayto but how could that be on represent list the cycle on rightwayto list is dirty needle dirty read rock slam dirty read dirty needle rock slam rock slam then needle clean and it stays clean unless it rockslams on wrongwayto oppose list the rock slams increase in number the clean needles do too you can tell by looking at any pcs list whether it is ok or wrong way to you will need to be able to do this when you are auditing in the field where you will have to repair other auditors pcs pcs can get sick on r212 and you had better know what could be wrong so that you can fix it compare page two and page five of the list if there are more rock slams on page five its wrong you can list list each way for page or two observing how the pc looks before you start and when you stop you will get good at seeing changes in pc appearance as his bank caves in on him dont let anyone who isnt real expert do r212 on children because they wont sit still long enough to be repaired they are easier to cave in so getting back to dead horses and represent lists acting like wrongwayto lists the flaw in man is that he does not know himself he is much more able to observe enemies than self ask guy to name his enemies and he will give you list of names ask him to name himself and you will get joe that is why representlists tend to be wrongwayto sometimes and to give you oppterms they are easier to see than selves and they often dont rockslam properly the pc gets stuck flow of listing oppterms enemies and you must find wording that causes the pc to list himself his terminals list so the represent list is all oppterms and it doesnt rockslam and it gets clean needle dirty needle cycle if you are lucky there will be rock slams on it and you will find an item but often the pc will go greenish and the list is dead horse the case that gives you wrong way to represent list or dead horses is someone whose next available item is terminal not an oppterm the more the pc lists oppterms the worse he feels the missed item is the one that the pc is being right there in the session this also applies to the skunk list which runs out to item despite rock slams dead horse list is list with rock slams on it even with midruds in skunked list has rock slam but doesnt go on to an ri the pc doesnt know from which point of view to give you enemies so he has to give you everything say the terminal is bad boy we are asking to bad boy what does life consist of and we get just oppterms that is how you get wrongwayto represent list r212 can be run over another ptp and still get good results although under these circumstances the pc gets bit dispersed at times r212 gets the big hidden ptps and hidden standards out of the 288way so that goals can be found until these ptps are out of the way the pc doesnt have enough free attention units to do r321 most people dont think at all they just feed questions to circuits which answer special case of this is the pcs hidden standards hidden standard is circuit that is telling the pc what to think the pc has signal system rigged up scientology works if _______ it is quite complicated communication system like an automatic trainstopping system the guy who leaps up and says oh yes scientology works first had to ask one of these systems they dont think at all for instance the fda thinks the whole world is composed of two valences victims and victimizers there are other items for the fda the guy who makes food is victimizer and the guy who eats it is victim this makes the fda an enemy of all industry since industry emanates and those who dont are victims the fda lacking any other than those two terminals and wanting to be effective is victimizer and can only create victims this leads to whole country of victims communism etc all dogooder government agencies fall under this heading life is sort of dreary game that goes on between all of these victimizers who have to be stopped and all of these victims the government official in one of these agencies is trying to protect everybody from himself dogooder gone mad has nothing but victims left eventually these boys have more purpose in life because so much is now missing from it the way to handle this dogooder is to sympathize with him if you do this he will go right out of the victimmaker valence and straight into that of victim he is defeated instantly if you like humanity you will leave that kind of politics alone in fact you will leave all politics alone the thing that man is tuned up to see first is enemies when they go batty they can see nothing but enemies everywhere the dogooder never recognizes that he is victimmaker however he would never give you victimmaker as terminal you could ask him who would have your problems and get terminals cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown nobody recognizes what he is being as easily as what he is facing terminals are harder to pick up than oppterms at the start of case so you get wrong way to represent lists dead horses and skunks and thats the source of all of these you want terminals and you must phrase questions to get them the last rung of cases is that of pt rock slams that would be pretty grim because now you cant do represent list the way to get someone to list terminals is to list in pt who or what would have your problems or who or what would live the life you are living or who or what do people think you are or who is looking at or who could be looking at or some such pcs have items stacked up in order as well as packages stacked up in order the majority of pcs are bit overwhelmed and the first item to come up is an oppterm they are being an oppterm other pcs not few have terminal as the first item they need terminal question if you said who or what are you as listing question remember that you is undifferentiated so you should somehow differentiate it if you have listed dead horse list ask the pc who or what would oppose all those things and get rockslamming list 6301c15 shspec231 r212 nevers never represent rockslamming item ie anything that ever rockslammed because rockslamming item comes from some source and if you dont know what the source is it could be wrong an arbitrary source is dangerous this is the most dangerous point in r212 never use an arbitrary list dont try to oppose some rockslamming word that just comes from nowhere never abandon r212 nothing else will patch up r212 if it gets fouled up r212 is an ultimate process ie process that repairs itself never try to patch up r212 with something else because it will fail never let someone lose records or keep records inaccurately there is way to straighten out case whose records are lost however using the meter find when the pcs case caved in the session in which it occurred and put midruds in on that session this will get the pcs memory improved to the point where he can give you data about the list or whatever but this is very arduous approach 289never attribute violent arc break to anything but wrong item or an incomplete list it is not caused by missed withhold except in the sense that the missed item is the withhold this datum applies in the workaday world as well as it does in session somebody has missed an item on the us government probably the arc break is from noauditing and missing all their items never run pc darker and massier he wont get lighter come off it at once never give pc an item and then do something else at once this is very distracting to the pc and if it is wrong item the arc break will be compounded you must allow minute or two of observation just put the meter aside and make little routine of it and say well apparently your item is _______ watch him like hawk does his face get dark does mass come in if so dont let it go any longer tell the pc that you want to continue listing never lead pc to believe that you are giving him an item when you are not there can be funny condition where all the indicators look right but after the pc cognites the rock slam will vanish as the lock blows after which the wrong item indicators start to show up so dont shift the pcs attention this will save lots of trouble the longer you let pc keep wrong item the more trouble it will be to patch it up never persist with wrong action that is worsening the case just because you dont know what to do it is far better to end off or take break to straighten things out it is good sense to know what you are doing before you do it this does not mean somatics thats not sign of the pcs getting worse at all never let case errors accumulate or multiply when you are aware of an error on the case fix it without forgetting that it is an error to fail to complete cycle of action on the case but also dont interrupt pc that is doing well if the case isnt running ok repair earlier mistakes all lists stem from some arbitrary point it cant be helped the three universes from which you list are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence each of these can be listed positive or negative oppterm or and terminal or thus you have twelve sources one way to make auditing with these less risky is when clearing the command to test it for rock slams this can include testing words or segments within the command for rock slams never represent it if it rockslams clear the command and vary it around until it makes sense to the pc until its real to him never try to list list question that the pc cannot answer ie clear it with him and get his agreement to answer it choosing the wrong universe to list will get you missed withhold phenomena including arc breaks because the pcs attention is fixated on the universe that you are not asking him about never in your anxiety to clear someone or pacify someone fail to get his ptps and hidden standards out of the way that is all in general that has been wrong with clearing 6301c16 shspec232 tr0 the original tr0 was to teach the auditor to be there and to be aware however in doing tr0 students have begun to confront with that definition the original definition and tr0 are still valid additives have arisen you can make someone confront with professional attitude an auditing attitude an interested attitude good coaching depends on spotting what the student is doing and running it out flunking it without either flunking so much that the student goes into apathy nor so little that the student never improves the purpose of tro is to enable the studentto stand up to the duress of auditing it disturbs pc to have an auditor whose confront is very unnatural and who shatters under an upset in session upsets are often assignable to faulty tr4 an auditor who q and as gives pcs 290withholds by not simply acknowledging one q and equals one missed withhold the pcs statement has not been acknowledged just acknowledged the reason some auditors take long time to learn not to q and isnt really outtr4 it is outtr0 the auditor cant stand up to the session whenever something in the session looks odd the auditor retreats tr0 is out the coach must have considerable perception to coach tr0 on useful gradient he has to see confront go out look at something the student is doing and punch the button lrh has noticed auditors who q and in the presence of an arc break because there is too much there to confront this is as disastrous as it is likely to happen coaching gradient on this would start with the coach shaking his hand in front of the students eyes somewhere on the gradient the student will demonstrate his ability to dodge flying emeter cans while still confronting for an auditor to freeze and go totally silent is worse for the pc than auditor q and it is auditing situation we should give at least fifty percent of our coaching time to the fellow who goes into wood good coach can recognize the difference between someone confronting and someone going into solid granite the next worst thing to going wooden is fleeing this amounts to the same thing dont think someone is doing tr0 because he has gone into apathy you can add aliveness to being aware this point is easy for coach to miss someone whose tr0 is granite wont be able to handle what comes up in session because he is not really confronting when you find an auditor who is having trouble with tr0 you know what kind of response he is getting in auditing because when something happens in session the auditor flees good auditing as opposed to bad auditing will show up most clearly under duress tr0 is the first thing to go the auditor will start making mistakes which is one thing you cant afford to do if the auditors tr0 is poor the auditor will make wrong judgments matter how well he is taught there is gradient of bad tr0 consisting of three grades 1 tr0 of doing the drill not associated with anything 2 the person who clams up and cant act 3 obsessive motion as form of and all three of these must be cured with coaching there is something else you could do different from tr1 or tr2 talking confront you see if the student can go on counting while you throw the cans at him or whether he loses count auditors must be trained to expect arc breaks and to keep going because auditors get arc breaks as well as getting wins and results lrh was aware recently of thinking less swiftly when pc arc broke he analyzed the phenomenon as his not wanting to confront it because it was counter to his intention for the session so he experienced small impulse not to confront it this gave lrh subjective reality on how an auditor could go from there to not thinking and making goof r212 arc breaks can be sudden violent and apparently inexplicable so tr0 must be beefed up in order to cope with this how much and how long should you run tr0 until the student comes to the independent conclusion that he can do tr0 and has the ability to do tr0 while doing all the other trs and until he can maintain tr0 when everything is going wrong and there is lots of duress bad tr0 leads to and lack of comprehension of what is going on and noauditing for the pc it takes awhile for someone to learn r212 if he is learning his trs at the same time you are liable to have mess on your hands coaudit with r210 see p 359 above can be done but only because guidance is very stringent and they dont have very much responsibility for tr1 go get good recording of lion roaring and then play it with the student putting intention into the middle of the speaker 291the degree of arc breaks the pc will have on r212 is proportional to the outness of the auditors trs bad trs lead to bad judgment if the auditors trs are perfect he will never have them tested by violently arc broken pc psychiatrists are trying to make the third dynamic safe by protecting it from the

stressinduced q and and alteris that has been added if you do something unusual every time you see something unusual in pc you will never make him clear he will be wrapped around telephone pole the more precise the process and the more you figurefigure on it the goofier it will get there is constant number of items in gpm this makes it possible to end one gpm and go on into the next one without knowing that you are doing so especially if the pcs ruds are out when you end the first gpm so that there is fn or it is so brief say 3 12 seconds that you dont see it or you miss seeing the bd if you jam the second goal like that you will get high stuck ta after awhile items will be findable and the goal stops rocket reading more comments on specific goofs on running goals if the pc gives you goal you always take it but you dont necessarily do something with it the only time you find item on list is when the item has already been found the pc isnt different he has the same bank or he wouldnt be here in this timestratum at this time auditors are to be congratulated for their willingness to persist on case but when one persists simply because one doesnt know what else to do one is doing the unusual what you are trying to do with gpm is to run it out not just to find ris the goal built the gpm so you have to knock out the ris aligned to the goal so the gpm will disappear the clear check procedure is given in hcob 22feb63 routine 3m rundown by steps 6303c20 shtvd18 shspec252 ruds and havingness session lrh demo with reg sharpe lrh does model session and beginning rudiments then finds suitable havingness process and runs it to stabilization of the ta dont ever nag pc with dirty needle it cleans up as the pcs confidence and arc with the auditor comes up auditors who punish the pc because they cant read his needle only make the dirty needle worse take what the pc says and get out the pc might have missed withhold but here is the test he is not mad at the auditor so that is not it you dont need an axe to clean up needle you may think that needle gets cleaned up because you pick up all the thoughts of the pc thats wrong needle cleans up because the pc has more arc and more confidence in the auditor it isnt cleaned up on the significance of what the pc says so in ruds and havingness session the primary purpose of the session is to build arc with the pc by reason of auditing it is not what you do it is how you do it you are smoothing out his needle pcs arc determines his reads on the meter it is based on smooth basic auditing the first requisite of all auditing is to be able to give pc smooth session on ruds and havingness session which ends up with the pc in better arc the needle cleaner if you can do that the pc will have confidence in you the pc has to be able to confront his auditor before he can confront his bank the effect scale is at work here if you are smooth basic auditor you can run any process ruds and havingness arent just practice they raise the pcs arc if they are done right 6303c26 shspec252 case repair worry is the occupational hazard of the auditor doing routine 2 and 3 the time to worry is when the pc looks and feels bad dont plow on at that point find what is wrong case repair can become necessary once goal has been found and run if the goal has not been run all it takes is prepcheck to straighten it out sometimes goal has been found which wasnt ready to be found or run and the auditor starts finding items that are out of another gpm then routine 2g comes into case repair see hcob 13apr63 routine 2g and 6303c21 shspec251 r2g series the actions you 293should take when one goal has been run and it has disappeared are resident in r2g1 or r2g2 not in r3m you list goals against items null old lists run r2g1 prepcheck an old goal etc if youve got items from different gpm in order to find goal from the items you have got you need to use r2g you will appreciate the fact that some class iv has checked out goal and verified that it rocket read when you try to find the matching items say you had an old goal which has been listed out on 114 lines and which longer ticks but on which there was once an fn or say someone had wrongly worded source list or someone made up his own line plot and got sick the primary datum of all case repair applies to all these situations all these weird actions are incapable of deranging gpm gpms are almost impervious to improper r3m though the pc can be made sick and caved in so at any stage of case repair anything that was done right will stay right and anything done wrong can be corrected r3m stops working where it is done wrong anything that has been found on the pc has been found even if it is not correctly aligned as yet that an item was found out of place doesnt alter the gpm where it belongs r3m will still work fine we can call the whole bank the goals problem masses and one gpm gpm one goal and packet of items equals gpm r3m is what handles the repair of messed up gpms if you want to know exactly what gpm is and the explanation for the formation of the gpm read dmsmh wherever it says engram in the explanation of why people have engrams put in item or gpm it is quite interesting there is reason why the thetan postulated each goal it was born out of the goal that the thetan has just survived only the first goal of the bank is postulated from nothing the only thing that can upset gpm is the exact auditing that we give it it hangs together by violence or lack of it so it is accustomed to violence and mistakes practically auditing goof can affect it though you can make pc unhappy and miserably uncomfortable by making auditing goofs you will upset the pc but you wont upset his bank however you are not running the pc you are running gpm with the pcs cooperation the varying length of gpm depends on how well it served the pc as survival mechanism that doesnt vary much although the difference of line plots gives the appearance of more variation this occurs because some items found are extraneous and others are strays from other line plots if you cant find anything while doing r3m you have goofed and you are looking in the wrong place it is not that there is nothing there or that the gpm has gotten messed up in case repair at any stage of auditing the gpm find the first wrong action that you can find behind you and do it right if piece or item of gpm is missing you can always find it and put it in you can do goals oppose list to start it and stop it also dont just straighten out the pcs straighten out the auditor who goofed get him to study the bulletins and find what he didnt get it could be that he never read them otherwise he will keep making the same mistake handle case repair as though it were clear test compare the goal to the line plot and see if they relate put in buttons on the goal get it to fire or at least tick go over your line plot and read each item against the meter if one rockslams even though it is from source list and has been opposed you know the source list was improperly handled any item that reads matter how slightly after having itself been opposed came off wrongly done or handled list that is stable datum if it rocket reads you have guarantee that there has been wrong way oppose the only guarantee is that the list it came from is wrong correct that list what you want is the earliest item on the line plot that now reads look behind it at the line plot on which it appeared and do that list correctly if you dont find something wrong with it the error is earlier look at items that were found earlier what happens when you do wrongway oppose it usually throws the pc out of the right gpm into another gpm and gives you stray item that looks out of place on the plot so seeing stray look at the list it came from one test for which way to list is to call the question each way the one that turns on more mass is the wrong one you should get good enough to recognize it by significance as all gpms follow the pattern in hcob 13mar63 294in case repair having found the right item just proceed as though the subsequent items had never been found repair case that needs repair dont just blunder on if the pc arc breaks use the assessment bulletin bulletin not available but is based on list of fifteen causes of arc breaks in r2 and r3 given in hcob 14mar63 urgent routine 2 routine 3 arc breaks handling of p 3 to find out what was really wrong dont just try to spot it or guess the cause of rough arc break is withheld from both the auditor and the pc dont put figurefigure into what you are doing just be sure that you are doing r3m right 6303c27 shtvd19 shspec254 sec checking sec checking is an art it consists of restimulating stuff which is to be picked up and then picking it up the way to do it is thoroughly getting through the sec check isnt the point the point is getting through to the pc and keying stuff in there follows tvd of reg sharpe sec checking leslie van straden there is world of difference between sec checking and midruds or any ruds ruds are done in perfunctory manner just to be able to get on with auditing sec checking and prepchecking are auditing the pcs case on goals running you are using midruds to brush the pc off so that there is nothing in your road in sec checking and prepchecking you are pressing the question home you are seeing to it that the pc sees how the question applies to his life dig dig dig you discuss and restimulate things so that you can clean them up to be called an auditor you must be able to do both of these things the brushoff and the presshome in r2g1 you have to be able to do both it is an art you have to be able to audit the pc in front of you you have to work around enough to really clean things up r2g1 is not run on the needle it is part of routine 2 prehav levels which is run on the tone arm totally as long as there is ta you keep persuading the pc to answer there is r2gpm prehav which is the original prehav levels applied to purposes see hcob 13apr63 routine 2g for summary of the routine 2g processes including routine 2gpm and routine 2g1 to g5 sec check ruds and havingness are all processes that are run by the needle not by the ta 6304c18 shspec258 directive listing part i details on running r3m gobbledygook to comply with the form isnt right the pc sometimes gives it knowing that it should be suchandsuch form dont use it since it will result in rocket read something odd but conceptually right eg catholicness is ok it is up to the auditor to direct the pcs attention to what should be there and get him to find it the liabilities of getting wrong items wrong goals missed items etc are so great that you should do everything possible to prevent these things from happening you have bank pattern that is at least close to the perfect pattern the upper fourteen to eighteen and the lower twelve items omitting the two lowest oppterms which vary on every goal are very set and patterned the pattern is that of lrhs fifteenth gpm he realized that we needed the basic fundamentals of the bank and that the pc was in bank so far back and so beefy that it was vital to get its character and its right pattern or get killed as pc there is more to the gpm than appeared earlier because one could confront it all until lot of charge had been taken off the goal of that bank is to create to lrhs amazement the pattern holds true later on the track and on other pcs if the pc isnt run closely guided to this pattern his rocket read goes off so the pattern has value there will be other patterns for other types of goals but they can be extrapolated from this one directive listing has to do first with the accuracy of the pattern when the auditor doesnt know what he is trying to do it is not very successful directive listing is kind permissive listing wastes time and pcs 295the main thing that will give you trouble is the top oppterm and the top terminal these are characterized as the final achievement of the goal the top oppterm and the negation of the goal the top terminal 6304c30 shspec261 directive listing part ii finding the pattern of the gpm has been pure slaughter you have to hunt and punch around among various banks stirring everything up lrh was horrified in the past to find so many items he wondered if some were locks now it is all shaken out it is mysterious that the noun form declines into ity forms then the goal as an oppterm the goal declines through the same pattern all the way down through absolute and perfect into the ivities then you get to the end of the goal which doesnt decline mysteriously body weight and machinery get knocked around sometimes when doing directive listing it is the unrun items which slamming into the body increase the bodys mass this is one of the oldest findings in havingness processing like mockups being shoved into the body increasing the bodys weight partiallyrun gpm being in restimulation impinges on the body more than it did so you get more body weight mental mass and physical mass are the same stuff but mental mass is thinner gpm mass looks like steel shell or is sphere covered with black or grey cloud the mass on halfdischarged bank looks like grey cottonwool it has finite dimensions the mass alternates black banks and grey banks going back down the track black bank partly discharged turns greyish and murkybrown while there are still some items it shakes and shivers and tries to fall apart the best items are those that turn on little mass the first items off take off proportionally more charge than the later ones however leaving lower ris undischarged is dangerous because the lower items hold it all together and it will charge up again the top items are uncomfortable and upsetting but not that important the lowest oppterm is the keystone that keeps the bank in its channel because it is cross between the failed goal of the next gpm down and the one you are in that is how the goals stay in sequence what keeps the bank charged up is the goal when you reach the goal as an ri you cant just leave it you have to list what would oppose it but dont let the pc start to run what comes up as the item because it is the next bank and before going into it the pc has to come up to pt acknowledge it very thoroughly dont null the list go back to the top of the first bank you ran and find its goal find the opposite oppose and go on to pt it is always harder to go the other way going later rather than earlier but that is the way to do it the reason is that you are trying to clear the pc by obtaining for the pc the greatest possible auditing gains per unit of time it is mechanically true that the more items you get off the more banks you run the more charge you discharge the more the pc will cognite but we are running the pc under special conditions that you as scientologist recognize as special but that one else would see as out of the ordinary you are running thetan in body that just about ruins ninety percent of the things you could do you are auditing bank with frail human body interposed between the bank and the pc but you need the pcs body to hold onto the cans that is what has given lrh trouble in research the pc is put into danger in that you cant audit dead body end if the pc dropped his body half way through bank he would probably be sufficiently restimulated so that he would have trouble picking up new body he would keyout but he would feel betrayed because the hope factor was way up so auditing is monitored by the consideration of what gains you can achieve in spite of the fact that the pc has body between himself and the bank this is real problem the bank is capable of influencing the body that is why the emeter can be used the emeter is not connected up to the auditor but the auditor can accidentally start looking at or into his own bank to figure out the pc and kick in some restimulation the auditors bank and the pcs are on different wavelengths so they dont collide mest has wavelengths also someone whose wavelength is near to yours is someone you feel very close to soulmate you can influence each other more than average being both more pleasing and more irritating there is also the possibility of having known the other person before so there is thetan plus body plus bank the bank consists of free track that hasnt been drawn into the gpms all the goals all the gpms all the locks secondaries engrams and circuits then there is the thetan the body and the physical universe with all its ptps so in sense in auditing the pc you are auditing the whole physical universe and everything in it it is seldom necessary for the auditor to handle the pcs environment except when handling very neurotic or psychotic pc or pc with psychotic family 296if you were auditing thetan with body you could run him back to his earliest bank knock it out and then run off the later ones more easily the body gets in the way of this because when the thetan made his earliest bank he didnt have body and his adventures were more strenuous than body could take so you can make someone quite ill by chasing them down into early banks and badly handling them the body is useful adjunct though nuisance in some ways so you should safeguard it by staying with standard procedures whatever you come up with to run run it well with minimum of stress on the body what could you do to overstress the body you could fail to clear the bank you are working on and go off into other banks you could not run banks closer to pt before going earlier you could not try as far as possible to run bank from its extreme top to the bottom you could keep auditing the pc over and over finding nothing and not discharging the bank you could find wrong items and run wrong goals you could fail to follow the pattern but assume that your pc is different your pc simply wont rocket read well on some parts of the gpm it is just charge that prevents the right item from firing just as the pc has many goals and many banks he has many ris in one gpm instead of worrying about all the gpms there are to run you should be worrying about cleaning up the ris you have your hands on just as if you halfran half of the pcs banks so if you halfrun half the ris in bank the pc will sooner or later feel queasy the monitoring consideration is that you should audit what you have your hands on dont run r3 on pc audit the pc with r3 that goes for every auditing skill we have i never sec check pc i audit the pc with sec checking i dont find goals on pc i audit pc with goals finding if you keep that frame of reference you will win all the way with routine 3 it is almost possible to audit the pc with scarcely somatic if you use everything you are doing at the moment you are doing it to clear the pc of what you have your hands on it will go something like this the first ri takes 2 12 hours the next thirty ris take half an hour apiece the next thirty ris take twenty minutes apiece the next thirty take fifteen minutes apiece the next bank takes you 45 minutes to get your first rl half an hour each for the next halfdozen fifteen minutes each for the next thirty etc etc this happens because you are building on gradient scale the thetans confidence and leaving nothing behind you to worry about this state of affairs is attainable if you follow some rules say you have spent two sessions trying to get the top oppterm to fire youve still got the whole bottom of the gpm and various points to cut in where the pc can get rocket reads by auditing the lower parts of the gpm you could unburden the case and then progress forward you should be aware that you can always go down in bank matter how hard you try to list upward your first interest is to get charge off if you get charge off the pc can confront more now he can find that missing top oppterm youve got countless locks which will fire when you first enter bank any part of the goal anything will fire because you are looking at the whole mass and it is so crosscharged that anything will fire that makes the top oppterm the hardest to find after you have taken some charge off all these weird combinations dont fire the more bank the more things will fire and the more restimulated the pc will be in life details on directive listing procedure some pcs will have to be taught the language if they dont understand the words in the pattern eventually they will get the words 6305c16 shspec265 the time track some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 15may63 the time track and engram rum ing by chains bulletin i and hcob 8jun63 bulletin ii handling the time track one basic tenet has never changed you have never successfully audited anything but the time

continuous record of time of the individual from the first moment he began to experience on through until now an interrupted threed fiftytwo perception movie things happen 297to that movie it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons eg his inability to confront the fact that it can get grouped etc all that auditing ever does is to straighten out the time track make it available and asis it the track gets collapsed and looped by chains which consist of related incidents until you get solid wad of experience which is unavailable to the pc and thus has command value over him there are only two classes of things involved in the time track 1 the mechanical things the matter energy space and time that is the time track 2 the significance of it people who cant confront the track at all eg psychologists and psychiatrists conceive it to consist of thought only the time track is not imaginary and shouldnt be treated as imaginary it has mass in the physical universe brick wall is the product of various people and forces where it all come from neednt be investigated for practical purposes the time track has remained undiscovered and undescribed by mental health practitioners because they have lacked the confront to get past certain mechanisms that make it unavailable nothing is holy to scientologist there is nothing that should not be investigated nothing is unavailable although psychiatrists think so they dont know that the time track is real they have fallen for the first trick that the time track employs to make itself unavailable the idea that there is nothing in the mind but thought that is trick of debarment the consideration is anybody who says that he is looking at brick building in the mind isnt looking as brick building and it must therefore be imaginary so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion so therefore he must be slightly mad insane people must be mad because they are seeing things says the psychiatrist then he compounds the insanity by saying you are not seeing these things he makes the time track less available the direction of sanity lies in the capability of confronting the time track and the pt environment for any individual existence consists of the physical universe pt and everything that is in it at this exact precise pt instant and the time track which consists of everything that has been and that is the total isness as far as this thing called reality is concerned archeology studies suppositional reality but it is not outlawed for that reason you can take some ruin and say what has it been but that is not the isness it is suppositional reality subject to error however archeology is not outlawed as science for that reason furthermore all futures are suppositional if they are suppositional enough they come true lrh used to tell fortunes by looking at persons facsimiles and mocking something up the future is always enforceable with altitude and authority this is just trick method of making postulate stick it is still suppositional reality there is isness and there is suppositional isness the time track often gives people the feeling that the was can return it can be quite solid when there is extra awareness jammed into particular moment you also have to look at borderline phenomenon creating someone says he will build building and he does his saying he will nearly puts it there but creation is suppositional reality until it is actually created at which point it becomes an isness and remains an isness for whatever period of time it endures part of the thought of reality is the adjudication of whether it is good bad or whatever thought is not separate from reality it is woven solidly into reality and is part of the isness of reality one can establish the isness of reality at time by asking about it some people cant even confront that here lrh recounts an anecdote about the cia or the police following students and pcs around for weeks as they ran union station an outdoor objective process command was you invent way of destroying that indicated person see hcob 6feb58 hgc clear procedure outline of february 6 the process was done to take over destructive automaticities they were trying to find out what the scientologists were doing without ever taking the trouble to ask it never occurred to them to establish an isness they couldnt even view the thought in the isness this is even worse than only being able to view the thought in the isness so there is descending gradient of ability to confront an isness 1 able to confront or view an isness 2 able to confront or view only the thought in an isness 2983 unable to confront or view the thought in an isness or even to ask about it opinions are there are thoughts and opinions abroad in the world that we may not agree with but which are part of the isness wrought iron fence is thought woven into the physical universe as to some degree is all else when someone creates something in the physical universe part of its isness is the expression of his thought thought is expressed by the formation of the mest so thought is to some degree part of the physical universe likewise the time track is composed of matter energy space time and thought so both the physical universe and the time track are composed of mest and thought added onto these are many complexities such as suppositional isnesses befores and afters purposes and aesthetics the degree that an individual is on suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingness how much suppositional isness is added to actual isness critic says the artist should have the should have measures the amount of nonconfront the critic is doing this is also true of pcs who typically say well it looks as if there might have been there could possibly have been wreck of some kind here at one time or another maybe i think it was an airplane it turns out that it was building the pc is very suppositional he doesnt give the isness of it someone who criticizes anything is doing supposition about how something should be they are not confronting the isness the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of isness confronted by the pc and that is how sane and capable he gets it is measured directly by the amount of isness the individual is able to confront in view of the fact that he pcs track is in terrible condition there are two factors at work 1 the pcs own feelings of incompetence 2 the unrecognizableness of the track these combine to give you cats breakfast an extreme form of this problem is seen in the pc who supposes all sorts of horrible things who thinks it is so uncomfortable that he doesnt even show up for session thetans state is not really pinned mechanically by anything he is not made less of thetan or more by mest but when you surround him as intimately as the time track does with tremendous amount of suppositional unconfrontability he is enforced into state of low morale where he doesnt think that he can do anything and the isness then is that he cant the pc supposes that the time track is not confrontable that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it that he wont be able to handle it etc all the time hes supposing hes not confronting he knows what will happen he has had all these unconfrontable experiences and his attention is still fixed on something and he knows he mustnt take his attention off of it he also knows that if he doesnt take his attention off of it he will go to pieces then he has forgotten that he has his attention on it he feels degraded by all this in addition the state of his track is horrible it is scrambled shredded snarled up the thetan in the middle of it all is convinced that if he moves or looks at any of it something horrible will happen all of it has command value over him yet at the same time it is valuable to him it has become his havingness its all the old tin cans hes got its all his knowingness hes like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed he cant even find out his own name rank and serial number without it that dependency and the why of it is also in the record department the great savants who have remained ignorant of the time track have just q and ad with its unconsciousness by remaining unconscious of it and unwilling to approach its pain the time track is unavailable to the being so the savant supposes that it is unavailable to him but the auditor mustnt do this q and the only real tragedy of life i suppose is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unobtainable the fact that thetan cant remember at first what happened in an engram doesnt mean that he was unconscious at the time if absolute unconsciousness and unknowingness were possible we would probably be all right dont underestimate the violence that is there on the time track and dont force the pc into it but if you get the earliest moment of the earliest gpm it runs like hot butter even though theres as much 299charge on it as there is on later one the difficulty you hit with the later one is that it has the charge of all the earlier ones in addition to its own so it is far harder for the pc to confront it is important not to give the pc loses early on you should know the mechanics of engrams and the time track be sure your commands mean what you intend them to mean through the incident does not mean through the incident to the end and if you just say move to the end the pc wont go through the incident the bank follows the you think you are there so you are there mechanism of the thetan so the difference between to and through is very important use to in scouting and through in running engrams and dont mix them up lrh found that some pcs cant run gpms until they have run an early engram also if you can run the overt engram that relates to these gpms as an engram fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves and they will run like hot butter here is datum that particular implanting outfit was located down towards the center of this galaxy and was founded 52863010 654079 years ago it was destroyed 38932690862933 years ago by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet it was wildcat activity they used to drag magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy let them follow lines of force and come over system and then send planes in with speakers the place would be caved in for thousands of years as result of radioactive clouds you are not likely to find any implant earlier then or even near 52 trillion years ago or closer to pt than 359 trillion years ago any other kind of implant is different kind or dramatization of it someplace else the helatrobus implanter had the dream of everyone in the universe being good they used the ice cube see history of man pp 645 this is the implant that really keyed in the time track 6305c23 shspec268 state of ot there isnt government on earth that has the right to permit our survival as an organization cognition the only reason you have present time problem is that you dont have enough time the helatrobus implants you can call them the heaven implants had big effect on thetans with their cold energy or frozen energy the helatrobus government had gold crosses on their aircraft one could find out who they were they couldnt find out who was behind and actually doing the implanting the implants were based on cold energy with significance placed in it the implants tended to talk the helatrobites had figured out something that looked to everyone else like natural phenomenon the magellanic radioactive clouds with which they surrounded planetary systems the stars in galaxy tend to be collected towards the center of the galactic wheel when you look at the milky way you are looking towards the center of this galaxy in the opposite direction you see other galaxies we are awfully far out from the center of this galaxy our sun is rim star galaxies are condensations of radioactive clouds into suns and planets planets sometimes shatter to become belt of asteroids suns range from dead suns to red yellow white and blue suns as they get hotter and brighter bodies could exist that are suited for conditions on other planets some science fiction writers have very good memories but have fallen victim to the implants that reverse time such that the past equals the future the boogie man is standard mechanism for keeping people from going places and looking at things confronting for instance the phoenicians spread seamonster rumors to prevent competition with england in the tin trade scare stories about terrible beings are quite standard they are used to keep people out of things that others want to keep hidden most planets run by animal forms have classifiable types of forms similar from system to system depending on the environment someone built for jupitertype conditions would look perhaps eskimoish you could become very disheartened and caved in about this universe and see it as trap until you recognize that the thetan is helped all the time by mest it gives him location consecutive scenery and persistent structure of matter this universe has solved lot of problems for the thetan when he gets too far down on the tone scale therefore he gets on stuck oneway help flow with respect to the physical universe the thetan doesnt help the universe you could run him on how could you help the physical universe and he would feel better about it 300degraded beings come to the conclusion because of the above situation that the trouble with this universe is that it has free beings in it they feel that the universe is too good for free beings so every now and then someone decides to make it evil if thetan is that degraded what he sees as wrong with the physical universe is that it has free beings in it so he tries to make them unfree the origin of the physical universe in the first place is probably collision of home universes the problem of why everybody stays in single present time was one of the more fantastic problems the why is response to vibration there is one underlying vibration that the universe your bank and you are vibrating at the only variation in that vibration relates to the progression of time therefore you can move someone on the time track one overwhelmed others with vibration very minute vibration the size of the vibration of light particle the time track is formed by an involuntary intention in studying the power of an operating thetan lrh has had pauses in thinking although intellectually such power is conceivable recently lrh has been exploring the actual potentialities of an ot the problem of an ot may be analogous to the problem that one encounters if one tries to pick up the cellophane wrapper from pack of cigarettes without denting it at all you could only do this if you could estimate or measure the exact force necessary to pick it up without denting it this is probably the basic problem of an ot and it may give him his time track the power of thetan is such that if he were to pick up steel cylinder capable of resisting pressure of several thousand pounds per square inch it would be like you with the cellophane wrapper the problem is how to touch something without crushing it the thetan is being careful in handling mest he seeks another method of handling he feels that he is quite destructive people who have lost their ot abilities and strength will try and did try on the time track to convince free thetans that they were dangerous people who havent that level of action would believe that free thetan was destructive and would trap him with the idea by causing him to use new trick doing things by intention instead of directly we have always thought of intention as primary but it is secondary the postulate and action through postulates is secondary to action through energy you should be able to do both but it is more natural for thetan to just pick something up than to pick it up by an intention or postulate that it be up it is great downgrade intention is unnatural it would be natural to just move things however this is hard to do if the thetan is afraid that he will destroy the thing in the process instead he develops the safer method of operation by intention alone he can do this but it enforces great restraint on him it is like putting yourself on terrific withhold of self the thetan trains intention to become involuntary it is not imaginary it is like involuntary nerves or muscles that work automatically mest is fragile recently in new york or melbourne when they started running the goal to forget in coaudit the emeter got fused the pc melted the lines some involuntary intention was triggered in him and zap unless you understand this as too great power within the ethical limits of the individual you wont understand the problems of an ot thetan is stronger than the fragility with which he is surrounded and he compensates by reducing his power this was the wrong solution he developed an automatic action eg the phone rings he doesnt touch it it springs into the air and he talks the postulate does things without his having to intend them there is difference between an involuntary intention to act and an involuntary intention to duplicate and an involuntary intention to create and thats where the time track comes from this is an hypothesis to account for the time track then someone gives the thetan things for the automatic machinery to mock up which would be bad for the thetan or someone jams the machinery and makes the thetan fight his own automatic intention the next thing you know he has messedup time track he goes solid he picks up meat body the withhold begins with the steel cellophane rational solution would have been not to make everything so damned fragile withholding all the time has all sorts of ill effects including putting engrams on your track these matters have lot to do with scientology organizations seeing the character of an ot we see that these matters could be upsetting in various directions we have some responsibilities to start things out right if we are going to make ots early on conceiving that free thetans were very dangerous and should be shot down people like the helatrobites started laying in implants and weakening people working with great industry before 301these implants planets were suddenly surrounded with radioactive cloud masses from the center of the galaxy waves of black and grey clouds would sweep over the planet engulfing it in radioactivity the dark horse nebula in orion is one huge radioactive cloud like this this could go on for million years universes have lines of force vectors like spokes which were used by the helatrobus group to move magellanic clouds they just set them loose one found out that it was being done by someone it was all explained as natural phenomenon because of these theories one thought to look for anyone doing it at least hundred years after system had been engulfed helatrobus would send capturing troops in ships with little orangecolored electronic bombs that would talk speech was frozen into electronic capsules the clouds would talk hark hark look out etc it sounded like fun house its unbelievability made detection of its origin all but impossible it confused the thetans all to hell for some reason the symbol of airplanes goes through this this symbol goes earlier to implants at 80 trillion years ago where aircraft symbolized needing machine to get you off planet so for some years after years of radioactivity the clouds were there with speech in them containing contradictory commands like come here cant come go mustnt go it was doubletalk the helatrobites put traction beams on thetans eventually after many incidents of resisting it the thetan got sucked up into small capsules via bubbles and thence into spaceships all of this assaulted his credulity he couldnt understand what was going on this had never happened before then in one to six months the helatrobites would get him into an implant area fix him on post wobbled him around ran him through an implant of goals on little monowheel pole trap with the effigy of body on it he had body at that time eventually he would get home then he would get picked up again and put through more series of implants probably the helatrobites knew who had been implanted already because we find implants in pairs of two and four never three or one once this started the planet would be in turmoil and revolt and things got very insane the heaven implants then were preceded by tremendous periods of unrest with radioactive clouds orange bombs warfare wild anarchy etc it was chaos rather like twentieth century earth it was hitler like stuff it got more and more crazy and out of control they were very worried thetans before the clouds came there would be occasional thetatrapping etc but things were generally pretty peaceful it was only when the free thetans were threatened that they became restive and ungovernable free thetans in themselves are easy to put up with in pi radioactive fallout is key restimulator of this whole scene but how does partlyfreed thetan feel when he sees the old situation seeming to repeat itself with all the symbols from the track it makes him mad at fallout government wars etc earth is in for period of chaos which scientology can render less extreme than it would otherwise be but we cant entirely eliminate the chaos since some earlier chaos will be restimulated but the planet is doomed if we dont operate lrhs attention is therefore on organizational concerns how do we move through such period the scientology organization is set up to handle this period of chaos as long as thetans have rage in their hearts about the situation their power is curtailed this is safety factor if we just let chaos happen we will slow our forward progress sooner or later there will be the rest of the galaxy to deal with earth has already blasted off into meatbody space opera which may not be appreciated by someone out there earth people get hysterical when they think that there is an invasion from space so it represents real threat not something people think is unreal or impossible orson wells radio broadcast of the war of the worlds resulted in ecuador in the radio station that broadcast it being torn down by enraged ecuadorians they knew about space opera even though they didnt have science fiction to educate them with things as they are several factors confront us if we handle things as they are we may be able to have things as we would like to have them 6305c25 shspec269 handling arc breaks some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 27may63 cause of arc breaks 302lrh has discovered the common denominator to all arc breaks bypassed charge an arc break is defined as the pcs transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor charge that has been restimulated in session may provide background booster for session upset when you drag the pcs attention to the auditor the charge that has been deliberately restimulated in the session doesnt get asised and the pc arc breaks thus something that outside the session could not cause an arc break may and will cause an arc break if it happens in session the arc break is not caused by social faux pas it is caused by the sudden shift of attention the unleashing of charge that was held back by the fact that the pcs attention was on it as long as the pc has his attention on the bank he is cause over its charge the moment his attention is flicked off of it he is the effect of that charge and the pc then dramatizes it any tone level or knowtomystery scale level that is higher than the chronic tone of the pc being higher than the pc is cause over the pc and is therefore dramatized it should be noted that apathy is high tone for pc the tone level contained in the incident is what the pc unintentionally dramatizes he could dramatize anything eg boredom effort eg breaking chair or manic and the auditor is good target the pc himself is helpless to restrain himself from dramatizing he will be surprised at himself amazed to react that way etc an arc break comes about whenever charge is bypassed that then puts the pc at its effect point the pc dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed this charge is unknown to him and can therefore affect him adversely the remedy is to locate and indicate the exact bypassed charge at which point the arc break ceases that is the mechanics of it you dont have to go into do and run the arc break and run all engrams connected with it etc you only have to indicate bypassed charge the remedy is not continuous auditing you know now how to turn off someones anger by saying that someone missed his withholds that often works but when it doesnt it is because you indicated the wrong bypassed charge you could assess number of possibilities eg missed gpm missed goal missed ri he will stop being arc broken when you get the right one in session only few charges can be missed goals ris engrams refutation of reality rejection of affinity more basic incident failure to acknowledge that pretty well covers it these things occur in life also rage is an automaticity in such delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip neurosis is actually hard to maintain that explains the simple effectiveness of correctly locating and indicating bypassed charge the psychiatrists failure comes about from two sources 1 lack of technology 2 an interest in insanitys being very hard to solve arc breaks are not hard to handle if you know the cause and handling of them dont back off or fear them just develop the skill to find and indicate the right bpc or you will get loses in auditing and eventually give up temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor 0r just get out of the auditing chair so i want you to get confidence that you can find the bpc and then by indicating it to the pc realize the tool that is in your power that pc arc breaks is guarantee that the pc is in poor case shape or difficult to get gains on just indicating the correct bpc turns off the arc break you may find that the charge was bypassed two sessions ago or the arc break doesnt get handled because you cant find what it was until somewhat later then when you indicate it the pc calms down but you shouldnt let an arc break last more than two or three minutes because arc breaks multiply on steep curve governments these days are run by riot because they are so scared of arc breaks englands matter offact handling of the ban the bomb movement is an exception to this rule like an auditor who doesnt get thrown by or governed by arc breaks governments have also been run by fear of assassination this is just dramatization of the helatrobus implants you as an auditor could be governed by arc breaks if you cant handle them you are never governed by that which you can handle with ease so learn to handle arc breaks until arc breaks become just another phenomenon like runny nose your attitude on arc breaks must never be one whereby you are driven by the arc break because you will be driven then into not getting the items clean into taking the pcs 303orders which are the direct result of dramatizations the orders are the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of the bpc dont for instance as registrar get reasonable in the face of dramatization hunt and peck around for bypassed charge the rage is an automaticity psychosis is very tenuous and easy to break number of arc breaks is not correlated with the success of auditing arc breaks multiply as the square of time the greater the facility with which you handle arc breaks the less you are governed by them pcs who are continually arc broken in session can be run on the threeway arc break process this process however is not for use every time the pc arc breaks for instance for an auditor messed up with arc breaky pcs you could run the following in auditing what attitude has been refused in auditing what reality has been rejected in auditing what communication has not been acknowledged this works better than midruds it is the successor to arc break straightwire which in 1958 could go into engrams and even implants it works because what it does is directly to locate and indicate bpc if you let the arc broken pc control you you will be taking his orders because he is dramatizing not only the emotion but also the significance contained in the bpc this is dangerous to the pc so you should 1 learn to handle arc breaks 2 be good enough as an auditor never to bypass charge you can bypass charge by not finding any you press on with the session in the teeth of pc who is dramatizing apathy then the pc gives you wrong goal and you take it thereby bypassing more charge the harder you are driven by arc breaks into doing bad job the more charge you bypass it wont run well bypassed charge is always prior to the charge on what you are doing so the arc break is blessing in disguise since it tells you that there is more charge which you have bypassed it is more accurate than the meter in this case arc breaks are cumulative in their effects you do still have to peel enough charge from later incidents to get to the earlier ones but the pc wont arc break if you indicate to the pc as an rfactor what you are doing if you tell the pc that there is basic on the chain he wont arc break even if you dont run the basic because you have indicated the earlier charge indicating that there is earlier charge also makes it possible for the pc to run the later stuff the pc can arc break in the rudiments because he has outruds in the incident that is just bpc and you can indicate it so when you chicken out of cleaning an rl because the pc is protesty and arc broken you have set yourself up for more arc breaks on subsequent items dont buy an ri that doesnt rocket read full dial if it wont there is bpc to clean up bypass the charge keep it secret you will get an arc break dont bypass charge 6305c29 shspec270 programming cases part 1 the subject of programming cases is almost as old as the discovery of the engram programming is the overall action taken to resolve the case regulated by the state of the case and the necessary steps if guy stubs his toe and you decide to give him an assist that is programming the assist is auditing the two are not the same these are the things to be adjudicated in programming 3041 time how much is available 2 what will the case accept stand for or tolerate as auditing 3 what will the case progress on as auditing 4 order of actions this comes back to time 1 5 when you will start auditing you cant leave out any of these adjudications you need good grip on programming before you can actually make clears even if you have technique that works on everybody because programming is easy to do lrh has never put it out as itself so it has been missed as factor in getting all cases to run well programming is easy unless you dont do it programming is based on some fundamental principles it is based on 1 the behavior of the time track 2 the abilities and disabilities of the pc related to the time track the time track is the worlds longest movie in 3d included in the movie are things which apparently destroy some of the movie so between say reel 16 and reel 80 everything is missing with improper programming you will never find that section and you can audit reel 80 and reel 16 and everything beyond reel 80 and though the pc gets lots of auditing nothing happens to his case because what is wrong with him is what is between reel 16 and reel 80 this film has total effect on the pc he lives it as you run it you can only be effective if you run the parts that are personal to the pc that is running the reality of the pc there are things you can run that are unreal to him but that nevertheless affect him eg the helatrobus implant but dont exceed the pcs reality by too much the program is not monitored by what the pc has reality on before you audit him it is monitored by what the pc can obtain reality on during auditing after all you want to increase his reality dont omit pc change and volition in your calculations and remember his reality might exceed yours if you dont try to increase the pcs reality you neglect his capacity to change it does the pc good to audit him farther than where he is at yesterdays mental sciences made this mistake continually they treated patients only from and on the viewpoint of their own reality then denied the patients capacity to change programming is based 100 on the following 1 the capability of the auditor 2 the capability of the pc to receive auditing 3 the amount of time available 4 the maximum result to be obtained given these limits in terms of increase of r c the increase in affinity can be seen in the persons change in position on the knowtomystery scale of which the tone scale is the middle guts person has personal reality except for possible intellectual reality on those tones that lie above his position on this scale he only has reality on those tones that lie below his chronic tone his chronic tone can be the tone of the body plus thetan or chronic tone as thetan the body plus thetan tone can be considerably higher than his tone as thetan the chronic tone of the body plus thetan combination can be at 40 while the level of the thetan is at unconscious any level above the chronic tone is susceptible of being dramatized dramatization is thetan or thetan plus body performing evolutions not under the thetan or thetan plus bodys control nonvolitional actions old mental studies fixated on these and believed that there is nothing else but there are volitional actions they lie below the chronic tone of the individual on the tone scale 305there are two chronic tones that of the thetan and that of the thetan plus body combination the body plus thetan can dramatize any tone above the chronic tone but most likely it will be the half tone above the chronic tone the above is of arc therefore increasing affinity is making the pc less susceptible to dramatization and gives the pc reality on more tones that are now below him you have added levels on which he has reality and subtracted levels which he may dramatize previously as certain tone was above him he was the effect of it now being above that tone he has reality on it and he is longer the effect of it the body plus thetan tone is an apparent tone and it never goes above 40 so you could have pc flying along at 40 enthusiastic and the next day you will get the thetan alone and he drops from 40 to zilch he has come up to degradation as thetan he feels awful for apparent reason because you are now seeing the thetan who has come up above unconsciousness to degradation as thetan for the first time this is case gain in terms of affinity to go somewhere by route one you have to get the thetans chronic tone level upscale enough to do it reality you can measure persons reality by measuring significance since reality is matter energy space time and significance the five parts of universe psychological testing measures reality on significances you can test reality by solution of problems if persons conversation is full of cant understand and he gets very reasonable about unreasonable things and he can assume viewpoint but his own while he doesnt really have one his reality level is low he may demonstrate this by the fact that as the pc comes to others viewpoints he begins to recognize his own overts and to suffer on that account that is big reality increase and occurs because understanding more and being more able to take other viewpoints the pc becomes more responsible he cognites cognition is actually the process of changing reality of significance it is necessary to case gain cognition more understanding case gain pc saying that the session was wonderful has not necessarily had any case gain he may have been beaten into propitiation but if he says you know my mom must have had quite hard time that is cognition if the pc is able to assume new viewpoint in this case that of his mother he has had case gain getting the pcs goals and gains at the end of the session is little psychometric test measure of case gain communication there is obvious gain when the pc is more willing to talk to people but his increased perception of walls etc isnt really changed reality so much as it is increased communication reach and withdraw willingness to receive etc is what is involved here even if the case is delusory and sees the room as full of polar bears it would be case gain at the end of the session if he could see the polar bears better if you are operating from the platform of the reality that the room is not full of polar bears and that you must therefore get rid of the polar bears you will have dropped the pcs communication this was one of freuds errors he cant communicate with you but he can communicate with these polar bears if he could communicate with the polar bears well enough he wouldnt have to communicate with them and they would depart thats the way to get rid of polar bears psychiatrists try to convince the patient that he doesnt have any bugs crawling on him this is the same as saying there must only be this one reality and unless we can hold the status quo of this reality we have lost this has been the criterion in all mental activities for the many trillenia and an auditor may be holding onto it with both fists and not realize it this consideration is that our only gain would be from the platform of where we are if we could continue the alteration to making things more like they are here and now we we would get case gain this consideration is way to clobber people by holding them on the time track these are the technical data underlying programming auditing is done by 1 unburdening basics 2 discovering what basics there are 3 disentangling them so as to erase basics this includes cchs it includes all processing discovery of basics end eradication of basics is done by discovering what basics can be found before the basic that disentangles the basic that you are trying to untangle basic will almost blow by inspection unless there is more basic one holding it in 306however basic on chain contains elements that are not basic to the basic say you have the basic on the chain of some somatic it is basic on the chain you are running but it has something in it that comes from more basic chain on another subject when this happens you can slip the basic out from under the earlier basics by finding the basics of remaining elements in the basic of the original chain frequently this can be done by dating by the time you are through you have practically cleared somebody if you can keep track of what you are doing you will be very successful if not the whole track collapses and the pc goes under the first action you should undertake on case is the most advanced action that can be undertaken in your estimation always enter case more boldly than you think is wise and you will usually be right if you dont you will never find the ceiling at which the pc can operate if you get away with it you are all set you have saved time that is what you are doing with the helatrobus implants if the pc cant manage it pull back so all there is to auditing is unburdening finding chain finding the basic on the chain and taking apart the basic i dont care what process you are using running chain back is unburdening it its taking off charge so that you can lay your paws on basic you are after the first gpm and if the pc cant recall what he had for breakfast this morning you have to unburden the case how long should you continue unburdening the case until you can get your hands on an implant not one second longer that you run the charge off of at least one dialwide disintegrating rocket read per item if and when you get stuck you probably have too early an implant one that is too close to basic remember you are trying to unburden pick up the last incident in the second chain if you know what it is and run that one with fast pass or lets use straightwire to give him some locks or find overts on this lets see if we can chase him earlier and find the first it is all unburdening you see lets run the threecommand process for awhile we are just trying to get our hands on an implant so we can run some charge off of it and find an earlier implant so that we can get to the basic implant you have to go later and unburden the basic implant because you are asking the pc to walk through wall of fire between pt and basic there is wall of fire you cant push the pc through the wall of fire you have to get him through to get the pc through it you have to put some fire out on gradient that is done by programming 6305c30 shspec271 programming cases part ii some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 8jun63 the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track in particular p3 of this bulletin contains scale of case states that is relevant to this tape there is gradient scale of cases it is not complete there are interim points that are not shown on this scale the lowest level on the scale level 8 is that of total unconsciousness the next one up level 7 is awareness of own evaluations this is where the mental sciences are at psychiatrist listens to someone chatter and becomes aware of his own evaluation of the person as crazy what he perceives is his own evaluation of what he perceives or of what is there to be perceived its an incapability of observation because its an observation of own evaluation you see it most flagrantly in the fields of arts and aesthetics the less that is known of subject the more it has authority or evaluation as its sole reality or adjudication this is where most antiscientology wogs lie i had an uncle who said you shouldnt mess with the mind that uncle is perceiving not scientology but his evaluation or anothers evaluation of it the next level up level 6 is dubin of dubin here person has dubin of his own nightmares that is all he sees it is someone forming his opinion on newspaper articles actually that is dubin the readers of dubin the reporters of dubin the sources this level is below but approaching unconsciousness as thetan manifestation the body plus thetan can go lower scale than thetan whose unconsciousness lies just above this level of dubin of dubin body plus thetan can apparently stay conscious longer than the thetan can as far as awareness of being thetan is concerned lot of boiloff occurs above level 6 level 5 is dubin of the time track the facsimile does exist but what the person or pc sees is dub in of the facsimile that is there second facsimile 307above this at level 4 is nonperception where the pc gets blackness invisibility small rockets etc it is nonvisibility what used to be called the black v is at this level above this at level 3 is spotty partialperceptic glimpses of the time track with only some visio sonic or tactile etc then at level 2 there is totally visible time track with interruptions there is blackness in this track unless the blackness was really there in an incident fifty or sixtygoal clear would be in this condition he could monitor the time track the way one monitors the physical environment above this at level 1 there is time track the lowest two levels are gross lower scale harmonics of level 1 the above is scale of perception of the time track it is what makes cases different auditing time estimates should be based on pcs location on this scale you could probably use the physical universe to test where pc is on this scale for instance you could have him look at wall with picture on it close his eyes and tell you what he gets the result will be about half tone or tone higher than where he really is eg if he cant see it what wall he is at level 4 above though actually he will tend towards level 5 in running track there is tendency to slip one level the only levels that are fairly serious are levels 7 and 8 because it is very hard to get into communication with those cases but establishing communication at one level moves the person up to the next level and so on up to the top ultimately dont expect this to be done swiftly and accurately however most of the cases that you will be dealing with will have invisibility and sporadic track if you consider the amount of auditing necessary to audit sporadic track case as one unit of time invisibility would take two units dubin of track would take four units of time etc ie the time required to get given auditing result doubles at each level as you go down the scale for instance if it took one hour to audit out one engram on pc with sporadic track it would take thirtytwo hours to audit out an engram in an unconscious case actually that is optimistic at both ends the case result that we are interested in is ot we already have the fait accompli of clearing so we are going beyond it any effort to get an ultimate result in processing leads to ot that upgrades the number of hours to ot to say 500 hours to ot for the sporadic track case insanity neurosis or ability to respond to communication play part in that scale of cases because those conditions are found only at one level of the scale the own evaluations level level 7 any objective test of case state that has human observer adjudicating pass or fail works out poorly where the observer is himself at case level 7 have you ever been flunked on tr1 by coach that couldnt coach the concepts of insanity or neurosis are contained as goals in the helatrobus implants therefore they cannot be used to evaluate state of case wisdom based on the helatrobus implants is nuts other goals from that implant include to die to be sick to move to escape to get it ie to get sickness etc etc almost any one of these goals has been the source of learned treatises dramatizing them to explain all of mans ills eg treatises on escapism the history of man contains references to few implants it remains valid though and the engrams described in it did exist they just got collected together during implants what causes different people to be at different positions on this scale it could be the length of time that they have spent in this universe this implies universe that accumulated from the successive collisions of home universes with it the mest universe picks up different home universes at different points on the track older thetans are in worse shape state of case then would be monitored by number of overts different statuses of thetans at the time of entry etc the why doesnt need to be known to solve the situation how these thetans came to be there in this universe can be stated easily charge this is quantitative matter you pump charge into case when the eighteen prepcheck buttons go out ie inval eval etc if there were thought involved you could probably shortcircuit it all but there is also thought which includes volition as the universe pumps charge into thetan he pumps it into other thetans and other things then he inhibits himself from doing so the result is overts and withholds the charge gets encysted as composite picture of the 308number of things done to the being held in place by the number of things done by the being this produces x amount of charge on the case that in the absence of auditing just keeps on growing the thetan gets lot more or little more in given lifetime but it is always additive that is what makes the universe trap if charge didnt keep accumulating the universe would be therapeutic instead of aberrative you can have an attitude about the charge too the attitude doesnt alter the charge but it can affect how you feel about it in view of the fact that an ot has fantastic power it is funny that charge would bother him until we figure out the basic overt of the thetan any overt thetan commits is also mixed up with the energy thetan is emitting all of his overts have particles connected with them so the only way to really get him is to hit him with particles because that is the path of his overts so most implants are mainly connected with particle flows of various types people therefore have different amounts of charge one person has quantity of charge another person has quantity b etc the more charge person has the more difficult it is to release it that is why it takes so much longer to get results on the unconscious case this depends to degree on whether the case condition is chronic ie lasting more than lifetime or acute temporary one lifetime or less eg the pc may be spastic now as an acute condition relating to his body the question is whether he is always going to be that way matter what body he picks up chronic if condition is chronic it will add lot of time to auditing you could put deaf man on meter and ask him whether he was deaf last lifetime and the one before that if he was you have deaf thetan on your hands not deaf body and it will take time to fix charge is what causes case to be the way it is just because thetan plus body is low on the state of case scale the thetan itself is not necessarily low on that scale environmental factors can also make someone look downscale when they are not lrh relates an anecdote of time when he audited girl who was acting very nutty and brought her through in short space of time you have to estimate this to program someones case what you are going to program is the persons case so you have to estimate the case to determine how to get the charge off the case case is programmed in relation to the amount of charge on the case that is what determines how you are going to take the charge off the case since auditing requires the cooperation of the being you have to estimate his cooperativeness his ability etc this does affect the ease of auditing and the speed of auditing sample program the case dubs in track charge can be run off we get dialwide rocket reads on helatrobus implants if the pc can run it run it it is dicey because the case can easily go to smithereens it is better to pull overts on this lifetime and run any stretch of track on which the pc has reality be very sure that the case has withholds from the auditor especially thislifetime ones muzzle the auditing dont force this pc run rocket reading implants as long as they run easily when things get difficult fall back swiftly to patching up roughedup track return to an arctype process if the going gets too rough on ris tunning ris is dangerous that would be very extreme and daring programming for this case it is quick but dicey the safe way is using straightwire havingness withholds etc an alternate approach is if you got goal run all the charge off the goal never look for earlier goals when you have found one dont try pushing the case to get all the charge off of an implant take case with sporadic track you can run it pretty hard you can move around on the track from one gpm to another without messing things up much this level of case level 3 could even stand leaving goals without running them he may arc break but you can do it the case can be pushed hard the invisibility case level 4 can be pushed bit but not as hard as the sporadic track case with the dubin case level 5 you need lots of track repair ow running havingness you must readily cut and run if implants get rough with the dubin of dubin case dont let him near implants this isnt common case level 6 use straightwire and arc break processes run the case lightly for wins every session you are running the case too steep if you are not getting session wins unless this case is aware of having regular wins in session the cases reality is not coming up 309the aware of own evaluations case level 7 is suited only for havingness and cchs room processes contacting pt processes this case cant detect an overt as such he has responsibility he will tell things to you but not as overts to get daring with this case run straightwire with the unconscious case level 8 establish communication animal processing is the same sort of thing establish comm get the animal to reach always be little optimistic in estimating where someone is on the scale then program to get as much charge off as you can with the pc winning how much charge is being gotten off is measured by the ta and needle action charge is important because its what restimulates when he tries to outflow and prevents his outflow its what educates him not to reach in getting off charge processing lets him reach and do total selfdeterminism is only possible at the highest level given above level 1 there there are automaticities time track charge on the case the result is unlimited reach 6306c11 shspec272 engram chain running i finally found out why you cant run engrams i found out youve been trying to run engrams and you never run engrams you run chains of engrams this is the way i ran engrams in 1949 this got crossed up with repetitive processing flatten the process became flatten the engram when it should have been flatten the chain you flatten the chain by getting the basic engrams never exist all by themselves there is always chain an engram is only part of chain of similar incidents which in turn is part of time track you are essentially running time track you never handle an engram all by itself because it is too closely related to the rest of the track to be treated that way if you are skilled auditor you can quickly pick up bpc when the pc arc breaks indicate it and have the arc break disappear until you can do this you will have rough sessions in engram running the bpc is always the earlier incident on the engram chain charge is able to make the pc feel worse or better depending on whether it gets restimulated and encysted or blows you can let the pc learn more by entering lot of engrams and not finding basic the result is that the pc knows more but feels worse because you havent erased basic on the chain running chain of engrams is not the same as finding out about lot of incidents every time you run an engram you open up valve into the next earlier engram letting its charge get restimulated and partially leak into the one you are running if you continue to run the later engram it gets sticky ta ceases and it gets solid and will eventually collapse on the pc the bpc from the earlier engram causes the pc to arc break moving back to the earlier one blows some of the charge charge always flows later from its source not earlier we can only find the earlier engram because the later one was run as we go back on the chain each incident seems to be the earliest incident when it is actually just the earliest available incident if two engrams or any two pictures collapse the cause is bpc and the pc will very shortly arc break the converse is also true if the pc has bpc and is arc breaky you have two pictures collapsed outofvalenceness thats over there is also problem of bpc if an earlier engram is tapped it will bleed charge into the one you are running the somatic will strengthen but this phenomenon wont cause outofvalenceness an outofvalenceness is caused by an earlier portion of the same engram that you are working on that hasnt been seen it is assisted by charge bleeding from an earlier incident you could even run dubin case and get him earlier than the dub in however it is safer to use straightwire or mest processes suppose you are running an engram where the pc hit his head and when the pc goes through the incident the part where he actually hits his head gets skipped this indicates that the engram is part of chain of hit head so we work our way back through earlier incidents as he gets back to basic he gets full perceptics when we get to basic we run it over and over and his somatic blows if we came back up through the chain you could send the pc through each engram on the chain and now he would get the somatic each time 310the only way to flatten an engram is to flatten chain of engrams chains of overts follow the same principle as was done in sec checking this involved the withhold system used in prepchecking old style see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill and pp 208209 above these also go much earlier than this life chains of overts include overt engrams it doesnt matter which you run because the overtmotivator sequence is an installed mechanism it is very old it is not as deeply laid in as obsessive create but it is equally implanted and engramic either overt chains or motivator chains can be run they rarely entwine sometimes the pc will jump chains from motivator to overt when that happens you should follow it down to the basic overt but you should then also pick up and complete the motivator chain running engrams is very simple here is how lrh would do it get crude date eg 89 trillion years ago get the pc to return to this incident ask him what he is looking at ask how long is this incident get the duration by meter get the pc to move on through the incident to the end there will be long pause the pc says i did ask him what it is all about the pc tells you ask for an earlier beginning get when it was send the pc to the earlier beginning then through the incident the pc goes through the incident and tells you about it pc has somatic lrh dates with the meter an earlier incident with the same somatic he sends the pc through that incident you go earlier date it etc if you dont complete the chain in one session and the pc doesnt get the picture run few commands of since the last time i audited you is there anything you were unwilling to duplicate run this to clean needle the picture will now be on dont harass the pc to find all the unknowns in the incident it is not necessary to do this when you have had rough session try since the day before that session occurred what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate alternate these commands if the pc cant run engrams it is because he is at the wrong place on the scale of case levels to be able to confront it even dubin case can run earlier than the dubin but it is dangerous engram running is important because you wont make ots without it all the fancy stuff was developed to handle cases that were too heavily charged to run real track the least common denominator of the case scale is noduplicate which is right in the middle of the communication formula the swan song of this universe is that that which you are unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic an arc break is an unwillingness to duplicate if you show students bad tvd they will flub the first five minutes of their next session because they were unwilling to duplicate the bad tvd and therefore it went on automatic in their next session this is what happens when you show bad example you could clean up earlier bad auditing by running since few days before the bad auditing what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate it will clean up resistance to duplication can be caved in one can become what one resists or the effect of what one resists persons ability to duplicate is what determines his ability to run engrams because the engram itself is duplication of the actual event the pc duplicates the event but if the picture he is running is an altered copy of the original it is dubin all engrams have some dubin in them and develop new material you can get some surprising changes one is particularly unwilling to duplicate dangerous things so one then gets lots of them the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obsessively duplicating everything the trouble with this strategy is that his duplication goes on total automatic some people have very heavy engrams indeed over which they have control these engrams are very inaccurate they stub their toe and have picture of being run over by truck that is all they run if anything since there are very incredible things on the track anyway such as the helatrobus implants it would be very inaccurate and dangerous to determine whether or not pc can run engrams by looking for factualness for instance basic on prenatals is an incident from the helatrobus implant in which the thetan on pole is tumbled through series of tubes all curled up one way to see if guy can run engrams is to try him out if it is go you can get out the arc triangle in hurry better test is simple duplication for instance you can call off series of numbers 3 6 2 9 7 to person and ask him what you said if the pc didnt duplicate you you can forget about running engrams or you can go by the chart of attitudes or any test of duplication but you shouldnt go by the material he runs you can use an arc process to improve someones reality all sorts of other processes will also do this the duplication process see p 414 below also works well cchs are effective when rightly 311used to show the pc that it is safe to duplicate if the case cannot run engrams and if you are running them correctly engram running is probably too steep gradient for the pc the reason these data on engrams is important is that the helatrobus implants are long chain of engrams each one with basic and they tend to bunch the whole track on some cases you can only run six gpms before the rocket read shuts off and at this point you have to start running engrams when do you go earlier whenever the pc recognizes that there is something earlier however he states it he may say so directly or he may say something that shows that he is looking for something earlier if the pc sees something earlier you go earlier never ignore this if you ignore the indication that an earlier incident is available the one you are running will get harder to run besides you risk an arc break charge is registered on the emeter by needle and ta motion you must get ta action or you are just restimulating the case without blowing anything there is absolute basic on engram chains when you get to basic on chain there may be portions of it that themselves have earlier basics go ahead and run those out too there is only one basic basic it contains those impulses which eventually became aberration there are two things you can do with dating 1 relieve charge 2 identify something if you do total dating it goes down to the second you get the exact number of years plus days minutes seconds ago get the date accurately and the incident gets placed right where it should be on the track thus relieving charge dating also contains identification you can use rough dates for this purpose eg 89 billion or 450 million as long as you dont have bunch of incidents close together in row blocking out an incident has these steps 1 get an approximate date 2 move the time track to that date 3 ask the pc what is there accept whatever he gives you in every case 4 find its duration fairly accurately if it is days get the number 5 move the pc through it not to the end 6 then establish what was there 7 move the pc to the beginning and send him through again dont vary the routine and dont q and with the pcs unknownness if the pc keeps saying im stuck forget about holders and denyers he has just gotten in over his head bail him out and revert to lighter processes always suspect that there is something bit earlier ask for it blocking it out is done by going through it once after that the pc may be expected to tell you if there is something earlier generally run the pc through the incident twice once through is plenty if it is gummy having to go through an incident more than twice is suspect dont try to keep getting more out of it it is ok to keep running an incident as long as we are getting motion on the meter but dont strain to get more perceptics out of the incident more will turn up as you go earlier you can keep running an engram as long as the pc is interested in it and finding out more but the instant he says there may be something earlier go earlier or you will stick him in the later incident if you dont go for earlier incidents you blunt the pcs ability to go earlier and stick him where he is but dont force him earlier if he is starting to bounce up to pt let him and run arc processes 312basic isnt generally the more powerful incident it is just the first incident it seems so unimportant to the pc yet later incidents built up on it bigger and bigger basic is the shorter lighter incident theoretically you could run back to basicbasic if you found and erased this the pc would then have pictures and track if pc seems to be trying to escape running engrams by going earlier he is over his head and needs more preparation if you get the pc fully interiorized into the engram say by putting his attention on large object in the incident he will get it all fully charged up in 3d this is not what you want you will never get him out of the universe that you are packing around him 6306c12 shspec273 arc straightwire arc straightwire is the oldest broadnature repetitive process it is possibly the first repetitive process the arc triangle was originated in july 1950 in elizabeth nj it was expanded in september or november of 1950 at the hubbard dianetic research foundation in angeles it was an important tool for understanding the mind it is best described in notes on the lectures see pp 9 16 the arc triangle is the most fundamental statement of significance although it also embraces mest when prime postulate impinges on mest it becomes involved with arc the mest can be in the physical universe or in the time track affinity is so much itself and so relative that we get into difficulties trying to interpret it in an auditing command affinity embraces everything from the knowtomystery scale it is feeling for or feeling with or lack of those it has connotations of feeling about it is not enough to say emotional response sympathy and empathy come into it it is very broad and new concept if you will substitute the knowtomystery scale for affinity and use the words emotion and misemotion pcs will respond to it the emotions scale being just part of the knowtomystery scale is included in affinity the word affinity is really inadequate to embrace the whole concept because the concept has not been expressed in any language how many words can be used in command to express the concept of affinity lots everything on the knowtomystery scale can be used including the whole tone scale we find the pc chronically situated at one of these levels and that is the level to which he will respond in processing reality could pertain to significance alone as in his reality is poor or to actual chunks of matter reality is normally considered to consist of considerations about something or someone on up to the more solid concepts of matter energy space and time in clearing this word you will have less trouble than in clearing affinity unless the pc is really in thought but if you bad to vary it you would have harder task on your hands you would have to specify which part of mest you meant or which consideration communication is anything that fits under the communication formula it involves cause effect duplication etc in clearing communication you could specify which type or kind you meant you could use various parts of the communication formula in the third c command of arc straightwire clearing commands doesnt just mean can the pc define the word it is matter of substituting words in the command so that the pcs level of reality is met by the command the question we should ask is which word communicates to the pc what we are trying to communicate to him r and c make understanding when combined this was worked out mathematically in the fall of 1950 they actually compute mathematically when the pc cognites he has reached point of arc expressed as new understanding you wont get cognition if you omit one of the legs of the arc triangle if you run only r and c and not you dont get cogs if you wish to raise any one point that is low you can and should work on the other two points that is terribly valuable datum that must be observed in any arc process any point that is overrun or more difficult will give you trouble unless you preserve the balance amongst the three one leg will ever flatten by itself it is the three that you are trying to flatten so flatten all three in flattening process you can run it to 3131 three equal comm lags 2 cognition leave the process right there dont ever overrun cog for instance dont put in the last midrud if the pc cognites on the nexttolast the arc processes unflatten easily so if you go past cognition the process will be unflat 3 ta motion runs out for arc processes this is the least reliable and the most desirable you can run by blowdown but you cant depend on ta motion to run out at the same time on each leg the way to flatten one leg is to give equal time to the other legs not to beat the slow one to death the first thing that arc straightwire was found to do was to break neurosis if it is going to have that effect it will work fairly fast the only difficult cases on the 1950 positive process are the ones who ground down to finite number of answers and gave those over and over without ever cogniting the reason for this is that their positive arc moments are quite few and they run out quickly they are pleasure moments and wont flatten you have to run the reverse side of it around 1958 lrh started running lot of reach and withdraw the way iq was being raised was to run what could you withhold on someone funny phenomenon or you could plunge people into an engram and run it half way that will also raise iq scores as person who needs mass to think gets more mass to think with the upsets you run into on case are not the cases pleasure moments they are times of separation and individuation the most fundamental forms of arc breaks are 1 times when the pc was knocked away from being part of things 2 times when the pc was forced to part of things that he wanted nothing to do with his power of choice to connect or disconnect was overthrown this gives an arc break he was there but didnt want to be there or he wanted to be there but couldnt be there an implant is the biggest kind of arc break you can run recall an arc break on someone and it will run him into implants into times when he was held in place where he didnt want to be and told things that he didnt want to hear fundamental overthrow of his power of choice the arc straightwire processes were revised to saw out pieces of implants in order to help handle the helatrobus implants lrh discovered that the big midruds see hcob 8mar63 use of the big middle rudiments or the 18button prepcheck mush an engram they mess it up spoiling the record the engram frays around the edges it turns into pure energy without giving the pc any memory of what happened in the incident this showed that if you were going to use big mid ruds and big prepchecks on pcs stuck in engrams you werent going to unstick them you need steam shovel not hand shovel thus the negative arc processes were invented negative arc processes do handle implants lrh also discovered that pc is operating on entanglements with the physical universe it is one thing to bail him out of this and another thing to get him to look at his considerations about being entangled its not what happens to person that is important it is his considerations about it that count people especially sociologists get caught up in the idea that the environment determines peoples states of mind this is the philosophy on which foreign aid is based power of choice is senior to this by miles it has to do intimately with r and c enforced r or or c will wreck the triangle but given the same environment and predicament two people can have quite different reactions the goodness or badness of the surroundings doesnt necessarily reflect in the happiness or unhappiness of the inhabitants this messes up social planning because the happiness of the individual involves his preferences and his considerations about his surroundings whether or not he has arc for them the pc has had all these preferences and considerations present with regard to all his circumstances all up and down the track that is an adequate statement of power of choice this raises the question of whether there is such thing as an ideal state or condition in scientology the possibility of such state exists as it has never existed before in the universe an ideal state is state that someone wanted to be in over which he had full power of choice the attainment of happiness for pc is parallel to attaining clear the two factors are 3141 the environmental conditions of the pc 2 the pcs r and c with regard to the matter energy space time and postulates of his condition this is channel that has remained fundamentally unknown to this universe these are born out of an interplay between the pcs postulates and the experiences he has netted we are still on an interactive basis between postulates and conditions of experience the persons power of choice is his affinity reality and communication with regard to set of circumstances existences or environments we should give this fact more attention in processing we needed process that could easily be ground out by the hour by any old auditor but which would give fantastic results arc straightwire approaches this ideal as process though it does require some skill and it can be done very wrong arc straightwire does give fantastic results although unfortunately it does not go the whole route because it doesnt actually handle the conditions of existence it only handles pcs attitudes reality and power of communication relative to these conditions but it handles enough to cut away lower levels of case especially levels 4 5 and 6 see p 402405 above for description of the eight levels of cases at level 7 its usefulness is doubtful at level 8 it is useless it brings cases upscale to where they have their own time track to run and are able to run it at that point power of choice is less our concern because the pc believes now that his power of choice is alterable and that he can do something about his conditions now he can handle the real stuff that has aberrated him sooner or later too one has to actually handle the conditions of existence auditors who dont understand arc straightwire can dream up all sorts of wrong ways to do it for instance they skimp on one leg because the pc has trouble with it although cases at level 3 can run the process commands in the order 1 2 3 1 2 3 you will get more ta with the order 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 that is the only way it will run on lower level cases so you might as well run it that way with equal time on each leg until flat or run an equal number of questions on each leg to get over the fact that the pc may have long comm lags on one leg you are after similar amount of run for each you depend on the other two legs to fix up the tougher one letting them get out of balance defeats the process how long you should spend on each leg depends on the pc and how long he takes to flatten something listen for cog to end off on the number of variations that there could be is great always try to get the pc to run the simplest most fundamental version the one that is closest to pure r and c the less you change the command the happier the pc will be since this produces the minimal change of process if you find the pc struggling with wording get it changed early if you are going to change it at all good question for affinity is what attitude has been rejected dont change the question too much settle down for the long run make sure the pc has question he can run another keynote of arc straightwire is that it is always run muzzled the auditors sole concern is understanding and acknowledging what the pc says it is true that sometimes the pc will arc break if you dont talk with him but dont q and or change from an unflat process only talk with the pc to avoid arc breaks and dont violate the auditors code if you run into trouble you can put big mid ruds in on the arc process this wont mush an engram it takes chunks out of parts of the engram chain it picks up parts of the engram chain that belong to other chains anyhow dont try to run arc straightwire as cyclic process cycling to pt on every leg he hasnt been in pt for trillenia you can get him to pt any time by giving him the command move to pt date theoretically he will only get to pt when the process is flat the process is flat when all ruds are in on the process and it produces departure from the pcs clear read on any leg you are not really after this flat point with the process you are only trying to get part of the charge off so that the pc can run engrams remember that can unmoving tone arm early on in the process is meaningless ta has to be run in before it is run out during the course of running this process the ta may well go up and stick on each leg your main concern is is the pc answering the auditing command does he understand it can we keep it balanced so that we can bring him through it you can ask the pc is there any question or command you havent answered 315the process can be prefixed with any combination of words eg in auditing on your job or in marriage this makes it more powerful than problems intensive especially if it is assessed against the problem areas of the persons life taking an area that reads well the helatrobus implants contain words like remember and think so you avoid these in auditing commands as much as possible rougher cases will be happy to run this there are cases that cannot recall or remember levels 7 and 8 they need reach withdraw and cchs you can use these principles in discussing whether or not they wish to be here whether they like you whether they wish to talk to you using the above prefixes you can run arc straightwire as pt 2wc process 6306c13 shspec274 levels of case here is where we are at technically we are developing dianometry to point where one can give series of tests and decide what you need to do with case there are six types of processes that are learnable and workable direct processing of postulates is not included although rising scale processes do sometimes work especially on level 1 cases the scale of case levels is invaluable and the six types of processes handle all levels the six processes are the only ones that raise case up the levels the only problem lies in how well they are known and how reliably they are executed we are working on how you can tell where pc is so you can tell what to use on him lacking this data you can just process the pc and go up or fall back to hit his level here are the case levels 1 ot track you can even go higher than level 1 for instance you can tell the thetan how to handle theta trap you can also teach him how to maintain game so he wont have to go downscale to have one what you can do with this level consists of education and practice only 2 this is theoretical state usually parts of the time track are missing and those parts that are there are under handling although the thetan at this case level is theoretically supposed to have total access to his time track with nothing aberrative on it the perfect time track is unobtainable it would fold up before it got there at this level we work to get the person over the idea that he has to have time track by handling engrams the thetan learns to block out facsimiles special process is used here 3 at this level the pc has partly visible time track that is however very aberrative he has lots of engrams but he can run them at this level you would use engram running by chains blocking that sort of thing out 4 this is an occluded case with black invisible andor spotted field lower levels can also have such fields so be careful at this level you can still run engrams if you have made sure that you are not actually dealing with level 7 or 8 you can run him on r3n r3n is strippeddown directive routine 3 which uses line plots it has to do with implant gpms r3n2 is an abbreviated form of r3n see 6305c14 shspec263 implant gpms and 6305c21 shspec266 the helatrobus implants 5 dubin case easy to restimulate this case should be run on arc break straightwire duplication what there are processes that produce change in the pc without necessarily giving change in case level processes can be powerful enough to overwhelm the pcs power of choice so you can change the case but the pc may not recognize it so his reality and confront havent improved that is what occurs when you run higherlevel process on lowerlevel case that is why it is idiocy just to cure someone of an illness he will just get sick again you have just worked directly against his hidden standard your real object is to advance the case up the reality scale so you had better use the process that corresponds to the pcs case or reality level you should see improvement both directly in terms of upgrade of case level attitude towards existence etc and indirectly by seeing ta motion if there is ta the pc is not improving with regard to his viewpoint of existence level of communication etc level 4 or 3 cases can also be run on arc break straightwire for repair or boost 3166 dubin of dubin this case is distinguished from level 5 by the degree of franticness and the terrible automaticity of the bank it is not common type of case but it is struggle to audit because the track wont hold still to be looked at nothing bites because of this constant motion of the time track the level 6 case longer has the power of stopping motion you could call this type of case the grouped automatic time track or the moving time track case you cant run straightwire on him because of the constant motion of the track such cases should be run on cchs repetitive processes work as do sec checks and to lesser degree prepchecks so does general ow done as an excuse for sec checks and prepchecks it is not done as strictly repetitive process the overts you get are very light and feathery that is ok the bottom rung on level 6 has passed beyond the ability to run bank 7 this case can only confront his own evaluations these cases can get enormously interested in cchs because that stuff is dangerous to them they cant run the bank it is not there to be run it is utterly unconfrontable 8 the unawareness case this case can only be run on reach and withdraw being virtually or actually unconscious if you have someone who is in coma take his hand and with commands have him touch the blanket touch the sheet etc the perpetual boiloff case needs reach and withdraw just like the guy in the coma reach and withdraw runs several levels above level 8 for instance it runs up to levels 5 and 6 but here on level 7 you must flatten cchs or you will leave the pc parked the pc at this level will run heavily on these processes you can run processes at levels higher than the case level for which they are primarily intended they dont do much damage if left unflat if the case level is several levels higher than that of the process but dont overestimate the case level and get loses the six types of processing are 1 reach and withdraw 2 cchs 3 sec check 4 repetitive processes 5 r3n implants 6 r3r route 1 could be added as way of handling level 7 case almost any case reacts to almost any of these processes but what you want to do is to improve the level of the case with economy of time there are certain processes that will do it fastest and host of others that dont fit the pcs case level the fastest process is the one that we are after for instance we just run enough r3n to clear off implants so that we can get at other parts of the track you can run someone on implants for long time but what you are after is unburdening the track enough so that you can run gpms there are more implants per unit time in the pt area ie the last 5000 years then there were earlier but the only really thorough workmanlike job that was done was in the helatrobus implant darwins theory of evolution came from one implant case level improves to the degree that charge is removed case level is determined by the amount of encysted and unreleased charge not by the inherent power of the thetan concerned different cases may have different tolerance of charge but the levels will still be determined by the amount of charge the auditors sole interest is to relieve charge in order to change case manifestations the index of charge off is amount of ta or dialwide rocket reads that start out like mad and turn into fall if you are running engrams without getting ta watch it you are just stirring up the bank and not discharging anything the pc will get unhappy with you just give the pc the rfactor that you are going to run more implants to get them out of the road so we can get this earlier material discharged let the ta run into the case on arc break straightwire this may take two sessions if necessary you can drop back to cchs and sec checking or even reach and withdraw 317it is better to start low and run high underestimate the pcs ability so as to avoid giving the pc loses and keep his confidence and hope factor up the variable is the ability of the case to rise up the scale of course the lower the case level the slower charge blows level 5 and 6 cases will get into rows about being underrun but when the case is being run in the direction of up the case will forgive you almost anything the lower the case the more they estimate their ability to be they dont feel confident enough to see their limits such people do take social pride in their case level there is statusseeking in auditing god forbid let ta motion be there instead and we will all have won 6306c18 shspec275 beingness the overtmotivator sequence is about trillion trillion trillion 1036 years old minus hundred thousand trillion it is long track but we have the process to take it apart the main difficulty with the time track and its use in auditing is that there are so many cases that cant confront time track or any part of it so you get loses trying to run engrams we have been accumulating processes that can bring someone upscale to where they can view the time track great number of processes have been accumulated and recently codified as we looked at the fundamental of what we are trying to do with case the ultimate procedure is rote engram running but not everybody could do it so the subject has had to be wrapped up in such way that it could be done by all current rote engram running is superior to and different from earlier engram running we are running engrams by chains to open up and smooth out the time track the only reason we are doing anything about engrams at all is that those are the parts of the time track that are least confrontable if you get rid of those stretches the pc has time track the worst part of the time track denies anyone the best part unless you get rid of the engrams you havent got any time track because the pc cant confront it this sets up innumerable problems the more heavily charged the track is the less the pc can confront it and there is point where the pc moves out of any confrontability of the engram and now there is nothing to confront at all this gives you the scale of cases ot to unaware awareness of the physical universe also diminishes as you go downscale if each case level were to be divided from the others it would be divided by layers of anaten anyone at level 8 would have to go through layers of anaten to get to level 7 awareness of own evaluations as one goes upscale the layers of anaten seem thinner and are thinner because the more aware one is the less one minds unawareness the lowest conscious level of unawareness would be catalepsy or amnesia but even man thinking that he has only lived once has lot of automatic unawareness of the time track when you throw into his lap the idea of having lived before you will get confrontation of his opinions about it eg what would that do to old age pensions and this will make him pretty groggy if you push him up the line his suppositional actions will occur in the absence of processing as he goes from level 7 to level 6 he will get wild ideas after going dopey he gets dubin of dubin lots of suppositional reality for instance he may think he is tutankhamen if you could get him to discuss it more intimately he would get pictures of pictures then as the pc reaches level 4 it all goes black the blackness or invisibleness are parts of real pictures the rest of the picture is just unconfrontable the blackness of level 4 is on the time track it is actually there on the time track it is nice dark safe part of the incident that actually happened run him through run him earlier and pictures can turn on at this point he gets very groggy in the incident as he reaches level 3 in this way he can see much more easily as level 2 moves into level 1 the time track disappears possibly because the time track itself is method of not confronting something he doesnt want to confront it and this overwhelms him to the point where without power of choice he makes picture of it and you have the involuntary picturetaking apparatus that is the time track one can however only be overwhelmed by that which one does not confront so the levels of cases scale is scale of confronting and we could mistakenly think that confronting would solve the time track while confronting does get results and is an interesting process it is not the common denominator of processes the common denominator of processes is duplicate the common denominator of reaction is confront the time track is duplication of an actual event and each one of the case levels is level of willingness to duplicate or unwillingness to duplicate so your 318breakdown from ot towards clear is an individual lack of desire to duplicate what he has to duplicate in order to be an ot leading to an overwhelming automaticity of making time track duplication goes hand in glove with the idea of beingness as we study beingness we will see this with great clarity to be or not to be is not the question in this universe you are going to be something whether you like it or not your power of choice on this matter longer exists you can notbe certain thing but only in order to be something else you can be or notbe certain thing but you will always be something the question is what to be so this is the problem one picks up as one enters this universe it doesnt matter if the universe is timeless because you entered it somewhere as you examine peoples time tracks you find that their tolerance of time is improving as you go back since time is the single source of aberration if your timetolerance improves as you go back on the track you must be getting into periods not only when the pc was less aberrated but also approaching the beginning of the time track an individuals time track is not infinite because 1 he entered the universe at some point 2 the earlier he gets on the time track the less it is constant continual and infinite thing the universe on the other hand continues at its own rate of vibration if the individuals time track were of infinite duration cases would be unresolvable getting back to the question of beingness once in this universe you cant absolutely notbe the question is what to be that is the only question in the universe that really bothers somebody you will drive kid up wall by asking him what do you want to be if you want him to be something and he knows it would be dangerous you have postulatecounterpostulate situation continuing problem of beingness theres dwindling spiral of beingness the moment one enters this universe there are fewer and fewer safe things to be you can aberrate someone by being after him to be something that is very dangerous you get problem with this the lesson of this universe is that everything you can be is too dangerous to be but there is nothing to do but be in this universe the universe has finite space that looks infinite the gains of r212 came from the fact that the pc was making lists of beingnesses and the fact that real ri is potential beingness anything you might want to be is either too dangerous or too discreditable states effort to dominate the individual is out of jealousy of beingness the press is dramatizing this by saying you mustnt be scientologist it is dangerous to be one so if you want guy to start sorting out his time track at almost any level where he is aware of it at all you could start him at once on question that would get him into some interesting categories time track is to duplicate or not to duplicate but any duplication winds up in beingness duplication and beingness are united or gradients of one another you will have cases that will not become ot until the beingness of ot is demonstrated to them to be not quite as dangerous as it has been all cases or all pcs have assigned to all upper states dangerous or discreditable beingness and the same to all lower states and to their own states impossibility to be well that is the state of any case if there is program for the security of this planet that we can push forward people become loathe to advance their states of case or do anything else they stay parked in an inertia because there is desirable future hope factor this is why hope is rudimentary therapy to some degree you would have to promise that an advanced state of case would not then bring about further problems complicated by the political or sociological problems on this planet if there is nothing that one can do with an advanced state of beingness it is doubtful that people will try to attain it so one needs future or else the problems one got into before as free thetan make one see point in case advance people will downgrade their own states if they feel uncomfortable lonely or unsafe up there planning and organization to resolve that problem alone would bring about case advance in the absence of such planning promise and organization you wont get as fast case advance if you advance any helatrobus goal lot of people will go on an automatic notis there are people who are on prevented beingness they make theta traps implants etc they can be tested for by offering them any beingness they will notis it for instance you say wise prime minister would be nice he says oh i dont know that would just give you more powerful government they would degrade any more advanced beingness or anything you wanted them to be they might even think that they were doing people favor 319we have the idea that if we dont have success with certain number of cases we havent got enough people to form any strata of civilization it is ok to say all right you are making an officer cadre the rest can be as they are that presupposes that there is future plan to take care of all this we have plan now for what to do with this planet fine now what about the boys from the next planet you inevitably progress into an organizational future so you have to solve the problem of beingness not only at the level of the individual case but also on out into the future through some organization that ensures some safe future an ot can straighten things out on the planet but unless you mock up plan to do so to solve the beingness problem more broadly you wont make any ots unless you plan to straighten things out few people will go through to ot because it has been so unsafe in the past the ot has had blind spot his own power was so great that he thought he could stand alone but every time he went up against an organized body he lost because the organization could furnish more viewpoints than he could it is the plurality of viewpoints that confuses the individual he cant sort it all out and eventually gets pulled down the individual could furnish only limited number of viewpoints to which he could pay attention and which he could coordinate communism advances because it has plurality of viewpoints organized to confuse the individual viewpoint the individual ot has his problems because he is an individual and has been convinced that he could do it all by himself and he could but the little boys with the airplanes always show up some time in the future the universe was ended by magellanic clouds less than 500 trillion years ago only space and rubble was left there were suns and planets lot of thetans got together to put it all back together you got planet builders and sunbuilders in spite of all this the little men with the airplanes showed up then with their thetatraps where did they come from this has happened repeatedly in this universe this universe surrenders to cooperative action and not to individual action but now we have new breed of cat the experienced being when you get through auditing someone now he is an experienced being who knows the isness of the universe and who knows that matter how tough you are you can get in pole trap we have the technology to straighten someone out unless powerful being learns that this is universe of organization and coordination he will just be back on the pole trap again any body of beings operating with coordinated program can beat him you have got situation where the individual is trying to operate in universe of cooperation and of course that degrades the beingness of the individual to that degree the more he fights to be an individual the less he cooperates the less he is willing to cooperate the more enforced is his co operation the more he fights against this sort of thing and the less freedom he has that is description of the dwindling spiral that an individual goes through noconfront is the mechanical basis of the spiral discarded beingnesses are what bring him down in facsimile the hardest problem the pc usually has is trying to isolate what is him and who is he and what is he this is usually the biggest lie in the facsimile the pc has been running it as an overt being the executioner and he finally turns out to have been the victims wife it is in fact dangerous not to be scientologist but the rest of the beingnesses are matter of opinion and the coordination of beingnesses is one of the better solutions being at the bottom of the reality scale has gone down through scale of beingness to get him to be anything at the bottom is impossible except to be an unaware being there are deeper channels of unawareness but there is absolute unawareness he goes into coma taking responsibility for any beingness of any kind whatsoever to move him up the line he would have to have some security in being able to be something at an upper level you can have problems in processing if there is future beingness going out of responsibility occurs because one continually gets the lesson that being responsible lands you in the soup the repetition of this lesson is what puts the individual downscale in livingness the scale keeps going further south to deeper levels of unawareness it has to be made safe to be exterior to be theta clear without some guarantee that you wont just wind up in the soup again you wont become skyscraper tall again havingness is useless without purpose unless the game itself is an expanding game then processing cannot produce stability future livingness ties into rise up the scale outreality equals responsibility what to be to be an or to be b that is the question if you cant be an and cant be b and there arent any other things to be the answer is anaten 320it is interesting what you can do simply by using the tool of secure beingness marital difficulties result from 1 husband who wont be husband 2 wife who wont be wife 3 husband who wont let wife be wife 4 wife who wont let husband be husband this is the average marriage marriage is not unhappy marriage is difficult beingness you could use beingness processing to remedy it bypassed charge that causes jealousy is bypassed charge in the other person it is not knowing about the other persons past therefore there is crisscross of bpc because we are not bypassing charge in each other scientologists will be the first people who can be friends in this universe because time alone builds up bpc in people who know nothing about the time track you have to handle the helatrobus implant because it bolluxes up the time track and debars an easy route to running engrams and to reaccustoming the individual to different levels of beingness only engram running will clear somebody beingness case state hope expectations and confront are all tied up in the case scale now that we have the scale of cases and knowledge of what gets case up to engram running we can sort out the time track reaccustoming the person to various levels of beingness after youve got all the engrams run out youve got an ot then you need an organization to handle the problems of the ot in this universe otherwise he will just slump again 6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing processes fall into categories according to which case conditions they handle cases deteriorate as they go down the time track one factor against which they deteriorate is confront and the other factor is duplication confront has to do with willingness and duplication has to do with ability as the pc becomes less willing to confront he becomes less able to duplicate similarly processes are allowed to deteriorate and fade out of use through failure of willingness to confront and ability to duplicate cchs for example went out for five years through getting down into the effort band there was duplication you would have very exact sort of process if you ran what are you able tounable to duplicate along with other flows you add more legs to it as the case needs more complexity highscale case not being much troubled by flows could go far on one leg only you can get different viewpoints on different flows also this can give you ta action where you might not otherwise get it you add enough brackets to get ta there is perfect way to run brackets since the number of available flows is virtually infinite the idea of flows is something that monitors all case levels and breaks its back around level 4 above level 4 any or all flows could be run person well downscale below level 4 almost at the bottom can only run one flow such person cant function on any other dynamic than the first he cant conceive of another viewpoint though he needs to run more than one flow there is problem here this is problem of the dynamics how many can person function on there are many facets of processing by which you could match up case to its ideal process you might be able to figure out the perfect process mathematically but there is the point about the need for workability that we mustnt lose sight of process should not be perfect it should be complex enough to be workable the complexity factor also goes into the number of processes you need we should not emulate modern science modern science is method of precisely determining overwhelming nonsense we also have to determine the common denominators present in all cases the processes that have survived the development of scientology are those that have broad workability they include arc the midruds buttons and common incidents on the time track the common denominators of all cases kraepelins list of psychiatric case types is ridiculous it is like saying i am auditing betty so it is betty case type or well everybody is george case type in the first case you get too many case types in the second case you get too few there is middle ground this is finite number of case types classified according to their behavior in auditing sessions and larger but still finite number of processes it is only useful to divide cases up into case types so that you can match them up to the 321processes the case types are based on behavior in session not in life you get finite number of them then match them up with processes that raise the pc upscale you cant expect auditors to memorize more than few types of auditing processes perfectly if you expect more of auditors than this they end up mixing types and styles of auditing and you get hash repetitive processing seems easy now that you are familiar with it in fact any type of processing you have learned well presents particular problem cchs got badly learned they are kid glove type of process since cases that get cchs exclusively are low on the effect scale and cant tolerate being mauled about lrh tells an anecdote about dropping cchs because they werent getting results then giving tvd and discovering that one knew what he was doing they had utterly alterised the process it was then that he stopped just creating new processes and began to insist on perfect duplication of what had already been developed we stopped accumulating process types when lrh found out that it was variation that made processes and process types stop producing results people shifting from the original type of process would then apparently bring about need for new process type process types are dependent on how many you can keep in line how to keep processes in line and working is more important factor than you might think when process seems to have stopped working you will find that variations from the original have crept in the simpler process types tend to survive better than the more complicated ones they are also perhaps easier to keep in line in their unvaried form but even the simpler ones will drift out of line process can die when it is too simple and gets used very seldom reach and withdraw is good example of this type of process it works at level 8 and is the only type of process you could use on an animal processes that work very slowly also tend to get dropped since they are seldom run to flat point so you dont see results we dont really know how much reach and withdraw processes can do processes can vanish because of disrespect we use one diffidently arc processing disappeared for awhile because of this that they are the only workable processes for certain type of case gets lost and so those cases get lost reach and withdraw is one of these it is slow but sure and it is almost lost from lack of respect for its potential there are lots of processes in the band of reach and withdraw that are ignored book and bottle hangs right in between reach and withdraw and cchs it contains duplication like the latter but is the former type of process lots of cases wont move unless run on these processes they wont move on cchs we mustnt lose processes we have been pressing so much at the top of the scale of cases that the bottom has been neglected so these lower scale processes have dropped out the next division in processing is what the auditor knows is wrong with the case vs what can be done with the case these can be two very different things modern processes have nothing to do with what is wrong with the case the viewpoint of curing specific conditions by specific processes is an outmoded viewpoint left over from old medical practices one must run what the pc can run and not fixate on curing that is sort of q and ii case with temporary relapse into heavy problems may not be able for the moment to be run on problems repetitivetype process therefore you had better be able to undercut problems processes if case is dramatizing something that something is not real to the case that is guiding rule of processing what you are guided by is not are we handling what is obviously wrong with him but does the case respond to the process that is being run on the case 1e does the case get ta when the ruds for the session are in you must of course check that 1 the session ruds are in 2 flows are in line 3223 the process is not already flat or unsuitable for instance speaking of flows most of the stuff we run eg the helatrobus implants are motivators so if you had ta and it ceased after you had run several flows the flows may be getting stuck we are interested in increasing the capabilities of the case he should at least be getting easier to audit because that means that he is getting more responsive to external orders getting more capable of viewing his track and pictures getting into less trouble getting better at locating bpc the case would be getting more done per session too auditors tend not to notice that case is paining and winning because they are too close to the case and they dont observe the slow gradient the way to spot it is to notice how the case was month ago if the case is progressing well if he is interested in and happy doing what he is doing dont change it unless there is ta for long time give ta motion time to develop also it may take several sessions to establish the pcs case level run engrams using the precise system and commands given the precision of the system tends to develop the pcs precision on the track dont word the item too adventurously make it finite enough so that there is hope of reaching basic it should be something he is worried about and can reach if you run chain of being held still you are asking for lots of still points which may be hard to get to the root of what you validate you produce with the exception that getting the pc to confront what he doesnt want to lets him take over the automaticity of producing it so it stops being produced modern processes are built on and monitor the degree of withdrawal of the person into himself and those things that will lead the pc out from himself so he is longer so restricted thus reach and withdraw is the most basic action you should have some idea about types of processes how and why they work and what case level they are most effective on and you should get good at estimating where the case must lie and upgrading the case from that point always run the case little steeper than it thinks it should be run the reaction of the case in terms of protest or arc break has almost bearing on whether what you are running is the right process you look amidst the yap yap and see if the pc is running the auditing command protest is common denominator of the whole track and this universe it is how the thetan makes pictured it is more fundamental than duplicating 6306c25 shspec278 routine 2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment the use of different processes has been monitored or regulated by two things 1 the ability of the auditor to do the process 2 the efficacy of the process in advancing cases both have to be taken into account it is important that these two factors mesh otherwise auditors tend to lose what is win or lose in auditing you have to be able to define them or we wont be able to recognize them win in terms of thetan behavior is 1 intending to do something and doing it or 2 intending not to do something and not doing it lose is 1 intending to do something and not doing it or 2 intending not to do something and doing it lose gives you disagreement ridge forms between those two things ridge is bit of entrapped energy that will read on an emeter in processing intending to do something for case and not doing it is lose from the pcs side it is the basic definition for lose if the pc sets goal for the session of becoming ot and doesnt make it it is lose matter how unreal the goal was an auditors idea of win could be not to arc break the pc then he does and gets lose this is the intention and sole intention of many auditors going into session this being the case it demands 323of process that it work regardless of the intention of the auditor that is quite bit to demand of an automaticity but it is very safe base for process your skill as an auditor is in getting the process across and completing an auditing cycle keeping the form and running the session it does not lie in inventing process as you go along you have enough to do without having to invent processes although lrh used to do it it is feasible to dream up the process while auditing the pc but it is only necessary when you dont know what to do the way around this problem is to know the fundamentals of cases what we expect of an auditor is to be able to complete an auditing cycle hold the session form together and take care of the pcs formness as needed that is minimal if you go lower you havent got an auditor and more randomness than order will be introduced into the session person who couldnt master repetitive process would never make an auditor because of the importance of the auditing cycle you need to be able to acknowledge this is more than just saying thank you the auditor has to understand and it is up to the auditor to minimize the possible breakdowns of the auditing cycle that results from the auditor being startled by what pcs come up with the auditor must be cured of tendency to q and since that is damaging to the pc common sort of q and is echo metering this drives the pc round the bend if this is done with dating it can ruin the pcs precious ability to estimate time any echo metering is and not q and aing is part of the auditing cycle if the pc says around 750 years you say 750 years the essence of q and is departing from the auditing cycle with new doingness because the pc has added new doingness this misses pcs withhold the worst situation you can get into is the arc break caused by your taking it up when all the pc was doing was originating the pc has originated and you thought it was question or request and acted to handle it flunk you didnt acknowledge the origination you can get the pc to clarify the origination by asking the pc was that request the final test of an auditor is not is he perfect but can he unscramble mess by session end get as good as you can get but dont get upset about imperfection just be sure you can straighten it all out as an irreducible minimum let things go that are going well and straighten out things that arent r2h is new process to assist in this see also hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment for more details on the process this would be predecessor of the l1c r3r is pretty rote procedure it has variations it took 13 years to arrive at it i intended auditors to run engrams and failed in the past i had loss that is why r3r came in the main difficulty in handling engrams is the complexity of the procedure these rote steps are pretty simple done one by one r3r runs engrams better and smoother than earlier engram running ever did it is quite triumph the failure in getting auditors to run engrams was enough to make lrh abandon trying for some years of all processes this is the one not to learn by doing it on the pc dont practice running engrams on pc you will tanglefoot if you dont know the fundamentals of the time track dating is an interestingly exact skill the hardest and trickiest step is getting the duration because it is hard to get the proper duration and in rote procedure duration is everything if the pc doesnt know know what the incident is all about you have the duration wrong why the later part of the incident is always knowable as to length the question is where it really begins for instance you know how long this lifetime has been but you dont know how long your track is if you get the pc just seeing one scene every time you run him through the incident then the duration is wrong he has just got the back end of the incident in terms of reality and behavior of the meter the pc could reach the last part of the engram if he cant tell you about what is happening the duration is wrong because there is obviously something more to it and that something more is always earlier so you must redo the duration the first incident wasnt wrong youve just gotten more incident this could happen more than once in one incident if the second run is still very vague if the pc still doesnt know about the incident if he has gotten only few more pictures get the duration step redone thats all you have to do you may have to redo it several times just take the pcs data the pc will always go to the beginning of that part of the incident which he can now reach luckily this is very uncomplicated and it is very important because all that is in the bank is in engrams engram running is longer barred to the black v case even gpms are specialized engrams gpm is just an engram with pattern required to run it the mind is not confused the pc looking at it and unable to find what he wants thinks that it is confused it is an idiotically orderly machine which does what you tell it to do addressed by 324proper technology the mind is incredibly precise and accurate the pc may think it looks confused but he is like someone on his first trip to the library he will be confused until he cognites that he can just ask the librarian for what he wants and get it the auditor always gets what he asks for in r3r the mind is not ouija board just keep your commands sensible and comprehensible the biggest problems an auditor has are 1 finding the correct date and duration 2 arc breaks most auditors are somewhat afraid of arc breaks if you havent learned to assess and handle arc breaks you are licked you will shortly back off from running engrams because you will have had lose routine 2h comes in here it is arc breaks by assessment it is superior to arc break straightwire it asks the pc for an arc break dates it assesses it for bpc locates it and indicates it to the pc this puts you at cause over arc breaks and gives you practice at dating things that the pc is not very nervy about unlike engrams r2h can be run on pc at level 6 dubin of dubin case r3r doesnt necessarily run only engrams you can also run secondaries with it which is fine just dont call it engram running dont run chains that havent been assessed you risk having the chain try to branch into another chain you can run locks with r3r on case that is not up to running engrams getting the item to run is done by the rules of listing you could also assess the 18 buttons of the prepcheck and list what they have suppressed in this lifetime and get chain that you can run with ta if you hit one of the helatrobus implants shift to r3n if it is another sort of gpm you hit go to r3n2 watch for dates between 38 and 52 trillion years ago for helatrobus implants the approach to processing has been upgraded because its target has been upgraded we are not interested in clearing we are interested in ots the governments of the us and australia decided to get rough also the kremlin and the us are trying to form dichotomy expressed with nuclear fission we must hold the line legally concerning emeters and upgrade the auditing target to ot 6306c26 shtvd22 listing assessment for engram running part i notice the simplicity of this procedure see hcob 1jul63 routine 3r bulletin 4 preliminary step for description of the procedure the difficulties with it are minimal the skills of r212 are used the rules of listing apply etc the key note of any fairly highlevel case and what makes an incident an incident is protest by protesting person shoves his face towards something he attacks it while he resists it this opposition produces heavy charge but some people arent up to protest so we will assess an 18button prepcheck list to determine the thing to assess for engrams lrh proceeds to assess an 18button prepcheck with created left out because it is goal with the prefix in this lifetime have you mainly _______ he gets huge list of items after nulling the 18 buttons down to decided lists in this lifetime what have you decided to clean needle does goals and gains havingness and ends off you just keep listing until the needle is clean without doing anything to disturb the pc and put ruds out you are not looking for rss rrs or any peculiar needle phenomena the next step would be to null the list in this lifetime what have you decided to one item if this item turns out to be goal it would be run with r3n otherwise you locate an engram chain that could cause such decision in life model session was very simple and skeletal if the pc had not made goals or gains lrh would have said im sorry you didnt make your goalsgains if he had made some of them the acknowledgment would have been both thank you and sorry 6306c27 shtvd23 listing assessment for engram running part ii this is continuation the next day of the previous auditing the session starts off with missed withhold rud being run then off and running with l and n then similar actions to the last tape at the end of the session the list was still incomplete it was banging on everything 325a list should be complete so that everything is out on nulling except the item since you know that lists being incomplete means that the item isnt on the list you could when the list is completed just null the last page or two and find the item dont though 6307c09 shspec281 the free being the shsbc is the place that you have been coming to for the last trillion trillion years it is lrhs job to make auditors who can clear up the track if we hadnt waited so long it would have been easier but two things prevented its being done sooner 1 the state of civilization 2 the previous failure to realize that the cycle was the cycle of loss of the ot being now had come to the point of believing that the only safe place to be was in meatbody civilization the fight the quality of life had been lost peculiarly enough freedom as an ot has come down almost into pi say to 500 years ago for some but they were lost too there is way to obtain and maintain stability as an ot as things stand what is peculiar about this war on ots was that it was lost by the most powerful all battles are won by combination of force and intelligence given enough force you dont need much intelligence viz nuclear bombs but then all you get is shortterm win longterm win is achieved only by balance between force and intelligence intelligence alone is never enough for instance in the communist takeover of tibet the wise men of tibet were powerless to prevent it there is an imbalance in any defeat any coordinated civilization combining technology with force and keeping force and intelligence balanced can make monkey out of an ot literally there is an implant four galaxies over that taught you that you came from apes the whole darwinian theory is implanted there in about day in fact thetans had different tastes relative to bodies for instance some liked caveman cultures and some didnt this is not evolution it is just different mockups for thetans the civilizations of treetop premen and of cavemen were just two different styles with evolution between them the deterioration of matter is not nearly as rapid as scientists think it is and the earth has been here much longer than they think carbon14 dating methods the measurement of time elapsed by deterioration of atoms doesnt work because this deterioration doesnt occur as fast as scientists think suns in this area have been burning for at least 200 trillion years dark stars suns that look as though they have gone out were never lit they dont go out so society is full of misapprehensions and stupidities that themselves act as traps these stupidities are intelligently conceived as means of cohesing society ignorance is used by the intelligent as means of entrapment if everyone remains ignorant of the society nobody can get out of it so they have choice but to cooperate and keep society going so these meatbody societies operate on combination of mediocre intelligence and mediocre force they make the airplane and the space ship and progress further then they disintegrate societies repeat patterns over and over again thetans get on different kicks and make these societies but beware of societies with as much progress as there is on this planet various unusual forces are at work here this planet is evolving unusually fast because for one thing it is being used as dumping ground it is on the periphery of the galaxy sun 12 is handy to other galaxies and to the center of this galaxy it is still being used as dumping ground for that reason this planet has very heterogenous society and lots of trouble because one is guiding it most planets have some guiding thetan these dont change they are rather like little play town there is master hand guiding this planet if there were there would be far less trouble than there is when you take thetans that have been indoctrinated to have certain types of societies in bodies that have been mocked up and then they get scooped up and dumped as unwanted in one place you have lots of different impulses at work one with the other this produces lots of friction that is what our society is this society belongs nominally to the espinol united stars or the espinol united moons planets and asteroids this quarter of the universe is ours this is sun 12 there has been command post occupied for this system now since 1150 ad at the time when group on mars was finally abolished and vanished you notice that at that time there was sudden resurgence in science and learning it became an uncontrolled civilization and one has been paying any attention to the 326dumping that has been going on since nobody took any interest in this system and it has been running wild ever since that time probably the most basic impulse on the planet is simply the basic impulse of thetans who have been reduced to more or less meat body level which is total cooperation with one another as you see in communism we are all equal there must be personalities of any kind and the cult of personalities must be banished this is the least common denominator of implants and indoctrination the notion that they must have teammates why did you arrive on this planet in the condition you are in good reason particularly certainly not just because of the overtmotivator sequence though you will try to find the overts you did that pulled it in you are still trying to be reasonable and intelligent about it you think that there had to be reason it is true that you have overts but the only reason you were ever punished was for being you for being powerful and for not being quite intelligent enough the exact crimes were to be there and to communicate once upon time some ot came along and for fun put together civilization complete with curbstones and hairdos some other thetan came along and interfered in some way so to get even the first thetan would indoctrinate his pet society on how to trap big thetan so this became the most accomplished skill that meat body society had how to trap spirit ot was ever so out of his mind as to depend upon any of his men or troops to untrap him he never taught them to do that because at the time he was doing this it never occurred to him that he would be caught singularly unintelligent it isnt this universe that did it you were just knuckleheaded not enough intelligence was used proportional to the force tributes to god are tributes to the workings of an ot creating the entire universe seems like very intelligent action but it was knuckleheaded because one worked out how to reverse it to unbuild it to cause things to asis this lack of intelligence was recently dramatized by frankie the limpers funding the atom bomb without building defense against it ots in the past have employed too much force and too little intelligence an ot could build anything atoms molecules suns traps but he didnt bother to figure out how to turn it off when he got tired of it the problem came from an insistence on matter that was to endure forever this was not smart eventually that is what theta poles were made of thats the pole youve been on confounded things last forever its possible to be trapped for over 135 trillion trillion years the tech for trapping thetans is vast but there is nothing on how do you get him off of it here is problem how can you free thetans when there are ots left all an ot has to do is to pull the trapped thetan off and toss him out in space to cool off seems simple but it requires an ot and what if there isnt any einstein was dead wrong he only contributed to the ignorance by which you get trapped space wagons used to travel trillions of light years per day teleportation is pipe dream you just unmock body here and mock it up there its not the same atoms the skill of making matter disappear has been grievously neglected like the tech of how to free thetan the failure to teach meat body society equally to free or to trap was just unintelligent this situation is like the phenomenon of stuck or single flows in processing where if you run motivators long enough the pc will give you an overt you can always get trouble when you run only one side of flow that is important to you because it says where you sit as being at this exact moment and why you are interested in the technology before you and why it is appearing at this time everyone will tell you that this technology is impossible it isnt it is only neglected they think it is impossible because they have outflowed the reverse technology the technology isnt neglected because the lack of it didnt cause societies trouble it did the galactic confederation is in trouble right now because of this lack the confederation operates on limited ot basis its hierarchy of command is that of limited level of ot and it goes down from ots at the top to the doll body as the ship captain and the post captain and down to meat bodies it is one of the few civilizations that has endured long time just because it has used these different levels they have tried to maintain nochange condition which is dangerous and impossible if you dont improve you decline the problem of the galactic confederation is that they have run out of the ots that are needed to command units that is the limiting factor on how big they could be since not once in 80 trillion years has anyone ever suggested repairing ots they have static and therefore declining society 327ots get peculiar they get fitful they get moody they can get keyed in and all they could do about it was to subdue the errant thetan turn sleeplight on him tell him to get more solid and take him down to the hospital i know i was there i was the guy they did it to if the technology of untrapping is so vital why hasnt someone worked on it because they are afraid of the technology governments would fear ots if they knew about them the galactic federation of course does they would worry about how you could maintain the social strata and the fixed organization if every janitor could be an ot it would be fine if you could restrict the technology to ots but it would spread to doll body and meat body beings they would fear the social and political upset that would occur if you freed thetans youd have to give them political solution which was as great as the political threat you cannot give them tech without taking responsibility for it or nobodyd listen to you people on earth dont think that scientology doesnt work but theyve been trained against the vector of it theyve been trained to destroy to entrap to set up fixed status of something and then work out destructive means of entrapment with it so people cannot leave certain social and economic strata of the society you are not up against pavlov freud etc you pose tremendous threat to the social structure of our current civilization you can tear it to pieces by rehabilitation of thetans tremendous power and force which can only be safe if there is also tremendous intelligence connected with it so that the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics will be produced for instance an ot can pull the air cover mammoths have been found in the polar regions with freshfrozen vegetables in their stomachs to explain this phenomenon it would be necessary to explain the fact that they must have been quickfrozen in sixty seconds in tropical region what natural cataclysm could have taken place in sixty seconds somebody pulled the air cover and gave the planet reverse spin because they got mad an ot who could do such thing in fit of pique would be terribly dangerous an overt act doesnt just damage it damages the greater number of dynamics one can commit an overt act unintentionally by lacking data or not using sufficient intelligence to see what really is for the greatest good but really heavy overt act is one where one deliberately sets out to damage the greater number of dynamics keep this in mind during secchecking you should be looking for actions that are really harmful to greater number of dynamics not just some irresponsible actions an overt act is often realized after the fact you could have done it smarter way that wouldnt have been an overt so you get regret and hungup overts you seldom find anything in this lifetime that is real deliberate overt it has been awhile since the guy had power enough to do real overt some thetans will take on their shoulders more responsibility than is rightfully theirs however running dubbedin overts wont get them anywhere but under all that there is real overt of magnitude phase of this universe has taken place and ended the phase of the free being the free being has lost to solid unintelligent meanlevel societies another cycle opens up now this new cycle involves different kind of being one that is as strong as the old but experienced not as stupid because now you know what the score is now you have good reality on meatbody society and can see their political frailties and the impossibility of obliterating them because they start again elsewhere they can be managed handled helped or thrown on reverse vector the use of intelligence with force can maintain freedom of action without racking up new bank and new overts new war against the thetan there has never been lasting or intelligent society of free beings for asisness has dropped out as an ability and needs to be put back in but such society is needed since everyone on his own puts everyone downscale in the long run if freedom means total irresponsibility up and down the line you are not talking about freedom you are talking about catastrophe we dont need war we need balanced technology with the ability to meld force and intelligence we need knowhow and force not knowhow in the use of force we need balanced intelligence that can reverse what one does unmocking matter as well as making it freeing as well as entrapping if you know how to enslave people you should know how to free people if you are going to make up matter dont insist that it be indestructible in dealing with meat body societies dont just stir up the ant hill it will just disperse and continue to grow the era of total irresponsibility is over long cycle is over in this universe the cycle of the free being vs the meat body society is over the battle was lost and the free being doesnt exist anymore we shift gears by just putting some intelligence in with the force freedom with barriers is insupportable there is nothing in this case to be free from or to push against freedom must be worked for if you think that you will stay clear or ot just by never 328destroying anything again you are nuts criminals should be permitted to free themselves through compensating victims not to do things for the greatest good of the greater number of dynamics is an overt of omission one cant maintain freedom in the face of failure of such magnitude you cannot be or make an irresponsible ot we have to continue to take responsibility for our fellows not to take responsibility for others is to lose our own freedom in the end 6307c10 shspec282 auditing skills for r3r some of the material in this tape is also to be found in hcob 9jul63 technical summary the required skills of processing and why we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an ot unfortunately they are not simple and they are numerous but they break down to about five skills which must be perfect they are 1 the ability to follow an auditing cycle 2 the ability to give it repetitively 3 the ability to read meter very well 4 the ability to read understand and follow the procedure of bulletin 5 the ability to get and keep pc in session any time an auditor cannot handle an upperlevel procedure it is because of the fact that he cannot do one of these five basic things as an auditing supervisor knowing this will enable you to get auditing done if the auditor cannot get results with process it is one of these skills not the process is awry amount of persuasion will overcome the lack of one of these skills you like to think that you are up against case level in training an auditor low case level does make it harder to teach some people but if you make that criterion of whether you can train someone you will lose there is case requirement for training you mustnt q and with the i cant of someone if you make him do it you make him right not wrong to agree with the i cant is q and aing with his aberration the d of t must never be permitted to refuse student because getting into the practice of doing so leads to limiting who can be trained to the point where auditing gets done when the instructor says yes you cant the instructor is invalidating the reactive mind and the students ability to audit deteriorates rapidly it takes some people little longer to get towards those basics and just do them but if you keep at it they will get there complex technology like r3r will show up the weak points in any of your five basics for instance given what you are handling in r3r if you q and you get major bad reactions 2 and occurs when the auditor doesnt make his intention stick in the session he tends to become the effect of the pc the level of error is always stupidly elementary and has nothing to do with what process you are running or how complicated that is r3n and r3r look very complicated they have lot of steps and lots of doingness but if you can do the basics of auditing you will have trouble it is fantastic to have process that runs engrams by rote all that can give you real trouble in r3r is wrong date and wrong duration which can result from faulty meter reading or faulty dating procedure it is difficult for an expert meter reader to get dates and durations of engrams if the auditor cant read the meter well wrong date doesnt mean minor wrongness it is something grossly wrong which rapidly snarls up the time track wrong date produces bypassed charge and grouped track the bpc is fantastic if person has his attention on date or something it will tick once on the meter even if it isnt the right date hence you can q and you might say that dubin case is just someone who has his dates mixed up you could probably cure dubin by accurate dating nothing drives the pc battier than to have wrong duration say the incident is really trillion years long and you give him duration of two days the pc tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident he cant because he is looking at something that happened two days before so it stays all black and gruesome when you get that phenomenon you reduration the incident what made r3r 329workable is that pc has perception on any incident that is properly dated and durationed that is where perceptics lie there are only three reasons for perception 1 wrong date 2 wrong duration 3 it has gpm in it wrong assessment and overrun chain already flat give you ta but not necessarily perception the incident can get obscured if it has gpm in it because black energy goes up and obscures the engram this was caused by the pcs protest in the incident when lights go off in an incident look for gpm if that happens you have to get the pc to straighten out the gpm by taking him to the first pair of items in it get the motion out pick up another pair of items get the ta motion off that pair etc just clean it up rapidly then run it as an engram it is never very long or very difficult to run there is point where r3r and r3n cross start the case on r3r and pick up any implants that turned up while running r3r check for an implant on the duration step if you get onto the helatrobus implant clean them up get the first pair of items and discharge them with rocket reads etc then go back to r3r use r3n as the adjunct it is there are some technical details that you have to know these include 1 how to assess an arc break 2 what lists one should use 3 ability to do an accurate and thorough l and n to complete but not overlisted list the source of arc breaks on lists is incompleteness of lists you can however assess prepared arbitrary list without fear of having the incomplete list phenomena turn on because the pc never started the list so it isnt complete but in regular list in order to get the items you do have to be able to do l and n which includes metering if you are having trouble with r3r be sure that your difficulties do not stem from troubles with getting in ruds or say writing while watching the meter learn to audit by fundamentals and you will have trouble with procedure that just combines the fundamentals your main danger as an auditor is being too complicated recognize that the simplicities of the game are what make it hang together and work wrong date and wrong duration are the only things that give you trouble wrong assessment is very junior and generally just gives you ta because wrong date and wrong duration are such lies it is difficult for the pc to asis them and what happens to the track when you move to wrong date it is very hard to get the right date and duration to read even when the pc is in session and you are on the right chain date is easier than duration because the beginning of the incident is so hard for pcs to see especially at the beginning one source of wrong assessment is overrun when you try to go earlier than basic case levels 5 6 and 7 see pp 414415 above all have channel through the bank on which the pc has reality where he can be run on engrams without dubin using r3r so if you find that channel and run the pc in it the pc wins and can go on up 6307c11 shspec283 arc breaks the trouble with arc break assessments is that you will generally have to do them on pc with dirty needle dont suppose you can or should clean up the needle first since all dirty needles are arc breaks you dont try to clean the needle and then assess for the arc break the only thing that will clean up the arc break is the list all you have to do is to follow very strictly the rule of the instant read and never miss an auditor who could do that would be pearl and that makes arc break assessment splendid training device 330if there were arc breaks on the persons track the fact of button going out would not cause dirty needle for instance suppress reads because it is sitting on chain of arc breaks there are two elements here 1 the thetans reaction to the experience he has bad with mest and significance 2 the mest and significance itself nothing has to be observed in order to be cf bishop berkeley and his tree falling in the middle of the forest thetans reaction to mest and significance must involve some contact with it but it can exist without being perceived the relation between the mest significance and the thetans reaction is communication to be affected by something one must communicate with it or knowingly not communicate with it this fact eliminates lot of philosophical baloney deliberate notknow of something can get thetan in trouble what gets the thetan in trouble is that he has been there and didnt communicate and he made picture of it or protested it and now he doesnt want to confront the picture either because the significance in the picture has been added to by his reaction of not wanting to communicate to it so thetans reaction becomes part of all observed or carefully not observed mest significance this then is the new significance of the thetans reaction at the time which made into mental image picture becomes the time track the past is different from the present in that the thetans picture of the past has had the thetans reaction added into it in mockups of future track hope or hopelessness is also added in so the future also has reaction added into it it is not often made up into pictures though it sometimes is it is just whole cloth dreamups not pressures against the physical universe or actual pictures however you can cause somebody to run future track so what you are auditing is thetans reactions to events gpms with their balanced masses float on the track and seem to be in pt to the pc if you want to horrify someone scatter him out of pt that the pc thinks is right there if you cant get read on dating facsimile that you know is there ask if it is tomorrow or yesterday this will shake the pc out of pt and you will get read however the pc usually arc breaks when you do this you are dealing with past that seems to be present time that requires reaction to it but has already got reaction in it so thetan takes his reaction out of the past incident and wears it in present time and you have the factor of restimulation of reaction his reaction of the past becomes his reaction to the present when you have audited an engram the pcs reaction to the engram becomes part of the session time track it gives faint shadow of read if you get the pc to spot it again it is not really charged it is just the action pattern of the observed present you might even be able to get another rocket read out of helatrobus implant series at any given instant of the time track you can rekindle any given reaction the time track has reaction added to it making it different from pt pt doesnt have reaction in it except as borrowed from the track or added by the thetan you could lay out some stretch of time in which you deliberately added happiness to everything if you get someone to audit you through that time few days later you will get ridiculous amount of happiness the guy who is always looking for happiness and not finding it simply doesnt put any happiness into pt when you are supposed to react favorably or hopefully but you dont feel that way the confusion of conflicting significances can be so great that the whole situation seems very unreal and you want nothing more to do with it and it can chew on the back of your neck from then on you say i wont look at it and put it away on automatic if you dont stir it up life will you can get things to persist just by postulating it will persist otherwise you can only get persistence with lie the thetans reaction to mest significance is about the reality r and results in feeling of affinity or misaffinity this reaction is communication c and it is bridge between the thetan and the mest significance the reaction is monitored by past arc or lack of it concerning similar mest significance of the past 331this assumes that the pc can maintain detached attitude then it is simple but say your pcs needle is nice and clean and you ask him to recall an arc break that is moment of miscommunication time when some charge was bypassed which has been restimulated the pc attributes the arc break to something other than the actual bpc which introduces lie into the situation and causes the arc break to persist time condenses as the pcs reaction to the mest significance prevents him from retaining detached attitude about it all if you are involved in the middle of the battle there is time to retain detached attitude you put it on total reaction this is caused by condensation of time what we really get the brunt of in this universe is an insufficiency of time you get that by staying on the time track if you start protesting time you get too much time on your hands actually this is an unwanted location that is blamed on time you start protesting time when you have an unwanted location the basic lie on the track is to confuse time and location few trillion trillion years ago you probably didnt stick on the time track the further back you go the less you were fixed into present time you were slippery on the subject and could go yesterday and tomorrow at will as with the time machines in science fiction an ct is the only real time machine you cant change the past and future without recreating it you werent necessarily surrounded with the environment of pt this was very useful you could slip around all over the place however the drawback was that since one was fixed in time you couldnt stay in communication very easily and certain impatience was generated you got unpopular because you couldnt be fixed in one spot to be communicated with only implants could cure this there had to be major louseups to cause aberration on the subject only gpm implants could do it if you have fixed time you get fixed reaction because it is an enforced thereness you cant drift out of the incident you have very little time and it is the unwanted absence or presence of time that gives all problems you could clean up problems by running tell problem you have had what time was awry there where was there too muchtoo little time this isnt especially workable being rather limited but you could probably get some changes shred the bank bit and move him on the track time is made insufficient by economics you could also adjust problems by attack on location less effectively but you could you can actually find the spot in space and do reach and withdraw that is why spotting spots in space works if someone had an accident with car and tree you could run reach and withdraw on the car and the tree all impact is based on scarcity of time you need some very complex mechanisms to cause facsimiles to stay with person in pt bothering them all the time with them reacting against them all the time to build up tremendous lot of reactions which then becomes the personality of the individual thats the only trick that is the chief engram that is what makes engrams unrunnable but now with r3r we can run them your reaction to mest significance is couched in various ways where those reactions tend to not communicate or to obsessively communicate you rough up energy then it stays in the picture ie it is flowing at one foot per second and you get it flowing at three feet per second but it isnt really flowing that fast or you prevent it from flowing at one foot per second and make it flow at one inch per second ie the normal course of flows is interrupted because of the existence of problem or an obsession to be at it or feeling that you have got to get away from it or that it is bad the result is that you bypass charge it is former reactions that get rekindled there which then throw old pictures into restimulation since the pc doesnt spot the old pictures the present reaction is somewhat inexplicable and he misses the charge the auditor locates and indicates it and the pc feels better what has been handled is not the facsimile itself but the reaction factor part which since it is the thetans reaction is the part most intimate to him it is similarity of reaction therefore that pulls in earlier similars cf getting the emotion somatic or attitude and running chains of that the only thing that caused restimulation of yesterdays charge was the fact that you reacted the same way today that you reacted yesterday the devil with the situation the reaction was the same and for that reason you pulled in yesterdays situation and didnt even know it youre not interested in running out yesterdays association as facsimile all you want is to clip out one little piece of it which is reaction reactionectomy when you indicate the charge you are actually matchedterminalling the past reaction and the present reaction and they can go bzzzt and the reaction or charge can vanish that is all you handle with an arc 332break assessment not the facsimile of yesterdays mest significance you dont have to know any more than that there was an earlier similar arc break the way to get pc into an incident is to ask him to find the largest object in it and tell you about it he will go right into the incident the thetans reaction to mest significance is manifested as arc your and my quarrels with many things that are wrong with the world is because our reactions are quite different from other peoples reactions to the same things hence to know everything is to forgive everything you get down past the reactions to the actual mest significance on an arc break all you handle is reactions not facsimiles in other words you dont run r3r on arc breaks you handle reactions the arc break assessment lists are just lists of bypassable charge so they vary depending on what activity you are engaged in arc breaks never rekindle until they key in an arc break is always keyin it is never the fact but the followup you can almost always get the missed withhold question to read on the arc break assessment list because that is the common denominator of arc breaks it requires missed withhold to key in an arc break there could be something far more fundamental than the missed withhold which wont read because of the pcs preoccupation with the missed withhold you can run the missed withhold and then still have to run the arc break if all you find is the keyin not the correct bypassed charge the arc break just keys in all the more the missed withhold only keyed it in on bypassed charge lists you may find the keyin and still have to run out the charge cf getting in buttons in ruds etc so missed withhold will read on almost any list it is on but there is most likely more that has to be found you should continue the list or reassess make sure that you are using the right list if nothing reads you are on the wrong list all you have to do to clear up an arc break is to locate and indicate the correct bypassed charge if it takes more than that you didnt find the correct bypassed charge if you dont know that you will give up using the system because you think that it is not invariably workable one reason for failure to cure an arc break is using the wrong list for assessment this could happen if there was little time spent on some other action which you and the pc had forgotten about 6307c16 shspec284a b preliminary steps of r3r this is demo session on two sides of tape of lrh auditing msh doing the preliminary assessment for r3r as given in hcob 1ju163 routine 3r bulletin 4 preliminary step 6307c16 shspec255 tips on running r3r auditing engrams and gpms is new world to many auditors especially to those who learned different kind of engram handling this doesnt invalidate yesterdays techniques they have their place especially in the field of healing we can heal things although we have neglected this area of responsibility for which reason we are being attacked in the area so we will collect and publish what we can do r212 for instance can have fantastic results when done as limited process just dont do more than four oppositions on one item get one ri do two or three oppositions and be happy with it the pc has been beaten down by his experiences on the whole track he thinks nothing good can happen in the universe when one goodness occurs it is almost too much for him to have that is different zone of expectancy from making clears and ots people wouldnt be able to conceive what you meant if you said that you were making clears and ots although in fact they would believe you and feel very uneasy about it you would have restimulated bypassed charge and they will always get cross with you in all auditing dont stir up more charge than you can handle if you apply that to any process you run or to any program you formulate you will have happy pcs the worse off case is the less you stir up this goes directly in the teeth of the q and that is yesteryears mental sciences the effect scale has to be observed at low levels the person cannot receive much of an effect so you have to featherweight the effect to let the pc receive it the more desperate the case the more featherweight the cure 333the technology of the preliminary assessment step for r3r lowers the level on which it will be effective that bypasses the ordinary defenses of the mind so when you do such an assessment the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle applies in neon lights if you are auditing case at level 7 6 or 5 see pp 414415 above for description of these levels this person doesnt easily run engrams the assessment has located the only tiny channel on the time track where the pc can confront engrams and on which you will not find dubin that is the basis on which the process has been developed case at level 3 see p 414 above this is the case with partially visible time track can be run on any engram you can find and wont be particularly upset or damaged by wrong date or other error but case at level 6 dubin of dubin case has barge canal sixteenth of an inch wider than your barge and full of roots old stoves and curves on that channel there is dubin of dubin and with correct assessment the case will have perceptics this gives you the responsibility of handling the case very carefully by the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle because at this level there is process that will put the case back together again if it falls apart the lower the case level the fewer incidents you will find per preliminary step the chain may be only one incident long test your level after you have run an incident if it doesnt read and the pc has had some sort of cognition about it dont choose this time to go backtrack if you have an incident that the pc can run it doesnt matter how long ago the incident was if he gets ta on it runs ok and that is all there is to the incident and if there are problems finding the date and duration and if there is read on asking for an earlier incident fine do another assessment things are more likely to run longer with an upperlevel case the clue to whether the chain is flat is ta action not how far back basic is to find out if you have run the ta out of the chain be sure that the ta didnt cease because of wrong date wrong duration or gpm in the incident if none of those apply leave it those are the criteria of flattened chain the helatrobus implant goes as far back as 43 trillion years ago the situation of having the ta cease is not the same as the situation of not having gotten any ta the only reason that you have trouble with running case with ta and arc breaks comes down to these factors 1 wrong assessment 2 wrong date 3 wrong duration 4 gpm in the incident that you are trying to run that you have collided with but have not found out about so you have been trying to scan the pc through the items of the gpm the worse off the case is the weirder the assessments will look to you the pc may run something well that is from the backtrack and still be lowlevel case so dont take the recentness of the incident as adjudicative of case level dating anything beyond an easily available incident becomes very difficult you are very likely to misdate and pass by incidents and the pc will know it too gpms are hard to date anyway being timeless and pc will have trouble staying in place on the time track this can also happen with upperlevel cases but they can take it lowerlevel case will plow in thoroughly the preliminary steps on level 4 see above this is dubin case or level 3 lead inevitably to gpm it is about the fastest way to find goal you ever heard of if the case is running well you can probably run the whole goals series right there any trouble you have with running case all goes back to the four factors given above wrong assessment includes running something that has not been assessed on lowerlevel case you can spend more time assessing than running the engrams test the level after you have something flat dont run over the pcs head when you have flattened the chain leave it the worse off the case is the more it moves from nonsense to murder so dont muddy the little channel you have to work in listen to what the pc tells you about what he wants to run but assess before you run it the way you make work for yourself as an auditor is by doing things that you shouldnt be doing for instance dont mix r3n and r3r dont switch from one to the other by mistake 334there is point on the track where you can get back of and find the basic of all gpms ive hit that point i havent got it so i can hold it steady i got there by the way by keying out had an awful time recently working out the most vicious series of gpms on the track there are five pictures but the first one is invisible goal with them just opposing items in dichotomy four firing five times in row for each picture i ran into myself on the track trying to figure this out i gave up took two sessions to get it unwound and the first picture is invisible so youd always try to put picture there so basic is always missing it makes vacuum and pictures pour in thats why later gpms accumulate pictures you get in the habit this is the vacuum that holds the whole bank together when he contacted this lrh could hear gpms coming apart all the way down to pt obviously you dont try something like this on lowerlevel pc desperate conditions are hard to maintain in the face of featherweight touches but heavier measures like bypassing too many goals in r3n wont help the case it is always ok to push pc little heavier than they can go but the rougher the case the less they can take the arc break is good test if the pc arc breaks regularly dont always blame yourself except for overestimating the state of case and running the process too steep there is real excuse for running pc poorly but if you put the pc in an available channel he will run like doll buggy if you run him right do careful assessment after every flattened chain checking carefully for wrong date or duration or gpm in it pcs that dont assess easily on the standard scale can be gotten to extend it auditing is as easy to do as it is real to the pc 6307c17 shspec286 dating accuracy in dating is the single most important function of the auditor since last october lrh has been studying something with intensity it took the preceding couple of years to determine that goals and related mental phenomena come down to engrams and the time track the difficulty with running engrams from 1950 on was the number of cases that couldnt run the time track years were spent on improving cases in october the time track assumed greater importance up to the point where lrh discovered that the gpm was an implant at that point we had to discover whether or not person could go clear without running the time track and engrams there had already been lot of failures with getting people to run on the time track lrh has always operated on the assumption that everyone could make it to ot few weeks ago he had to consider whether only fifty percent could go on to ot this was serious question which he had never before wondered about research since october has been very rough it has had to be done more rapidly because it was obvious that we didnt have much time left as proven by the january fda raid that was one reason that lrh decided to bypass clear and go for ot clear is an an aberrated comfortable human state which society can accept ot is something else it is like making playground supervisor vs commando with the government attack on scientology we had time margin to let us take care of clear first then go for ot so we are into research concerning how to make an ot when you accelerate research you get problems because you have taken time out where you need time in the last few months the work lrh has done per unit of time exceeds anything previously attempted the fact that if you cant run the time track youll never get to ot emerged however what also emerged was that with r3r if you get the right chain with the right date and duration you can get anyone to run with sonic and visio that wasnt solution unless the pc also got ta action ta action is the key to all case progress because it measures charge blown hence improved reality and better ability to confront the track the pcs reality must improve or he cant go any earlier on the track if you process someone without ta you would be doing him more good by taking him for walk in the park ta motion tells you how much mass you are discharging off the reactive bank where ta is not moving you are not discharging mass you can tell in the records that this is happening by observing that the same goals are being set for every session and the pc is getting only lukewarm gains that coordinates with ta action that was what caused lrh to wonder if fifty percent would never make it to ot there was the thin hope that by running lower level processes you could get enough charge off so that the pc could run track with ta it was pretty frail hope doing this could produce keyedout clears but that is not good enough the world is going down fast and new solutions are appearing to handle crises we are the only new factor in the world in order to meet the present 335situation the scientologist in the us will have to produce at least spectacular case results or spectacular being the problem now is what is absence of ta ta action disappears off case to the degree that time is in error and there is the answer ta does not cease because you have run wrong goal or from arc breaks or failure to run gpm it is because of wrong time time is the single source of human aberration this datum now emerges as more important truth than we had realized the gpm is totally devoted to scrambling someones time so if you cant get the gpms off the case you cant unaberrate him gpms are hard to date but they must be gotten off the case gpms have characteristic sound there is slow statement of the goal in earlier gpms this was preceded by crack so they sounded like this spat ssssssssssss spat non sen si cal ly spat part of the aberrative factor is the pcs effort to speed it up to get it to run at speed that he is comfortable with he is speedy sometimes people cant get rocket reads off of items because they dont duplicate the speed of the items they go very slowly the the thetan thinks why doesnt it get over with the doublefiring principle of gpms also messed up the thetan and hung him up in time it gave positive or negative charge to two opposing sentiments it hit him from the right and from the left it made him feel as though he couldnt move but had to move to get out of the way of it he would also get into timescrambler the total purpose of the gpm was to scramble time gpm engrams are the hardest engrams to date pc cant scan through gpm you have to use repeater technique because if you try to scan through it it all goes black because the pc protested it all the way through in running it you rekindle the protest he had when he got the implant that turns the engram black then you cant see anything in it and he cant move on the track and he is all frozen up in the thing the only thing that stops ta action is wrong dates wrong time and ta action equals processing the perfection of your auditing alone wont solve this so dating accurately is necessary to get ta action this doesnt mean dating down to the last microsecond your errors are the gross ones eg dating something at 945 years ago and it is really 145 trillion years ago very approximate dates back in the trillions of trillions of years ago is vastly sloppy but it is successful enough to get ta to straighten out case where the ta has ceased you clean up on time in auditing or on dating with an eighteenbutton prepcheck you should also clean wrong dates and wrong time as long as the needle is rough on the subject this could in or out of auditing you handle by 1 finding when the wrong dates were found times when things were wrongly dated you dont at first redate these things 2 when that is all cleaned up run down what was wrongly dated and clean it up with the pc even if you have to redate it you will see ta action restored to the case you want wrong dates that the pc guessed at or assumed earlier in auditing you continue to clean up the area until the needle is really clean and all the wrongness and upset has been cleared out of the way now the pc will date easily someone who is an auditor will also need the wrong dates that he has found on pcs and his anxiety on the subject all cleaned up too if you got the right date and right duration you will get perception if the incident has gpm in it the perception goes off because you have restimulated the pcs protest dubin itself is simply phenomenon of wrong dates you could produce the effect of dubin by deliberately giving the pc wrong date and wrong duration and sending him to the wrong point on the track then you will get collection of apparently dubbedin pictures and ta wrong items are tough on pc wrong line plots are result of wrong time sometimes you will flatten chain and the ta will go up this has something to do with wrong dates more deeply seated in the case than you can overcome without reassessment the pc has overstepped his own reality if the pc has trouble whenever he goes on the backtrack because it is all unreal and he cant believe it what is his wrong date it is the notion that life began at birth his error on time is on the length of the time track this is trap mechanism clean up all his considerations on the subject and his ability 336to run track will change look at the entrapment value of this limitedtrack business and see how much fuss current societys savants make about past lives one protests against truth unless they have vested interest in maintaining lie every pc tends to get their track tolerance extended as they find correct dates in the portion of the track that they can run fairly easily any case will hit ceiling of reality on the subject of dating but people only creak to the degree that there is wrong time wrong date can sneak in on you without your doing any dating for instance you assume that certain gpm is in the helatrobus implant when it is really goal that is much closer to pt by running it with the helatrobus line plot you have incorrectly dated it never leave wrong goal or even more importantly wrong date on case if the case has been run on r3r and ta action is doubtful clean up wrong dates and all possible charge on the subject of dates dating etc if case is getting ta action dont harass the pc about it but if there are arc breaks look into wrong time always also look into wrong assessment some cases are very nervy about time and wrong dates they can hardly take it if you make small error on date getting all the dates straightened out will improve this case even if nothing is run dont invalidate the pc by checking all his dates do it periodically just checking for wrong dates every now and then in session date things in terms on years ago since the pc has been on other planets with dating systems that are different from earths ad and bc the wrong date phenomena extend to other parts of auditing for instance the pc may be doing an objective process walking through the room through facsimiles of maypoles merely in the act of doing that the pc gets reality on the room and gets the pc date which straightens out the track to that extent you could date the facsimiles whenever the pc hits one and then return the pc to walking around the room you could probably take case that couldnt remember half of this lifetime and accurately date things this would give him tremendous reality on things that he had never remembered before 6307c18 shspec287 errors in time the insistence on having lived only once seems odd it takes more than gpm to produce such frenzy on the subject behind all aberration and illness there must be lie aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth pavlov apparently never noticed that reward was one of the stimuli that he was observing communism based on pavlov and the physiological nature of man becomes disastrous when practiced pavlov did total anatomy of punishment but left out reward capitalism works only because one analyzed it and pay is still part of the system if capitalism were earnest about fighting communism it would dig up such truths and promulgate them punishment does not uniformly control response at all it is not constant not all beings succumb to threat of punishment the reward part of existence is at least as important men will do more for reward than to avoid punishment the more that reward is taken away eg by taxation the more difficulty society gets into the lie that man is driven animal is destroying the social structure of man as long as you are trying to isolate the truth you will be 0k matter how much trouble you have in getting at the truth the trouble starts when you settle on lie and stop looking for truth you can have misconceptions and still not go nuts but when you settle on lie and say that that is the truth you have had it the lie will pervade your life it takes lie of the only lived once magnitude to continue the aberration of man to maintain such lie must take fantastic amount of duress someone must be working at it all psychosomatic healing could probably be done by finding the lie about the somatic for instance you could use the command recall lie behind the psychosomatic what would be the most disastrous type of lie it would be one about time here is how to aberrate someone give him false time track implant him with false past complete with pictures and times times in the order of magnitude of thetans actual existence of trillions and trillions of years only wrong time will freeze case as reflected in frozen ta so this must be pervasive common denominator of aberration this suggests processes like recall lie about time or dating 337everything in the pcs lifetime hence the importance of history with this view of the subject of time lrh investigated to see if someone earlier had played around with peoples time in the past sure enough there were implanted times and areas of track where time was utterly confused and incomprehensible you could get guy fixed up with enough false pasts that he would dramatize them he would get the opinion that he should never return on the time track because it is too dangerous or too confusing you could confuse the guy further by giving him some incomprehensible dates r3r is good enough to be able to find moment when false past was installed date it and find its duration and then run it out the incident pretends to be trillions of years long when it was really two or three hours long the common denominator of these incidents is that the point where you approached is commonly repeated in the incident one moment is actual the other is picture of it in the incident so you get two beginnings as well as two departures commonly such implants also have mechanism showing troops marching to the pc the beginning and troops marching away the end with numbers running along the sides of these implanted pictures to give their times the implant will often have these pictures of beginning and end reversed it is very confusing the way you can tell false track is that it really doesnt move there is time in false track for all the details between major events and the sound is seldom included true time track is more sequitur but can have periods of anaten the reason the pc is likely to be on false track is that most of it except for the beginning and end points is safer and less uncomfortable than actual track false track is lie about time it may have dates neatly placed on the sides one thing you can say about false track is that gpm is on false track this would be pointless they may be implants but they are not on false track so if you are running gpm it is not the false time track you can find gpms and date them there are two things that you want to know when you find an incident and date it 1 does it contain oppositefiring items in which case it is gpm 2 does it contain any false past you need this data discouraging though it seems to say so on false track be especially alert for false date and duration the darwinian theory is just an implant putting out the idea that man is mud it starts with goal to persist they have you in cell so they start by showing you being in cell then they show you pictures of your arriving in the cell to be implanted then they show you complete with pictures like movie all that has happened to you this is background data that lets you know how mean you are then they show you being implanted while you are watching you are having the hell picked out of you by electronic mass stacking around your body you are hit with electronic waves and the mass becomes associated with the pictures nothing at all is said there is sonic in this incident some false pasts do have sonic but beware of running things in these incidents that arent there the darwinian implant makes evolution appear true but it isnt when there are horses on planet it is because someone came along and mocked up some horses this sort of false past implant was done lot before the helatrobus implants some was also done after the helatrobus implants you have to know about this in order to get dates corrected you have to know that some are false not just wrong look for false pasts not false dates per the time track can also contain false future fortune tellers practice this to this day someone who is always trying to know the future is just dramatizing false future implant sound and motion are seldom found in false track incidents rather these incidents tend to jump from still to still more like lantern slides than movie the helatrobus dear gorilla and glade implants dont use pictures the helatrobus implant only uses pictures of railway and house in the gorilla and bear implants they have guy with pink striped shirt with monkey or sometimes gorilla that they put on the cart with you this is not the same as getting whole set of pictures that purport to be your past or future while getting electronic blasts false track can get in the way of running actual track some of it is pretty incredible but if false past doesnt read go ahead and run it run it anyway even if it is false maybe you will be able to find the real beginning however it is hard to find the beginning of falsepast incident 338when you run across something in session handle it but dont louse up your pc when you start correcting dates you will run into false pasts and futures so beware of redating just get in and clean up first the fact that it is false past and run it so you wont have it in the way if you locate source of wrong dates dont ask for another source of wrong dates run the one you have here is rule when you have your hands on an incident that contains false past or future run it with r3r to get it off the track get its actual duration the real beginning of the incident and also its end are hard to find since such incidents generally have two beginnings and two ends dont do anything extraordinary just be prepared to reduration it if necessary dont just redate it and leave it because thousands of dates will have been restimulated in the course of auditing and finding it again will be difficult apart from the fact that that incident is all you should run anyway until you have run it out so when you have your hands on something handle it dont leave the pc struggling with it while you try to do something else remember that your major auditing cycle is to accomplish some particular result on the pc if you get into something outside the perimeter of what you were going to do dont neglect it because it may never show up again when you have found the source of the pcs upset what else is there to find if you invalidate the source how will you accomplish you major purpose dont bypass achieving what you set out to do cognition can signal the end of your major auditing cycle 6307c24 shspec289 arc breaks and the comm cycle current model session is pretty short sincemidruds and pulling missed withholds is better than the previous beginning ruds an arc break assessment at end of session is much better than any end ruds we had in the old model session if all lines are cleaned up as they read presession stuff is the same as always she rest of the model session goes like this 1 goals for the session 2 sincemidruds if ta up or needle dirty 3 check for and pull any missed withholds 4 body of the session use whatever is necessary to get him through b chat little before ending the body of the session 5 arc break assessment if the pc is not very happy at end of session the wording of this is still very fixed the only problem is on what to do if rud question is clean asking the pc if he agrees it is clean can cause an arc break if the pc feels that it is impossible for the question to be really clean 6 take up each goal from 1 above acknowledge the pc for each one made 7 ask for any gains made in session dont milk this question acknowledge these by saying thank you for making these gains 8 can squeeze 9 end of session the reason for rough needle on the pc is the auditors outtr2 and tr4 clean up tr2 and tr 4 and youll clean up more needles than you can shake stick at it isnt the significance of it you see its the calm flow of the auditing cycle during arc break assessments you normally consider dirty needle to be withhold or something the pc has done but weak or overly heavy tr2 can do it as well there are two comm cycles in an auditing cycle 3391 auditor pc 2 pc auditor these cycles can operate independently both have to be very acceptable before you get good auditing cycle the pc doesnt even have to say anything for communication to exist thus from the auditor you can get an rfactor as an independent comm cycle and from the pc you can get pc origination as an independent comm cycle from the pc as in tr4 in this case an acknowledgment is not even really necessary an artificial acknowledgment can knock an origination off its base you can handle these with head nod or facial expression the pc origination only needs ghost of an acknowledgment for the pc to know that the auditor got it if it is something that seems funny to the pc and to the auditor it is ok for the auditor just to laugh with the pc if you can project your think tank you dont need tr2 sometimes an acknowledgment can indicate understanding on the part of the auditor the pc only needs to be sure that you understand good auditor of children obeys kids auditing commands in r3r you dont have to ask the pc whether he has done the command on move to the beginning of the incident he doesnt have to tell you that he has done it you will get meterflick when he is there and you can send him through from that point if the pc gives you gobbledygook do not tell the pc that you didnt understand that is powerful phrase to use furthermore by saying that all you have done essentially is to ask him to repeat what he has just said this is peculiarity of homo sapiens you just get the same words again that doesnt help you are just asking for complete arc break you want the pc to vary the statement what you want is an explanation or broader statement so you have to be able to get him to do that without invalidating him here we get the basis of the arc break there is bungedup communication cycle whatever else there is what is bunged up about it is that the communication is not fully detected and understood lacking those points there is comm cycle the intention of the pc is cause distance effect and that cycle is interfered with so that the communication is not fully detected this is the woof and warp of all arc breaks communication that is partially but not fully detected or you could detect something but not receive it for instance say the pc says that he feels fine and doesnt need to continue you say well thats fine but we will continue to fill in the time here the pc sees that the communication is not received because action is taken you said that it should be something else before it arrived at you therefore there is busted communication line you can get roaring arc break on this this is primary cause of arc breaks in this case r and c are out because u is out actually the communication is detected expectations come into this you can yell at rock since you dont expect detection you dont arc break auditing is different because the expectations are different there are other kinds of arc breaks all of them are based on the communication cycle the whole definition of bypassed charge is partially detected it had to be partially detected because it must have been stirred up comm cycle once begun must go through if it doesnt there will be trouble eventually you would think that people at cocktail parties would always be bypassing charge on each other because they are always partially detecting that someone spoke the only reason wog meat bodies dont explode during cocktail parties is that they are armored they dont expect anybody to hear them so theres never any partially detected charge comm it is very dangerous to ask for communication and then fail to acknowledge what is received as result of your request you are inviting an explosion in doing that for instance an auditor asks for the earliest incident the pc cant give it and arc breaks because the question kicks in an earlier incident than the one he can see which he cannot reach thus the pcs bank gets only partially detected and you get an arc break if the time track is like bunch of mines laid out in line and activated magnetically lets say you want mine number 4 you throw magnet to mine number 8 then you wonder why you get an explosion mine number 8 speaks but it is only partially detected one way to locate the earlier incident is to find its order of magnitude of years ago 340a comm cycle once begun must go through or there will be an upset eg the president promises to communicate to everyone but lacks the ability to carry through this gives the background for the revolution people who dont know anything about the communication cycle find this all so threatening and dangerous that they just decide to withdraw from communicating because they dont understand what is happening or how to remedy the upset desperation only enters in when communication goes out think of the sessions when you have gotten desperate your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you could put comm between yourself and the aberration thats bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge you dont worry about case for any other reason when you cant seem to reach the pc or the bank with your comm you get worried and upset when you are upset as an auditor see what communication you are not getting home to the pc and you as an auditor will feel better if the pc is miserable comm cycle is awry but this could happen in various ways from the pcs point of view some comm cycle has begun it hasnt been fully detected and it hasnt been understood that is the basis of low arc or arc breaks in your pcs even when the pc doesnt have an arc break realizing this point will help you understand something about your pc that you hadnt seen before keep on figuring out whether you are bypassing any charge the basis of low arc or arc breaks is 1 some comm cycle has begun 2 it hasnt been fully detected but has been slightly detected 3 it hasnt been understood actually in any pc you are going to see an out comm cycle because he isnt ot the telepathic cycle is usually out there can be the mundane result of the pc not having ever understood the command and at least faintly knowing it the reason that it is an arc break is that the nonunderstanding brings in and r it is the and r factors that tend to make the c not understood something didnt go through an incomplete comm cycle always results in bpc you should know that that simple little outness can bring the living lightning you should also know that the cause and effect always work in that direction the catastrophe that you are handling has simple little outness as its origin not complex bear the basic things that wont go through and get detected are r and c and the basic things that these three face are m s and t so you have the livingness of the person arc vs the material universe or mest or it is the individual vs time that is what keeps the k and c from completing the communication cycle there is lie in the individuals communication with time or with times communication with the individual bypassed charge originates as the beginning of comm cycle that is not wholly detected or understood charge is energy excited and channeled to go in certain direction but it never arrives because it is not wholly detected or understood so it always remains as bpc then explodes in dispersal of some sort it does not always explode sometimes it just results in downtone pc who is not feeling so well lately we know the magic of the explosive nature of interpersonal relationships knowing these things you should be able to handle session better dont be afraid that handling means always doing what the pc says just let the pc know that you got his origination and understood it and go ahead and do what you are doing youve got to be an expert in the detection of communication that has begun the better you are the fewer arc breaks youll have the arc break assessment covers the number of types of comm that can be started and not detected in the activity you are doing so that you can find the correct bpc and not have to shotgun it with something like an earlier incident was restimulated deciding which list to use could be problem look in the right place if the arc break is in the session and you do an r3r arc break form you wont find it therefore use the right list if you dont get the bpc you are using the wrong list get the right one just realize that deciding which is the right list could be problem and use another list if you didnt find she arc break the main mistake you could make is not to be sure everything is 341fine with the pc after you have handled the arc break make sure that you are right about the bpc lists locate the type of charge bypassed the type of comm cycle that began and was never completed now its up to you to locate and indicate to the pc the charge the charge is not on the list it is in the pc the assessment is not the location even though the magic is good enough so that you can often get result just by indicating what was assessed you only actually get type of charge not the charge with the assessment you must still locate and indicate the specific charge if you tell the pc what you got on the assessment and he feels better fine let sleeping dogs lie but if he doesnt feel better or if there is still charge there find the exact charge that was bypassed you may need another list to get it so there are five steps to handling bpc with an arc break assessment 1 find out if there is an arc break 2 assess the appropriate list 3 locate the exact bpc 4 indicate it to the pc 5 check whether the indication was all right with the pc if it is wrong date check the ones you have gotten or see if it is in the first or the last half of the session 6307c25 shspec290 comm cycle in auditing illustrations for this lecture are contained in hcob 74aug63 lecture graphs most auditors early on get the idea that there are all kinds of pcs good and bad there are pcs who are nervier about comm breakdowns than others but practically pc can stand up against good comm cycle the difficulty an auditor has comes from his own auditing cycle and his impatience there are two comm cycles in the auditing comm cycle one with the auditor at cause one with the pc at cause they are only connected by the fact that the auditor has calculatedly restimulated something in the pc which the pc discharges on his half of the cycle that is the whole game of the auditing cycle some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc if the pc doesnt answer the auditing question he never gets rid of the restimulation if the pc alterises eg if he alterises the question or if he alterises the data from the bank then every restimulation gives rise to an alteris the cycle of acknowledgment is another little shadow cycle fadeout another shadow cycle is the auditor seeing that the pc has received the auditing command you can tell by locking at him that he didnt get it or that he is doing something peculiar with it so do look at the pc to find out so there are really seven comm cycles in the auditing cycle the four main ones plus three more 1 observing that the pc is ready to receive the auditing command failure to do this one can cause trouble if the pc is hung up on the previous cycle he doesnt really get the command if he wasnt ready to receive it 2 observing that the pc got the acknowledgment 3 tiny one before the acknowledgment which is seeing whether the pc has or hasnt said all he is going to say if you acknowledge him before he has said all you havent let one line flow to its end so the acknowledgment cant actually go through and the lines jam when you violate one of these comm cycles you will get trouble in which case you might need more cycles to unsnarl it so the auditing cycle can occur 342theres another comm cycle inside the auditing cycle which is between the pc and the bank you have an effect produced by the auditing command which results in cause the restimulation causing the pc to outflow it is actually two comm cycles there pc to bank and bank to pc then you get pc to auditor the latter is actually the least important of the cycles except when it isnt being done and it is the hardest to detect when it isnt being done what is mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused some of the comm cycles within it when you are doing complicated action like r2h if you are nervy on handling basic tool like the auditing cycle break it down and work on it while doing something simple on an easy pc then you will find out where it is jammed up there is different auditing cycle inside the regular auditing cycle which occurs when the pc originates just handle it as its own drill it handles any origin including the pc throwing down the cans the pattern of causedistanceeffect is reversed because the pc is now being cause at the start of the cycle what the pc causes has to be understood so there can be some little comm cycles where the auditor gets it clarified what the auditor uses to clarify it mustnt just cause the pc to repeat himself tell some more about that is good approach but whatever you use isnt rote once the origination has been clarified the auditor acknowledges and can then resume the regular cycle if the pc is ready for it also at the beginning of the pcs origination cycle the auditor should observe that the pc is about to originate and shut up and make the comm cycle of im listening the fact that duplication is part of the comm cycle carries it over into r c and u this makes the auditing comm cycle different from the military comm cycle which doesnt require understanding military cycle causedistanceeffectcompliance auditing cycle causedistanceeffectunderstanding hence the auditing comm cycle involves and r too there has to be and r at the effect point because of duplication and there had better be and r at the cause point also so there should be arc at both the cause point and the effect point the trs handle comm cycles from one side or another full auditing cycle would need fulldress tr above what is covered in trs 04 and r come into tr1 it is one thing to enunciate syllables clearly and another to have an understandable communication r is involved it has to be duplicatable an accent can get in the way of duplication it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible from the point of view of accent diction and sense since if the auditor is not comprehended by the pc tr1 is out and comm cycle or auditing takes place then there is the pc who doesnt want to be audited at all here you have to establish comm cycle with some trick like tell why you shouldnt be audited or if the pc ia misemotional and the is out you can do an arc break assessment in order to pick up what is awry with the comm cycles between the pc and himself where the bpc lies repetitive auditing cycle is specialized activity it gets you in trouble if you dont realize that there is point beyond which you shouldnt be trying to complete the cycle that point is an ability regained that ep is of senior importance the major auditing cycle has as its ep ability regained junior to that is the process cycle which in turn is made up of single auditing cycles repeated as needed so the cycles that exist in auditing are 1 single auditing cycle 2 process cycle 3 major auditing cycle indications of flatness in process cycle are 1 three equal comm lags with the pc confidently doing the process 2 minor cognition win 3 ta flat 3434 major cognition 5 ability regained the above eps are given in ascending order of seniority 1 and 2 are both absolute minimums the first real flat point is when all the ta has been run out of process major cognition takes precedence over the ta criterion to continue over major cognition invalidates the pc the senior ep is ability regained which is also the ep of major auditing cycle 6308c06 shspec291 auditing comm cycles definition of an auditor that mixture which is not shaken stagnates for that reason we have checksheet changes people who ask for changes in organizational structure overlook the fact that the character of this planet and its population makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet it takes incredible stress and planning to get anything done on the backtrack one ia used to operating with ease and swiftness this planet is different this planet was part of federation and passed out of its control due to war etc this federation has been called the markab confederacy this sounds spaceoperaish but if it is true is should be stated whether it is acceptable or not the planets of the confederacy united out of fragments of earlier civilizations over the past 200000 years but it is not native to this galaxy in the past 200000 years mental implanting has been taking place that is not native to earlier track the markabians have the basic problem of how to kill thetan the best way to hide your overts is to give someone amnesia and tell them that something else happened thats what is going on here their ideal is the conformist what they are conforming to is pretty scummy and lowtoned their standard choice citizen is the contented wage slave this leaves the artist the brilliant engineer the manager the criminal and the pervert all persona non grata they are afraid of all these types so they condemn them to perpetual amnesia calling it being dead forever then they ship them here so on this planet we have minimal number of workers and maximal number of artists geniuses managers criminals and perverts how do you make an organization out of these dudes they are all non conformists therefore the difficulty you get in organizations with these people is alteris this has led to civilization on this planet that is totally different from the civilization that planted it here until recently when current western civilization started to look like the markab confederacy the fact that current western civilization has the same image as the markab confederacy makes this civilization restimulative it makes it look dangerous one of the highest crimes in the markab civilization is error in income tax that makes matters relating to income tax very restimulative here the material of the betweenlives area is contained in what to audit history of man pp 6566 the markabians have not launched big reaction to the fact that their secrets are out probably because they fear that landing in force would restore everyones memory and blow the amnesia people get mad at governments and organizations on this planet because they are really mad at the markabian government almost unbelievable force was used by the markabians to create the amnesia you can easily restimulate peoples amnesia by giving them some data about the markabians it seems very unreal to them as an auditor therefore you are handling the roughest case in the universe to rehabilitate the individual you have to rehabilitate his knowingness charge on the case represents lost knowingness as the case moves up the line you get an odd phenomenon the case remembers more one kind of memory that is restored is picture memory at an advanced state the pc can tell the difference between false and genuine picture he graduates up to simply knowing without depending on pictures up to point of knowing who and where he has been independent of crossproof knowingness is slow to increase but it does rise over the top of that identityknowingness which is still rather general comes detailed knowingness eg knowing how you got here why you are here and other details of the past without pictures that is the restoration of the beingness of the individual it returns gradually bit by bit along this gradient what does it take to bring about such total amnesia total explosion of spaceship in his face twice was enough to be little confusing to lrh it takes far more force than that to destroy someones memory to the point where he would have case the force also has to be combined with trickery scrambling dates giving balanced items etc to keep the thetans memories scrambled 344the amount of force it took is what the auditor has to get off the case its easier for the auditor and the pc to confront things like unknownness than to confront force but the force must be confronted eg in running ow getting off critical thoughts does nothing for the case theres something done behind it which contains energy and must be gotten off it is the energy contained in done that makes it hard to confront harder to confront than some random think the mission of an auditor is the restoration of persons awareness which includes restoration of his memory his identity what holds it down is force used with trickery thus an individual gets an arc break with force and then becomes the effect of force so you are handling someone who has lots of arc breaks with beings matter energy space time location and form that is pc an auditor has to be somebody who can release this force from the pc ta movement registers relief of force in the reactive mind force is being removed from the case as long as the ta is in motion when force is aberrated by trickery the ta hangs up until the trickery eg wrong dates is handled you dont always have to run process to get the ta moving ie particular curative process if the ta is moving the pc will eventually go ot auditing in the absence of ta motion will never produce an ot if you run the right significance off the case and get ta action you will make an ot quicker but running the right significances without ta wont do it while getting ta alone on anything right or not will eventually give you an ot if might take thousands of hours if you audited person randomly ia motion indicates the blowing off of encysted force as it leaves the case when you run the right significances it speeds up the case because you are running the force off early track and you get extra charge blowing which doesnt all show up on the meter sometimes you will see repetitive blowdown as remote force area blows up the most fundamental method of making ta move is not running process it is the basic definition of an auditor listener it is up to the auditor to permit the pc to blow the mass that has been restimulated by the process which he does by listening his basic job is to listen not to restimulate we can get away with restimulating charge because we can talk to each other the only way to get rid of reactive charge is by communication line that is the only method cf axiom 51 the auditor only gets hit by the charge if he stops it from flowing across the comm line all therapies from time immemorial have consisted of listening but what makes auditing different is the ta action which the auditor produces by restimulating charge and letting the pc blow the restimulated charge the auditor gives the command it crosses the distance and hits the bank square in confrontable aberrated area the bank now causes an effect on the pc the pc now becomes cause as he tells the auditor about it answering the question the pc gains some knowingness when he observes what happens when the command reaches him additionally life is always giving commands to the pc and restimulating all sorts of charge as the pc tells you about his betweensessions activities with or without sincemidruds ta occurs as he gets that restimulation communicated to you this shows that the line from the pc to the auditor is little senior to and more important than the auditors line to the pc in the former line you will find all auditing failures providing any process at all has been run if the case was loused up by auditing we inspect the ta in judging particular process if there was ta on the process the process was ok as far as getting the causedistance effect of the pc to the auditor goes when that line goes out the restimulation flows back to hit the pc where else can it go you see the first symptom of that line going out in the pcs dirty needle the auditor isnt listening he is doing something to shut the pc up the line with the pc at cause may take many times as long as the one from auditor to pc as the pc examines something undoes identification gets force off and gains knowingness the more ta action you get the more positive the pc sounds even in just one auditing cycle ta blowdown accompanies returning knowingness on the part of the pc the names of these main lines in the auditing cycle are the whatsit line from auditor to pc and the itsa line from pc to auditor the tone arm follows pattern it goes up on whatsit possibly the reverse happens on lowta case and it comes down on an itsa high ta shows you restimulated but unresolved charge when charge flows across the comm line it asises and the ta moves down knowing scientology if you were in the galactic confederation now you would be enthroned you could fix up all the messedup ots as long as you could listen in the confederation your pcs 345wouldnt have all the enforced amnesia you have to get rid of with an earth pc it would be like the difference between auditing an earth case and an ant the progression of events that occur when an itsa line goes out and is not restored is the following 1 dirty needle 2 stuck ta 3 arc break the itsa line is the most fruitful source of bpc charge restimulated and not allowed to flow out there are arc breaky pcs there are only auditors who dont listen the only crime you can commit by letting the pc talk is to do it without getting ta action what about the pc who is just talking motivators well they dont get ta from it besides someone who is just motivating is already in an arc break so you should find the bpc so that the itsa line which is the the same as just talk can get in again so let the pc talk as long as you are getting ta action and longer dont acknowledge just look intelligent and nod if the pc looks brighter at you this is case level 2 see above for description of this level auditing by the way if the pc is telling you all about the track lower down the case levels you have to direct the pcs attention more 6308c07 shspec292 r2h fundamentals r2h is one of the most satisfying processes you have ever run for description of r2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment it takes apart arc breaks by assessment however it falls apart with inexpert handling it is different from any process we have ever had in dianetics and scientology it has great power it will run engrams and secondaries and may be senior to r3r the only thing it wont run is gpm which must be run with r3m and r3n r3m gets you the patterns of wildcat engrams r3m is how you got the gpm patterns in the first case in r3m dont ask the crisscross question on oppose i would ask what does the next pair consist of or give the oppterm of the third pair then what would oppose that r3n presupposes that you have the reliable items on some pcs if they dont random list you dont get ta random listing gets off the locks so you must still do this even if you have the item the main thing that causes the ta to rise and stick in r3n is wrong date or wrong gpm pattern cut itsa line will additionally send the ta up and stick it gpm is hard to date and floats on the track because its purpose was to foul up time the opposing items firing at each other sound like time to the pc the gpm floats in time and produces nochange situation this makes it perilously easy to misdate one also there is an implant basic to the helatrobus implants but much earlier which looks the same as the helatrobus implant it is at about trillions4 1048s years ago it is far more aberrative than the helatrobus implants that ia the one that they put on the screens in the betweenlives area see history of man pp 6566 gpms are the only things that need to be audited with special technique r2h has the potential for running wholetrack engrams and secondaries better than r3r by taking all the bpc out of them and letting them snap back to where they should be on the track we are not actually trying to erase everybodys time track in toto we are trying to take out of the time track the things that prevent the pc from having his pictures we are trying to pull the pcs havingness up to the point where he doesnt need pictures in order to know who he is if you can take the charge off of his unconfrontable pictures pictures that deny the knowledge of the track to him he can have pictures or not as he chooses the main pictures that louse things up are gpms however because the betweenlives implant has the target of invalidating all your pictures restimulating implants and wiping out identity and memory many people who are upset about auditing might think that you are trying to do this telling the pc that you are going to erase his time track will therefore cause an overwhelm lrh was thinking about outer space tactics and figured that lack of comm is the main trouble he speculated about entering societies from within with communication and wondered what would happen if we put up markab headquarters complete with flag etc they when they arrive they would think we are still loyal etc but the reaction of the earths population to the symbols could be rather wild the point is that when you tell the pc that you are going to erase his time track he goes 346into propitiative anaten because that is what has been done however if he had heard that you were going to return him his pictures he would feel very different pictures if inimical can be disowned the pcs real trouble is the pictures that keep him from seeing his pictures of course they are his pictures too but he disowns them you are only trying to pick out and handle pictures that bar other pictures when you have done this you will wind up with case level 2 see p 414 above with all his pictures then you can get at the automatic mechanism of picturemaking and place it under the pcs determinism whereupon you have got an ot level 1 see above there is an interesting point that can occur in auditing where the pc may disown the time track and just say well i dont know who i am but i am from there on you can have the track back with knowingness you could go at this another way instead of erasing pictures bring up the pcs confront on pictures to the point where he could face the hostile ones and understand them without flinching or misowning them this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach except that it gets the pc to confront his pictures r2h well run can give the pc greater ownership of pictures and it makes the pictures better and prettier life and beingness consist of potentials and abilities not things but the ability or potential to have r and c degree of livingness is measured by arc how much arc is guy capable of and degree of arc is measured by the amount of livingness person is capable of think of it as potential for having affinity what is arc arc with with other beings usually communication with other beings goes out through mest ie it uses mest vias one usually has arc with other beings through mest one can however communicate telepathically even without high arc in some civilizations there are such things as telepathic vocotypers telepathy is hardhitting force it can pick up the thoughts or fears of thetan down the line who is also being subjected to implanting arc can also go way above telepathy below certain level arc depends on mest for its communication medium arc only really gets important after one drops away from telepathic communication because it is so present before then that one thinks of it when you introduce mest into comm lines arc becomes the measure of life so one could be in arc with thetans matter energy space time form or location those are the principal things to be in arc with see fig 16 the arc an individual has expresses the degree to which he can be at cause over thetans matter energy space time form and location the potential of arc of the individual gives the degree to which he can be at cause over the things of life the less life he has the less he is as thetan gets more and more solid he can have less and less arc because he must have gone out of arc with mest form and location or it wouldnt be piled on him without his choice so he must have had arc breaks with these things but how could he without having arc breaks with other thetans it is probable that he did have arc breaks with other thetans and it was having arc breaks with other thetans that led him normally to have arc breaks with mest form and location not necessarily but normally the more the arc the more direct the communication the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication so as the thetan rises up the line he rises back up to direct communication direct reality and direct affinity with other beings when you drop away from telepathy you enter mest into the line and arc becomes subordinate to mest the less the arc the more you need mest to get across communication then you get very low where thetan communicates to mest not just through it man is not mud but man who wasnt alive at all would think muddily and reach mudlike confused conclusions that is the condition of other mental sciences today their adherents are so far away from other beings that they are talking to mest not through it this is like the kid beating his red wagon or cussing mest objects this situation is different from investing mest with life and other determining it which is on another harmonic you are perfectly capable of mocking up living being or investing matter with life and then otherdetermining it and having it walk around and talk this is potential discussed in dianetics the evolution of science apparently in the form of discussion of installing demon circuits in the mind see pp 32 60617 but what if you felt that another living being is more capable than shoe what if you divested living being of life that is how far south people have gone arc breaks with thetans matter energy space time form and location bring about the dwindling spiral of decreased arc one believes that it is deteriorated but it never really deteriorates r2h 347forecasts that by clearing up persons arc breaks the auditor returns to the pc his arc potential by cleaning up arc breaks with mest things you can clean up arc breaks with pictures of those things in the reactive mind hence the reactive mind becomes more accessible and confrontable since thetans matter energy space time form and location are what the pictures in the bank are images of thus in auditing one clears up arc breaks with things in pictures that the pc cannot confront in his reactive mind therefore the bank becomes more confrontable and it opens up the basic concept of r2h is that the reactive mind is reservoir of arc breaks space space is the cure for noconfront the button of the bank is space so that it is right on top of you time you get an apparent absence of time in the reactive bank in the presence of totality of time you get nothing where something is and something where nothing is thats what makes the bank reactive instantaneous response regardless of when the response was laid in form this relates to aesthetic taste the pcs reactive mind has closeup stockpile of those forms that the pc has detested the most location an example is running an australian incident as being in england or you are poking around planets that are lightyears away without knowing it when you run such things they may spring back to their proper locations the problem is identification or disassociation disassociation is the reverse of identification two things which should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different r2h helps the pc to differentiate all the identifications of thetans mest forms and locations that he is afflicted with you could also run into disassociation if you really put in the itsa line the pc will be giving you all the disassociations he runs into as he looks over whatever it takes to answer your question he should see similarity between your question and his answer but he doesnt at first so you will get nonsequitur responses these are things that are on the pcs mind as he tries to answer the question hence to get them off his mind he says them the thing to do here is to wait until the disassociation is run out eventually the pc will answer the question disassociation is an inversion of identification which also gives an inversion of arc you get restimulation factor that works this way 1 the pc knew girl with pink hair 2 therefore girls with pink hair arent to be trusted 3 therefore nothing pink must be trusted 4 the pc knows fellow named pink who brushes his teeth so he had better not brush his teeth any more below disassociation you go into an inversion and you get more identifications at lower levels good comm is shooting people arc doesnt just decline it inverts and then inverts again there is bottom but odd things happen on the way down beingnesses forms and memory can die but not the individual there is some method of communication all the way down because arc never ceases you can get into weird versions of reach and withdraw for instance you have to go through the anger band so if you can improve c r or you can keep raising the triangle by running arc breaks as in r2h the main limit of the process is the limit of communication of the command recall an arc break but that can be communicated with little work if need be furthermore it is therapeutic to someone just to comprehend the definition of arc break you dont care what the pc is arc broken with in gpms you may get arc breaks with mest for obeying implanters and with implanters for debasing mest to this use it is an upscale case that recognizes real arc break with mest it all works out if you just follow the formal structure of r2h 1 ask for an arc break 2 get what it was 3483 get where it was 4 get when it was 5 do an assessment cleaning every line as it reads 6 work the arc break over until the pc feels fine about it and it longer reads take what the pc gives you dont probe the pc may get into trouble getting when you use your meter to help out only when the pc is in despair about the time and has utterly given up then just tell him what you have seen reading that is your meterdating you can watch the meter while the pc gives possible dates repair of r2h 1 when the ta is hung up you have wrong date and you had better find it 2 you can also get in big midruds on the session or the process because the pc has recalled arc breaks that he has suppressed and that he hasnt told the auditor 3 the pc can arc break in the session because of an arc break in the past 4 you may have missed read on the assessment so you dont have the right bpc when you get read on line of the r2h assessment be sure to take it up with the pc by getting the pc to tell you more specific data about the reading line eg on had some emotion been rejected you must find out what emotion was rejected dont just indicate the generality to the pc since that wont handle the arc break it is not the correct bpc if this doesnt work then one of the factors listed above under repairs is out if the pc protests line fine dont shove it down his throat but come back to it later it just wasnt ready to be answered you should get bds on finding the correct bpc if you dont get bds with running arc breaks you are going to have trouble with future arc breaks you must find the bpc getting one doesnt necessarily mean the arc break is fully cleaned up so check with the pc and notice the meter after you have gotten one bd you ask the pc how he feels about the arc break and watch the meter like hawk if the meter is clean and the pc ia ok now dont go on or you will be after withhold of nothing and you will create an arc break do not keep cleaning clean if the arc break isnt clean continue running it it doesnt matter how many arc breaks you handle per session what matters is how much ta you get dont leave an arc break until it reads smooth as glass if an arc break doesnt blow down you are asking for future trouble because you have bypassed some charge without cleaning it up the mechanism that you are operating on is that the incident will blow if the misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out and that arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge if you find the bpc there wont be an arc break and the pcs bank will straighten out clearing an arc break depends on itsa the slippiness of the process of running an arc break depends on knowing when to leave it and letting the pc get charge off with itsa you could theoretically get the pc all the way to ot with this just by getting the charge off 6308c08 shspec293 r2h assessment the original meaning of the symbol 8 has to do with money it represents two money bags one on top of the other how can you evolve list 1 for r2h this has really taken some doing r2h is process with new rationale it is the case level 2 process see above for description of level 2 it is not just headed at ot but it would give you free needles as clear waystop in many cases you would get keyout phenomena that would give you the straightenedout track that would look very like case level 2 it is really only keyout but it would have the attributes of clear if you combined it with r3n when necessary to get gpms out of the way it would take you to case level 1 recent policy letter 30jul63 current planning gave series of scientology levels 349scn 1 pe level scientology scn 2 healing care of the body contains hpahca scn 3 advanced auditing and academy courses leading up to the phenomenon of clear scn 4 research towards ot this contains the present material r2h r3r r3n scn 5 social political and organizational scientology or what an ot does about it the various levels compare with the classifications of auditors which is convenient it puts more order into the subject and its materials class 1 he can listen class 2 he can do cchs run repetitive processes or cure something class 3 he can make better human being class 4 he can make an ot class 5 he can make sane universe r2h can be used at scientology levels 2 3 and 4 it is phenomenal to have process that can be used at so many levels it would be putting lot of stress on the theory of arc to ask of r2h that it reach into level 4 and some holes in what we knew of arc showed up r2h turns out to be inadequate for certain kinds of work the only frailty of r2h given an auditor who listens and meter that reacts is in the list used if one specific type of charge was missing from list and you used that list on all arc breaks that specific type of charge would tend to charge up on the case it would be restimulated and encysted eventually it would gum up the track and overwhelm the pc so the weak point of r2h is the embraciveness of the list used lrh cooked up all sorts of fancy systems and finally hit on the formula that would give an embracive list it is very simple like the itsa line the full derivation formula is as follows the cdei scale has an upper and lower band which were previously missing known and unknown go above cdei you never get curious about something you know about so knowingness must have disintegrated down to unknownesses therefore things must be unknown before you enter cdei at all in the logics we have had the datum an unknown can cause confusion so that is how it fits in actually this is not in the logics dianetic axioms 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity and 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data may be relevant here the know at the top of this expanded cdei scale is below notknow the first postulatesee p 14 above the know on this expanded cdei scale is evidently equivalent to know about the second postulate unknow on this scale then is evidently equivalent to forget the third postulate unknow is not the same as notknow you never get curious about something you know about so unknow would have to intervene between know and curious about on this scale below cdei there is lower band nothing an absence nothing to inhibit that is the black panther mechanism of ignore it man routinely does nothing about things below that there is one more level falsify falsifying puts something else there so that now you can get the whole scale again on an inversion the false at the bottom of one scale becomes the known at the top of the lower inversion scale so there is known falseness then unknown falseness then curious about the falseness etc all the way down so you get perversions of perversions falsifications of falsifications as you descend into lower and lower inversions of the scale so in this universe one probably never sees know but always form of false finally you get modern science based on the false premise that man is mud the pure cdei scale wouldnt handle engrams because it was incomplete and didnt invert the way the full scale does the pure cdei scale still shows only one band say 2010 of the tone scale whereas every time you go through one cycle of this expanded cdei scale you drop 70 on the tone scale 350now you can look at arc for an incident and arc for an earlier incident to each level of the expanded cdei scale we also add missed withhold and all this dives you the list 1 containing the totality of all possible combinations of charge on an arc break all possible levels that will have all possible reactions for everybody so combining them youve got attitude reality communication and missed withhold on each of the eight questions plus all these on earlier incidents giving you total list 1 with 64 questions that is how you would evolve list 1 if you were off in the boondocks you could use this schema by assessing the cdei scale on the incident first then assessing the level with r c and missed withhold the current list 1 is really the inhibit scale you wouldnt have to put in kucdeiof on missed withhold on lower level cases some on the levels of the expanded cdei scale are null anyway you can eliminate k u c d and 0 leaving you with i and f as the most potent sources of arc breaks because of the low case level with which you are dealing so for beginning cases this would leave 16 question list as you go upscale you find after awhile that your list falls short so that you have to add as too much someone at case level 2 would need still more expanded list dont have anything missing on list 1 the dale carnegie course is course in the creation of and maintenance of false realities psychiatry isnt even up to this lower case levels probably need emotion on the scale as well as attitude representing affinity in order for it to communicate to the pc after all the whole knowtomystery scale can go under affinity you might wonder why we dont expand this schema to include overt the answer is that ow mushes engrams and ruins pictures overts and prepcheck buttons ruin the energy structure of an engram because of gpms etc the buttons are too powerful and fundamental it takes certain amount of aberration to hold the picture together ao that you can run it but the buttons of arc and cdei only strip charge out of the engrams and make pictures better big midruds are ok for use on the physical universe as in ruds because the physical universe wont unmock easily at lower case levels however perhaps when the pc gets up the line into case level 1 using big midruds on the physical universe would be dangerous too we dont want the list to be too beefed up so that it mushes things up too much that would defeat the purposes of r2h the heaviest button on the list turns out to be falsity that is what the thetan objects to most and it is also what he feels guiltiest about falsity aberrates because it destroys trust it is part of every theta trap and it accounts for lots of arc breaks with mest the way to get the most ta out of list would be to go down the list preassessing it then take the biggest read and have the pc explain and itsa about it method 5 sometimes when you use this method some pcs will drag the bpc that got restimulated on an earlier part of the assessment on through the rest of the list with him such pcs would do better being cleaned up level by level as you go along method 3 but if you do it that way the major charge that would give you bd has been bled of charge to the point that this major charge wont read much on the list you should therefore take any change of characteristic as read you get that difficulty in exchange for dirty needle the best solution might be preassessment that narrows the search too abbreviated list leaves you with bpc and high ta charge moves the time wrong in an incident the incident is charged say because of something that happened in 1912 but the incident is in 1920 you could miss this leaving bpc and eventually getting stuck high ta from the wrong date process that would be ta pump would be recall worry what was it about from this you get ta pump consisting of an alternating whatsit and itsa this is not particularly therapeutic one other point what if you had pc who got ta but got better his failure to get better would be an apparency eventually he would go ot but it could take thousands of years however you also have to run the right significances you also have to complete cycles case change may result from shifting processes on the pc that you were getting ta on with this happening the case could still get better but uncomfortably also you can restimulate things on case that dont get handled for some time for instance you could early on get screenrestimulated engrams that could not be run out right away this would be an unnecessary restimulation of charge getting better is not how the pc feels but whether he is getting more knowingness and more ability also current state is not measure of getting better for instance person may have had good memory and awareness level and had it knocked out in the last betweenlives this then would be temporary condition you have to review case over at least thirty days to know what the true state of affairs is 3516308c14 shspec294 auditing tips 1 audit to gain for result 2 the pc is always right 3 the significance is less important than the ta action 4 ta action on the right significance brings about faster clearing 5 the right significance and ta action equals case gain 6 keep the itsa line in 7 get ta action 8 when training an auditor get him to figure out how many ways you can cut an itsa line the smoothest auditing is the auditing which least cuts the itsa line auditor means listener 9 it takes lie to hold aberration in place 10 serious aberration surrenders easily its the mediocretype aberration that takes the long haul 11 the primary difference between scientology and psychiatry is that psychiatry is authoritarian and tells the person what is wrong with him often introducing new lie scientology finds out what is wrong with the person from the person and then knows more about it than the person but listens anyway 12 listening is the badge of superior knowledge he who has privileged to listen only he who has superior knowledge talks all the time with this data you could evolve all of scientology dont discount the knowledge of scientology even though you dont use it to evaluate for the pc if pc feels unreal about having lived for say 30 trillion years let him go through the unreality and run it out he will natter about how unreal it is he has never talked about an unreality before but in the process of talking about it he is raising his arc with whatever it is albeit slowly pc has two kinds of talk theta talk and entheta talk auditing consists of two actions corresponding to these two kinds of talk 1 listening with ta action this is getting theta talk out of the pc keeping the itsa line in it is theta the pc is generating that is blowing his bank apart 2 locating eg by assessment trapped charge entheta talk is handled by locating the impeded charge of theta which is barriered in the bank bpc this is the first step of putting in the itsa line find what trapped charge is trying to get loose the pc is talking up out of the bank he has been protesting cut communication lines unrealities and lack of affinity charge has been ticked and missed and the pc will go on nattering unless the auditor locates and indicates the charge what about talking havingness down this only occurs when it is entheta talk the whole phenomenon of havingness is raising arc with the environment if the pc is cutting his arc with the environment his havingness will drop how many ways can you cut an itsa line it would be beneficial to an auditor in training to give you all the ways he can think of it with an example of each and how to prevent or remedy it there are three parts to successful session 1 get the pc in session ie interested in his own case and talking about it 2 keep the itsa line in so that you get maximal ta action 3523 knock out the significances necessary to resolve the case fastest the above would define the superskilled auditor you would get lower classes of auditors as you cut out parts of this until you end up at the bottom with book auditor whose skill is just to listen to the pc talk about his case with idea of ta or right significance when training auditors pound one significance home at time dont get complicated and you will win for instance on coaudit just keep the pc talking about himself dont worry about repeating the command or acknowledging etc all you want is the pc telling the auditor about his troubles you can see improvements if the pc looks brighter and talks better ie if he shows increased arc as you move the auditors skill up to using meter you want to get ta motion keeping the ta moving is the deepest problem in auditing at present this can get complex the reason ta stops is time the type of incident that is the most tastopping is the gpm especially after it has been redated crossdated or grouped in one of the betweenlives screens and after it has been mislocated if there were gpm probably nobody could group bank the gpm gets pinned down in the betweenlives screens and ta stops it is timestopper because it floats in time and appears instantaneous the auditing action that stops ta motion is wrong date it tends to group incidents if the incident is 3d visio and stays in the same place as you run it the date is ok if person is running different incidents at once he has wrong date if you wrongdate gym it is grim ta stops as if hit by truck it is possible to date gpm but the reads on dates are tiny because it is gpm and it is very rough to date it after you have dated gpm the date is as valid as you get ta if ta packs up the gpm is very likely to have been misdated you could find that you have to redate gpm when the pc gets off enough charge to spot that the first date was screen date your new date could still be only temporarily right you could go for seven sessions getting it dated which could be very fine if you kept the itsa line in and let the pc help you most of the track you see is real track but it is often invalidated false track is nothing because there really is false track there are false pictures but false track is just the dubin someone has put over his actual pictures if you invalidate someones track hard enough and hit him hard enough he puts dubin over the top of the picture which looks like the original except that it has little film over it as you audit it the film comes off and he sees the original picture the dubin is not very different from his own track actually the unreality the pc gets about the picture is the force and invalidation that has been laid in if you hit someone hard enough things get unreal down to unconsciousness unconsciousness is just total unreality so there are also arc break phenomena which prevent the meter from reading well that is one reason why the meter reads so little on gpms they are full of arc brokenness but if you just keep trying to date the gpm and dont cut the itsa line you will get ta having the itsa line in and blowing charge will increase the pcs reality on the incident to the point where the date is more and more real bundles of facsimiles will start to come apart if you just keep chewing at gpm in this way chewing at its date its pattern etc it will suddenly be there so clearly that you will wonder how you ever missed it you are getting enough charge off so that he can see it keeping the itsa line in while dating is very helpful but hard to do at times let the pc give you anything he can tell you about the date get all the ta out of it first and only go to the meter when the pc throws in the sponge then work it over and when it is all hopeless with the meter talk from the pc takes over keep at it persevere and relax it might take up to seven sessions to get the date the stable datum is that if you keep chewing away and trying to find it suddenly enough charge will disappear so it all folds up and you get it just keep him talking and he will come up with it but the more you ask the meter for the data the less you will win you can kill ta by evaluating because the itsa line is being put in for him dont put in the itsa line for the pc the meter gives you preview of coming attractions meter reads at deeper level of awareness than the pc when some charge is blown the pc will now see what the meter saw awhile earlier you say whatsit and the pc says itsa this is auditing but if the pc says whatsit and you use the meter to say itsa the ta folds up this will occur if you create meterdependency it is better if you must tell the pc what the meter says to present it as question if you put in the whatsit and get itsa from the meter you will get ta action if you have pc demanding information you can help him out it is more desirable to use the meter than to have the pc quit sometimes you have to snap in the itsa line try to get the pc certain before using the meter then you may use the meter but get the pcs agreement first as an itsa eg concerning the date you can work back and forth with the pc and the meter using the meter to jog the whatsit eg to get the order of magnitude then ask the pc if he gets anything let him find it if he asks does that read see if you can get him to say itsa eg by asking does it seem right to you then when he has said itsa you can confirm it with that reads 353one way to cut an itsa line is by continually asking for more than the pc can give for instance the pc says proudly ive got picture of some mountains the auditor says what kind of mountains are there any people or when the pc says i just cant find the date i dont have clue the auditor says well come on what is it this stretches an itsa line beyond its ability to stretch the situation is that you have bled off all the restimulation that was available so stir up little more by using the meter on one step or so of dating the pc easily invalidates his own reality and ability to know date dont above all use the meter to invalidate him it is better to leave the charge on something than to arc break the pc about it if he gives you date and asks for meter confirmation and there is read make it as ok as possible for instance you could say well i didnt see one there it doesnt say anything right now on that use your meter to give him the whatsit line and coax the itsa line at last resort all you have is your meter like when there is howling arc break and the pc isnt talking or thinking that applies to sessions where the pc is out of comm you can cut an itsa line to ribbons with arc break assessments as the drop of hat the value of the assessment is when all else has failed because the most operating thing you have around you is the pc the problem of how you discharge gpm without cutting the itsa line is tricky one what if he is going over one pair of items and the next pair comes up and he wants to go on if you leave bypassed charge on the items you are doing he will arc break one solution is to write down the new pair acknowledge them and then clean up the old pair the whatsit line raises ta the itsa lowers it the solution of mystery is the resolution of the case and the restoration of ta motion the pc is stuck on whatsit for which he has itsa when the ta quits the pc sometimes has his own whatsits he forgets the whatsit you gave him and never gives the itsa so you get high ta pcs do this all the time especially during break hence you could ask is there anything your attention is on or did you speculate about anything during the break the funny thing is that asising whatsits doesnt give you auditing you cant asis whatsits you could ask get the idea of questioning things repetitively this would give you high ta the bank is composed of cure to the problem or puzzle the reason that the puzzle is hung up is that there is something in it that was cure cures brought about problems to asis problems you have to pick up the cure which is the itsa the problem was the whatsit the cure is the itsa so you announce the confusion the pc gives you the stable datum and you get restoration of balance it blows off twoway comm blows all the locks off of engrams for instance if the pc says that he has big ptp you could ask when he became aware of it what solutions he has had for it etc so you need to find the whatsit and the itsa problem is in microcosm gpm you could ask what have you been puzzled about what answers might there have been to it auditing questions must balance between announcing the puzzle and asking for the cure 6308c15 shspec295 the tone arm meter that only had tone arm would be useful to teach auditors to keep the tone arm moving it should have the same numbers it should probably also have onehanded electrode it should be very small and rugged ideally it should be able to go through the bottom with stop you could hang it on the pc with belt and keep him on it for cchs it would show discharge of charge the minimum ta you should get is 025 divisions per twenty minutes 075divisions per hour small amount of ta is enough for healing needle blowoff is enough r3t or r2t consist of putting in the itsa line and dating even 01 division per twenty minutes is enough to blow somatic that is enough for healing but not enough to make the pc feel better as result of auditing this explains the oddity that dianetics heals chronic somatics with the pc not realizing that auditing had done anything you would heal the illness but the person still doesnt believe in dianetics you havent helped the person that was what drove us out of healing not the medicos auditors found it frustrating without understanding the ta it is doubtful if the auditor will ever be able to predict his result if you know about the ta you will know that if the pc got ta in session 1 he is liable to throw the auditor curve at the end of the session 2 he is liable to have some sort of upset within twentyfour hours 3543 you have restimulated charge because all auditing restimulates charge these phenomena are not inevitable the reason ow is not being stressed is that not all auditors seem able to restimulate overts they accept critical thoughts and motivators and miss all the pcs withholds any auditing that requires extraordinary targeting and restimulation becomes more difficult to do difficult part of auditing is in selecting the significances of restimulation which the auditor must engage in with the pc the degree of restimulation restimulated in the significance becomes an even greater level of skill eg the question of how much gpm you have to restimulate to get the gpm run the skillful auditor restimulates only the number of items he wants to run the less skilled the auditor the more items and gpms he restimulates in order to get one pair to run the whatsit line regulates restimulation on the whatsit line you should 1 know what you are going for 2 know what you have to get to 3 have heart and dont overrestimulate 4 avoid q and auditing works by restimulation and blowing of charge you can blow charge on an early incident of chain and have the later charge blow off without registering on the meter that speeds things up if you dont put in the itsa line and let the charge blow off the pc stacks it up and arc breaks etc etc not restimulating charge at all or restimulating too little charge equally result in noauditing this will give an arc break because the expectation of auditing not fulfilled will itself bleed charge which is then bypassed and will blow up restimulating too little charge or charge is worse than restimulating too much charge for instance you will get in bad trouble if you fail to run the pc through an engram twice because he is in pain incidently thetan in good shape probably enjoyed pain you can pick this up by asking the pc to waste some pain repetitively he will cognite that he can have it sadism isnt peculiar it is lower harmonic of an actual fact any sensation is better than sensation anything is better than nothing that is different from only being able to enjoy pain as thetan goes upscale he can stand more effect most newspaper reporters are unauditable if you try to audit them all you get is lot of missed withholds the reporters attention is all out there he has attention on his case this guy has lot of arc breaks he is dramatizing overts indicating bpc gives the pc control over his charge when you run circuit with charge on it it gets spongelike character then it starts picking up charge whether you want it to or not out of the intention that auditing will occur it will still bleed charge out of the bank and the pc will still arc break ta measures the adequacy of restimulation it shows that an adequate amount of charge is being restimulated and that it is adequately dispelled with the itsa line there is really miles of margin for error on either side of the ideal amount of restimulation where you will still get ta and case gain you can have the pc swamped and still get ta or you can be running the pc pretty shallow and still get ta there is lot of tolerance too much or too little restimulation beyond this margin of error causes cessation of ta the meter doesnt tell you if you are getting too much or too little restimulation most standard processing is strong enough that you are not restimulating too little charge auditors therefore dont worry much as long as there is some ta motion just doing any auditing at all guarantees some restimulation what you are auditing regulates how much charge you are restimulating using upperlevel processes you are only going to err by getting over restimulation since niagaras of charge are available if you are going through gpms without getting ta it is not because there is too little restimulation it is overrestimulation if there is too much charge the pc shuts it down and the ta locks up you can say that it is unreal to the pc but unreality consists of 1 force uncoordinated raw force 3552 invalidation 3 disagreement on the thought level so to say that something is too unreal to the pc is to say that there is too much charge on it the auditors problem is delicately to put the whatsit line in the right place so as to bleed off charge where the pc can confront it if the discharge line gets overloaded the pc will explode in an arc break the problem of the auditor therefore is not how to restimulate more charge it is not the problem of how to empty the atlantic ocean but how to bleed few drops off of it the pc may beg you for oneshot clear process here you see the working of the effect scale what the pc needs is some small effect some line to bleed charge that is small enough not to be dangerous he is very careful because everything is live wire if you run any pc at too high level it can become too much for his body while still being ok for continuing to get ta eg person with cancer is in an almost continuous arc break however if you go above the charge tolerance then thats it for the ta lrh comments on wilhelm reichs character armor wilhelm reich had an esoteric form of charge that he called orgone this sort of charge was thought to be involved in the buildup of arthritic deposits charge is also what caused things to break around jung and it is what gives people odd somatics acute or chronic acute charge destimulates in three to ten days if it keeps on being restimulated with opportunity to be destimulated or bled off one gets chronic somatics even then it takes periodic restimulation at the end of each lifetime to keep thetan as unaware and charged up as he is there is preparation series of gpms that have thirty to forty wrong dates apiece with command to return sandwiched between each of about eighty gpms the goals make life the opposite terminal they are all derogatory goals like to be wrong or to get caught your first indication that the pc is nearing his limit of restimulation is lessening of ta action by this time the pc is already past the point of comfortable charge level audit as delicately as possible at this point as you go on be sure the itsa line is very in and dont let any more charge get restimulated until you have cleaned up what you have do not let the pc dive into earlier track matter how eager he may be to do so that is how you get stuck tas haul out of there start getting thorough you can ordinarily trace back any ceased ta to some action that stirred up more charge than got handled for instance say we run the center goal out of the bear implant then we start running the rest of the goals suddenly we lose ta action we have just restimulated three or four out of five goals ie we have three or four gpms on restimulation that amount of charge stirred up eliminated ta motion the overcharged case is always the high ta case it is the whatsit line that is responsible for this over restimulation with resultant high or low ta even if it is life or the pc that put the whatsit line in the wrong thing to do is to get wore whatsit tell something you have been worried about is therefore not good process it is all whatsits for the pc to look at if you want to cure the overcharged case you could assess his problems to central one and ask what solutions have you had for this problem this allows the pc to itsa and thus permits the ta to come down the cures give you the itsa line get all the whatsits already in restimulation and get the solutions off that will give you itsa bring the ta down and get the ta into action when you finish one whatsit with itsas find another whatsit that is already there and finish it etc this is guaranteed to fix the ta find something small enough for the pc to let go of knowingness and reality dont increase unless you get charge off the case so the case knows that nothing has happened unless you increase his knowingness 6308c20 shspec296 the itsa line the itsa line is the pcs comm line to the auditor it is not always pursuant to the auditors whatsit sometimes it is pursuant to the pcs whatsit the auditing cycle is made up of concatenation of comm lines comm line can be very faint as with the attention line there may be lines preceding the attention line as the auditor gets the pc to put his attention on the auditor having an attention line already extant you convert it to an itsa line theres the situation where the pcs attention line is on something other than the auditor if the auditor is adroit he can flick it over to where he wants it for instance the pc says i cant stand wild parties blah blah it takes skill to flick the attention over to what you want the pc to talk about this is getting the itsa line in 356pc will always follow the leastcharged aberrative line with his ta action ta exists on the least charged aberrative line at any moment the mind is so regulated that it will not release charges that the pc considers too dangerous ta action ceases when you have too much charge you could bleed it off but you have gotten into too much charge and ta action equals case advance even if you get somatics off you can make it even worse by running the pc with ta action you can make the needle action cease too the longer you run case with ta action the more the case freezes up and the harder it will be to produce ta action the most likely way to get ta action on case is to get in the itsa line routine1c routine1 comm is the process that does this it is soft touch way of getting in the itsa line this is the workhorse it requires deftness but it gets in the itsa line on jammed overcharged case and it will restore ta action per btb 4dec71r i r1c r1c consists of 1 finding something that moves the ta 2 running the ta out of that subject to fn cog vgis the usual method of finding what to run in general r1c is by assessment of dynamics assessment by dynamics gives series of questions covering each of the dynamics this is assessed by tone arm as given in emeter drill 23 take up the reading question by use of further questions on that same subject the best way to restore ta action to case that has become overcharged is to cleverly get in and handle the itsa line cleverness is required you could ask the pc who comes into session talking about something else did our last session have anything to do with this this puts his attention back into session gently without putting it on the auditor this is preferable to the psychoanalytic practice of letting the pc run on and on about irrelevancies getting your job done and having your pc like you all the time conflict and are sometimes diametrically opposed the crudest way to get the itsa line in is tell about it this is functional however what you want to do is to move the itsa line around enough to relieve his problem to the point where you can put the attention line on significance that will give him case advance it is about as skilled as building watch very adroit to the point of invisibility you duplicate what he has been talking about and pull his itsa line bit further and put it on something you want it to be on you can even reuse the pcs origination later when you have run out of ta or itsa for instance the pc complains of headaches you get him to examine how they are affected by what you are auditing then several sessions later you can bring the headaches up again as needed unless you can handle the attention line smoothly you cant get the itsa line established you are split between wanting the pc to think well of you and getting your job done in the end they come to the same thing but for the moment it is matter of making forward progress despite unavoidable or avoidable upsets be as clever and as adroit as you can plus little there are thousands of ways to shift the pcs attention say his attention is on something you ask what have you learned about _______ you get ta parallel what the mind is doing and you can control it find what the pcs attention is on and if you can get ta motion by having the pc locate things about what his attention is on he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it it is the ta motion that takes off the compulsion not the significance of what he digs up the pc way be talking about his grandmas jammaking but if he is getting ta motion he is getting gains the fastest recovery comes with combination of significance and ta motion the least charged aberrated area of the case is where you will get ta motion sometimes direct approach to highlycharged area may fail until it is unburdened by getting ta off some other area first when you work with that area the latter area the pc will know that processing works for him pcs always make gains if they are getting ta motion ta motion only occurs when the itsa line is in why do we call it the itsa line the itsa line is more than just comm line it is seeing something to describe and describing it person in jail cant go to anywhere to see if itsa he cant say itsa beach or itsa brighton etc nightmare is the inability to itsa followed by mocking up something that can be itsaed that is wrong itsa is the way the thetan orients himself itsa ceiling itsa floor itsa wall etc itsa therefore ima cf descartes with i think therefore i am hide somebody and the itsa line is cut on himself one else can say itsa disassociate somebody from his identity and he wont be able to itsa himself he wont be able to say itsa joe jones this is the basic aberration inability to orient identify declare or recognize it is not just the inability to solve if itsa is so important to ability memory identity and 357power then we would expect the major trick on the track to be that of cutting the itsa line one way or the other and so it is implanters give you all sorts of false data you get killed one way and they convince you that you died another way or that you didnt die at all they disrupt your itsa line this can go on to the point where people believe that they live only once the reportback mechanism is even used by doctors when they have insane people report back for shocks etc people think that what we are doing is unreal but we know the substance of their unreality we know where their itsa line is out the notion man is an animal at death there is cessation of cellular commotion makes nothing of everyone the itsa line can be out of arc and on kucdeiof the whole scale for r2h tell someone that something that is isnt and his itsa line will go out give someone chalk for candy he bites into it his itsa line is out this is the false level nothing say that nothing haunts this planet its all natural and anyone who thinks otherwise must be paranoid say something isnt that is or that something is that isnt like the darwinian theory inhibited tell someone not to examine something because it is dangerous enforced know this or be shot desired wanttoknow itsa curious curiosity itsa not just curious about then theres unknown itsa you have reality on the unreality of people on this planet the itsa is their unknowingness thetans tolerance rises to where he can confront an unknown comfortably without doing anything about it x in algebra would be an example of this mathematician has gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and having to solve it all some auditors likewise cant stand the pcs being in an unknown as he is working on an itsa and have to leap in and get the itsa line in themselves with the meter known an itsa line can be too known for instance some crimes are unsolvable because they are committed in too known fashion the obviousness of the postman makes him the ideal murderer in mystery he is too known sometimes things are too obvious that also includes the everyone knows that never gets examined itsa identifies either individually or if that is not possible by classification by type you get comfortable feeling from this which every now and then gets betrayed eg when you find out that you are in stage set not room this gives you an arc break from the false itsa gpms are full of such false itsas the subject of itsa has to do with straightening out ones arc with the universe it is an interesting question why there should be this passion for itsa getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pc to auditor comm line in the latter is more likely to be related to the pcs attention line to the auditor getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify inspect decide about and differentiate things in his bank or in the physical universe eg in objective processing the room you could probably get ta by running whats that and pointing at things this is not always workable itsa is familiarization eg with car or typewriter that is why familiarization processes like touch that _______ work person who is really itsaing is blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusion about an area that is the mass aspect the force aspect of it when you have itsad on area the area never comes up again until then the area keeps coming up in the future ten years in the past two trillion years in the past as this as that etc while the pc is looking for the itsa what drives some auditors nuts is the extra itsas he puts in and takes out this that lot of apparent itsas come off before you get the final itsa but you could almost say that all the running of case on through to the final cognition the final itsa consists of conditional itsas an auditor should never expect only permanent itsas it is adroit of the auditor to use the pcs attention line to get the itsa line in by steering it to areas that can be itsad put the pcs attention on things he can identify letting the itsa line exist is the lowest level of auditing putting the itsa line in is more active the universe is full of whatsit lines so concentrate on the itsa line the itsa line will suffer from being too known as in everyone knows the itsa line is the pcs line to the auditor 6308c21 shspec297 the itsa line continued things look more complex than they actually are sitting somewhere in back of every thetans bank is tremendous insecurity in which the thetan believes implicitly that the universe is dangerous or that he is in danger or that he cannot live or survive as powerful being the itsa line could look to you like simple communication line on which if you let anyone talk enough he will get better this is 358not so if you understand the itsa line you will see the pc go through cycle of fishing for an itsa if the auditor tells the pc what is there by putting in the itsa with the meter it leaves the pc in zone or area of insecurity as will any interruption of the pcs itsa the pc has to be responsible for putting in the itsa line if the auditor does it too much eg saying the meter reads that it is before 1850 etc you have created psychiatric potentially hypnotic evaluative setup it is ok to give little help but not to put in the whole itsa line for the pc when you tell person that there is hope for his case you are putting in an itsa line the hope factor but what about the line plot for instance this puts in an itsa line for the pc to some degree the line plot for the gpm is the lesser of two evils it allows the pc to identify it to his own reality and it is less undesirable than letting the pc wrap himself around telephone pole it was an other determined thing in the first place and the most important thing is to get the charge off of it similarly if the pc is trying to date something and bogs utterly you should help him with the meter enough to increase his ability to see what he is after by narrowing his search even if you get down to the hour and minute and the pc never spotted it at least youve got it dated but it is still bit of lose the only time you totally lose is when you have to put the whole itsa line in aberration is means of perverting the itsa line pure evil is denial of the itsa line and aberration of it perversion of the itsa line has to be very direct in order to be very aberrative given the slightest chance the pc will put in his itsa line but the question is will he put it in on anything aberrative he wont unless directed to it psychoanalysis directs the itsa line to something nonaberrative lets him itsa and then evaluates putting the itsa line in totally analyzing it for him putting in hope factor by saying that something can be done to change conditions puts in the itsa line to small degree even start of session puts in an itsa line with the intent of putting the pc in position to itsa the intention makes the difference where one puts in the itsa line for another an evil intention in this respect is one that is devoted to decreasing the persons ability to itsa that is the way to make slaves good intention is an intention to improve someones itsa get the person to identify spot and point out and he will be in better shape than he is this corner of the universe is suffering from surplus of lousy civilization it was recently conquered but it was set up to be conquered by the use of degrading mental technology the civilization in this area implanted their own soldiers to be loyal to be brave etc such civilization has power because for an implant to stick it has to have two items one positive and one negative eg to be loyal soldier and to be disloyal soldier so fifty percent of the implant is in the negative also the fact that the implant was done at all destroys loyalty the galactic confederacy with implanting lasted eighty trillion years the espinol confederacy with implants lasted few hundred thousand years rome died at the hands of her slaves not at those of barbarians being free man didnt pay so who wanted to fight for rome slavery produced civil war the first families of boston made their money from slaves and so we got civil war too it is not just matter of sentiment statistically slavery never pays off it is dangerous russia is having trouble because of the slave economy which is hangover from prerevolutionary russia probably the white russian nobility came back from the betweenlives area as communists slavery always produces backlash because thetan never really gives up he can hold the postulate that he was right all the way down to the bottom of unconsciousness the effort to dominate and to deny power of choice to others is the road that this universe walked towards the hell it became fear stands ahead of that the nonsense behind it is that thetan cant do anything but survive so for him to fear nonsurvival is foolish how to kill thetan is the biggest problem in this universe how can being who cannot cease to survive get into state of mind where he is afraid that he wont it takes lot of trickery usually it is on an extension of self into possession like making minion mocking up mockup endowing it with life and protecting it when someone attacks it it can be body state etc the thetan must have confused himself with it to the point where he thinks his survival can be affected that is the first step into aberration the next step is elementary one is worried about survival so one solves the problem of survival by domination this solution is not successful in the long run that which is not admired tends to persist that is one reason why domination stays around domination is not admired thetan to protect something dominates thetan b in so doing he sets himself up to be dominated in turn having set up causeeffect line the line can reverse it is comm line with duplication which makes it easy to reverse any custom on this planet has this reverse duplication element you can 359count on its having been the reverse at some time the duplication factor easily makes cause look like effect on this comm line and it leads to the overtmotivator sequence one commits overts then one day one slips into effect and gets what one caused running ow frees up vicious comm line and cures some misidentifications thus undoing aberration for instance waiters wear black tuxedos any custom was reverse custom at an earlier date if communication is so dangerous why does thetan communicate at all it is because he wants to be oriented once oriented thetan uses his best tool communication to dominate to do people in and to mess up things that he tries to identify with he misuses his comm line it is there because he is lost and feels the need of orientation hence his desire for communication there is insecurity behind this desire the reason for which we dont know yet in using the itsa line were using the obsession to identify which lies back of the communication line we are using principle higher than communication coupled with communication in order to orient and rehabilitate the thetan all we are missing is what lies behind the insecurity that caused him to start the whole cycle originally the thetan was not insecure was not reaching not protecting anything and he was not communicating how and why did anyone get to him originally to the point where he felt that he needed to be oriented to be comfortable it is hard to figure this out because there was communication at the time but you show the problem and very shortly later ill show you the answer just as it took only one step to start down that road so it takes only step at the other end to go back up the pc gradiently comes up to ot then breaks through with shock that may scare him processing is the cure for having to be familiarized with things to itsa we are undoing the tendency to itsa by using it once thetan is free of those things he will snap back to his original lost power at least until he rights some wrongs and slips briefly selfdeterminism pandeterminism and personal power is restored to the individual along the line of minimal help and maximal recovery of selfdeterminism of selfability to itsa on the part of the pc as the case goes along its progress is measured directly by the degree to which selfdeterminism is returned into the pcs hands thus you could get fantastic number of engrams and gpms run and have foggy pc by dating everything in the bank for him or by invalidating some datum of the pcs matter how slightly an auditor has the same problem mother has to give enough help but not too much the amount of help required is not constant from one pc to the next because pcs are at such different levels of independence and aberration both could be high the problem is to determine how much help the pc needs in order to know what you want to do is to take whatever ability you find and reduce any dependency you find give the pc all the help he needs to get along and then reduce it added into all this is your flubs you will never reduce them to zero so dont try you will get caught in crosscurrents of communication and purposes since the pcs comm line is so often fogged up in session the auditors ability to handle it perfectly is nil so the auditor shouldnt be afraid of mishandling the pc because an occasional mishandling is inevitable so when this happens you have to get slippy and handle the intention line if possible dont put the pcs attention on the auditor this can happen by mistake but watch out eg dont say do you want to tell about it this inadvertently diverts attention to the auditor the pcs itsa line will get better to the degree that it is permitted to exist dont just let the pc talk but direct his attention to things in the bank that he can identify dont tell him what he is looking at if you can avoid it but if you do have to tell him let him itsa it if you dont his ability to identify will deteriorate and his ability to know whether he is right will decrease that is the effect of confirming his itsa line with the meter if you look on what you are doing as improving the pcs ability to know that he is right to be positive you will make minimal mistakes that is the chief ability that is there to be improved on case if you look on case as something from which significances have to be removed regardless of the pcs ability to be certain the pc will still make it but it will take much longer the pcs case improves by removal of charge but is impeded by the auditor cutting back his ability to itsa an arc breaky pc is probably one with high degree of independence perhaps swamped by charge you can create dependency by telling him everything there is also the point to be 360considered that if you dont tell the pc when an item is finally discharged early in running gpms the pc will leave items charged and the mechanism of the bank will cause him to bounce and arc break so you put in the itsa line itsa discharged sooner or later the pc will start to tell you that it is at that point stop telling him that it is clean dont stop if he still cant tell to do so would leave him with live ris and postulates wean him off from the meter slowly validating his knowingness as it develops give the pc all the help he needs if pc cant tell what is in his bank he cant live with it there is certain minimal help that pc needs to get started he cant do it all on his own on the other hand you could get pc who hasnt been here long who cognites on the axioms knocks out the bank does change of space processing between the auditing room and the next building see the creation of human ability pp 3739 171173 this is the grand tour process the object of which is to get all areas into present time by directing the pc to be in variety of places and says goodby and thank you fine you audited him arc breaky pcs sometimes get into the situation of having their concept of their own independence cut up by people putting in itsa lines for them they dramatize pc who is routinely arc breaky undoubtedly has something wrong with the itsa line and not from auditing he could benefit from an 18button prepcheck on the itsa line those eighteen buttons are the most powerful itsas there are or ever have been in the universe another approach would be to handle the fact that the pc is using the arc break to solve problem but the prepcheck normally gets it cleaned up cut itsa line is the most colossal ptp there is persons itsa line to the rest of the universe is cut just by the fact of his being on earth if he tries to leave earth he goes to the betweenlives area the only missing piece is why does thetan have compulsion to itsa 6308c22 shspec298 project 80 80 is mathematical trick to say oo and 0 it embraces all project 80 has to do with organizational targets dissemination and technical planning 1964 will be the year of scientology for everyone organizations suffer from loss of personnel one would be rich if one just lived and persisted long enough if you are persistent you yourself become sort of institution to solve problem is mest universe way of looking at things the right way is to find out how did it become problem lrh operates on the basis that if he conceives of problem he is about forty eight hours away from seeing what made it problem an organizations problem of losing all its people is one that we have licked with all the shifts and changes we the people are the stability in the development of the tech we have the material for scientology 4 research towards ot see above making ots wrapped up as far as research is concerned in view is wrapping up of the betweenlives area so as to strip out the reportback mechanism it is bit tougher than lrh thought it would be there are in addition to gpms screentype incidents and postulationtype incidents the gpms are all negative on the beginning end of the screen and positive on the leaving end so the dichotomy makes them tend to collapse some rules for cleaning up charge faster have developed but it is all just auditing keeping the pcs attention directed to those areas of the track where he gets ta action that is the highest level of professional skill drills for thetan exterior is all wrapped up not everyone will reach the technical level of those who are at st hill who have been through all the developments and changes that is too much to expect auditors elsewhere are operating at different levels of reality which establish different levels of arc for them the gap between our r and theirs has been getting wider and wider so we are in an informed ivory tower with bridge behind us that is rather important this planet is in slightly different circumstances then others it has chance not to get tilted things put here tend to stay other nearby planets are more tightly governed and are harder to enter to salvage them they are invasionary planets this area used to be controlled by the espinol confederacy but their return platforms are closed off that spells defeat for them is there some other implantive system that is deeper into the heart of this galaxy system that is going to backfire against this one probably so it is probably coming up soon but conquerers almost always spare the jails we cant bet on the preservation of earth but we can bet on this planet having better chance of becoming rehabilitation center than other planets but what if we have left bridge in the rehabilitation center so that everybody flounders around with way to improve if you dont leave bridge you will wind up with group of people who are very angry at those who might assist them that would be very undesirable weve got to leave bridge however at present our feeder lines into the public are weak not organizationally but technically 361project 80 is the bridge it requires that we find what the public agrees with and use that to improve their arc up to another level and that we keep doing that in order to bring them up gradiently we are not necessarily improving their arc with us we are just improving their arc to point where we can hit another level of agreement the dynamics various scales the arc triangle and the dynamic principle of existence all of these are too hightoned for scientology 1 so they comprise scientology 2 see above for description of the scientology levels so we are back to 3060 day hcahpa training this is only possible because of the discovery of the itsa line some of you as auditors overlook what is win for pc knowing that your goal is to run out gpms etc you miss the fact that the pc has had win in being able to talk to an auditor when he couldnt talk to anyone before the feeling that one is getting case advance and real case advance lies in the fact that the itsa line is in and the ta is moving get the itsa line in and the ta moving and you will get level of improvement and result never before achieved this has nothing to do with significances if you get somebody talking about his health or his lumbosis you find out that the cures solutions decisions discoveries cognitions comments reiterations and hopes about that lumbosis in their aggregate caused the individual to have lumbosis if you get them off with ta action you get recovered lumbosis the condition could well vanish just from getting the pc to itsa about these cures etc this does not apply to broken legs yet someone who has been trained in getting an itsa line in and not cutting it given also some basic training in the auditors code the axioms the arc triangle the cdei scale etc would have good results and wins scientology 1 operates at the level of it is possible to have happy marriage or if you want to get along with children better listen to what they say and let them know you heard it dont just ignore them or employeeboss relations are mainly problems of communication in fact you should make communication the stable datum how you design this line is all regulated by what people can go into arc with you have to talk to people at level where they can have arc r1c is list of questions that you can use to get in an itsa line specific questions from this list could be used by book auditor to run on someones lumbosis this could be done on coaudit basis and would get fine results that is the auditing level of scientology 1 lower grade scientology 2 hpahca can get fabulous results with r2c r2c is r1c preceded by an assessment on the expanded cdei scale plus the eight dynamics see hcotf 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics as well as hcob 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics directions for use of hco technical form 17oct63 and hcob 31oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics continued the tone arm is used the pc first looks over the cdei scale to see which level best characterizes his life it might take ten minutes and it might take fifty hours the pc has to see which levels applied at which times in his life and where and how and which they are and how they relate etc you can get lot of ta on examining the scale eventually the pc comes out with level x now give him the eight dynamics expanded ie broken down into subparts he has to find out which ones he has been most concerned about this lifetime this could also take ten minutes or fifty hours eventually the pc comes out with dynamic therefore the question becomes x the pc gets asked about the combined assessments eg curious about children the question could have third component considerations solutions decisions about concern for so you have matched up the arc triangle with mest form and location the pc will start off with arc vs arc then when he can confront mest he will get into the sixth and seventh dynamics so as you repeat this operation the pc will go up the dynamics to the sixth and seventh this would be way of clearing this lifetime uppergrade scientology 2 would use r2h arc break dating and any other process like prepchecking that uses needle action as well as ta it is retread level for hpahcas so the line up for scientology 1 and 2 is scn 1 362a nonauditing pelevel scientology b auditing book auditing on coaudit basis scn 2 lower level hpahca level uses r2c tone arm used only not needle action b upper level hpahca retread level processes using needle action and ta another element enters the scene the arc break assessment this would be specialized activity it can be done by central orgs or auditors in private practice to patch up field auditors pcs and at the same time the field auditor whose pc needs this action can be nudged about following the auditors code eg about keeping his mouth shut try to bring it home that arc break assessments need to be done we can use them both on pcs and on auditors you can keep lot of coauditors straightened out by having someone around to do arc break assessments you could have course in which you can give classification of hba hubbard book auditor the student gets gen on 1 the itsa line 2 the auditors code this course would also include testing and coaudits the whole secret of our communication is that it is up to us to establish the level of the communication that we engage in we have considered it somewhat dishonest to put our communication at level of anything less than everything we know but it isnt really dishonest to say less then we know there is reason to overwhelm people with all the data it would just be outreality there will be snags in the program there will always be people who are uncomfortable with motion and change these people will try overtly or covertly to stop it all they will be the people who despair of getting result by doing the usual because they wont do it they will be the ones who keep applying unusual solutions dont get your attention pinned on one bad apple and forget that everywhere else it is going fine to do this would be to embark on crusade in an illadvised direction probably all evil generates from too great concentration on evil if you concentrate on how the show isnt getting on the road when it is in fact on the road you will contribute to keeping it from being on the road you should take care of such matters on routine rather than an emergency basis when we have auditing at lower levels totally shaped around the definition of an auditor as listener we will have trouble getting the whole project well done 6308c27 shspec299 rightness and wrongness people use mental technology the way they do in this universe because they dont know what they are doing the purpose of mental technology must be one of survival with consequent necessity to dominate so it must consist of being right and making others wrong survival rightness and wrongness and domination fit together apparent contrasurvival actions are the thetans effort to be right this is the lowest ebb of aberration because the thetan cant do anything else but survive in order to survive you have to be more right than wrong so you get obsessed with being right the beginning of succumb is the recognition that you are wrong this is not sensible but it is the way thetan behaves therefore if an individual is surviving at all he must be right even if it is only an insistence on being right if an individual is undertaking an action and is surviving then it must be right action thetan has to enter basic lie on the scene to worry about his survival this is idiocy because there is reason for thetan to worry about survival thetan first worries about the survival of something else something that can be threatened with nonsurvival then the thetan identifies himself with that thing this is the first lie when he starts worrying about his own survival because he has taken the idiotic step of identifying himself with his creations he enters into the necessity to dominate to ensure his own survival there is reason why if you are protecting sand castles you have to take the idiot step of becoming sand castle and you can go on protecting them indefinitely without doing this but once you have identified yourself with sandcastle and are 363worried about your own survival you enter into the necessity to dominate to continue your own survival to be tougher than the other tough boys on the beach you dont even have to become sandcastle to start the game of domination if that is what you want to do the game of domination consists of being right and making the other fellow wrong that is all there is to it its silly game really for instance russia and the us are each devoting so much of their production capacity to defend themselves from each other that they are failing economically people justify all sorts of insanity on the basis of rightness and wrongness even skidrow bum is being bum in order to be right everyone has tried to make him wrong for what he does so he has to continue to be right if he admits he is wrong he feels he will die you may be confused just watching what is being done because some of it could have good results but the basis can still be nutty rightness people assert nutty rightness because everyone is always making then wrong for the nuttiness if someone agrees that he has been doing something wrong he is liable to collapse since he has identified wrongness with succumbing behavior doesnt necessarily have everything to do with the whole track behavior is behavior people have tried to aberrate it one way or another they have tried to make people behave some other way but the science of life still remains the science of life the factors of life still remain the factors of life and if you were to delete all the gpms and incidents and everything else you would not have removed the basic laws on which scientology is built gpms etc merely use the existing laws of life to enslave people they simply enforce exaggerate and destroy freedom of choice over the exercise of the ability to be happy powerful etc they destroy the ability to be self or pan determined they make people onesided about everything they use basic laws unwittingly to exaggerate certain things which then lead person to enslave himself the basic mechanism of enslavement is 1 insistence upon surviving followed by 2 the necessity to dominate followed by 3 the necessity to be right or wrong 4 which then becomes as irrational as the original postulate to survive and then 5 the person becomes more and more degraded the postulates made by the individual go downhill to the point where you would be amazed at what the individual is doing to be right when you get down to very aberrated rightness you are dealing with death because at that level cessation of survival is so imminent that it gets dramatized before it happens in that way the individual is still right by succumbing currently there are three organizations under attack 1 scientology 2 buddhism 3 theosophy the us government is supporting the vietnamese government in its attacks on buddhists it has attacked the theosophists recently and it launched raid via the fda on the fcdc in washington but these are the only three groups that believe in reincarnation ie they are the only groups that dont believe in death forever in attacking them the us government is asserting rightness about death to get some sort of aberrated behavior of this kind straightened out with someone you would have to get him to tell you how the behavior makes him right you would get an automaticity for starters which would finally run out then you could see how it makes someone else wrong when that is all run out the individual will have far less inclination to do the behavior that he previously had to do to be right the strongest intention in the universe is the intention to be right the diagnosis of how you could make person wrong depends on what that person most insists upon that is what you can make him wrong on this would be getting persons goat behavior doesnt consist of an aberration that someone is dramatizing it consists of an aberration that person dredges up in order to make someone else wrong thats behavior it works too making someone wrong all the time does worry him furthermore one can be made wrong to the point where one inverts goes into agreement 364with what is being said by the person who is making him wrong and now makes the former wrongness an obsessive rightness the right label gets identified with the wrong action government may be made wrong about bringing in law and order to the point where it now exercises criminality using the label of law and order the issue of rightness and wrongness has been further boobytrapped by guys on the whole track who implanted people with gpms that contain the words right and wrong however when making himself right and others wrong an individual is not acting because of the gpm that just intensifies the action if you try just simply to run someone on right and wrong for very long you run into the gpm and cant keep on in that line ordinarily getting in an itsa line on the aberration will deintensify its power however if guy has accidents frequently 1 find out what he is having wrecks accidents injuries etc this doesnt take very long you have to isolate what it is that the guy is doing the obvious action may not be his intention maybe it is not his automobile accidents that are making him right maybe it is getting injured when you have the right thing he will run easily 2 ask the pc how an auto accident makes him right you will get an easy itsa line 3 ask him how an auto accident would make them or another wrong you will get another avalanche 4 ask 2 again then 3 etc keep it balanced and you will avoid bumping the gpm as hard this process is below the level of recognition or cognition it undermines neurosis neurosis is defined as an antisurvival action that is compulsively undertaken by the individual the only qualification to this process is that we have to be capable of communicating with the person and listening to him and we have to get our hands on him first but on coldbloodedly practical basis service fac processes are more practical mental technology than the alternatives implants drugs electric shock treatments etc just because of the backlash from angry thetans who want revenge on implanters the hole in implanter tech is that the survival of the implanter can in the future be threatened implants can be undone many implant setups have been destroyed implanters do implanting because they are trying to be right and to make others wrong thats all it is mere dramatization when you see someone acting simply to be right and to make others wrong you will see worsening condition you are looking at the last dregs of domination the person who is being right is in fact getting worse as are the people in his vicinity implanting works only over short term period eg 100000 years which is shortterm on galactic scale implanting worsens not only the people implanted but also the implanter and everyone in the vicinity of these people what is true of neurosis is also true of psychosis psychosis has the same mechanism at lower level and it gets treatment from psychiatrists at the same low level of makewrong and q and the overtmotivator sequence also fits into this effort to dominate and be right when you get two people each insisting on his own rightness their ideas eventually commingle and they cant tell who is doing what this is because both are saying im right and youre wrong if science is dramatizing an unknown one of its parts it is not complete technology it is impossible to have science of life under these circumstances because you cant fully understand something that you are dramatizing part of science of life should be complete understanding and since one is dramatizing at least part of living one cant have total understanding of it in other words being right should be one of the parts of mental technology however if being right is being dramatized by the practitioners of mental technology then clearly they dont have full understanding of the mind this is particular problem with the science of life hence there is tendency to withdraw from life total cessation of the dramatization of the game called life would put one in confused state of thinking that the way to do it is to separate oneself from life by going off to cave and meditating but person that cant experience easily has to experience compulsively the final challenge of science of life is does it produce life not does it produce death if you know all the answers you can live it is remarkable to be in situation where this can be sorted out as one goes along 365getting more understanding one doesnt have to work so hard to experience existence one doesnt have to be convinced that one is surviving being right dominating etc when person is longer able to select his own behavior he must obsessively be right by doing something wrong it is ok to be right if you are being analytical however there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical and become obsessive it is below that level that we speak of aberration you can find what the person is doing that he doesnt like to do then ask the person how that makes him right everyone has few of these actions they generally arise from some overwhelm of the persons selfdeterminism where he has accepted anothers rightness the person is out of valence and dramatizing someone elses aberrations you could perhaps pick this up on flow one of level 4 triples but we arent interested in other peoples aberrations the dwindling spiral is really entered where the person accepts inability weakness stupidity etc as way to be right any dramatization of mental science that brings about further disability is wrong for the civilization that uses it anything that brings about more life livingness and beingness is right for that person or society anything that is crazy in person was ok at some higher level all madness is an exaggeration of some ability or capability for instance sexual misbehavior is lowerscale dramatization of the ability to create it becomes aberrated in the following way 1 it was really right 2 it was method of survival 3 it was method of domination 4 it was method of being right in order to make others wrong 5 then one got enough overts such that the communication line switched around what was right about it is now wrong about it and vice versa the sexual misbehavior or other aberrated behavior is practically unrecognizable from its original state as far as the persons behavior is concerned when you understand this you understand much of the nonsense that you previously only protested against the explanation for the behavior that is offered by the individual so obscures what he is really doing that it gets confusing the main line of human behavior is along the lines of 1 survival 2 domination 3 rightness and wrongness however when an auditor invalidates anothers assertion of rightness it only drives the pc downscale and cuts the only communication line that can help the pc dramatization of rightness and wrongness is not the answer to dramatization of rightness and wrongness 6308c29 shspec300 the ta and the service facsimile if you cannot make keyedout clear with prepcheck in 25 hours or less the pc is operating on service facsimile this is startling but elementary prepcheck fits in with the itsa line very closely the 18 buttons are hot they give the key itsas of the case if they are not working you have service facsimile on your hands in doing prepcheck it is assumed that you are using timelimiter in order to keep the amount of restimulation under control if you dont control the itsa line the pc will restimulate more charge than you can get asised the time limiter you use can be by subject or location as well as by date pc answering prepcheck questions is giving you key itsas if prepcheck is done for this lifetime you should get keyedout clear per the book 1 definition of clear see dmsmh pp 817 77017 clearing in this way is destimulation by knocking out the points where restimulation took place making incidents inert an inert incident can be restimulated however 366degree of restimulation is not important to state of case neither is the condition of being restimulated but there is state of case with respect to restimulation all cases are restimulated to some degree but some are overrestimulated case that is overrestimulated will not discharge the restimulation by ordinary means because discharge has somehow been prevented this condition is important it is getting ahold of too much and not discharging it uncontrolled itsa line can cause overrestimulation an incident that is discharged has been relieved of charge so that it can longer be restimulated restimulation can be let off without the incident that was restimulated being discharged it can simply be destimulated so with bank you can either destimulate it by knocking out the keyins of the original charge or you can discharge it by running it discharge is flowing off of charge when an incident is discharged it is gone and it is longer capable of being restimulated let us assume that the reactive mind consists mainly of inert incidents if they would just stay quiet you would never have to clear anybody however the pcs attention can be directed at the incident by life auditing or the pc himself at which point the incident converts the pcs attention to restimulation over which he has control if the pcs attention goes to the incident so as to have understanding and confront you will see ta motion and the incident can be discharged or erased on the other hand if the pcs attention flicks over the incident giving keyin you can knock out the moment of keyin by having him look at it and it will destimulate again ie it will key out bank is inert until life or auditing causes the pcs attention to go onto portion of it the pcs attention is the actual source of charge an 18button prepcheck should key out anything that keyed in it can destimulate somebody to the state of clear so you dont have to make clear to make an ot you only have to make keyout clear the state of case of the pc is directly represented and analyzed by the tone arm and the free needle the eight levels of case compare with eight states of the tone arm and needle see above for description of the eight levels of case case level 8 stage 4 needle 7 continuous rock slam 6 stuck needle at clear read dead thetan 5 low ta 4 high ta 3 ta moving in the high range 2 good ta through and past clear read 1 fn at clear read when lrh tried to go from destimulated clear to discharged clear he found that there was waystop short of ot the condition youve got to have to take anyone to ot is ta moving through clear read with good ta without that there is too much restimulation present for you to get the pc to discharge material from the backtrack or to get into gpms if you tried to do this anyway the pcs ta would tend to stick then to go high then to go low then eventually to stick at clear read if you then did prepcheck which would now be harder you could send him back to all those states of ta as you destimulated the case you wouldnt have to go all the way to fn to go to the backtrack now the subject isnt how you discharge the incident it is when the ta should be moving around preferably through 30 before you try to go backtrack so you can make clear by prepchecking few prepared subjects the case will feel wonderful sometimes for years until he starts wondering whether he still has any worries about what used to bother him then he starts restimulating himself and gets keyed in mere keyout clear cant be ot because when he tries to turn on the power it kicks in the inert incidents the only way to make clear completely stable would be to discharge everything in the bank from fning the meter goes blank because youve got nothing to measure thats ot 367overrestimulation is the cause of amnesia edgy and bad body feelings etc if you gave the pc three sessions in row without getting any ta he would feel rather bad because just the auditing would have restimulated charge and you would have an overrestimulated case when this happens memory gets bad facsimiles get harder to see incidents get jammed together the bank gets to be mess all this is due to overrestimulation if the pc now gets prepchecked and destimulated he can approach the track but this can be done with good ta only if the auditing is done gradiently with good cleanup of everything contacted discharging it as you go dont fail to pay attention to the ta and go backtrack hoping to get the incident responsible for the restimulation you will restimulate more than you discharge in the process of looking for the incident cheerful pc equals the itsa line in and the ta moving it almost doesnt matter what the ta is moving on case level relates to over restimulation not to the amount of bank the pc has the auditing target is always the restimulated charge not the inert material in the bank the pc can always restimulate more once he has discharged what was available clear means nothing in the restimulation chamber if too much gets restimulated by life auditing or the pc the auditor can destimulate it with prepchecks and arc break assessments see above it is not possible to audit someone without doing one of three things 1 restimulating 2 destimulating this is the same as keying something out or 3 discharging this is the same as erasing auditing is always doing at least one of these three things when case is already confused and is not confronting well naturally the amount of destimulation and discharge are minimal so restimulation takes over you will get ta motion when you dont destimulate or discharge anything you will restimulate more and you will get ta lack of ta is danger signal the auditor should find out why there are two possible actions 1 the auditor may do something that can discharge or destimulate the restimulated charge eg prepchecking or flattening what has been left unflat prepchecking or r2h would be safest 2 he can look for something that is preventing discharge eg by doing an arc break assessment to find the correct bpc if the ta is not restored immediately only one thing is wrong the case is sitting in service facsimile and will only worsen until the service facsimile is cleared if small amount of auditing doesnt restore the case to clear state the pc has service facsimile if he is sitting in one it must be run or he will not improve prepchecks turn on mass in the presence of service facsimile because the pc has intention of getting rid of it the pc wont let go of the service fac and the service fac wont surrender to the prepcheck this also includes hidden standards now that we know that the anatomy of service fac is rightnesswrongness computation we can do something about it we knew of their existence before as can be seen in advanced procedures and axioms pp 711 the 18button prepcheck should key out the pc if it doesnt the pc has service fac prepcheck is just series of types of decisions that thetan makes about things if it turns on mass it must be in conflict with rightness and wrongness so in the pcs eyes the auditor is trying to make the pc wrong with the prepcheck and the pc moves the facsimile forward as defense increasing mass the only reason for high ta is overrestimulation the two things that prevent its cure are 1 the cases overrestimulated condition 2 service facsimile that the case isnt about to give up to some degree most cases fall into the service fac category but most dont have the service fac directly in the road of auditing only service facs that lie across the road of auditing interfere with clearing if the service fac has to do with the pcs spiritual condition with his case itself then you have to handle it so that he can get case gain the more pc is trying to be right by having wrong case the less progress the auditor will make with this case pc says if i didnt have bank theyd give one so having bank is right 368dont let the pc itsa beyond the answer to the auditing question it is far better for the pc to feel that his comm has been cut than for him to pull in restimulation by being permitted to overrun an answer an 18button prepcheck on an assessed this lifetime subject or subjects should give you keyout clear but service fac wont surrender to prepcheck 6308c29 shspec301 the service facsimile although we call it service facsimile there is more to be known about it than was in earlier definitions in the past it has been said that service facsimile is what person uses to explain his condition or get his way in the world it is called service facsimile because it was of service to the pc the service fac manifestation is blood brother to the ow mechanism it is how you make people guilty the current definition of service fac is that it is that condition which the individual uses to make himself right and others wrong using this definition we can crack cases the only hazard is the use of rightwrong in gpms but the use of time limitation to in this lifetime obviates any danger of restimulating the gpm the gpm is not the reason for the service fac there is an upper scale rationale survival for instance the darwinian implant see above has to persist at the beginning of it all by itself but this is rare however when the goal to survive occurs it is couched in the word persist there is gpm known to date that contains the word survive this concept is therefore not motivated by bank therefore you can use survive in processing pretty easily implanters used the words live and alive lot but survive is the top scale of all this it is ok for us to go back to healing now since doctors the ama havent appreciated the fact that we ever stopped healing people b they will be socialized in five years anyway they are convinced that curing is impossible however 22 12 of people eg patients pcs or whatever get well with any or or fraudulent treatment they are apparently in an hypnotic state and respond to suggestion so any healing profession should get at least 22 12 cure rate unless it is doing something to depress the patient and to prevent healing from occurring if you get less than 22 12 you are actually impeding the cure only two things prevent the scientologist from healing pcs 1 inability to get in communication with the pc eg because he is dead 2 the service facsimile if we allow for the fact that it takes relatively short time to train an auditor into using thislifetime techniques if you take such an auditor and dont worry about making him into an auditor who can make an ot if you turn him loose with only an understanding of the service facsimile the itsa line and repetitive prepchecking limited to this lifetime if you let him rely on the tone arm there he would be practically sweeping the boards as far as illness is concerned for person to have bad back he must have more than facsimile of an experience involving bad back causing it he must have had it restimulated by something and to have real bad back something must be keeping it in restimulation something has to kick the facsimile in and hold it in you must add to the restimulation factor mental aberration factor it is not just what is restimulated it is what the pc feels might become restimulated what he himself opposes what he becomes afraid of when he is restimulated so the individual is added to the equation the experiential pattern of an individual regardless of incidents containing pain etc might be aberrative for instance say person has lived all his life in very cold environment he gets knowingness in the process if you throw him out in the 40below cold either he has confidence that he can withstand the cold or he doesnt accordingly he either freezes to death or lives respectively this is true even though person is conditioned and trained to handle the cold people may react differently to the same engram there is guarantee that someone will respond one way or the other to their stimulusresponse conditioning one person will be terrified by some danger another person will ignore it another will look and say oh what makes the difference we come back to the service fac for the answer how could you use facsimile to make people wrong 369so there are three reactions to an engram 1 the guy who is terrified of the facsimile has in back of this lots of ways to be right and to make others wrong by having this facsimile 2 the guy who ignores it has use for it at all one way or the other 3 the guy who confronts it has another method of making others wrong being competent with regard to this type of facsimile the rightnesswrongness possibility is present to some degree in everyone and in every bank to the healer this represents barrier because someone who is using an illness or disability to make someone else wrong wont respond to treatment or if you cure one thing he will pick up something else to do the job of making himself right and others wrong symptomsubstitution see also haley on oneupsmanship games aberrated behavior is service facsimile in at least goodly percentage of cases when you do mimicry processing and the pc persists in crazy behavior he has vested interest in acting crazy this makes it hard to tell how good deaberrative technique is however if it works on lot more than 22 12 of cases it is probably good technique that is rendered ineffective in some cases by service fac the tone arm turned out to be reliable measure of case progress if you dont get destimulation or discharge you will get restimulation because something is happening if you dont get any ta action you know that you are not getting any destimulation or discharge and that therefore restimulation is all that is occurring therefore dont audit without ta action the margin of time during which you can audit pc without ta action before he starts feeling horrible is only about three sessions if pc is upset about auditing is having trouble handling life etc it is only because of overrestimulation from whatever source gpms arc breaks or whatever what about medium or acceptable amount of ta action fifteen to twenty downward divisions per 2 12 hour session excellent ta would be about thirty divisions per session acceptable is 1520 below that level more restimulation than discharge is occurring these are just approximate figures great deal of addingup has not yet been done to tabulate the figures exactly so there is point where there is an apparency of ta motion yet the pc is not getting better and only restimulation is occurring auditing pc on and on with ta will overrestimulate him all the way up the ta dial backwards through 7 all the way to dead thetan lrh introduces here the idea of ta counter why does ta go up and stick only because of the pressure of overrestimulation if you have ta action or if you are getting rising ta without discharge you get overrestimulation because you are overwhelming the pcs power of choice you are trying to get discharge and the pc wont let go of it and he becomes more and more arc breaky if the ta is going up even when you are not auditing backtrack you must still be overwhelming the pcs power of choice between not getting ta and getting high ta we move into service facs when you are doing prepcheck and it turns on mass you have bumped into something that shouldnt be there service facsimile has moved in to assert whatever you are prepchecking and trying to get rid of any mass for thetan is an assertion that something is wrong and there is something weird about it the mass comes from the complete disagreement that you and the pc have concerning whatever it is that turned mass on you want to get rid of it but the pc does not intend to get better because he has to hang onto bank to make someone wrong with it it stands to reason that any thetan that has been hit hard and continuously that has had continued loses and that is trying to get back at and attack some area will be unable to put the itsa line in on that area he cant say if the area is bad or good he cant say what it is he doesnt feel that he can be at cause over that comm line so his final method of staying at cause is to be right and for the other person to be wrong this goes down to the point where he merely has to hold the concept of being right and the other person being wrong this way in sense he is still being cause this mechanism persists therefore because the pc cant asis it because he cant observe it anymore one can be haunted by nonexistent thing if one doesnt have the comm lines to observe it the pc never knows when it goes away if you cant inspect something you cant inspect its cessation therefore for survival the best thing to do is to assume that the thing is still there that is the safest course life 370teaches you that it is dangerous to go look and see you operate on the principle that if you cant ascertain that something has ended you had better assume that it is continuing something that the pc cant cure with processing must be service fac you can ask the pc how he is making others wrong then when you get it you can ask him how he is being right with it aberrated survival mechanisms all sit around on buttons of rightnesswrongness survival and domination the ow system is connected with this through the makeguilty mechanism these are survival mechanisms buy they are not sensible unfortunately the words rightness wrongness survive and dominate are also in the bank so you have to indulge in some brokenfield running to handle these buttons the more force there is and the less one can stand it and be cause over the user of the force the more one goes into forms of aberrated rightness and wrongness against the holder of force hence people break minor laws to be right about the government since it is so overwhelming this is quite irrational to find service fac you could use the original listing steps of r2 or the preliminary assessment of r3r or you could ask the pc what have you been trying to resolve about your case in processing taking anything that didnt resolve with processing as service facsimile what would be method of making others wrong could also get it be prepared for the service fac not to be very sensible but dont reject it even if it does seem reasonable as long as it is something that hasnt yielded to auditing 6309c04 shspec302 how to find service facsimile apparently there is more to know about service facs than has been relayed probably because it is so simple pcs dont defend their service facs against discovery if you point the pc in the right direction he will go right to the service fac unless you prevent it so dont prevent it in assessing for service facs there is substitute for knowing what service fac is service fac is first tremendous solution always aberrated in pt as part of the pcs environment which the pc believes would result in his survival being threatened if it were disturbed it is something which others keep telling the pc is wrong causing him to assert that it is right this assertion of rightness is very integral and important to the service fac it makes the pc unauditable to the degree that he is getting auditing only to prove that it is right it sticks out like sore thumb one could have more trouble labeling it than finding it the human body is service fac but if we used that we would be going for ot and we arent shooting for that we are just using the service fac on this lifetime to get the pc auditable so the body isnt the service fac that we are trying to target having found service fac we dont use it to make an ot we are only trying to get someone auditable and to get the constantly restimulated solutions out of the way to clear this lifetime on the whole track obviously having bank is service facsimile that accounts for the reluctance to go clear noticed earlier while finding goals being incapable could still be service fac at an ot level if say the ot couldnt tilt planet but attacking this kind of service fac directly is too steep gradient you could run service facs at all different levels the concept of service fac is based on confusion and stable datum theory in running service fac we are attacking solution that is barrier to getting rid of confusion you can pluck the stable datum out of the center of confusion and thus get discharge of the energy of the confusion stable datum holds confusion in place this is the reverse of using stable datum to handle confusion charge is an electrical confusion as long as stable datum holds confusion in place the confusion will not discharge confusions are tolerable and are not always aberrative most have aberrative value eg in card game life is not in itself an aberrative action there has to be some force and violence involved in the confusion or at least fairly real threat to survival for it to be aberrative the thetan knows that if he ceases to dramatize service fac he will die the immediate thing someone is worried about may not be the service facsimile itself it could be the consequence of something else that is service fac the consequence could be very hidden the two things could have at best faint connection as you take off service facs the central one on which they all lean eventually comes off as you audit the 371case you could get off several before the central one comes to view the apparent service facs lean on the main service fac rote procedure to apply to this would be logical solution to very illogical area but it is better to understand what you are doing if the case has been audited you could collect list of things that have been found on the pc eg old lists r212 assessments etc by discussing them with the pc and following the pcs interest you could find some service facs you might have to reword some of the things you come up with the rightwrong bracket is always the same the question is how would the condition or thing found make you right and make others wrong the service fac is the pc it is something he has it is not like an oppterm it is something he has to make him right and others wrong the pc will slop on the auditing command eg the pc may misduplicate the auditing command as what would be made wrong by it you dont worry about this let the automaticity run out then reask your original question and get it answered service facsimile is not an action an action would be the result of service fac the service fac turns on automaticities because it is an automatic unanalyzed solution for this reason you dont run it as repetitive process automaticity means that more answers than the pc can articulate are arriving from the bank when this happens when words are coming too fast you know that you are getting the service fac throw the question in and let the lions tear at it for awhile let the automaticity run out let er buck when the pc starts to run then when he runs out of answers turn it around and run it the other way if he hasnt already done it himself you are trying to get rid of the avalanche of automaticity and get ta also dont overrun by insisting on more answers than the pc has or you can get stuck flow run it permissively it is sometimes difficult to keep the pc answering the question just because he is in dissociated area the solution is holding back tremendous amount of aberration which wont asis as long as the solution is there the solution just keeps accumulating mass the solution is always below 20 on the tone scale because it is perforce substitute for an itsa line the pc felt that he could not itsa the object that he was trying to make wrong so he dreamed up this solution as final solution and that is substitute for an itsa line then there is asisness or itsa on the environment since there is asisness you get an accumulation of mass since it is substitute for an itsa line the service fac is referred to whenever the pc refers to anything when the solution is below 20 it propounds the idea that to survive it is necessary to succumb that is what it boils down to aberrated though that is for instance the solution may be not eating as in anorexia nervosa the service fac doesnt even have to fit in with the guys environment it is often totally hidden you cant necessarily spot the service fac by what the person is doing it often goes underground especially the very hidden ones some are very obvious too sometimes so obvious that you miss them you could ask as an l and n question what do you think your service fac is interest is the keynote the service fac is not deliberate solution it is subawareness automatic solution which the person is on the verge of all the time that is what makes service facs easy to spot if youve got the service fac the pc cant stay out of it it has to be specific enough you can use represent on something that is too general you can assess the list according to interest the pc tends to fall into the whirlpool of the service fac if the pc has fragile tone arm easily stuck then youve got service fac solution there that is preventing the charge from running off the pc doesnt have to look at things hes got it solved once you have the service fac get the pc to tell you how in this lifetime it would make him right etc dont go for the backtrack this improves the pcs ability to get ta action the peculiarity of the action you are looking for is not particularly great compared with the peculiarity of social mores but it is posing as survival when it clearly isnt prosurvival the pc will be interested in it and it will get ta because it is fixed solution your main interest is ta action just get the mass flowing that was hanging up service fac is fixed contrasurvival solution which the person hasnt inspected it could even be fixed survival solution but then that wouldnt interfere with auditing however using conduct as criterion makes anyone liable to be put away service fac is batty when compared not to the mores of society but to actual survival so you could say the following about service fac 1 it is contrasurvival but poses as survival 3722 it has the pcs interest 3 it sticks the tone arm 4 it is always protruded into pt thus any constant ptp can contain service fac for instance you could ask what did you come into scientology to resolve that is one reason that service fac processing is beneficial however it is dangerous to list too many problems on pc because you are giving the pc too much whatsit while an incomplete list will arc break the pc so you had better twoway comm it use friendly discussion so you can move out of it if it gets sticky dont list it when you find an appropriate problem find the solution in back of it and that fixed solution will give you the service fac if the discussion does get sticky you could free up the ta again by asking for solution that the pc has had to each problem he mentions getting fixed solution means that youve got the service fac notice that r1c and r2c are designed to strip away solutions and stable data therefore they are not likely to freeze up the ta find out if the pc has run r1c and r2c you can use this for data you can ask what the pc found interesting dont ask what problems would that solve that sticks the ta assess it then you can get the service fac the r3r preliminary assessment is almost dead center pitch at the service fac providing it winds up with stable solution this solution should be something that makes sense to you and the pc getting the item with the pcs interest will give you the service fac the level assessed will be too broad the service fac is magnet you are asking for right answers and the pc is giving you the rightest answer of all you can even get the service fac as nonsequitur item on list so watch for service facs on any list the fact that the item that is service fac is dissociated gives you clue the pc will handle your session with his service fac eventually it downs on you what he has been doing keep running service facs until you get change in the pc and free needle and good ta the service fac is the source of the ptp that the pc keeps coming to session with so getting it saves you all sorts of time and trouble when you get it out of the way get rid of the service fac and over restimulation of the case ends this would reduce by 50 the total restimulation on the case so cases wouldnt keep dropping between sessions because of environmental restimulation having the pcs attention on disabilities keeps his attention off the bank thus good handling of service facs increases by hundred to one the runability of the case so you can now run him on steeper gradient 6309c03 shspec302a r3sc some of the data in this tape are contained in hcob 1sep63 scientology three clearingclearing clearing routine three sc the reason person doesnt recover under auditing has been subject of investigation off and on since 1949 it was most recently looked at with regard to r212 it has now come up again with the discovery that to get case gain pc had to have ta motion the fact that you are getting ta action doesnt guarantee that the pc will feel better but ta action does guarantee that the pc will feel worse pc could feel better despite getting ta action because he is getting somewhat over restimulated while still getting some charge off by classes of auditors here is what should happen with ta motion class i he may or may not be able to get ta its mostly chance that determines it class ii the auditor has to be able to direct attention enough to be able to get ta action while he listens it is very light attentiondirecting class iii the auditor directs the pcs attention towards service facs and clearing the itsa line is controlled more firmly to limit the pcs attention to this lifetime and to what you are trying to run using midruds etc to do it 373class iv at this level you are dealing with living lightning backtrack stuff gpms slippery track etc if you see the various classes of auditors arranged in order of increasing control of the pcs attention rather than by degree of complexity of material studied it is all quite clear by overwhumping the pc by restimulating more on the backtrack than you can discharge and by not controlling the pcs attention and letting him skid around restimulating things you get get the pc into condition where restimulation is too great even to permit the discharge of the keyin this is quite problem the resolution of this problem comes with running the service facsimile service facsimile is solution that the person himself has so restimulated that it wont discharge and nothing will discharge past it it is so valuable as solution that the pc feels he would perish if he got rid of it its an overcharged solution which the pc himself is keeping charged up it sits there and charge is permitted to flow by it unfortunately for the being it has weird sort of workability it is nonsurvival solution that has become survival it appears to make sense until it is inspected it has lots of in it when you start to run service fac by running engrams of the thing it will grind and it wont erase this is another odd datum the service fac is mainly diagnosed by the fact that the ta hangs up not by how the person acts in life the low ta or dead thetan case always has service fac the dead thetan case is sometimes hard to spot sometimes he is just sitting in something and when you ask question you get an fn high ta case probably has service fac although it is questionable case whose ta is between 35 and 375 with responsive needle has good chance of having service fac but doesnt necessarily have one person who tends to be out of control on the backtrack is overrestimulated you might even try to find service fac on him when pc has service fac the normal river of discharge is blocked by stable datum that the pc feels is vital to his survival the service fac the hallmark of service fac is that sometimes when it is being run out or between sessions the pc questions the wisdom of getting rid of it service fac is present where life has done so much overwhelming and the pc has done so much overwhelming that life makes more sense he has abandoned it and in lieu of it he has erected this insane stable datum the service fac it might be better to call the service fac service computation or survival computation since it isnt actually single facsimile at all it is the person himself keeping the facsimile in restimulation because he knows it is best there are also third dynamic service facs such as the current prison system penologists know very well that the current prison system does nothing to handle crime it only increases crime this system which was adopted in 1835 was intended not to rehabilitate criminals but to dramatize making criminals wrong prisons are actually universities of crime maintained at public expense similarly the fdas actions are the result of basically good idea namely that the public should be protected against noxious food and drug products but this idea has gone bonkers it was good solution that has been plowed in so that it appears lower and lower of the tone scale and becomes an aberration the legal system of precedent is based on the same principle as the service fac in that it involves maintaining old solutions without necessarily inspecting them it is not true that every solution becomes service fac service fac is solution that is insisted upon but wont itsa solution to be real solution leads to further ability to itsa if solution reduces the ability to itsa it is potential service fac the fda is taking over the publics ability to inspect goodness of food and denying the public an analytical attitude towards products thereby reducing the publics itsa the public longer inspects and decides the fda can now go in and can pass stuff as good that isnt because of politics corruption etc the public can now be caved in by it you would never look to travel agencies as source of social aberration because their business is to increase itsa it can occasionally occur that they do though there can sometimes be problems associated with this eg british west indies immigrants flooding the uk however it is reducing itsa that has bad effect on society generally those things that result in or produce solution without inspection that is too broadly applied generate service facs the service fac prevents itsa of charge that comes up thus causing the accumulation of mass this mass gets restimulated when you prepcheck something that nicks the area lack of itsa also causes lack of ta action since without itsa outflowed there is discharge of charge families can get into noitsa of their individual members lack of itsa results in failure to handle situation in its own zone of reality which is all that aberration is service fac makes it apparently unnecessary to cope with anything in its own sphere of reality that 374is the service that service fac performs the resultant accumulated mass causes ta in the area result in prepchecking or other processing the more service facs the pc has the harder it is for you to get ta action on him in some cases there are definite advantages to getting service facs out of the way before proceeding to running back track you can save time and stabilize clears by destimulating what could key in r3sc is very workable process just inspect the folder past assessments etc looking especially for periods when the ta shut down ie where ta motion stopped for awhile whatever ta motion stopped on will be likely candidate for r3sc dont overrun it if the pc has trouble answering it come off that particular subject the right subject gives very good action the faster you get the real service fac the sooner ta action is restored so this makes r212type processes unnecessary it solves the problem of rockslammers chronic ptps hidden standards and body masses mainly it restores ta action r3sc run on few service facs advances the case to clear it is level iii process because it is clearing process current routine threes that actually produce ots eg r3n will be renumbered as level iv processes 6309c05 shspec303 service facsimile assessment we have been walking around the edges of the field of psychotherapy for some time there is third dynamic service fac in this field in that medical doctors who have training for and have business in the field of mental healing are attempting to take dominance over this field they have understanding of the mind only an understanding of the brain all you would have to to is to get legislatures to pass laws that would only allow those trained in the field of the mind to practice in that field and you would have secured the field there are only 272 mental practitioners in england so we have mocked up our own opposition our own extra item so people qualified at level iii will soon have certificate as psychiatric consultant there is legal patent on the name level iii is expected to be able to clear it also incidentally takes in the ability to treat insanity neurosis and psychosis these are just different degree of what is wrong with the mind the person who cant even manage himself and the environment we call insane what is wrong with him is that he has got the final solution some solution that is so allpervading that he doesnt have to itsa anything after that he never has to look so he just disappears in mound of unasised mass in processing certain amount of introversion takes place for the purpose of bringing about extroversion the only time introversion and erasure do not bring about greater reach and greater arc is when overrestimulation is brought about that factor still exists in class iv but there it is whole track that is most likely to get pc into an overrestimulated condition not just itsa on this lifetime at level iii you could overrestimulate someone who was already batty the worse off case is the more careful you have to be of overrestimulation for instance someone who had been running on conceptual basis who did not have much reach and not much arc with the environment might get overrestimulated if you got them to contact the pain in the thing that they are running to clear somebody you will stay in this lifetime only at level iv do you leave this lifetime and that is when someone has an active ta that doesnt go high or low with any pc on this planet it is environmental restimulation that is the straw that breaks the pcs back you can go backtrack but it is rough it can make the pc unauditable an hgc operating with raw public or even with scientologists has to battle with environmental restimulation not with the bank neurotic and psychotic states are caused by environmental restimulation the two factors involved are 1 the amount of environmental restimulation 2 the inherent susceptibility of the individual therefore if all you did was to try to reduce environmental restimulation some people would go sane and others would go mad with boredom it is question of acceptable randomity dogooders end up reducing randomity and things can get pretty boring an acceptable level of randomity equals the amount of environmental restimulation divided by the amount of restimulation the individual can withstand this being equal to some constant pcs usually audit only what they consider safe the mind starts to shut off any restimulation that would overwhelm it cf the minds protection the pcs ability to resist restimulation is too low for him to face up to track so how are you going to get anything done 375there are three types of cases 1 normal confront of bank those which audit easily 2 confront of bank those who refuse to approach the bank 3 suicidal confront those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs so that they go in over their heads all the time we want to convert the two latter sorts of cases into the former all cases tend towards the safe solution some cases also adopt vengeful solution like getting even with people by dying even dangerous solution seems like the safe solution to the pc all cases when they become more auditable do so along the channel of the safe solution safe solution is safe decision safe environment safe assumption etc all human rights disappear down the channel of the safe solution that is the hole in the bathtub it is actually very dangerous to have safe solution it inhibits observation and anything that inhibits observation destroys someone who is very neurotic or psychotic is so to the degree that they have adopted safe solution this datum underlies mental healing as sweepingly as the datum that survival is the common denominator it is another way of saying the same thing people adopt survival solutions when then become so safe that they become contrasurvival the safe solution makes the person right and others wrong enhancing the persons survival by putting him in position of dominance and letting him escape domination by others it lets him survive and causes others to succumb he thinks this reaches extremes of craziness eg the miser who starves in household of 100 bills his method of survival is to have lots of money it is very safe solution but in his obsession with this safe solution he has neglected to spend any of it to live so his attention becomes more and more concentrated and less and less sensible for someone to be wise he must be able to observe his environment he must be able to reach it is not good enough to have maxims tucked away to which you can refer in times of stress philosophy becomes not wisdom but study of safe solutions the safe solution is the service facsimile there are times when you will have to be very clever to find just what it is in the pc it is complicated alterised and not believable there could be thousands of them you want to get the one the test is did it resolve the case in the first ones you find the most you can hope for is to find something that moves the ta and brings you closer to resolving the pcs case when you have found the service fac on the case the needle will be looser and the ta will be in more reasonable state acting better when something you have found doesnt run on the rightwrong bracket you prepcheck this is an invariable rule you could fix the pc up by taking anything that has been found charged on old assessments and prepchecking it that which you couldnt prepcheck with ta you could run on rightwrong if it goes nowhere on that ok there is harm done all this will eventually reveal the service fac one way in which you could be too clever with this would be to get overambitious and throw the pc in over his head as follows you are pulling the stable datum out of the confusion therefore the pc may be thrown into the confusion which makes him feel weird if you run r3sc on the stable datum until it is flat it will make it all right for the pc one of the tests of the service fac is that the pc is likely to say or at least think that he is not sure that it is wise to get rid of it be very sure if you are working with someone who is already shaky that you unburden the case gradiently even though he is standing there saying his service fac environmental restimulation has to be reduced on such case before you add any processing restimulation the better the assessment and the less gradient there had been the greater the shock to the person remember the pc adopted the safe solution because he couldnt stand the environmental restimulation so you dont necessarily want to get the big stable data first it is better to start off with r1c or 2wc on solutions that he has had to his problems the more solutions he has had to problem the more it will stick 376how do you raise someones ability to withstand environmental restimulation you pull his service fac since that is what reduces his ability to see his environment the more safe solutions he has adopted the more environmental restimulation he isnt asising the less he is confronting etc oddly enough or not so oddly the thing that reduces his ability to handle his environment is the thing that he has adopted to handle his environment for him when you remove that thing he can now confront and inspect the environment and handle it when you get the environmental restimulation out of the way the pc can confront the backtrack we have gone into this line because we want faster run to ot i dont care anything much about clearing or whether he gets clear or not we are not trying to make happy persons we are trying to make an able person you can make clear by getting off enough service facs it makes better human being but the point is to cut down the time spent at level iv which is already sizable amount at level iii then we can handle environmental restimulation by knocking out the service facsimile which is what encourages environmental restimulation we have enough attention free so that we can go wholetrack and erase things faster and we are not held up by low tas and high tas so we dont have this situation w started to do gpm we got little bit mixed up we got into the bear goals then we got into the helatrobus didnt realize it but we were into the invisible picture goals all the time by knocking out the service fac session restimulation also drops because the session is part of the environment the assessment for r3sc is simple one it is l and n the lists dont have to be superlong in fact they should not be longer than eight to ten pages with twenty items per page unless it is just safe to keep on listing list should be only as long as it has to be to keep the pc from arc breaking because it is incomplete here is the r3sc procedure 1 you do parts of existence list and null it down to some one item that the pc doesnt object to say peanuts it doesnt matter if the item is right so long as the pc doesnt argue about it if say four items are left in and the list isnt complete we will just do step 2 to all four of the levels left in as long as the pc isnt protesting pcs dramatize doing only what is safe ss they move in towards the service fac so you may need to do this assessment several times 2 take the item found and list safe solutions to it safe assumptions about it or safe decisions about it whatever clears with the pc the item you get eg not eat them is probably either as close as you can get to the service fac at this time or the service fac itself 3 take the item and work it over until it is solution to more than just that one dynamic eg solution to more than just peanuts you could ask how could that apply to other dynamics etc we want broader version of the safe assumption to get closer to the real service fac 4 in any case take whatever you get from 3 and run r3sc brackets or prepcheck on it 5 repeat the entire procedure starting with new parts of existence list 6 run it to free needle if you run something and you still have some charge on it list for safe assumptions about that topic look for identifications pcs will mention assumptions that dont make sense such an identification is cousin to one or more service facs note them when you find them this whole operation does take some genius 6309c10 shspec304 destimulation of case use arabic numerals to apply to routines use roman numerals to apply to body of data eg scientology iii not 3 auditor report forms are getting standardized format when handling service facs you are handling stuff that can bypass more stuff than any other thing there is if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on 377his case and he blows his skull off the service fac is what keeps the environmental restimulation restimulated when you are handling the service fac you are handling what makes aberration permanent many pcs have second dynamic service facs this has nothing to do with life but it has to do with your situation on this planet at this time the sickness and incidence of illness on this planet is unusually high because the way to make everybody wrong is obviously to produce nothing everybody counts on guys going ahead and making bodies keeping the civilization wheeling to keep thetans interested enough so they will keep reporting back the industrialist is in trouble at this time because he is producing on wholetrack basis thetan is in trouble simply because of mest that is how he looks at it if he could have arranged never to have created anything he would not now have anything to be in trouble with clearly so any creative activity is doomed to attack and the artists and musicians of this planet always attract someone who caves them in the same is true of industrialists etc they dont have enough force to protect their creativeness so people attack them therefore you find lot of service facs having to do with the second dynamic r3sc is thinice activity if you go one step too far you are in the soup so be careful to word questions with in this lifetime that way you will avoid lot of trouble from overrestimulation from getting onto the whole track with service fac running we are engaged upon keyout not bank erasure keep the pcs attention on this lifetime and be careful since it easily goes to other areas which can then easily become bpc that is the second factor that makes service facs fraught with potential arc breaks the first factor was that if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on the case the moment you combine scientology iii with scientology iv you will lose you will have had it you will have left on the pc restimulation both from the pt environment and from the whole track how do you handle this so as to avoid this situation word questions so as to avoid all goaltype answers if an item rocket reads dont take it since only gpms rocket read you could get away with running it if you handled it very gingerly with in this lifetime and if you were very careful and didnt oppose it you can note it for later reference the best way to avoid problems is to ask questions that cannon be answered with goal asking for safe assumption about item is pretty safe in that you dont get goals but asking for safe solution to something tends to give you goals service facs are almost never to but they can be expressed that way avoid it scientology iii bypasses less charge run skillfully than scientology iv just because you are not among so many potentially heavily charged restimulatable things what you want to do with scientology iii is to destimulate the case so dont restimulate it in running service facs you can be wrong by restimulating the more you restimulate the more wrong you are the value of destimulation appeared in the search for ta action which is the only way to advance the case the whole track is too restimulative for most pcs getting into it produces overrestimulation and stops ta action the only reason that the ta doesnt move is that the pc is in overrestimulation take room and fill it half full of cotton bales representing charge person in that room wont be able to move too well then put some more cotton bales in the room now the person will have even more trouble moving trying to handle the situation by putting even more cotton bales in the room stops his entirely the proper course of action is to get rid of as much as you can that is already there clearing is getting all the false data and this lifetime restimulation off the case prior to recovering the truth one gets very good ta action doing scientology iii just by working on that line any case is overrestimulated when you start work on it the basic mechanism of entrapment is to keep the persons attention diverted to financial matters for instance to keep kicking him ground with various forms of trouble and worry so that he doesnt have chance to observe what is really going on the thetan wants something out of this planet and he thinks there is some pay he thinks that he is getting something out of it the trap wouldnt run at all unless the thetan was so busy in it that he never had time to look at it if he could see the trap he could get out of it but his attention gets diverted in it he then makes foolish decisions to hold off foolish confusion and gets still more entrapped it is perfected system of attention fixing shifting and dispersal real trap not just cynical snide comment those aspects of this planet that you protest are probably there to excite protest and overrestimulation eg finances money is bum itsa what is it in socialism you can never buy yourself off you stay tied down life is constant restimulation the pc comes into session subject to all this environmental restimulation restimulation comes in several different forms 3781 pt environment 2 restimulated bank restimulated by the service fac actually there is an interrelationship between environmental restimulation and service fac restimulation in that the pc wouldnt have the ptp of environmental restimulation if it werent for service facs 3 auditing restimulation what has been restimulated in auditing and not erased 4 current session restimulation what you are going to restimulate in the session or what you are in the process of restimulating in session 5 auditor restimulation restimulation occurring simply from being audited if the auditor is rough restimulation from flubs all of these sources of restimulation are interactive to some degree they all hinge on the service fac crossrestimulation occurs the only core on which it sits is the service fac the service fac keeps the environment restimulated it has great bearing on other forms of restimulation and prevents their discharge however it can be knocked out the most notable thing about the service fac is that the thetan is doing it right now he is making himself right and someone else wrong all on his own cockeyed determinism he is keeping the gpm in restimulation because he is using the service fac he is mocking up his bank and he is the effect of it too but he is responsible for everything that is happening to him the preceding is happening right now he is doing it it is decisional how does the auditor restimulate something by putting the pcs attention or letting the pcs attention go on any heretofore inert charge that can be restimulated ie anything that is not already discharged the pc is totally incapable of causing trouble in session the auditor can let the pcs attention wander all over restimulating anything his service fac directs him to you wouldnt have psychosomatic illness unless the thetan had as all do the service fac that the best way to handle situation is to get sick that is service fac that goes backtrack easily the way an auditor restimulates something is to let the pcs attention wander to it or to mention it how much it gets restimulated just depends on how often you mention it and with what intensity the mechanism of restimulation is name it the way to get an arc break is to name something and permit itsa this gives you instant bpc as when the auditor says sorry about that last session we had another way to get an arc break is to let the actions of the session bar the discharge of materials already restimulated eg the pc comes into session itsaing and the auditor getting model session in shuts the pc up auditors often ask silly questions to be sociable then shut the pc up in order to start the session cutting the itsa line an auditor can goof at start of session by putting in whatsit eg how are you doing and then not letting the pc itsa were going to start the session now you can do this any time it results in an explosion on an uncleared pc the service fac is interacting with whatever else is restimulated so the pc is putting in continuous restimulative factor in sessions you will get restimulation trouble as long as pc has prominent service facsimile getting one out of the way knocks about half the potential restimulation out of the way audit smoothly as you do it if you the auditor do the tiniest little thing wrong when you are approaching service fac the pc targets you as the one to be made wrong provide good specific small targets for the pcs attention and dont let his attention slide around it is trick to find service fac without restimulating everything here are some tips 1 audit smoothly this is the solution to session restimulation 2 restimulate more in your current auditing than you have to dont start naming whole bunch of things 3 give the pc frequent on auditing prepchecks to handle charge from past auditing do this every five or six sessions 4 keep up with the pt environment audit at least 2 12 hours week in case that was over restimulated one would look to see what was practical to cut out normally the auditor would be concerned with reducing the auditing restimulation this is often overdone by excessively big targets 379b loss of control of the itsa line the auditor lets the pc talk too much one reason an auditor goofs is that he has his own service fac he is unwittingly trying to make lrh or the tech wrong he will usually come around when this is pointed out another phenomenon is that as you look for the pcs service fac and jog it he will target you to be made wrong which can be fairly restimulative and make the auditor flub one way to handle that would be to switch auditors you want to key out service facs so in assessing always use in this lifetime you dont want whole track only gpm rocket reads if you have room full of cotton bales you wont get anywhere with that finding the service fac directly because there is room to move around but you can reduce the restimulation in other ways if you handle all auditing on the basis of reducing restimulation you will seldom be wrong any pc who is running badly is doing so because of overrestimulation any solution of the auditing situation or the case has to take into account reduction of restimulation either by discharge or destimulation you can destimulate the persons life somewhat you can reduce one or more of the five sources of restimulation see p 503 above you could destimulate any restimulatable area whatever you can in fact work with then audit out this lifetime service facs case is as hard to run as it is restimulated more than that anything that reduces restimulation on the case is valid auditing for instance you could destimulate past therapies psychiatrists add more environmental restimulation than they pick off case so of course they fail 6309c11 shspec306 service facs and gpms hcob 8may63 routine 3 the nature of formation of gpm says the early gpms contacted are implants this does not mean the pcs own gpms do not exist the pcs own gpm has power and velocity over an implant gpm in ratio of 1000 or 100000 to 1 there is great difference in order of magnitude the whole and entire amount of implanted gpms all together are one ri of one of lrhs gpms the oppterm goals which is one of about hundred ris on personal gpm which extends from trillions 30 to trillions 20 on the track and is actually still continuing number of you have some protest on the length of the time track multiple trillions of trillions etc modern times is trillions 13 to now the stuff that is likely to influence the pc in pt what you are doing in r3sc is fooling around with the pcs current ri in his existing pt goal line of his current truncated goal gpm there is an opposition to it clearing up this stuff is clearing dumbbell pair out of the pcs own gpm restimulated in pt out of sequence on the track the pcs goal will fall out of this with thud it is probable that while you are listing for the pcs service fac you will get the pcs goal rocket reading the amount of aberration required to reduce power must be comparable to the power reduced to account for the reduction of power of the thetan we must find some force of equal power that could aberrate him all the implant gpms did was to confuse you as to what was your goal and what was an implanted goal implanted goals were installed backwards from top to bottom an actual gpm is run the way it was lived from bottom to top use r3m2 to run actual gpms r3m2 is apparently variant of r3m r3m is method of running the sequence of actual gpms ri by ri starting either with an ri or with rocketreading goal starting with the goal the first ri is obtained by using goal oppose list also known as source list more or less with the wording who or what would the goal oppose subsequent ris are obtained by ri oppose lists these have to be listed rightwayto there are different rules for finding the item on these two sorts of lists each ri after it is found is packaged by relating it to the goal and to the ri found just before it and when verified is added to the line plot this packaging step also lets you know when you have entered new gpm as the ris will longer relate to the goal previously found when this happens the new goal is found by doing new goals list for new rocket reading goal or the pc may volunteer the new goal you can also start r3m with an ri perhaps one that was obtained from r212 in this case you just keep doing ri oppose lists and getting new ris by the time you have several ris the pc will give you his goal but you continue with the ri oppose lists other references on r3m are to be found above 380dont use an early actual goal as service fac and try to run it as such if you do this you are making the guy look down the goals channel the goal in an actual gpm is the furthest item from pt being the bottom terminal when you get the pc to reach down for that goal he is to some slight degree traveling through time between that goal and pt and he livens up the whole track which is lot of charge it is like looking down between the rows of the helatrobus implants you get tunnel of blackness that is what happens when you reach down gpm the same thing happens with the pcs gpm channel only it is quite different order of magnitude with the helatrobus implant it is not so good to do this but with the pcs own actual gpm channel it is like having your head shot off with sixteen inch cannon the residual charge in an actual gpm is incomparably greater if the goal comes up as you look for service fac put it in the auditors report form clearly marked with red circle and dont do much with it except in r3m2 if you run it you are getting the pc to look down through the gpm to the beginning of some track with at least hundred ris between you and it you will get ta etc if you run it as service fac but the pc running it will scuff up his track the pcs own gpm looks like black island floating it is quite meaty they come in different sizes but each is distinct size you are running the pc back and forth from the bottom of mass maybe three feet thick 75 feet long and 30 feet wide you could well restimulate so much mass that the ta will all of sudden freeze up you would have to remedy this by working out the gym with r3m2 the pcs own gpm has the beauty of disintegrating as you work with it you get rocket reading blowdowns the black islands turn grey then start shaking and fraying like opaque jello that someone left in the sun the power in this early gpm is commensurate with the native power of thetan ie there is lot of charge on it this charge doesnt discharge through the pc or the meter luckily the technology for handling this is all in r3n see above and r3m2 ris relate to goal but each as its own central postulate with regard to the goal this is true of every ri in the pcs gpm for instance the current ri might have central postulate of to ring bells where the goal is to go to school you might get an oppterm of people who bring their lunches without knowing the goal this would be puzzling thats why it would be an aberrative factor r3sc will land you somewhere in the vicinity of the current oppterm or terminal of the pcs own gpm as it applies to pt or it may land you near some old ri that is in restimulation in pt that will be the source of the pcs pt restimulation with r3sc you can knock that in the head you can pull its central postulate but when you try to make the service fac make sense you may find it impossible to do so until you relate it to his goal by running r3m2 so that is actually what you are auditing when you find the service fac you could find service fac without meter by having the pc write list of solutions until he is easy about it and feels that it is complete then looking on the list for the solution that makes the least sense however when seen as an ri such things can be seen to make sense when you are handling service fac you are handling the central postulate of an ri so running r3sc disintegrates the ri the thinkingness of the ri is sometimes different from its beingness eg you may have the ri lame man but from that you may not know what the significance is that lies within it ie you may not know what the central postulate is you could list for this and find it it may turn out to be lameness things can be audited nicely without being related to the gpm where they occur even though under these circumstances they might not make sense service fac is actually not whole ri but just the central postulate of an ri you are handling the central postulate of an ri when you are handling service fac so you get disintegration being assumes an identity because it has solution in the middle of it for instance in the middle of the identity lame man we may find lameness as solution to something sometimes an ri comes up as its own thinkingness but beingness ri in particular may have an idea at its core an ri always has an idea at its core but sometimes you dont have the central idea when you have the ri given the ri you could list for the central significance which is an automatic solution its safe it solves everything this safe solution would be the service fac that is how an ri is generated the thetan has an idee fixe so he never has to inspect in order to solve so therefore he never asises the mass so therefore he gets caught in the middle of the mass if the thetan does this with goal he gets 381an accumulation of ris resulting from this goal each of these ris has the goal carried through into it but there is also new idea that makes each ri and that whole mass comes together as gpm so you get this huge mass this huge block of energy with its separate items in it they dont appear separate the whole thing is all squashed together from so much attack and so little inspection the whole thing is dominated by one goal eg to go to school which is common to every ri or identity within it this is what it is accumulates it but that goal all by itself is noinspection it is way to solve all problems totally uninspected in fixed way for instance the goal to solve all problems go to school is totally uninspected solution and now gathers to itself identities who have this idea as well as other characteristics because the goal is uninspected automatic and fixed it generates into itself the second step of identities eg an idiot child that have the goal as central idea but which already have their own characteristics they have the main idea the goal as dominant but the characteristic of the identity after it is longer able to carry out the postulate is something like that of an idiot child the idea of an idiot child is people like unintelligence so the central idea may be unintelligence solves everything but the ri is an idiot child the only way that it could exist in the first place was that the thetan had the idea of the goal to solve all problems go to school so there are three types of ideas in gpms 1 the goal of the gpm this is the first postulate and central idea of the gpm 2 the central idea or postulate of the ri which in itself forbids inspection 3 the identity or individuality or the ri this is the accumulation of mass that results from the fact that 1 and 2 above being fixed uninspected solutions forbid itsa and hence forbid an asisness from occurring that is the anatomy of an ri but it also tells us what service fac is this is what gives us the dwindling spiral of abilities ris substitutions of ideas for thetans the thetans ows all these get piled up on these fixed ideas the biggest fixed idea was goal which then developed into gpm that which is not inspected tends to persist because it is never asised what happens person gets hell knocked out of him the ri and its significance is the constant invitation to attack but it is never the right enemy the constant ow and battling that ensues from this fact accumulates as the mass of an ri it is interesting that an idea is most easily substituted for thetan because it has mass and seems to contain some wisdom i am guard implies i dont have to understand or inspect the thetan has tried to solve screwup with fixed idea or postulate this is sort of sweeping under the rug that permits inspection therefore asisness therefore persistence any idea is liable to become substituted for thetan because he does it himself when one gives up on one goal one gets another for instance say the last three or four mountain ranges the thetan built fell down and fouled up his planet so on the ideal planet never build mountains becomes the solution that holds all the confusion uninspected it is solved instead sooner or later we will find him running society for the prevention of building mountains he is now an identity he is the idea never build mountains substituted for thetan the pc keeps abandoning old solutions as they fail and keeps getting new goals this is covered in r3m basically except for finding the pcs own goal and distinguishing it from implant goals so be alert to anything you find in r3sc that rocket reads but dont run it with service fac tech you cant run gpm with service fac tech but you can run one ri with it but that rocket read is more than just service fac r3sc does handle the ri that is part of the pcs pt environment if you find an ri and your pc is having energy doing odd things to him giving ghastly sensations body distortion sensations etc the pc is liable to disclaim the ri in an effort to get away from it all getting towards the service fac causes qualms and invalidation in pc the service fac is pro survival so he doesnt want to give it up dont q and with that invalidation to do so will just restimulate it worse if the invalidation occurs pick up everything found as service fac and finish it off standardly with all of the r3sc steps when stable datum is pulled out and not run off completely you leave some of the confusion behind so just get it with r3sc if you take the stable datum half way out of confusion you leave the confusion this is what happens when you leave r3sc on something halfrun the result is that the person will get foggy his memory will deteriorate if you took the stable datum all the way out you would blow the confusion 382the postulate in the center of the ri is so far downscale that it is twenty ta divisions below hide it is an idea that has turned into mest you run it only as far as cognition but it may enter at any of these levels 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival but real gpm item service fac goes through the steps of 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival 5 domination 6 rightwrong then the next 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival etc again the service fac may enter at any of these stages it starts off reasonably sensible but becomes very weird like cows are kissable as safe solution to how to repair motor cars this service fac will turn out to be intimately related to solution or domination etc in the pcs mind when you try to run it the pc may not be able to fit it in on rightwrong so check it over on the other buttons he may well cognite on it and blow the charge you could then see how it is solution how it would make or has made him right and others wrong around and around on the buttons until the pc is out of answers and the buttons are clean do an 18button prepcheck and it will all cool down the auditor is always in danger of grabbing the gpm accidentally getting the goal instead of the service fac this has advantages too since the pcs goal is hard to sort out from implant goals the pcs own ris are probably what make implant goals read they read off the top of the pcs own ris the service fac doesnt have to rocket read you can accept one that does but be equally prepared to take one that just ticks the pcs service fac is his current solution his current ri monitored by the goal it is very aberrated stable datum it is an unexamined solution that keeps the pc from doing anything it was decent solution when the thetan first got hold of it but then it started running his life therefore it does not even vaguely take care of environmental enturbulation the rule when in doubt communicate is an attempt to overcome the effect of service facs you have to work at it to do r3sc wrong the best way to do it wrong is to be completely unthorough to leave everything unflat the pc will get very confused from having all his stable data pulled away when you handle service fac all the incomplete cycles that the service fac has caused hit the pc at once this generates confusion when the service fac running is not completed the confusion gets even worse so it is good idea from time to time to clean up what you have done get it all finished up some service facs wont run quite in the order given for r3sc it may start on later step than rightwrong or earlier at solutions real service fac behaves outrageously in that regard something else that isnt service fac may be far more mannerly while still giving ta action 383keep your eyes peeled for the pcs goal since this is the best means of finding it that we have developed keep running service facs until the case is in good shape and the pcs goal has shown up you get the best ta on the pcs own gpm channel you can use r3m2 when you get his goal but that is not your immediate purpose r3sc is for destimulating the pt environment factor 6309c12 shspec305 service facs the difficulty with getting pcs case forward is that the pc has hidden standard which is that by which he measures his progress it is often unknown even to the pc that is why it is hidden an aberration is an outofcontrol exaggeration of the positive or negative of anything thetan can do hence aristotles doctrine of the golden mean the fact that something is normal doesnt mean that it isnt aberrated for instance the difficulty of exteriorization is accepted but it is not anything much in line with the thetans abilities so departure from the normal is particular index of case state auditors sometimes have trouble because pc runs too easily so in judging case level dont use the pcs behavior as an index use the amount of ta motion by running service facs the case can change very quickly so worrying about the pcs normal behavior is unnecessary and irrelevant it is easier to measure persons case against some scales of abilities than against behavior and it is more accurate the condition of restimulation of the case has more to do with understanding the pc and handling him effectively than does the pcs behavior the only things you worry about with pc are 1 can he do the process 2 is he getting any gains 3 is he getting ta motion the fact that someone has hidden standard merely means that he has chronic restimulation that is throwing extra charge on the case it is some facsimile or whatever in chronic restimulation if it was changed in the session the pc had gain if you got ta some of the chronic restimulation will have gone so the pc will have had gain and will probably say so that unfortunately isnt all that happens with hidden standard the pc is also trying to fit every process to this thing to resolve it he is so introverted in session as result that he doesnt asis anything and you dont get ta action time and the ta fit together and the pc drags his hidden standard facsimile up into every incident or whatever in order to evaluate it therefore the pc is always misdating something the hidden standard isnt the date of it whatever date he is in that is why it is the most effective ta stopper there is way of getting rid of the hidden standard process called r3t now called r4t in this process one simply asks the pc for his chronic psychosomatic what he is experiencing and what is always present he answers and you date it whatever it is then you get the itsa line in on it in most cases that is the end of the hidden standard the hidden standard always expresses itself physiologically it is never hidden physically it will be what the pc complains about sometimes it will take you an hour or so of itsa to find out what it is when the pc spots it he will feel better and you will have been getting ta dont let him start giving you problems or you have had it since problems are not itsa so perhaps you should stick to what physical condition are you trying to solve he will finally itsa it out if he doesnt tell you all at once if he gives it to you right off the bat you might get some ta with when has this troubled you in auditing or in this lifetime you can take it up with r3t and date it taking it back as far as need be sometimes dating it will cause it to blow on the spot especially if you dont get it so narrowed down that you get the pc into an engram and have to run it with r3r or if he gets stuck in his own gpm with r3m2 or if in another gpm with r3n r3t seems to be the precursor to the date portion of the datelocate for handling intractable pressure somatics r3t is commonly overrun youve got to watch the pc when you first start using r3t you are likely to overrun it roughly 80 of the time eventually you get slippy and stop overrunning it 384not every pc has hidden standard to the point where it ruins the auditing but hidden standard exists in every case that has difficult or delicate ta that the auditor has to worry about so r3t is the weapon to use to get the ta moving again when all else has failed r3t can fix it but little goes long way dont try to run the whole case with r3t since if you tried to do this you could end up with messedup pc however you could do r3t on everything the pc is worried about in pt you could clear somebody with r3t as long as you you kept good control over the pc and just dated all his pt hidden standards the service fac has to be severely located on the time track in this lifetime so that it will key out handle every hidden standard that the pc could dream up but dont let him pull anything up from the back track in the meantime use tr2 if r3sc goes nowhere you can still clear the pc using r3t the tough case is the pc whose service fac is his hidden standard the only workable handling is carefully to get it dated this is all destimulation so you have to be careful not to run anything the reason you are trying to destimulate the case is so that the pc doesnt have ptps so that he can put his attention on the session if you start destimulating action and then go backtrack and start running something the pc will get restimulated and if the pcs service fac includes making you wrong that is the first thing he will do he will try to restimulate more than he can handle how do you keep the itsa line in on pc that wants to restimulate more be awful damn careful of your whatsits remove all social actions and chitchat from your auditing avoid all violent attention shifts and attention shifts directed by whatsit and dont direct the pcs attention in way that arc breaks him so that he has to get even with you by whatsiting the type of model session to use on case that isnt getting much ta is your wunit type model session social frills w unit was next after the v unit which was heavily supervised r210 and r212 on coaudit basis w unit contained ruds havingness cchs and assists it used gf model session or goal finders model session see hcopl 8dec62 training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units for description of w x and z units gf model session is given in hcob 15oct 2 goal finders model session this bulletin is not on the shsbc overrestimulation leads to selfinvalidation and invalidation of scientology and other dynamics the pc invalidates his own case chews himself up all the time and he doesnt know so let that be warning sign to you the case minus the service fac is subject to less restimulation because he pulls in fewer ptps in his environment case without good processing gains has ptps the way to handle them is by handling service facs there is way of listing for service facs that nails ptps 1 whats safe assumption about your environment 2 what would be safe method of handling your problems here and now in life this is only one of many solutions to this situation such question will drop into your lap the stable datum that the person is using to hold at bay various sectors of his existence so in that respect it becomes method of destimulating the environment you wind up with what he uses to handle his family his job etc take the pcs whole environment to pieces find out where his life is in conflict and what it is in conflict with in pt get what pt consists of this orients the pc and is good scientology i see above for description of scientology i note also the similarity to the pt environment list in expanded dianetics you should both categorize things and locate them spatially this is good for the pcs itsa after you have all of pt use the above process on it you could plot the pt environment out and find where most of the pcs problems are the pc gets gloomiest when talking about this area the ta dies down as you keep talking about it indicating that there are more problems there than the pc can confront he cant put any itsa into the vicinity as the pc looks at the stable datum that he is using to hold sectors of existence at bay and as he finds out more about it you will get his confront on the environment increasing and increasing as his ability to differentiate comes up this is terrific hgc approach now that you know about the hot spots and fixated areas in the pcs environment you have subjects where he cant itsa you can assess by rising ta to get zone where there is service fac in operation as long as one cant itsa something he will continue to have ptps with it so since the pc cant confront the areas of rising ta he will have ptps there make mistakes etc the frequency of 385ptps is the measure of noconfront noconfront is caused by substitute confront which is service facsimile it isnt that the thetan cant confront it is that as long as the pc has the service fac the things he is notconfronting can keep caving him in and restimulating him here is lesson that you should learn about life dont stay in places that you dont want to keep confronting because your nonconfronting will lead you to pick up stable datum to do your confronting for you in that vicinity and the next thing you know this is going to be gorgeous piece of mass and will give you more ptps than you can ordinarily count and your life will become very restimulative the rising ta is less observable than the pcs attitude if the pc hasnt got anything to say about something he isnt observing it something is observing it for him and that something is service fac find this and run r3sc steps on it if you are having trouble with r3sc you have collided with the ri of the pcs ongoing gpm it will still handle with r3sc if with some difficulty you use several assessments to get something to run on r3sc you can use scientology list one assessment or discussion of pt doingness and environment with observation of where the pc goes downtone and where the ta rises indicating areas where the pc cant confront and itsa when you run the brackets step of r3sc you will get ta by asising stable data and letting confusion fly off do thorough pc assessment sheet you can use the pc assessment sheet to find out about the pcs pt if you treat it as leisurely 2wc activity looking for ta action not data ie doing it as an r3sc assessment when dealing with this lifetime let the itsa run free when dealing with past track control the itsa line very closely an assessment at scientology iv is rapid bangbang assessment 6309c17 shspec307 what you are auditing we are interested in the total concept of what you are processing the idea of oldtime psychotherapy is completely useless we have always gone along with the notion that the ideas of oldtime psychotherapies had some historical interest but they are worthless all we can say for the oldtime psychotherapists is that they tried and they did give people the idea that something could be done in dianetics we talked about the mental image picture this is handled today with r3r it is great that we can now get any pc to see facsimiles just by getting the date and duration but the therapeutic value of dianetics is limited since it handles free track which is relatively unaberrative the aberrative value of free track isnt enough to keep someone from being clear or ot you could run r3r for long time and never get there frequently you can of course heal psychosomatic illness with r3r unfortunately the wins you get with it are sporadic this makes it dangerous technology since you will keep going on hoping for repeat win it is an excellent piece of training technology however and it is very useful for an assist r3n handles implanted goals and materials see above people keep on worrying whether the fact that they have implants means that they were implanters what is the relative value of this implanting the value of it is that without knowledge of implant goals and implanting you can easily get pcs own actual track mixed up in then and you will always be confused on the subject an auditor would mess up the pc thoroughly if he ran an actual gpm as an implant gpm or vice versa r3n is very good as way of teaching the form of gpm it gives lots of practice getting rocket reads etc implant gpms have practically aberrative value compared to that of pcs own actual gpms what implanters did was to take the form of an actual gpm as made by thetan and mock up synthetic gpm with his own goal in some cases and implant it some implant gpms were given several times that was very confusing to thetans because it was parody and mockery of the thetans own actions implant gpms were intended to key in the thetans actual gpm they were somewhat successful at doing this but they didnt manage to scramble up the actual gpm undoubtedly implant gpms influenced the thetans postulate of his next goal or some of his ris however the implant gpm makes the thetan feel sad about the universe but the implanter did us favor in that he gave us training ground that can be used to gain familiarity with gpms without wrapping the pc around too many telephone poles the implant gpm has real impingement on the pc he has never been upset about its ris but when you get one of his own ris you will get charge off cognitions etc 386an actual gpm looks more like the gorilla gpm it is more natural ta action lies in the actual gpm because it is much much much more aberrative than an implant gpm it is difficult to get at the actual gpm finding the goal of the pc has always been struggle we have just speeded it up by using the service fac to find the goal the service fac is the top ri terminal of the pcs actual pt developing gpm the reason that the pcs goal was so hard to find was that pt bearing down hard on the goal the gpm all its ris and particularly the ris in pt kept the pc sufficiently over restimulated that the ta was stuck and the rocket read is suppressed if you cant immediately find the pcs goal all the pt sources of restimulation are bearing down on the pt ri and oppterm the last two items of the goal that the pc has and is living with in pt this is all happening because of the pcs own postulate the service fac the mystery of stuck ta is the environment impinging on the pt ris which are held there by the pcs postulate so the pc is doing something there and we have the service fac when you find the service fac in its entirety you have the top or next to top pair of ris in the pcs actual gpm the pcs own gpm will now rr providing you unburden it here is the situation the pc is very overrestimulated by pt and he is keeping himself super aberrated with stable data like horses sleep in beds on the goal to ride the pt goal is so overburdened by pt that if you find goal at all you will find it way down the track at trillions 50 or trillions 30 if you try to run that one the pcs bank goes creak all the back track charge is smashing him forward towards pt his attention is pinned in pt and the goal you have found seems unreal to him it is probably dichotomy of his pt goal r3sc run successfully occasionally gives fall which you will see in the next session as accelerated falls on everything you are running in the next session as you are nulling list you start seeing rocket reads the bank has loosened up enough so that you are reaching locks as the pc differentiates soon you may get rocket reading goal showing up which keeps rocket reading now we have arrived among the last four or five gpms not necessarily at the most recent gpm as they approach pt the gpms are so restimulated and jammed up that it is hard to be sure that you have the most recent one when you get goal eg to hide test it to see if it is an implant goal if it isnt oppose it you want the pc in good shape before you do this since you are about to drag him through three or four actual gpms say you have the goal to have nothing worth taking this will seem to be the pt gpm check who or what would oppose _______ and get the next goal you may have to do this again by now the pc is very uncomfortable try to oppose whatever you get keep doing oppose lists until you get the pt goal test it out thoroughly and list for the latest terminal of the goal eg not to be so slimy when you get the latest terminal the similarity or connection to his service fac will be clear he could have gone over to the enemy camp where he is about to start new gpm the pc may in this case be feeling pretty awful and may start rejecting the goal he is dramatizing the ri terminal that he is in which may oppose his goal the way to run the gpm is as accurately as possible just keep listing your way down to the bottom of it not missing ris or getting off into other goals when you get to the bottom go around and run it back up to get the remaining 50 of the gpms ris that you missed on the way down implant gpms are all backwards but an actual gpm is laid in as it was lived so the bottom is earliest in an actual gpm dont go farther south than the bottom otherwise you might get into foreign gpm dont fool around too much at the bottom the goal throws the whole gpm into violent restimulation dont find ris for goals you dont have that is the only thing that turns off rocket read note that with r3sc you are looking for ris with goal so how long can you keep looking for service facs without finding the goal because you are shredding up rocket read chewing it up there is some danger in it although the way it works it is probably ok for 1550 hours the phenomenon of shredding up rocket reads doesnt start to appear until the pcs goal shows up when the goal does show up put it down prominently in box labelled as goal we havent yet seen r3sc turn off rocket reads but the rule is valid so some caution is in order using this analysis and program we have programmed ot well within reach by making goal finding easier we have also found method of straightening out pt which is useful any time we run into trouble with running an actual gpm the condition when this happens is that pt is now an overwhelm to the pc so if you are running an actual gpm and having trouble we now have handle 1 scout out the possibility that we have run bunch of ris without goals 3872 do an arc break assessment 3 do case analysis checking for going into the next gpm b skipped gpms c listing backwards d implant goals etc 4 run r3sc assuming that the current ri is in restimulation clear would be attainable then r3sc is good way to end off an r3m2 intensive you can get the state of clear at any time with one proviso the most dangerous time to use r3sc is at the outset before finding the first actual gpm because you are finding ris for known goal yet this is also the easiest time to run r3sc so the auditor must be alert for any rocket reading goal if he finds one he must mark it clearly he has to find out what goal it is because you only want to run the last goal closest to pt the system that you know as the service facsimile is the system that applies to every ri in every gpm the pc has it is the system that has aberrated the pc all pcs have done this the service fac cum laude for every gpm is the goal as an ri it accumulates mass in the form of subsidiary ris the point where you look for the pcs goal is when using r3sc you have rehabilitated the pcs rr you should always run case on the latest point of his aberration that keeps his pt cleaned up it keeps his ruds in his skills as an ot will slowly be rehabilitated he advances as being in relation to pt therefore he advances smoothly and calmly with regard to pt you wont get flukey manics turning on and off rollercoastering because of dropping earlier on the track than is real to the pc this in fact is the cause of manic behavior the pcs arc is down because of unreality which occurs when he is run over his head so he cant cope with the aberration that is thrown at him it is actually doubtful that the pc could make it to ot unless you continually handled the aberrative factors of pt it is best to cut the case back from pt this gives better reality factor and smoother stabler gains running smoothly cutting back from pt cuts down the time you will require also the pc will be cogniting on pt having wins etc pc ever really progresses beyond his ptp that is the secret of processing at any given moment in auditing the pc is introverted at the level of what is now live in pt his thinking about pt is colored by and introverted into the ris that he is sitting in so they can discharge against pt therefore his power is consistently and continuously cut back to practically nothing we have to handle this the pcs perception of what actually is ptp improves with time so he is seeing bigger and bigger ptps as we go back along the actual gpm or as he progresses in auditing all progress is measured by the pcs ability to perceive ptp the measure of pcs power is the extent of his ptp it isnt how far he can reach it is how wide his ptp is in every case it is the pcs reaction to pt that is creating the problem beyond that there are problems as ris are peeled off the gpm and new ris come up into pt new problems appear to the pc the pc is being an ri and therefore it is his service fac underlying it is many more ris his current gpm etc fortunately there are only twenty or thirty actual gpms on the whole track this puts us on the sunny side of thousand hours to ot and perhaps even within 500 hours of ot 6309c18 shspec308 saint hill service fac handling it is adventurous to go in to handle something like the mind without knowing what you are doing every case and every practitioner in the field of the mind has been concentrated on one aspect of existence and dedicated to observing existence only through that aspect so wonder little has been discovered and less applied knowledge about the mind means freedom for life and beings in this universe therefore anyone who is after enslavement is also in favor of ignorance about the mind there are two ways to make people ignorant 3881 deny any information at all 2 substitute false data this is an easier and more effective way add to this the fact that 3 everyone is mired in his own favorite data and youve got good trap the way to overcome ignorance is to find the precise mechanics that apply to all minds because this will be broader truth that overrides all the minor data on which people are fixated false relay of the basic truth dropping out bits could again make slavery because it would deviate enough from the generally recognized broad truth and degenerate into opinion and fixed data this is the difficulty that scientology has had to deal with over the years the solution is results because once the technology is producing results you get arguments so the whole contest has not been for the achievement of certain truths we have had these for years rather the contest has been for workability so that we can get an application of those truths so that we can get rapid release of attention from favorite data and so that there is demonstration that by using the truth greater freedom is attained the one reason why you cant get pc to see that he can get release of attention by virtue of applying general truths is because of his favorite data his fixed idea he considers that any other truths have to agree with this favorite idea in order to be true he is sure that all horses sleep in beds this is not only his fixed data it is his total data any data that doesnt contribute to it he will discard to person with service fac his idea of truth is whether something fits his idee fixe person may have his attention fixed to varying extent so person whose attention is not totally fixed may obtain fringe benefits from studying scientology to the degree that persons attention is fixed he is not able to explore the perimeter of his ideas and therefore cannot see greater truth so he is more entrapped than someone who is less fixed the greater the fixation the closer to psychosis psychosis is the state in which the individual has only the idee fixe the degree of enslavement is the degree to which the individual is fixated on the fixed idea if you try to communicate datum to someone with very fixed idea the datum will be received as false unless you indicate the fixed idea if you communicate some idea that fits with the fixed idea it will be accepted as true it could be that any other datum you then communicate will be taken as true but these data will not be inspected false data is worse than none as far as entrapment is concerned it is like putting up sign pointing over cliff and saying this way lies freedom one can only get fixated on falsehood never on truth truth is an allfreeing mechanism if freedom is not obtained the truth in question must be to some degree limited either in conception reception or application therefore anything you are worried about must have falsehood connected with it there is always lie connected to anything that you are having trouble with session goes well if and only if you get ta action the discovery that pcs case gain can be measured directly by ta action seems simple but it is an advance in technology beyond anything in the past fifty thousand years since it takes judgement of improvement out of the realm of opinion and possible inability to observe on the part of the auditor or the pc all confusions and masses must be there because they are held in abeyance so far as observation is concerned and will not asis because of stable datum stable datum prevents observation of the environment or these masses and therefore accumulates masses what is wrong with mind is that stable datum is substitute for observation person 1 ceased to inspect 2 fell back from living 3 let everything go to pieces 4 chose stable datum instead of inspecting 5 got an accumulation of mass and confusion when you shake up the stable datum by taking apart some of its ramifications confusion can start to flow off 389the amount of ta determines whether or not the pc had good session matter what the pc says there is opinion about it at all good ta means that the pc will feel better bad ta means almost invariably that the pc wont feel good stable datum is held in place by the confusion its supposed to confront and doesnt instead of remedying the confusion as it was supposed to do and as inspection would have done it collects more confusion like dam the more confusion it is supposed to hold in place the more confusion batters at it so the more confusion accumulates around it like twisting fork in bowl of taffy modern science and other mental technologies have taken stable datum that man is an animal and that the mind is brain the idea that man is mass is stable datum in confusion that is persistently dramatized try to tell the modern scientist about stuck flows and he will think that you are giving him lecture on blood and the causes of coronary thrombosis they cant be taught until you get them to inspect some thoughts that they have had about brains modern science has man equals the brain as stable datum what can you do for someone who is totally bound in and fixated to the point where he is being stable datum you could take datum of enormous magnitude and hold gun on this person and say believe it or we shoot you that substitutes forcedatum for inspection ultimately it fails because it is just another stable datum with an associated confusion that is why iq usually deteriorates with years of schooling since modern education is usually just laying in more and more uninspected stable data you would have whole new area of education if you said look over this data and sort out what is true in it you should have the student inspect data and find what is right or wrong about it this is of limited usefulness as long as everyone has his own fixed idea by which to tell rightness from wrongness another way to go about it would be to free up peoples ideas so that their perimeter of inspection increases so that they can inspect the data that lies before them you lead them up with disciplined action that leads them to their fixed idea when they have spotted and disposed of that they are free to inspect and move up to higher levels of truth therefore it is important to find the pcs central fixed idea as soon as possible thus freeing him to inspect more broadly you free being by freeing him not by making him wiser exteriorization and even the state of ot depends on getting greater freedom not more wisdom because with the freedom wisdom will be attainable and will take place anyway by concentrating on the wisdom you are all too likely to fall into the idea of the implanted stable datum freeing attention leads to freeing the being since all that can trap being is his attention thetan can only trap himself by 1 being unwilling to confront things that are not interesting to him 2 being unwilling to back out of situations in which he has lost interest 3 being unwilling to move off and go his way but still somehow be responsible for where he was various combinations of the above lead to the individual trapping himself by leaving some inanimate postulate in his place to confront confusions for him eg i have an unconscious mind that does all that the unconscious mind is that totality of stable data that is holding back that totality of confusion that the individual is longer aware of but is still doing so when you are looking for the pcs service fac you will be looking for that on which his attention is most fixated in pt fetish objects are just things associated in some way with persons service fac any cousin to the service fac that you find will give you ta as the confusion can flow the service fac is the last pair of ris formed at the top of the last truncated gpm postulated it has lot of locks and cousins which you will be able to pick up first it is actually impossible to find the exact pair of items as the service fac the pc has to know that they are part of that gpm before he will recognize them they must be seen as part of the bank before they are recognizable to the pc they have to be related to the last goal and to the last two ris you need these three data in addition you wont find the service fac but try anyway because that is where you will find the last actual gpm it is those two top ris that have the pc so restimulated that pt is restimulative and his ta wont move so you have choice but to find the pt goal of the pc having found the goal find the top oppterm of its gpm by asking who or what would be the latest idea formed concerning this goal to catch catfish make reasonablesized list list it to clean needle and null to reading item prepcheck it after the pc has cognited for awhile then you might 390see it rocket read the difficulty in finding pcs goals has always been in getting them to rocket read you can do this whole operation with only ticks and rr until you have prepchecked the top oppterm here is how to do it 1 find what you hope is his service fac this gives you enough ta so some charge is off hunt and punch around until you know youve got something that will get good ta action either on rightwrong prepcheck or something dont do anything with it it is not the real service fac this keeps the pcs tone and morale up by virtue of getting some ta off it or by having the promise of getting ta off it 2 start looking for the gpm if things bog down while looking for his goal you can still run the item from 1 for awhile and give him some ta 3 this could go on for couple of sessions until you get goal that ticks and that keeps going tick which reads as an actual goal probably from the past track it is not likely to be the pt goal so 4 use goaloppose to get up to pt so you oppose the goal do the same check on it then oppose that goal and get another one check each new goal found as being for sure an actual goal check if it is the pt goal the pc will be very interested in what you find since they are his actual goals keep doing this until eventually you will reach his pt goal 5 when you reach his pt goal and you oppose it the list goes nowhere it keeps developing more and more ta the pc wont arc break because you are listing towards his future postulates and unburdening the pt goal by the above phenomena you know that you have the pt goal 6 you check this make sure it is the pt goal 7 list for the top oppterm which may or may not be opposed yet you could find out where the pc is on the gpm by asking him if he has started to oppose the goal yet list to clean needle null it dont have two rrs on the list etc dont be too concerned with whether or not it is really the top oppterm the top oppterm will most likely give lots of needle action when you hit the top oppterm the needle goes mad 8 after you have given the pc his item you sit still and let him cognite 9 put in bigmidruds on the item as far as you can 10 call the item you will probably see it rocket read that is fast slippy way to get into the pcs current actual gpm starting with r3sc when you are on the goals finding step check over any goals that the pc may have mentioned earlier that were seen to fire then having found the pt goal you are ready to take the bank apart that first ri accounts for all pt restimulation the reason why we havent been able to find goals on pcs is the overburden of the top terminal and oppterm accumulating all the debris of pt and masking the top gpm or any gpm for that matter because of this masking action we used to have to find goals with ticks instead of rocket reads when the top ris and their accumulated mass are gone you are ready to roll right down the bank and back up again the pc gets ta ta ta now hes got new problem we are in new gpm and can go get it in the same way 6309c25 shspec310 summary ii scientology 0 note summary i was probably 6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing 391in the material covered since 24ju163 plus cchs and touch assists we have basically all the material in scientology every level of scientology contains in vignette all the levels of scientology scientology 0 deals with the problems confusions and wrongnesses of existence with the identification of those zones of chaos falsity and upset people go around thinking that healing including mental healing is all solved scientology 0 points out that they are unsolved areas this level is easy to work with because all you have to do is to find falsities and wrongnesses it is matter of degree how much you reveal and point out you dont want to open up too much scientology 0 too fast this requires judgment it is level that has ta in it unless you talk about false solutions it is better to talk about solutions than problems dont imply that there are only problems this gives the audience ta the last stable datum anyone can get in is tolerance of terrible condition it is best to talk about false solutions but this is scientology i scientology i gets the false solutions off scientology 0 just recognizes existing chaos typical question on scientology 0 would be do you find your home noisy do you like your job the idea is to give the person the idea that his life might be better that is the sole therapeutic action of scientology 0 hope instilled by identifying problems and giving faint hope for change this is quite workable this level says 1 there is problem 2 maybe something can be done about it hope factor view of scientology 0 is view of the world as it exists we need this as legitimate level of inspection scientology 0 is in processing to the extent that in order to find service fac you have to find what problems the pc has that is the scientology 0 factor at that level little of this goes long way in all auditing you have to keep the hfactor in scientology 0 is very acceptable on public level if you keep it very mild as far as the degree of hope you offer is concerned if someone comes in with all sorts of problems take only one and tell him that maybe you can do something about it pick out some small possible gain and put some hope in on it person can have this he can give up just little of his service fac so this gets around the service fac little dont promise the sun and the moon that is too much it is unacceptable it threatens his service fac so what youve got to do is to take one thing and put in very little hope that is acceptable that is confrontable you have to judge what is confrontable and give him neither too much nor too little if you ever gave somebody drill on scientology 0 you would give him long list of confusions and have him pick out the one or ones that people could confront there always something that you can get pc to confront on any dynamic the trick is that there is something to be done about any condition that the person can do the elements of hope are 1 there is something that can be done about it 2 there is something that you can confront and do about it in processing if the pc gets in trouble just getting him to tell you about it can raise his tone level because that is doing something about it in scientology iv never force the pc forward if the hill is too steep dont push be willing for the pc not to do it but at scientology 0 find something that person can do and get him to do it remember gradients when giving advice to people if you advise people this way your advice will be followed and you will win dont ever suggest that they do something that they know cant be done nobody ever gives anybody anything they can do in social work consequently you get socialism and total indigence and you get social workers who go terribly downtone because they have given the client an overwhelm and arc broken him by telling him something that he knows cant be done because of some stable datum that he has adopted at scientology 0 it doesnt matter if you put the itsa line in or he does even in r3sc you can offer things to the pc that you noticed had gotten ta and run them they may be quite confrontable things and therefore not really the service fac but you could get ta running them person who can only confront getting mad at the auditor can confront getting mad at him because he is the persons best friend this is the secret of the arc breaky pc he is arc broken in the world at large and it is safe to get mad at the auditor people may get mad at their friends because that is all that is safe perhaps marital squabbles exist by virtue of this mechanism the scientology 0 aspect of existence is 392that you dont tell people about problems that you know are unreal to them that they cant do anything about and expect them to be enthusiastic about doing something about them people arent even capable of observing an existing condition they destroy ones stable datum that seeing is believing or that if people just saw something with their own eyes they would believe they dont even see thats the trouble dont ever bother to try to prove anything to person with fixed idea in an area even if he sees it he wont believe it there is ability to observe there is only generality or service fac instead of observation and judgment this person is incapable of asking what is the situation the easiest thing to relay then is an idea that doesnt violate the reality and confront level of the person who is receiving it if he cant look he can get something trustworthily looked at someone who can confront only in small area will be able to be effective only within that area when his confront comes up he will get larger problems to handle he will solve these problems if they are the real problems and not some lowerscale mockery to have real justice you have to have the real situation actually looked at as unbiasedly as possible if all during your career in this universe you had only operated on the real facts you would be in fine shape if you are going to have group operate on any cleared level youve got to take the service fac out of the group as far as you can the characteristics of service fac are 1 nonobservation 2 generality substituting for judgment you cant utterly remove those on an absolute basis from all situations everywhere but you can go long way in this direction the formula for successful handling of case or of third dynamic is 1 what is the situation 2 what part of it is potentially confrontable 3 what part of that can someone actually do something about neglect of this can give you case failures that is the usual reason for case failure someone made an inadequate observation of the confusions of the case and didnt handle the case on the basis of what the auditor and pc could confront the auditor should look over two aspects of case 1 problems and difficulties that he can see in the case 2 the ones the pc can see these are often quite different there is certain level of pc difficulties that the auditor thinks is confrontable and then there is what pc thinks is confrontable if the auditor pays attention to the pcs view of problems and difficulties he will have some loses there is also the question of what the auditor can confront about the case vs the pcs view of what part of his problems as he sees them he can confront then there is also the level of doingness the auditor can confront and the pcs idea of what he can do about those difficulties he can confront thus there are six factors in the auditorpc relationship at scientology 0 1 difficulties the pc is in that the auditor can perceive 2 what the auditor can confront 3 what the auditor is capable of doing about it 4 the pcs estimation of his difficulties 5 which difficulty is confrontable for him 6 what is he willing to do about it you can get case failures by misestimation of any one of these this becomes quite important when you cant get ta action then little discussion with the pc can be very enlightening 393the greatest use of this survey is in odd advices to pcs advice is something we ordinarily ignore because of fear of evaluating but scientology 0 is the level of giving advice using the above survey would make you very successful advisor whose advice would always be followed 1 get an estimation of the problem situation 2 find what part matter how small he could confront 3 get what of that he can do something about 4 get what he could do about that 5 tell him to do it when you find out what the pc can do be militant about his doing it he will think you are genius but you are just getting him to actually estimate the situation and do what he thinks he can do about it when someone acts on that he gets larger reality more confront etc the cycle can be repeated after being successful once the only difficulty is that pcs confidence can rise faster than their real doingness sometimes pcs overestimate their confront ability so undercut what they think they can do just get them to do that point that they can do and you will have agreement because you havent told them anything that they think is false scientology 0 is the level at which one gets an estimation of the case or situation if you can get the other guy to estimate the situation you seldom have to scientology 0 deals with confront life is successfully lived with scientology 0 well in you probably came downscale just because it was out 6309c26 shspec311 summary iii about level iv auditing do not underestimate the difficulty of r3 processes that look for the pcs goal what saves our bacon is r3sc which permits unburdening of the bank by removing the two top ris r3sc gives you variety of locks which can be called possible service facs you get perhaps five or six of these pick the one that gives the most ta to list goals on it wont be the ri but it will give you the entrance point for the goal then you can try to find goal which that fits by asking what goal wouldmight relate to possible service fac obtained from r3sc the overrestimulation of the top ris was what made finding the pcs goal difficult and prevented the goal from rocket reading to parallel with processing what the mind is doing has always been the basic mission of processing the mind is holding in the pcs two postulated ris based on his most recent goal on top of those we will have locks finding the locks takes charge off the ris we list goals against lock that gave good ta since it has been unburdened the goal can rocket read if you get the wrong goal ie too early goal you can oppose it to get up to the pt goal note that pt goal is not very hightoned it tends to be pretty degraded one when youve got the pt goal you want the top terminal this is hard to find because the gpm is truncated incomplete you can find out roughly where the pc is in the gpm and get the terminal by getting the pc to list what are you in pt that relates to the goal on all other gpms you can ask for the top oppterm but not in the case of the pt gpm this is the truncated gpm the programming for any actual gpm whether totally formed one or truncated one is to find the top ris go down through the gpm to the bottom and take out the bottomplusone ri you may have to find the next goal to get the bottom oppterm you want the goal as an ri discharged and you want what it opposes totally flat you want the pc totally out of that bank before you repair it you do it this way because the goal as an ri and its opposition hold everything fixed and rigid in the bank until they are gone go all the way down then come up check the items you found on the way down to see if any are still ticking if so they came from an incomplete list abandon that item and complete the list it came from from this you will get whole new series of ris to do the reason why we dont go from the bottom of the bank to the top is that the goal is part and parcel of every ri it you listed starting at the bottom from the goal as oppterm you tend to beef up the whole bank you throw every ri alive and the pc cant reach them he will have very heavy time you could find yourself getting turned around and heading for the bottom of the bank again it is easier to go from the top down partly because the pc has been implanted with thousands of gpms 394backwards the main reason is that the pc is more interested in the later ris than the earlier ones also you are unburdening as you go down coming up past actual goals while doing the goals oppose lists see p 520 above restimulates the pc more than if you just got the pt goal right off the bat but this procedure is acceptable so long as you dont try to run some far backtrack gpm if you foolishly start to run one you are committed to running it all the way out and it will be difficult since it is unreal and inapplicable to his pt condition it is great strain on the auditor and the pc the only reason why you get old backtrack gpms being restimulated in pt and coming up for example in r3sc would be something like 1 the past goal may be some kind of dichotomy with the pt goal or with goal near pt 2 it seems safe it is far from anything that is wrong with the pc even if the goal you were running turns out not to be the pt goal finish running it then take another shot at the pt goal when you have the pt goal start listing for the terminal of the first pair of ris then go right on down the pt gpm clean out the whole bottom of the gpm when you have cleaned out the whole pt gpm you have to find the goal of the next gpm down then find the top oppterm of this goal that is easy you just ask who or what would the goal as an ri oppose then despite the pcs protest about it go back and clean up the pt gpm picking up any ris that you missed on the way down when it is all cleaned up you can put polish on it by prepchecking the auditing of it and prepchecking the goal sometimes the ta will go up and stick because the pcs interest is in the next bank down all you have to do about this is to call it to the pcs attention and the ta will come down if you dont finish up gpm it will give you trouble from then on when you do your next gpm do the same top to bottom and clean it up in reverse when you get two or more items ticking on this step always take the one nearest the top and work on it say you have three items ticking as you read the line plot take the top one then you wont have to worry about the other two they will fly off and cease to be part of the list recheck for ticks etc until there are more reactions get the idea of shortcircuited electric blanket 35ft by 3ft by 10ft coalblack or fuzzy black with grey undertones sometimes it is grey this object is one actual gpm of the pcs it is made of ideas both gpm and block of concrete are ideas if you get an actual gpm out of sequence and get items out of other gpms they pile up on the pc and jam here and there pc can get gpms out of sequence and maul them about say you have carpet of these things that stretches about mile at the bottom is the earliest past say you take the third from the beginning of track and insert it between the third and fourth gpms back from pt now crisscross the items from the early gpm with the items from the fourth gpm back when you do case analysis you park two of the gpms over to the left now you find more items in the gpm that is ten back you find wrong items and it goes out of gear and is thought of as long in the past it goes out with three that are twentyfive yards away this is longshoremens work in livingness the pc may have found new use for an old goal he may have pulled it out of line so an auditor gets at it goofs and you have debris all over the place it is mechanical proposition like diving into tar pits it is that physical when you run gpm correctly the pc will start getting repetitive rocket reads as the gpm folds up as the pcs perception comes up he can start to see the gpm discharge and fall apart sometimes you have to run two or three gpm before he sees these things the further back on the track gpms are the bigger they get they are like black islands the pc can energize the whole thing by raking his thetan paws over it grubbing around in it sometimes he activates his own suppress and it all goes black sometimes the pc gets into creak of bpc in his vicinity where he feels pulled or pushed into an odd shape by unidentified bpc when pc is in trouble you have new tool to use analysis of whatever youve got for instance when you find an ri before accepting it do an ri analysis on it 1 make sure there are bypassed ris 2 find out whether it came off an incomplete list 3 find out whether the wording in it is correct 4 find out whether its position in the bank is correct 5 find out if it is from the right goal ie not from some other gpm if one of these reads finding out now saves time and trouble it is the same with goal we want to know if it is an implant goal or 395an actual goal and whether it is in the right place etc dont expect an analysis to be completely valid however the case can be so charged that nothing reads or that not enough can be seen to sort out what is there because of charge so we have the rule complete process cycles of action begun on the pc given available time and when you do case analysis do it and then complete what you were doing before you did the analysis eg you were opposing catgut the pc is in creak you do case analysis and find out that you had wronglyworded goal fine now go back and finish opposing catgut case analysis has shown up the fact that auditors have q and ad by finding something wrong going off to fix it and then never completing the action they were previously on this would be enough to keep pcs from going to ot the case analysis is there to take the creak out not to be followed it is the same situation as with an arc break assessment you want to find the bpc not to do something about it if you get case into repair session with lots of incomplete cycles which is now in the middle of something else finish what the pc is in the middle of because that is where his interest is or take the cycle the pcs attention is stuck in do that one first this is not necessarily the earliest cycle left incomplete however sometimes the pcs interest is in the case analysis and the auditors interest is in the case analysis it is more interesting than hodwork the pc wants to lay bricks and make things pretty if you find out that the item you are listing against is wrong dont try to complete the list complete the earlier list that you got the wrong item from the general rule of completing auditing cycles of actions begun on the pc needs to be applied using ones judgment about importances and working from fundamentals 6310c15 shspec312 essentials of auditing the relay of information from one mind to another is communication education therefore the arc triangle operates if you can take effort out of the comm line you can normally get fast accurate comm line but when comm line loses enough mass it becomes unstable that is what happens with verbal data line sometimes there is data on tapes but not in bulletins this is unfortunate since sometimes there is data in the tapes that could make all the difference but you cant hold duplicatable standard because it isnt down anywhere in writing with nomass data eg verbal data it gets altered in the relay there is always some data that escapes the solid comm lines so you cant get all the data for this reason you have to reduce things to their fundamentals keeping what is important you can always have communication of fundamentals both for educational purposes and because to reduce something to fundamentals makes one understand it better the relay of data from mind to mind b is susceptible to many alterises there are almost as many sets of alterises as there are minds for the data to be transferred through this also occurs on the time stream we probably have very little grip on what was thought in 1800 there was tremendous change in manners in the us because of the telephone movies radio tv and the automobile you can overload comm line by putting too great volume of data on it so that it doesnt communicate the door to learning can be shut that way too students sometimes feel overwhelmed by data and long for some fundamentals an overloaded comm line is overloaded because of insufficient time to peruse the material being communicated you can also have too little or too varied communication scientologys data is basically research data at present it is not yet sifted and clarified into fundamentals and less fundamental data we started with the definition of an auditor as one who listens and computes thirteen years later it turns out that listens is the fundamental not the and computes which was part of the original definition in the meantime lot of other data got added which in fact was only added because there was insufficient understanding of the original definition there is datum in the sciences subject has arbitrary data in it in direct proportion to its distance from the actual comprehension of its basics so you get into pure opinion and arbitraries as in art there is nothing actually known about subject when the subject is nothing but opinion opinion present is proportional to knowledge absent for instance when psychological testing requires the opinion of the tester you know that nothing is known developmental line is an ambitious selfcritical line which is trying to achieve parsimony of information the data keep condensing and becoming more fundamental with importances well evaluated this evaluation factor is missing in other philosophies eg that of krishnamurti krishnamurti on time is great but it is not evaluated for importance by him it isnt true that you are studying lrhs case the struggle has been to rise above ones case and the colorations given by the condition of this planet etc this has been quite successful 396whenever things get more fundamental bucketful of items drop out which can make one wonder what is stable from the past the stable data are the axioms the logics and prelogics the fundamental material of the philadelphia lectures and the behavior of thetan the only thing changed was the idea of exteriorization what will person do when brought to point where he doesnt have to be in body we used to think that he would move out of his body this is not what he will do he will move his body off of him because we have changed him upscale to where he could hold position the factors and arc triangle and scales of all sorts these are stable what has altered is applied technology not the theory better more efficient ways of applying the theory have been discovered it is reevaluation of data as applied tech that you are seeing and because you are studying to become an auditor not theoretician you need to know application what gives you headache if anything is trying to apply the theory to case so as to get result all your bulletins are addressed to this subject the data that you are using to square away an aberrated student or pc has to be absolutely fundamentally true the project 80 hcob actually hcopl 21aug63 change of organizational targets project 80 preview p 1 where scientology is defined as the common peoples science of life and betterment drew some criticism because of one phrase the common peoples science of the mind oddly enough this is the one inaccurate phrase in the bulletin the critics didnt spot that fact they just objected to the phrase the mind tends to fixate on those things that contain an alteris of truth and an alteris of truth is the thing that most resists the truth of the situation it is an aberrated stable datum where you have slightly altered truth that you try to give to someone who has already got an altered truth on the same subject the two will come into conflict which promotes all sorts of bad applied technology it is like trying to drive truck through truck when you have two alterised truths in conflict to try to understand an aberrated datum through another aberrated datum results in complications so if you are studying body of data that has any alteration from the fundamental that should be there and you have an alteration that is contrary to the altered datum that you are trying to assimilate you get dogs breakfast you never look at what is wrong with the datum that you are trying to assimilate the conflict wont resolve because you have vested interest in trying to make it fit with an aberrated datum you get conflict of aberrated data against each other overlaid with opinions you have pc who is gold mine of aberrated stable data if any datum which you are using to solve that case is the least bit curved the case wont resolve but will develop new complications therefore the mass of technology that grows up in scientology is centered around applied technology you get masses of data that subside when fundamental is clarified so the greatest possible truth has to be used in application hence research is directed at finding the clearest fundamental possible we have gone long way and have made great gains but we still have to cope with the randomity in the person who is assimilating and trying to apply the data if you in assimilation of data are assimilating to the slightest degree data up against miscomprehension or an allness which you are putting in place of the auditor you dont get an assimilation you have difficulty assimilating the data but you can assimilate the data your trouble comes when you turn around and take the data youve assimilated and altered in some fashion and then try to apply it to the case that is sitting in front of you the alterises in that data will then bring about nonresolution of that case you are confronted with the only solvent is truth even though absolutes are unobtainable truth in very refined form the purest possible is the only thing that will resolve cases all the way because it is the one thing that the aberrated case cannot argue with therefore you as an auditor desiring results have business twisting the technology there is fortunately considerable zone of tolerance that permits the tech to work even when it is imperfectly applied as long as you stay within this zone of tolerance but the tech has to be as nearly perfect as possible the tech heretofore was too imperfect ever to work it has been lrhs task to bring about recognition of fundamentals that is sufficiently great and tech that is sufficiently great to overcome lot of this alteris this task is thousand times greater than the task of simply presenting what is necessary to resolve the case we have to present if so accurately that the pc can still alter it and the auditor alter it and still have resolution of cases this is an heroic problem the amount of difficulty that you have with cases is directly proportional to the amount of aberration or alteris that you are adding to the data that you are trying to apply it is also inversely proportional to the purity and assimilatability of the material that you are asked to study that is tough one but it is pretty well handled the way you solve solutions is solutions wherever lrh has made little 397mistake or wrong emphasis there has been trouble because the additional alteris added by the auditor takes it far enough from truth to make it flukey to apply lrh in describing some horrendous auditing error says its good thing kids that im almost indestructible these things usually get done to first level iv makes an ot but it cant be varied 118th of an inch from its procedure and still work there was hole in it that appeared when it was imperfectly applied there are three types of goals that will rocket read 1 an actual goal with gpm connected with it 2 an implanted goal 3 an actual gpm any gpm can have in it up to hundred actual goals plus the goal of the gpm but there is another source of rocket read 4 phrase in an engram this wont necessarily rocket read but it might even pcs life or session goals can be free actual goals every now and then one will rocket read it is probably lock on an ri if you run it as an actual gpm goal you can even find items from the nearest implants or other gpms or locks but there was gpm there in the first place so when you find goal rocketreading you should check on the meter 1 is this an actual gpm 2 is this an implant gpm 3 is this gpm auditors have been asking is this an actual goal etc instead this can wrap you around telegraph poles because you will be trying to oppose it when it is lock on something and you can do this pulling things all out of place for awhile until the pc crashes in flames the three comm lines in session include the itsamaker line the pcs line into the bank the whatsit line and the itsa line it is an error to cut the pcs comm line to the bank in order to put in the itsa line this stems from misunderstanding of the auditors role as listener the error could also have come from failure to communicate the importance of the pc to bank itsamaker line since it was obvious to lrh that that was what auditing is all about he didnt mention its importance it is where the itsa line comes from without it the itsa line has nothing to carry the auditor is actually there to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the reason why that communication wasnt accepted or didnt go through is the reason why the auditor is having trouble auditing education is acceptable to technical end only when it is conceived pretty purely and relayed well technical data must 1 be conceived purely 2 be relayed well 3 be received accurately its test in scientology is results auditors can also have trouble because they have glommed onto some older datum and made it an all but there is this overriding fact that datum i give you is substitute for you thats the burning thing to remember as an auditor datum wont audit pc the only thing that can handle auditing is live thetan because that is all that can handle the complications that come up youve got to have technology but the live thetan in the chair is necessary to audit the pc 6310c16 shspec313 the itsa maker line 398the itsamaker line is the line you are guiding as an auditor which sorts out the things in the case and gets the material that is reported to the auditor as itsa the itsa occurs at the end of this line the line from the pc to the auditor is the itsa communication line itsa is the identification of isness or wasness it is simple commodity until an itsa is recognized it is only potential itsa auditors can make mistake by thinking that there is potential itsa where there is only nothingness this is the commonest method by which an auditor refutes itsa the meter version of it is cleaning clean this is demanding more than the pcs got if you repeat the question this makes the pc feel as though you havent accepted his itsa when you do this in effect you deny the itsa that you have received you have cut the itsa comm line by refuting the itsa that was offered you may think that the arc break was caused by your cutting the comm line but it was really the invalidation of the pcs itsa that did it the auditor is likely to try to cure this situation by asking whether he has interrupted the pc that is also cleaning clean so the arc break intensifies you havent interrupted the communication you have enforced it you have to keep in mind what you are trying to do which is to get ta action all the significance on the case will have to be handled at level iv anyway so at levels i ii and iii what counts is ta action for description of these levels see p 462 above see also recent tape on level iv pp 524526 above everything wrong with the pc except how and why he started to make time track in the first place comes out of his gpms anyway level iv is the scientologists level the preceding levels mainly set the pc up for level iv i dont think that anyone will make ot except trained auditor trained auditors confront is up he knows what he is dealing with etc probably the basic barrier on the track in mental sciences has been specializing in results without also trying to make everyone into pro causer pcs have been audited on level iv in hgcs they have understanding of what is occurring they arc break easily they dont have the confront mainly they arent educated enough to understand what is going on so they get upset by reason of unknownnesses there is only one way that gpms can be run you must find and run the pt gpm first then keep going on down the track to prime postulate then repair you cant do it as you have been previously told to because you will get items out of other gpms you cant repair gpm until you have gone through the whole thing but you cant afford to make single mistake because you will spend amazing amounts of time correcting it youve got tremendous processes at levels i ii and iii so you should be able to sit down with raw public pc and turn out 35 divisions of ta in your first 2 12 hours on any pc anyplace if you cant do this it is because of lack of understanding of one of the basic points of auditing like the itsa maker line you might have some wild idea about something basic it might even be scientology datum magnified out of all proportion to its true importance for instance you may think pcs never answer the auditing command so you always get the itsa from the meter and leave the pc out thus destroying the itsamaker line you and the meter can act as substitute thetan perceiving things in the bank that the pc isnt perceiving at level iv the material is subitsa you have to depend on the meter at level iv because the pc cant itsa what is in the gpm without some assistance the auditor can undercut this with the meter and find out what the goal is because it rocketreads but if we rely too much on the meter we cut the pcs itsamaker line you still have to stay in comm with the pc and avoid invalidating his itsa and cutting his itsamaker line this doesnt mean that you should be very careful it just means that you should know what you are handling and how to handle it get observant so that you can tell when the pc is introverted when he has said all he wants to say etc in session means not only 1 interested in own case but also 2 with the itsa maker line in on his case not on the auditor but under the auditors control the top of the gpm is hard to run it is resistant to processing since the itsamaker line is invisible to the auditor the auditor has to synthesize what is going on the itsaline is not unit area thinkthinkthinking it is an actual line between the thetan and real thing the bank an auditor who attracts or rapidly shifts the pcs attention to himself has moved the itsamaker line to himself and it has become whatsit whats wrong with the auditor etc the itsamaker is what makes ta occur it is the pcs attention line an arc break is caused by sudden shift of attention you should be aware that perfection in the control of the pcs attention and perfect handling of the itsamaker line is impossible you will make couple of mistakes in this per session even if you are an expert what counts is how adroitly you can wriggle out of whatever you get into not how careful 399you are to stay out of trouble it helps to spot the birth of an arc break well in advance of its overt appearance an arc break is much easier to handle early on and you wont have audited over the outrud if even implicitly you give the pc an order to shut up and let you write the pc will do it and keep doing it pcs and the bank generally do what the auditor apparently wants nonverbal behavior may communicate an auditors desire to the pc auditors main goofs consist of giving apparent orders that they arent aware of and dont intend like stop inspecting your bank and put your attention on the emeter this may occur when the auditor fiddles with the meter lot fumbling takes away the auditors control of the itsamaker line by shifting the pcs attention to the auditor and the goof the bank always does what the auditor orders it takes combination of the auditors orders and the pcs inspection to get the bank handled randomity will occur the auditor who is allergic to unforeseen circumstances would do better to go to an old ladies home to get bank inspected 1 the auditor must direct the itsamaker line 2 the pc must put in the itsamaker line how does an auditor straighten these things out for one thing he can audit smoothly getting good ta so that he has cushion to use in working with the pc dont fix something when the pc is running well something that upsets you does not need to be handled if the pc wasnt concerned as long as the itsamaker line isnt affected in other words dont repair nonexistent situation if you try to repair something that didnt upset the pc you are cleaning clean and you will get an arc break sometimes the auditor gets consciencestricken this should not be remember that when you ask pc about something you put his attention on it you can also put pc on whatsit by being so conscientious that you are always looking for what is wrong you should only repair auditing when auditing isnt occurring case repair is otherwise an interruption of auditing 6310c17 shspec314 levels of auditing getting ta motion is common denominator of all scientology activities the state of case of the pc has practically nothing to do with your ability to get ta motion on him some day you will cognite that if you dont yank the pcs attention off of his case and if you give him something to itsa and if you dont stop him he will get ta motion you can reduce ta motion by being unpredictable as an auditor eg by varying the form of model session keep the session drill constant and predictable from session to session or the pc will start running whatsit on the auditor then the auditor runs itsa on the pc and you get ta the auditor not the pc is in complete control of the bank the bank always does what you tell it to do the pc sometimes does and usually tries to when new style of auditing is released like listen style auditors at first go to pieces they will start introducing some listenstyle into formal auditing you should let the pc itsa the item or goal but thats all if you let the pc itsa the bank you will have sick pc on your hands the ta might move for awhile but the overrestimulation that the pc could get into will lock up the ta pretty soon the things that you are handling in the bank are the things that prevent itsa so letting the pc itsa around in the bank isnt effective the pc will restimulate that which prevents him from itsaing so he wont be able to itsa level iv is all subitsa but when you give the pc an item do let him cognite and itsa on it or you will stack up missed withholds bpc and high and stuck ta this presents bit of problem since eg when the auditor stops the pc from wandering into the wrong gpm there is bpc which can produce fierce arc break what you have to do is to audit fast enough and positively enough so that the pc never gets chance to wander the two great dangers in level iv auditing are 1 the tendency for goals list to be underlisted 2 the tendency for an item list to be overlisted 400when you fumble command you are not in control of the pcs itsaing of his bank but you are in absolute control of the bank so if you fumble list the bank will fumble so the bank fumbles unseen to you the pcs attention line is on the point where you fumbled therefore the bank has shifted under that scanner and the pcs attention goes off onto other things because you have shifted other things into his view with your fumbling soon after such fumble the pc will add something to the session some kind of yipyap not necessarily critical you did something that showed that you did not have control of the pcs bank you distracted the pcs itsamaker line and shifted the bank underneath it with this goof so you are going to get some other stuff it isnt neat and clean the pcs attention will now be somewhere you dont want it if there is any bpc lying around the goof or cutting the itsa line will key it in and you will get an arc break you will get dispersal of attention the itsa goes all over the time track there is always bpc in session you cant avoid it the bpc is either from past auditing or from this session the keyin of bpc is always some communication failure eg cut comm or refuted itsa on the part of the auditor you could even get wrong goal and if you audited very smoothly you could audit without giving the pc single arc break because it takes cut comm line to restimulate any bpc even when it is there the fact that there is bpc does not mean that there has to be an arc break but the fact that there is an arc break does mean that there was some bpc bpc via rough spot in auditing via session keyin cut comm etc gives rise to an arc break wrong goal may cause very uncomfortable pc but need not cause an arc break whether there is an arc break from bpc is entirely dependent on the auditor of course the more bpc there is in the session the tinier the mistake could be that could key it in the cycle of any arc break is 1 bypassed charge 2 rough spot that gives the pc little dispersion 3 cut line on the rough spot 4 the arc break dead on the arc break you will find little misdemeanor but ten minutes to 1 12 hours earlier you will find nice nasty misdemeanor for instance you might find that some sort of forcingness was going on guide the pcs attention dont force it the bank does move to whatever the auditor says running an engram is like developing picture just have the pc look at it you can move his attention over it repetitively this procedure will develop his picture of whatever was there lrh did this with pc who was dead in his head lrh moved the pc to nonsignificant date and moved him through the next half hour over and over the pc got to where he was reading the mail that he had read at the time that lrh moved him to word for word if you get the date and duration of any picture on the back track the picture will turn on the only thing that fouls this up is 1 the comm line is too lousy for the pc to report that he has done it there are several ways to prevent pc from reporting what he sees you can also foul up the comm line by refusing to take the pcs data you could fail to believe that you were moving the date under the pcs attention 2 the track is stuck in something you can demonstrate the above phenomenon by taking some nonsignificant date and getting the pc to pick up everything in it by moving him through it enough this is even easier than getting aberrated incidents since there is charge debarring it running chargeless incident is test of an auditors tech because there is nothing there but the auditing if you dont go goofy and demand more than the pc has you can get the picture you may not get the pcs state of consciousness in the incident unless you spend long time on it it would be good test of auditing there is upset present except what the auditor introduces if your auditing is rough you will find that when you are trying to get the pcs attention on the rough stuff of level iv his confront will be lowered his confidence will suffer and his ability to itsa will be lessened the pc will only have difficulty on what he can 401confront and do if you make difficulty for the pc additions to the comm cycle do make trouble for the pc so keep itsa where it belongs when youve got nice long item list 20 items long give the pc his item let him look at it and cognite when he has done so you can show him the list and ask him how the other items relate now you will get more ta and more confusion blowing off once you have learned how to audit level iv it will seem easy the fast way to arrive at that point is to do it 6310c22 shspec316 the integration of auditing your difficulties in auditing are all made manufactured by you in this universe difficulty always has to be manufactured living beings are theta beings they have to work pretty hard to be entheta beings one may not be aware of the labor involved but it is still being done there would be mass in the bank if it were not being created in the instant in which it has an effect on the individual thetan creates his own bank it is not that thetan has created his own bank it is that he is creating his own bank at this instant there is such thing as continued creation all creation must be done at the moment it is perceived there can be utterly unconscious creation that is the source of the reactive mind the reason thetan is creating is contained in the things he is creating trickily enough the thetan creates the item creativeness which then forces him to create person generally cant confront what it is that is causing him to create or what he is creating to cause himself to create he is not confronting the fact that he is creating it so it is gone notised not as ised the difficulty with this creativeness is that in view of the fact that the thetan can create so much automatically he cannot differentiate what he is creating so he cannot asis what he is creating the easiest thing someone can do is to create an artist who is sweating over his creation has put some arbitrary barriers there such as time barrier eg it must be done in fortnight or economic barriers eg he has to sell it or he cant eat and possibly material barriers eg the paint he has must be used even if it is suboptimal you could sort this out with him easily this action taken to its final form is r4 you audit out all the gpms and ris youre auditing out the barriers which person has put in his own road in order to prevent imagined oppositions from having an effect upon him game of shadows we tend to poohpooh the trouble that the bank causes him because it is shadows but the individual does in fact have to be bailed out if groups etc are going to be made effective anything thats wrong with an organization is being created now by the organization it is the same with the individual difficulties in auditing are all made in this universe difficulties have to be manufactured except for the question of succession benevolent monarchy is the most nearly ideal form of government people wont accept it because it might fail next year benevolent people is preferable to benevolent monarchy you cant work with anything but the individual if you want to succeed the individual is the only thing there and the only thing that will ever be there so hes got to be in good shape in any given organization there is enough theta to make it whiz unless someone is keeping it from whizzing livingness is monitored by the amount of arbitraries to which it is devoted the amount of livingness present is reduced by the amount of livingness invested in notlivingness in arbitrary factors it isnt really reduced strictly speaking because it is all recoverable by auditing by asising the not livingness auditing is recovering the water from the mud pies the theta from the arbitraries the entheta and enmest ta action is the flow of theta coming out of the mud the mud is the bank why cant you audit pc who has screaming ptps because there is too much attention theta invested in the ptps entheta an auditors action is to find some entheta and to invest it in an orderly fashion to recover more theta from entheta when there is never any theta present you have psychology and psychiatry when there is theta present you have overrestimulation and you get ta action there has to be some pc there if the pc is unconscious ie all mud you have to run some cchtype process to get him aware enough to be audited take pc who is pinned down in fox hole he is out of food 402and ammunition with mortar shells beginning to bracket him in that is how some pcs feel they dont dare take their attention off of pt all you can do is to find out what the mind is doing and parallel it in routine 4 pc can get so keyed in that he doesnt want to continue auditing on r4 person with heavy ptp on the perimeter of his consciousness that you have eased off with lowerlevel processes who was doing fine at getting ris before now wont run as well he gets fewer items they dont fire etc this happens because the pc has attention invested in ptps the same thing happens at lower levels with the ta being stuck there is free attention with which to asis aberrated stable data at levels i ii and iii the pc can run into level iv when neither the auditor the pc nor the process are equipped to handle level iv because there is actually more potential over restimulation of the pcs ptp on the pcs track than there is in his present time environment when you look at gpms and their ris there is more potential restimulation on the track than there is in present time so the pc could be more restimulated by reason of keyedin gpms and ris than by simply getting knocked off in present time this liability is answered by auditing goals with in this lifetime prepchecks if the pc has given you some goal you could get rid of the level iv potentiality with such prepcheck probably but you will find while doing level iv that prepcheck of this kind is messy to work with when you have already found the pt goal you get to the bottom of the second gpm and end session with the ta at 30 week later the pc comes in with the ta at 50 something has keyed him in midruds dont handle 2wc on what has happened in the intervening week doesnt handle so you go on to list for the next goal and the ta goes down it was the next goal that had the case restimulated the pc went around talking about it i told joe it was _______ or _______ one of them at least was wrong goal and finding the next goal was the only thing that would bring the ta down so auditors at levels i ii and iii should be able to assess an arc break assessment that includes goal restimulated and item restimulated if you hit one of those the ta will come down ptps almost always appear on the goals channels the pc thinks that he is influenced by one or two ris and that his character is formed by one goal in reality it is the whole bank that influences him ptp usually occurs as keyin of an ri or gpm of one or another of the pcs goals chronic ptp is keyedin gpm out of sequence that can cause psychosomatic illness an educated pc will respond to an l4 or case analysis that spots the fact that gpm concerning that illness has keyed in if with good smooth spoton auditing there is ta action then r4 has gotten in the road spend session or two analyzing the case dont try to date gpm because it may span trillions to the x power of years you can date the top and the bottom of the gpm this will cause the gpm to move in find by case analysis what caused some chronic illness an ri gpm an implant gpm an actual goal etc actual goals stick on gpms as locks by themselves they are not aberrative gpms out of sequence gives psychosomatic illness ris can pull chunks of gpms along with them when the pc gets into the wrong gpm because of some similarity the bank isnt all chaotic it is actually pretty neat basically it consists of thirty bricks laid end to end each composed of forty subsections ris when you start thinking of the mind as vehicle of thought you are already licked in handling it it is not vehicle of thought it is made out of things like bricks and tar the spots of tar on the bricks are the implant gpms actual goals thousands of them are stuck onto each brick like lumps of dough the gpms look like black energy masses thats why thetans get restimulated by black energy masses the gpms can get shoved out of order say bricks five through eight have been inserted in between bricks 19 and 20 etc level i auditors dont have any business trying to straighten out gpms the meter is necessary because pc restimulated by the bank cant perceive the bank and can audit it hence there are three essential parts of auditing 1 the pcs body 2 the emeter 3 the auditor level ii and iii auditors should be skilled in arc break assessments they can prepcheck goals in this lifetime and can do level ivtype arc break assessments if they can bridge the comm gap 403with the pc there is one case that cannot be patched up well at levels ii and iii case that has been run badly on r4 that has been thoroughly loused up can only be remedied by having class iv auditor straighten it all up you could prepcheck or analyze wrong goal and find out what it is and perhaps where it belongs etc any case that has had goals run would probably do very well with list 4 and case analysis to sort things out and slip them back into line the bank is full of pictures but the gpms are what need to be sorted out and gotten rid of at lower levels you dont disturb the gpms as rule as you go up you get closer to them until at level iii with service facs you could get rocketreading goal which you may or may not be welladvised to do anything with since it may be the fifth goal back everyones ability to create is so good that they can keep creating whole bank they underestimate their own power to create and stop themselves people get stuck in their own mazes and are now lost in their own creations they will never sort themselves out of the maze by themselves they dont want to be this way even though they are creating what entraps them every now and then thetan in the betweenlives area tries to sort out the stuff but this stuff is all subitsa and without meter or anyone to itsa it to it is hopeless even now knowing all about the gpms one couldnt make it without body or meter cf the buddhist conception that the only condition from which one can reach enlightenment is that of being in human body lrh has tried meterless systems but none has ever succeeded an auditor is necessary because thetan restimulated by his own bank cant see it but an auditor not restimulated can see it with an emeter as an auditor you must realize how slight the barriers are in fact until r4m2 longer seems difficult or complicated to you lrh knows that auditing at this level can happen because he has been through it all the way from the complication to the simplicity so you start at the top and start going back goaloppose ris ris ris making mistakes when things go all weird you straighten it all out and come back up to pt with it all aligned there are different types and styles of auditing but keep in mind the fact that it is the same bank matter what level or what pc you are auditing level iii is the only level that is really dicey since you are moving ris and gpms around in your search for service facs you can audit the only reason you feel you cant is because of difficulties that you conceive to exist 6311c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing as an auditor you can now be found out by the ta motion that you get on your pcs an accomplished auditor can get ta at will ta motion has to be prevented by the auditor to keep it from occurring it is prevented by 1 additive complications 2 failure to recognize basics there are three zones of auditing and applied scientology 1 basic auditing 2 case analysis 3 routine 4 so there are three zones of expertise which you should recognize as separate areas of performance to be expert the auditor must be good in all three zones someone could do technique perfectly but lacking basic auditing and understanding of what the mind consists of he will not get anywhere lrhs auditing is perfectly mechanical and bythebook doing r4 he goes along doing it until the pc either gets to the end of the processing cycle or until the pc has fallen on his head in the latter case he becomes case analyst using different set of data namely how do banks go together the pc can say anything he likes about the situation as long as there is ta when the pc is done the case analyst goes looking for why the list is misbehaving having done an analysis the auditor knows that the accuracy of the analysis is subject to question because of the charge on the case so any charge gotten off will make more accurate analysis possible until all charge is gone only factors 404that are present now are analyzed former analysis is relied on analysis is valid after its date of inception because more charge may meanwhile have been taken off the case the accuracy of case analysis depends on the pcs ability to itsa so caseanalyses shift they are always conditional and timespecific there is trick of not speaking invalidatively while not buying something the pc is selling the pc says that x is his goal you say fine ill check it out calls the goal im sorry that didnt read in case analysis you look at the source that you got list from as well as the possibility that the pc was arc broken or not answering the auditing question etc when you find the right answer you will get some ta action it will correct to something like it should be when you reach that point you go back to being an auditor being mechanical etc and you give the question you go back to what you were doing you never wear both hats at the same time just wear the hat that is needed at the time there is one hat that you wear all the time the basic auditing hat lacking that it doesnt matter how good you are at the other two basic auditing is giving someone something to talk about letting him talk letting him know that he has said it when he has and running an emeter all the while the basic auditing hat includes 1 trs acknowledge at the end of the complete cycle of action if the answer involves only one itsa ack at the end of one itsa if it occurs after fifty itsas ack after 50 itsas 2 the auditors code 3 metering 4 itsa line handling all basic auditing actions are coordinated with the pc there are four elements to what happened in session 1 what the pc did 2 what the auditor did 3 what the bank did 4 what the meter did the auditors actions in the session are relatively unimportant the most unseen character in the world is an auditor in session he is about as visible as drop of water in stream this is an almost perfect example of thetan with mass the important actions in the session are the performance of the pc the pcs bank and the emeter the auditors actions only matter to the degree that they interfered with the pcs actions an auditors actions can be anything so long as they are not destructive to the session an auditor runs mostly on lack of action auditing is third dynamic activity the auditor merely runs it basic auditing is like the firebox of the ships engine thetech is like the generating equipment the big engine is the bank this is not so great an analogy all an arc break means is that something has gone wrong in the case analysis department not in the basic auditing department wrong goal found can be listed smooth as silk but any later slip will produce an arc break basic auditing can always be improved it is not bunch of dos and donts it is thetan sitting in the auditing chair running the pc and the pcs bank verifying it on the meter and keeping up both the small and the large auditing cycles there are rules or tricks in it anywhere that solve all its problems because it is not complicated action you make it far more complicated than it is the zone of auditing called r4 mentioned earlier in the lecture p 539 above is really technique of any sort these three zones of auditing apply at lower levels too in the same order of use and importance basic auditing then technique and case analysis if you get confused in your own mind about whats what you will think that you need new technique when your technique is fine but your basic auditing is out you think that you are being trained as auditors when in actuality you are 405simply being untrained from all the complications which during the vast vistas of time you have accumulated with regard to human relationships and minds person believes that if he takes too much responsibility for one of these sectors it is liable to go wrong that is just because he is unconfident the think on it is it is best to let the pc run the session because hidden datum if anything goes wrong then it isnt really my fault and this is called making the pc selfdetermined or the opposite think can occur the pc doesnt know what he is talking about he will get himself in trouble and i will be to blame so therefore i had better do everything in the session and not permit the pc to do anything in the session because if you depend on the pc that will make him guilty and that is like blaming the pc you really shouldnt do that so we will relieve the pc of all responsibility we will get our itsa from the meter but what is all this worry about it going wrong an effort not to have wrongness is not session there is very little to teach in basic auditing there is the pcs attention line you keep it on some area of the bank until he has said all that is there and when he is finished you see that he is and you tell him that he is done you can produce ta action with do birds fly with good basic auditing surprisingly enough auditing is doing basic auditing running process and having an analysis of the case that justifies running the process and that tells you when the process is flat auditing is these three departments the most important part of the session is the pc the next most important part is the pcs bank the next is the meter and its verification of what is going on and the least visible part though the most important part as far as the beingness of the session is concerned is the auditor session is an irreplacable section of time that will never occur again so what happens in the session is important the important questions for session are 1 what actually happened in the session 2 was there ta action 3 was the pcs ability to itsa and confront improved 4 was the pcs bank straightened out those are the important things not whether you appear in session in costume so long as when you appear in session your appearance doesnt impede the session appearance is only important in that it could be distracting or disturbing basic auditing training is simply the average action best calculated to produce result in session with minimal impedance of session gain there is completely proper auditing action except as measured against these elements all your selfcriticism is badly spent it is whether you produce results that really matters 6311c07 shspec322 relationship of training to ot you are very fortunate people to come all the way down the track having done all those stupid things and to wind up here with chance out the chance is as good as you can audit and not bit better the number of rawmeat pcs that will go out through the roof is nonexistent unless they become fully trained auditors they wont make it the raw meat case is very easy to audit but what you are doing is auditing the charge off the top ris scientologist appears to be tougher case because the charge is off of those you will have to find the two top ris now and go on down the bank you cant go on and run the bank on someone who hasnt clue about his mind who doesnt know what is there frontwards and backwards the pcs ris only disintegrate when found in their right locations even though they can be found out of position so dont worry about case getting messed up by ris being found in the wrong place goals which have already been run can mess things up all you can do if an ri or gpm has been run is to date them even after you have run an ri you can verify it by dating the reason for this is that in running it you pulled it little out of its own time sphere so you can still get bit of bang on dating it and reorienting it you are just getting the idea of it which is still there in position the mass is already gone 406sooner or later someone will take lot of clay and work out the mind with the pc an unusually smart pc who will get it and go on being audited with understanding but this will be very rare occurrence getting someone to be responsible for session occurs on gradient the people who start on an hca course etc are already preselected just by the fact that they enrolled any of them including any upperlevel auditor including lrh gets nervous over pcs wondering if the ta is moving the pc doing ok etc that is to be expected people who persist into upper levels of training are further predetermined by their willingness to continue in the face of struggle and disappointment there is an additional problem where do you take over the pcs itsa so as to allow him to itsa just enough neither cutting it short nor letting the pc wander around mucking things up these points vary from pc to pc and with the same pc as he gets more able some pcs have good perception and if they say it is so it probably is so with other pcs you can count on it that if they say its _______ it isnt you should be increasing the pcs perception of and confront on his own bank so as the pc gets closer to ot you should have him in good enough shape so that he can perceive what is there to be run next where you can deduce change in the pc you are of course changing the values by which you audit also the pcs itsa can deteriorate if he has had some loses and the case is going sideways and backwards you will have to take over more responsibility for directing his attention until he is fixed up cases are always different from one moment to the next lowlevel cases run on fat they have charge leaking out of their ears when you have gotten off the fat that exists on the two top ris you have got the whole bank to deal with now you have to be genius to find some fat to get off the case and the case is more likely to get arc broken from the aspect of cleaning cleans this makes you very good auditor what happens when someone is in the position of doing r4 they are probably somewhat trained by now but they will need more training the surest way to get to be ot is to be highly trained auditor for various reasons including the aplomb that it takes to confront the bank case is on its way to ot when the first gpm has been run out this can take up to two years after finding the first not necessarily the most recent goal running out that first top gpm is more hell for the pc than anything the thetan has thought of confronting and this is true for several reasons the state of the technology the hazards of the auditing possible errors previous errors the lack of the pcs perception of the pt gpm because of its pt restimulators etc etc raw meat not understanding what is happening wont put up with it they cant confront it even though goal is an incorrect goal it could be that only its position is incorrect not its wording you can get wrong items wrong line plot for an implant gpm without turning off the rocket read but if you take an actual gpm and try to run it on an implant pattern it turns off the rocket read right now and it turns off any other meter phenomena as well there is another horrible datum an actual goal invalidated will now behave like wrong goal it will turn on the same creaks as really wrong goal the pc will arc break the same way it will read as wrong goal it will turn off arc breaks when indicated and so forth so now after you do case analysis prepcheck everything found so that you dont discard an actual goal it is possible that wrong goal sufficiently asserted and validated might behave like right goal one thing will still be the case any actually wrong goal or an actual goal run as an implant goal will turn off the rocket read within two or three items this saves you from running wrong goal you wont have any rocket read to run it with what is dangerous is that an actual goal thoroughly invalidated will be consistently discarded by the auditor he and the pc agree that to spit is wrong goal and they continue looking for the next gpm in line or the pt gpm but they will never find it many are called and few ever hit the top of the bank these are the sorts of errors that can occur and that make r4 hell for pc and auditor nothing will make it easier because that is happening with all the data the besttrained auditor and the most educated pcs r4 takes high degree of skill compounded with phenomenal degree of luck with hindsight one can see how things got off the track but as one proceeds one is walking in the dark with thousandth of millimeter peephole what takes time in r4 is the mistake the worse r4 goes the harder it gets for the pc and the auditor to see what is the true state of affairs however dont put attention on not making mistakes because the effort not to make mistakes will produce mistakes directly and indirectly most of the auditing time is consumed in handling mistakes and most of the mistakes you make are in trying not to make mistakes anything that can make meter go out or any condition that can get you an erroneous read is then susceptible to throwing out case analysis and your own efforts to straighten out case analysis are susceptible to throwing out case 407analysis and case analysis can be wrong in the first place ok those are the nerves with which you live so the only questions for case analysis and the only points of randomity should be 1 exactly what is happening with this bank that i am handling 2 exactly how is it going together 3 what are the contributive data i have with which to make up my mind about the situations in this bank so you have to have basic auditing and techniques down to the noattention state because there are enough hazards and difficulties in case analysis so that you have attention to spare for anything else the ideal scene with the auditor and the pc is still going to be porcupinejuggling act you should be able to think bank so as to be able to parallel the pcs mind well enough to figure out what is happening with the bank in front of you that is plenty to confront and handle therefore training is vital part of becoming an ot thus in the short run many are called but few are chosen though eventually all can make it by the training route 6317c27 shspec330 tvd 25 auditing demo and comments by lrh lrh critiques three student tvds during and after the tvds the sessions are ruds and havingness sessions if pc gives himself the auditing question he is selfauditing so the auditor should reassert control by giving the question half dial havingness isnt enough the needle should bounce twice for saint hill student if the havingness isnt that good then it is too low for the pc to be audited the pc is hungry tired has ptps or mainly he has withholds so run some ow run havingness and fix it up missed withholds cause low havingness as well as environmental and other causes on auditing in general modern faults fall under not knowing model session well enough letting the pc itsa is one thing but sitting silently and inviting itsa without having asked question is another there is happy medium between cutting the pcs itsa and doing nothing at all you clean clean by sitting and looking at pc who has nothing to say or who has said all or when you havent asked question the pc will arc break failures in basic auditing are the usual reason for progress of case you cannot apply technique in the absence of basic auditing 6311c28 shspec324 seven classifications of auditing scientology will go as far as it works not as far as it is administered therefore lrh has focussed on full technological development first with the administrative picture to come later when the technical data was completed the administrative pattern could not be let out without having the technical data together the tech data turned out to be an account of highly precise coordinated activity it turned out that people couldnt be audited at high levels unless brought there gradiently this turns out to be true at lower levels too people have to understand what is being asked there is always repercussion to any stimulusresponse cycle or causedistanceeffect cycle the response being new stimulusresponse causedistanceeffect cycle so every stimulus response cycle has return stimulus response cycle where the first response acts as the second stimulus the philosophic conundrum is that you cannot act without consequences in this universe the buddhist answer to this conundrum is cause nothing ie by not building up karma we have another solution audit it out but only trained scientologist will grasp this the questions of what is right conduct and can you ever really cause anything come up here if you try to trace back the cause of something you can get into difficulty say guy is shot with rifle you can try to trace back the cause to the finger tightening to the thought or intention behind this to the motive to early childhood 408to mother ad absurdum to solve the problem of where cause started you could say it started nowhere but that doesnt really solve anything people get so interested in the cause end of the causedistanceeffect line that they never look for the other end they never look to see what cause comes back from the effect point for instance oswald fired rifle and twentyfour hours later he is shot dead causeeffect cycle always leads to cause effect cycle there is room for lots of think about it but one simple fact applies in this universe you cant cause something without receiving some sort of effect in return in this universe the magnitude of the effect may differ there is the question of how much you can confront how much you cause is monitored only by how much you can confront if you can confront getting shot shoot moral conduct would consist of only causing those things that could be confronted by those to whom it is caused that is route around the overtmotivator sequence cf the two rules for happy living in scientology new slant on life pp 2328 cause only what others can confront if you do this you lead rather unrestimulated life if you are causing things that others cant confront without great detriment such as starting war you can expect to get your head knocked off eventually even though you think you could confront it an overt is the generation of effects that are unconfrontable and the motivator will be someone causing an effect that you cant confront that is the story of this universe selfdetermined thought is not permitted in this universe the message of this universe is all thought occurs by association but this is not true what is omitted from this is that at any moment thetan can get an idea totally independent of all other ideas by an independent postulation not by stimulusresponse by prime motion that is what puts randomity into the whole picture psychologists and earlier philosophers didnt believe in independent postulation or they missed it lacking independent postulation there is trap they will argue that you cant think of an independent thought because whenever you do you will find that there is another thought with which it is associated in trying to disprove this you go into agreement with it so you cant disprove it this is the old hippopotamus mechanism dont think of the word hippopotamus was part of the alchemists formula for the transmutation of baser elements into gold cf the think thought process in pab 54 pp 23 people want to predict human behavior so they never look at the fact that human behavior can be unpredictable and take this datum into account as part of their predictions this denial of the human beings ability to be unpredictable takes away selfdeterminism of think in this universe now we get up to the question of how much think person can tolerate running overts on the man in the street we get motivators instead of overts all put forward as overts on self this relates to the concept of responsibility the man in the street thinks that it is all being done to him that is why book one has such appeal in scientology the emphasis is on you done it thus scientology has higher responsibility level than dianetics this makes scientology highertoned however it is harder to attract people to scientology on that account than to dianetics irresponsibility is very popular people prefer to think that they never started an action that they never really caused anything this relates to the thinkingness of criminal the criminal knows that nobody owns anything anywhere but they have entered into conspiracy by which they pretend that people think people own things and this is done for only one reason these other people pretend this to get him in trouble and to be nasty to him courts exist not because there is such thing as crime but so that they can pretend outrageous and unreasonable things so that they can get him so criminals have total reality of the uncriminality of criminal acts criminal acts arent criminal to the criminal the cops have picked up some of our think on this eg the idea that criminals cant work but they dont realize that the person they arrested for overtly stealing car knows that the police are bunch of frauds the car never belonged to anybody and the police are fraudulently pretending that cars are owned in order to get this fellow in trouble mest goes to pieces around criminals because they know one owns anything the criminals reality is basically neurosis which at lower levels becomes psychosis for instance another characteristic of the criminal is the notion i didnt shoot anyone because there is one there everything is figment of his imagination solipsism his imagination gives him universe which he knows is delusory even the guy in the street has the idea that something was done to him that accounts for his condition he feels that all responsibility for his state of beingness is exterior to him the common denominator of most thought is it was done to responsibility lies without not within this individual failed or wouldbe writers used to get lrhs goat by saying i always wanted to write but i didnt have the education they were saying this to lrh who was trying to get rid of the phobias had instilled in him 409when you disseminate scientology you err by not estimating the amount of cause that the person is willing to accept you are willing to assume some degree of cause but he is not and he will find the thought of overt causation and responsibility to be unreal he believes that he is the total effect of life there is some truth to this the pc can be the effect of tremendous number of things to the extent that he cant see himself as cause you might be able to reach him at this level at some time in life in some area if you look it over very carefully you may find that you had something to do with what happened for instance perhaps once you decided to read book and did it that he might agree with you give him rule he might apply eg communication or how to do touch assist right and he will find that he has caused something by experience this approach is more effective than that of giving him the theoretical philosophical data he realizes that he is causing the effect people mostly want the comfortable agony of being at effect catholics get to thinking heresy if you tell them that they can cause effects or create things they are the toughest nuts to crack people who are saddled with religious superstition are the hardest to bring out of this rut in ireland the lecture on creation laid an egg every week for this reason create is the wrong word to use cause would be better though even that is hard for people to admit the areas where one knows everyone fails are those of communication relationships with people and health those are desirable effects so if you give the individual tools and let him find that he can cause an effect in these areas you have snapped him out of the cycle of be nothing but an effect to cause is impossible etc it is not that the man in the street isnt interested in philosophy it is just that he has failed at it the savants have made the field seem unapproachable but what they are concerned with isnt live philosophy anyway the real philosopher is the little guy in the street who actually is concerned with questions like who am i what am i what am i doing here what are people what happens to when i die why dont people like etc in short the real philosophers are people like you and and those are the basic questions that philosophy hasnt answered but pretends to have answered at an unattainable level for many this failed attempt to arrive at answers to these basic questions led to the service fac god made everything cf the why is god we come to full stop in this search until we realize that every being is an independent being who is himself capable of expressing thought or intention independent of any other thought or intention at any moment the idea that man is or can be cause cracks the back of philosophy when we recognize that every individual is capable of being causative we have scarcity of answers when we realize that it is the degree to which an individual can accept or execute causation independent of other influences that brings about his state of case we have then cracked the whole riddle of philosophy and training person gives him the idea that he can cause an effect as soon as weve got time stream then all befores influence all afters post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy then we can prove that nobody can be cause because the time stream exists this holds water until we realize that the time stream itself is capable of being influenced by postulate the time stream can both be caused and escaped from it this is possible then we have level of cause that is senior to the time stream in disseminating scientology if you only tell people things about it on which you yourself have excellent reality and which you have experienced you will find that you communicate like shot to everybody because the rfactor in you is so high that you cannot help but put it across to others complete truth from the point of origin does get across with effect it isnt the startling thing you say its the real thing you say and it isnt whether it is real to the other guy it whether it is real to you the classification scale is scale of willingness to accept cause over ones destiny and that of others it gives the degree of being at cause madmen get into obsessive cause as lowerscale mockery but you could find where someone is on this scale every time by finding what he has done and withheld and feels responsible for ie what his ows are cause is not expressed in actions in life but in case responses it is cause over ones own case that is important where we are concerned people make progress in processing or they dont if they dont they set the same goals session after session if the pcs goals change violently from one session to the next there was an arc break cases dont leap from one case state to another they gradiently and smoothly become more at cause over more matter energy space time and other beings the person isnt necessarily becoming more causative he is more capable of cause he can handle his mind better he is therefore capable of handling other things better his responses in processing are your best possible indicator this is not quick test however so it tends to be neglected 410case progress is direct index of cause you dont realize how far you have come until you ask someone on the street whether he has any problems and you find that he is living in madhouse from his viewpoint the seven classes of auditor are really eight because they start at zero an unclassed class plus seven classes see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified for description of the classes person could be class zero and have certificate without being of class that is important because there are always some people who work very hard and pass their checksheet but dont make the grade they get certificate showing that they were there classification means more than just getting the certificate class zero certificate is not sign of being classed there are all sorts of valuable processes lying back along the line and they fit into various slots for instance class ii will be studying comm lags of equal length as sign of when to end process this is all an effort to graduate cases on up the line lrh has found that they do not advance further than they are trained so this is the creation of bridge from lower to higher levels this increases information and skill and auditing availability right on up the way it is now people dont know where they are or where they are going or what is expected of them there are professional pcs from 1950 waiting for someone to process them to ot whose cases havent improved much there will be chart with all the processes and training skills of each class on it all the way up at some late date there will be textbook all the way up 6312c03 shspec325 certifications and classifications see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified why have we put in the classification and certification system the original method of dissemination very successful one was to gather group who had troubles and wanted processing and give them some training setting up coaudits and supervising them charging small fee for the supervision and having them pay only for patchup sessions as needed the textbook was the original thesis distributed in mimeo the auditing was clumsy but some fantastic things would happen when the foundations were formed not at lrhs instigation there were lots of bosses around and many schools of technology developed they started training on the basis of letting someone hang around for month or so to pick up what was going on that was parker morgans idea this started the academy these first auditors were trained to audit others not to coaudit lrh taught them straightwire the same fault turned up here as in the earlier group people wanted only to be processed not to process anyone this is destructive action because it denies training and dissemination and neglects the people who keep it going if you want lots of auditing to do get lots of coauditing going there are always lots of patchups to do so the central organizations of 1950 went into the processing business and everybody they processed who wanted only processing and who didnt want to give anything for it introverted the purely pc person doesnt ever disseminate despite all his gains and ability because he never mentions his auditing unless you do something wrong this is the phenomenon of negative gain if something is eradicated properly the pc never says anything about it because it is gone the pure pc remains at the effect point and needs to be moved to the cause point to some degree with respect to scientology people who coaudit disseminate central organization can also make the above mistake they can concentrate on income from the hgc and neglect training auditors coaudits do produce lot of randomity all sorts of goofs do occur but that means repairs which can be done in the hgc the individual who is helping someone else while he is being helped gets his attention extroverted and introverted during the time the coaudit is on life gets off the first dynamic often for the first time it puts person in better frame of mind to combine both flows furthermore person can progress only so far without an increase of understanding which comes from training 411the pc starts at level i with itsa just talking about his problems etc assists and r1c are at this level then he changes gets better and moves up to level ii where repetitive auditing gets used and where it is the number of commands per unit of auditing time that determines the pcs progress this principle carries through to the highest level of ot processes the pc longer gets ta from wandering around in itsa so now you have to start pounding ta out of him with smoothly run repetitive questions cchs straightwire and ow are at this level then the pc moves up to level iii r2h see above the auditor has to be able to get the pc to spot things like bpc and if the pc has reality on it he will drift around you may have had the idea that the higher the process the more it would do for the case well the process that does the most for the case is the one that is realest to the case at his state of case that is new look technical revision the pc will get maximal gains on the process that is the most real the further his case is from optimum the more tiny little things are real and the more big tough things are unreal we were running people over their heads in 1950 they couldnt confront engrams but they did fine on straightwire processes pc who is being asked for selfdetermined changes for prepcheck see problems intensive procedure p 292 above may not believe that he has ever decided to do anything he may need to be run on some lowerlevel process like get the idea of deciding to changenot to change until he cognites that he can decide and eventually that he has decided it takes an educated pc to run arc break processes because you are asking the pc to look at complicated area unless he knows something about it it is too confusing and there is too much charge in his way then at level iv we handle service facsimiles the service fac is very esoteric thing to conceive of the pc has to take over responsibility for his own illness that is impossible for lowerlevel cases missed withhold running is at this level because missed withholds take higher level of responsibility to run than ow at this level we also get arc break assessments and case programming at level v the pc gradually starts getting reality on the idea that he has had other bodies and other identities with some acquaintance at first with the past 2500 years at this level he works with implants engrams whole track and gets whole track case analysis at level vi the pc gradually gets reality on track back to trillions to the eighth power where the earliest implants are at this level he runs ot processes his own actual gpms and old r3 and r4 processes then at level vii he will get reality on track back to trillions to the 200ths that is real sweep of time here he finds that one gpm will cover from trillions 29 to trillions 21 dating gets crude when the numbers are that large at this level when the pc has all the bank run out there are various drills for ots route 1 change of space processing etc for route 1 see the creation of human ability pp 3343 this includes change of space processing done in connection with the grand tour the grand tour consisted merely of getting the pc to be at different places in the physical universe the change of space aspect added an alternation of being at these different locations with being in the auditing room the pc is made to run change of space on any area until that area is in pt this process is also known as r19 it is questionable whether any of these drills are necessary lrh has found that if he is exterior all he needs to do is to itsa to an auditor for awhile to get over feeling queasy about whether he can hold his position in space as far as we are concerned the whole problem is one of dissemination smooth processing and keeping the bridge open behind us the smoothest way to do it would be to insist that the individual doesnt outstrip his training level with his processing level how do you guarantee that someone will make it all the way that is an important question there is the economic question too if it would take 1500 to 2000 hours at 1000 per hour just to be processed then even if it were possible to go ot in this way it would be too expensive for most people how much would training fees add up to lets say 5000 to 6000 that makes it more possible this cost could be decreased further by requiring that each preceding course be very thoroughly done so that each subsequent course would be shorter the student would of course get unlimited processing provided he was expert enough to keep his coauditor thus the reality level of advance is cared for which takes care of dissemination 412so any hcahpa could train people at has up to class i this would give this individual coaudit area that he could cope with level ii training would be given in some district it would not be too expensive nor too long about thirty days is the most that most people could spend then you would have higher levels of coaudit going you would need textbooks for each level with all the relevant technology question and answer sections and exams that would really ensure that the person has got the data etc the system of the private scientology practitioner who takes people in processes them and ejects them hasnt been generally successful although few have done it this system is following system set forth by the healing professions which we arent it took the healing professions long time to get this going anyway private clubs also have privileges which are denied to members of the public who have government protection the certification system handles people who do the theory part of the course but not for classification classification is shown by roman numeral if student is studying for the next class he can do the processes of that class provided that he has the nextlower classification but he cant do any higher processes without getting higher classification what about class 0 and class i class 0 has to be double the person is being trained for the has certificate and you have to consider him class of some sort going for the has certificate then you have has certificate classed class i that condition doesnt occur again after that the student always has certificate to put class on there are cases all over scientology that are parked because they skipped one of these levels and tried to leap into upperlevel processes while still worried about the environment it is true that only at the upper levels do you really resolve what is wrong with the case it is also true that you have chance to get at that without getting what is on top out of the way this also reduces the randomity and dangers connected with processing results 6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing this is combined lecture and demonstration to show the presence of auditing and what basic auditing is auditors have misunderstood what itsa is giving rise to awful results they are getting their pcs to draw pictures giving the pc nothing to do and handling nothing the place to get your basic auditing together is at class ii basic auditing handles the pc handles the session handles the auditing comm cycle and handles the meter regardless of what else is occurring it is different at class ii than at class iv lrh has been improving his own auditing for the past few months basic auditing should be very smooth lrh has been improving his basic auditing in the area of observing the pc to see when he has said all that he is going to say then acknowledging him one can play it safe by saying nothing but that is cleaning clean comm lagging inviting more itsa when there is nothing there stringing out bunch of unnecessary acknowledgments is also comm lag keep the session rolling that is what gets good ta just sitting there listening is level i auditing it doesnt work at higher levels lrh found that he was causing the pcs dirty needle he also found that he had to increase the pcs ability to itsa by using the meter to get information only when the pc couldnt supply it he found that it is necessary to remain silent while the ta is in fast motion but one doesnt wait after that to see if the ta will move again at level vi the motion you get after the bd on an item is coming from the next level taking up and handling the pcs problems at session start during the session or at end of session is part of basic auditing basic auditing is 1 getting the pc to itsa 4132 promoting and increasing the pcs itsa by letting the pc find data not relying on the meter to do it however dont give the pc the feeling that he is getting help 3 not talking while the ta is in fast motion but not waiting for the ta to stop jumping around 4 handling any ptps at session start as they arise or at session end the tvd tape follows with lrh auditing msh the tape is intended to show basic auditing as well as technique it starts out with ruds then gets into goaloppose list lrh finds the pcs pt goal finds where the pc is in the gpm and finds her top terminal he finds the wrong top oppterm technical note the top oppterm of the pt gpm unlike any other in the whole bank should blow up and shouldnt keep on reading it should just go and it didnt so the auditor knows by now that it is wrong item since it didnt blow and that the pc is selling it so here we get into tremble and scramble the pc is getting arc breaky because the pc has wrong item if you missed the itsa once here you would get screaming arc break because the out session rud would key in the bpc of the ot process they do some more work with the top oppterm pc still wont agree that the top oppterm is incorrect however they do verify the correct terminal listing it straightened it out the top oppterm turned out to be being disobedient lrh points out the basic auditing of the session letting the pc itsa not leaving the pc with nothing to itsa the pc should have been arc broken by taking the wrong top oppterm and abandoning the right terminal the pcs ability to itsa is the road out keep the session driven keep it going take action promote and increase the pcs itsa it is the auditors job to make session out of it 6312c05 shspec327 basic auditing some of the data in this tape is also to be found in hcob 26nov63 all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysis the problems of auditing are divided into three categories 1 basic auditing 2 technique 3 case analysis technique means the exact patter and procedure for getting something audited on the pc we have dug up lots of old processes all of them are still valid except mockup processes processes like spot three spots in your bodyin the room run long enough tend to exteriorize people another exteriorization process is where arent you these processes are ok if they are not run to exteriorization exteriorizing someone tends to result in his coming back into his body more solidly because he becomes alarmed he is unstable this occurs at higher levels eg levels v or vi the pc tends to come back in and hold harder actually what upsets him is the energy masses that he is going through which exert certain emotional responses upon him the liability of these old lowerlevel processes is that they run the pc into gpms and can pull ris out of line eg the liability of tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting is that you could run into the ri forgetting but such an occurrence is very rare people coming up through level iii are in the charge of the top ris but they are getting destimulated as they get more oriented and wiser in their environments just remember when running repetitive process that there is some danger of restimulating an ri especially if the process has fancy or oddball wording you even run this risk at level i when you ask what solutions have you had to that since the track is just series of solutions what saves your bacon is the pcs lack of reality on other lifetimes starting at level iii you would be wise to preface processes with in this lifetime do this for sure at level iv since the pcs awareness has come up and he will slip back on the track pretty easily your main problem will be the manic at level i who insists on running only past track 414this came up in elizabeth nj with the first foundation when couple of coauditors could only find pastlife engrams to run on each other joe winter parker morgan and john campbell tried to pass motion to make research on or mention of past lives offlimits because it had bad public presence they found out then that lrh could get mad public presence has nothing to do with the truth there is such thing as acceptable truth that is really just lie there is room in pr or public image for truth pr is nice but dont build on it build on truth with most pcs any attempt to go backtrack before their ptps are handled will produce nothing but disaster you are asking them to confront big new datum when they cant even confront their environment most processing failures come from the attempt to process someone higher then his class the classifications are laid out on gradient scale of increasing responsibility for self and the dynamics the processes laid out in any given class form gradient scale too plotted against increasing responsibility so it starts with motivators and ends with overts all this is still techniques the programming of techniques is based on case analysis every level has its own case analysis the three basic steps of case analysis are 1 find out what the pc is sitting in 2 get the pc to tell you about it fully get any lies off 3 handle it by locating and indicating charge as accurately as possible that is the pattern that you would use at any level this delivers the whole world of healing to us it was research target set last january and it has been met at level i this could consist of getting the person to talk about some illness that they have had at levels ii and iii you would find what incident the person was sitting in in dianetics this was done with an ageflash at level vi it is done with all the tech of case analysis asking if it is an actual gpm an implant gpm etc at level 0 it is how do you feel today what have you done about it do you feel better as pc runs actual gpms the subitsa and the pcs ability to itsa come closer and closer together on case analysis they fold over about half way to ot where the pcs ability to itsa surpasses the meter if the pc doesnt say itsa the meter wont read the meter depends on mass and shortcircuits in the mass you will eventually reach point where the person is selfdetermined enough that unless they think it it isnt so somewhere along the line you will also run into their recognition that they are creating all the mass what you will do there hasnt been worked out you will have to get across it and back to the beginning and the earliest postulates with regard to the making of mass and the creation of all this type of bank it is rough go unless your basic auditing is superb your basic auditing at levels ii and iii has to be magnificent because the pc doesnt know what you are talking about he has nomenclature he has reality on it he cant put these things together smoothly the whole burden therefore is on basic auditing on handling the pcs itsa improving the pcs itsa never give the itsa to the pc on the meter when he can give it to you dont refuse to check the meter if he asks but wean him off it the only things that vary in basic auditing are the addition of more complicated metering as you go up the levels note that at levels v and vi you never use sensitivity higher than 8 other wise the needle is too loose improving ones basic auditing is the way to improve the amount of ta that one gets given particular technique used dirty needles come solely from out basic auditing see hcob 25nov63 dirty needles on level vi the ta moves around so much that you cant wait until the ta stops to say something you have to talk when it slows down the pc will get heat during bds which will be suppressed if you talk so that you will have to get the suppress off the heat to get it to turn on again if there is nothing going on it is up to the auditor to start something if there is something going on with the pc then there is need for the auditor to start something 415at the upper levels basic auditing had better be as free from attention as walking this sounds obvious but it is horribly true youve got plenty to do with the meter you dont have time to record ta except when you give the question and when the ta blows down when the pc gives the item apart from that you need ta counter to keep record of it just dont move the ta while the pc is moving around or you will get falsely high count youve got to stop the needle at set with your thumb in order not to cut the pcs itsa while centering the needle you will put in comm lag if you delay while centering it and the pcs attention will go to the meter there are numerous tricks that you can do with meters for instance you can brake the needle to stop it from wobbling know the needle well enough to be able to spot missed withhold without asking for it or to repair havingness without having to run any by getting the pc to spot what upset his havingness etc you can know ta behavior well enough to spot trouble before it arrives so that you are not startled when the pc erupts at level vi technique is an alldevouring monster you can spare attention for the meter or for basic auditing aspects such as the comm cycle there is zenith on how good your basic auditing can get you could probably make some mistakes with techniques and case analysis not many but you cant afford to make any mistakes with basic auditing especially if you do make mistake in another area nothing very serious will happen to pc because of technique or case analysis errors especially below level vi but basic auditing errors will pitch the pc on his head the only serious things that can happen to pc occur because of out basic auditing pcs feel badly when basic auditing is out invalidation is the only way to turn on somatics at level vi ot processes are as rough as there is invalidation it isnt that items turn on pain it is that if you invalidate right item or goal the pc can get good and sick this makes the steps of case analysis mandatory but if your basic auditing is in such that the pcs itsa is in you are less likely to make these mistakes because the pcs opinion and knowingness are consulted the greatest dividend you can get from training is improvement of your basic auditing to point where you can relax and get technique and case analysis to hum get it perfected and your tone arm motion will triple 6312c10 shspec328 scientology 0 it works out this way having completed scientology research all the way to the top lrh has had to undercut it all to find new series of processes and new processing theory on which to build the edifice that is quite trick knowing the upper strata only makes it harder to build the lower strata because you see it so clearly that it is hard to see how someone else lacking your knowledge could miss it you can know exactly what is wrong with somebody but if he knows differently you cant get him to see your solution or your view of the problem lrh finally has scientology 0 to undercut scientology i it was description of the environment and what is wrong with it it has nothing to do with the persons mind at all scientology i is the isness of things and it takes care of the mind as well but scientology 0 takes care of the environment it is summable up as the dangerous environment that sums up 1 what you are talking about 2 the frame of mind of the person talking with you look around and find something that isnt threatening you or pushing ptp on you or trying to exteriorize you this will help to pull your attention out of the threatening environment it allows differentiation to come about instead of identification many people are professional dangerous environment makers the chaos merchants push dangerous environments on people in sensationalized form this includes politicians newspapermen policemen etc they spread confusion and upset and breed fear of the environment this is the same thing that blackmailer or an extortionist does they make the environment seem more dangerous than it is they sell the dangerous environment 100 the avidity of their sell can be used by the scientologist by means of sort of thetajudo practiced on them understanding scientology 0 includes understanding how to use the enemies of scientology the chaos merchants 416toynbee working out of libraries came to tremendous understanding of life he says that the reason that the mexican for example does not succeed is that he has insufficient challenge in his environment toynbee has obviously never talked to any mexicans it is myth that primitive peoples get apathetic because of insufficient challenge in the environment the challenge of the environment is actually overwhelming to downtrodden peoples primitive peoples etc the environment is too dangerous for fellow to have ambition this is actually true of anyone who lives on earth the individual on this planet if he has not been able to achieve his destiny is in an environment that he finds overwhelming his methods of dealing with it are inadequate and his existence is as apathetic or as unhappy as his environment seems to him to be overwhelming get those principles down and you will have scientology 0 lot of people spend their time worrying the people around them to death they spread confusion and upset while wondering why their victims dont get ahead these are smallscale chaos merchants compared with newspapers but they are more intimate doctors get paid not by the number of people who are well but by the number who are sick the police would go broke if the prisons didnt make more and better criminals police chiefs would be unimportant if they had few police under them newspaper reporters dream of big story meaning good disaster the environment is never as dangerous as it is made to appear solution to the threat of nuclear war could undoubtedly be found especially if there were profit in it but anything that tends to make calmer environment meets and makes ridge with anything that has vested interested in the fact and idea of threatening environment the expansion of scientology will lessen the amount of fear it will lower the stress perceived by people as emanating from the environment scientology would make for calmer environment it would not be less interesting environment but calmer one one that is in less turmoil this could permit resurgence of the individual because he would be less enturbulated you would get beneficial spiral where the threat of the environment would be dying out the chaos merchant doesnt like calming influences they threaten his livelihood and survival on an individual level domestic chaos merchant gets upset when his or her victim gets calmer with exposure to scientology it is very disconcerting to chaos merchant to be met with humor instead of seriousness the true story of scientology is simple phd develops philosophy people find it interesting people find that it works people pass it along to others it grows that is what the newspapers are trying to make story out of from their viewpoint there is story because there is conflict you can amplify the story and get some statistics but anything else is distortion and lies added on to make the story disturbing and sensational but all disturbance folds up in the face of truth in universe kept going and continually disturbed by lies all the basic facts have been covered up particularly those relating to life and death many contrary data have existed fundamental questions belong in philosophy but philosophy has become so decadent that it is longer source of truth it is at best limited truth and in going for truth you have to go all the way see 6211c01 shspec 207 the road to truth above the clean blade of truth cannot be stopped but if you talk truth you had better have your hands on it socrates talked truth but didnt have good enough grip on it when you start to introduce scientology to anyone the first target would be the environment not the persons mind you could dream up processes based on the assumption that the person believes that the environment is too dangerous for him any relatively sane person will agree with you on that we know that it is being made to seem more dangerous than it is this is key point of scientology 0 so the person could be brought to perceive that this is so by his own perception it is also key point that the persons 1 health 2 sanity 3 activity level and 4 ambition are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment from these factors we can draw up an improvement program for any person we can therefore improve these things in the individual without reference to his mind we have dealt with this before under the heading of controlling environmental restimulation we know that to handle his problems 417terminatedly we will have to handle the mind nevertheless we can get very marked and noticeable gains and improvements by handling his environment since we know that most of the threat that he is worried about is imaginary the therapy could be as simple as dont read the newspaper for two weeks and see if you dont feel better at the end of two weeks have him read the newspapers for week get him to see whether he then feels better or worse so that he can decide if he gets too upset or confused tell him to look around the environment and find something that isnt threat to him good havingness process at scientology 0 is finding out what is threat to person and running it as negative havingness process this is actually very sophisticated it could be used at upper levels run against some particular fear it is an improved version of take walk and look at things this is positive education the reason take walk look it over works is that the individual sees that the environment isnt threatening him to the degree that he thought it was when he has inspected it so you could use process like look around you and find something that isnt going to fall on you at scientology 0 you are trying to get the individual to inspect the environment and find some greater security in it the general auditing approach would be look around you and find out if the environment is as threatening as it appears to be but each person would have to be handled individually you could get person to look at the papers on his desk that are threatening him and find something in them that isnt threat that is taking walk while he is sitting at his desk for person who feels that everyone is hostile to him you could use find something that people say or do around here that isnt hostile to you or find one person in the organization that isnt actively hostile to you or was there anything said today that wasnt immediately and directly hostile to you this could also be played in the direction of exaggeration but then it goes up to higher level in mental direction get the idea of chinese in every corner shooting at you with cong hatchets you could use look around here and find something that isnt trying to exteriorize you etc all this runs on the single auditing command look there is effort to get any itsa about it almost any inspection of the environment is helpful except negative one if the pc has secondary if he has lost an individual in an environment where he has been with the person lot eg in love affair you can use look around here and find something that isnt reminding you of the exlover the mechanism here is that the person has identified everything in the environment with his unrest everything in the environment has become identified with the threatening things in the environment the persons charge on the environment can be destimulated by indicating things that are not so threatening thus getting person to differentiate when identification becomes differentiation intelligence and judgment can return an interesting commentary on the character of man lies in the fact that if you really want to interest people at lecture or pe course you should give them something that they can use to help others rather than something that will help themselves man is basically good and this is proof therefore your supplementary advice should always go on the basis of who are you trying to help to discover that the environment is less dangerous than it seems you had better understand the data well enough so that you can give it to him well enough so that he can use it and see result and then use it on himself if you do this right you will often get the cycle 1 the person finds out something to help pete 2 it works on pete 3 he decides to try to use it to help himself take walk and look at things is about the mildest advice you could give someone it would be quite effective if he actually did it lrh did this and found that by putting tension on the beam with which he was looking at things he could pull himself forward without having to walk this got intriguing he went skimming his heels on the pavement until he noticed cop looking at him the master question is what part of the environment isnt threatening this question gets the person to differentiate you can also get him to arrange his life little if you can get person to just plan life in which everything is calmer and less threatening the life he is living becomes calmer and less threatening 418when you move this up into scientology i and introduce communication factors and show the person how to communicate with people he will find that he can produce an effect on people and that people are less threatening if you keep havingness in mind as you go up the levels you never lose the benefit of having the environment being less threatening which you started at scientology 0 all people are trying to 1 get out of the environment or 2 master the environment if they cant escape any thetan has these intentions and has had them all the way up the universe these are the only totally common ptps of an environment the individual would also like to find something to help his friends what you need is level of help that requires practically education at all this would become real to the individual just the concept that he considers the environment dangerous and would like to find the source of threat is an enormous piece of wisdom to him since before you identified it for him he was being it if you provide therapy by telling him to stay away from the things and people etc that upset him and find and associate with the things that arent threat he will make amazing progress this pushes whole new philosophy under the structure of scientology 6312c12 shspec329 summary of ot processes this is fast and rapid summary of ot processes this is matter of record not so much matter of education this gives the record of the final technology of bank running which is now complete and unvarying the technology is very precise it is extremely crisp you do not vary from it some pcs become fixated on parts of the bank and argue with you about structure for instance seeing two ris the pc may think that he has two and only two gpms there are variations as far as which implants someone could have someone might not have the helatrobus implants for instance but everyone on this planet has the train implant there is whole set of implants around trillions 2 which are similar to the helatrobus implants and for which we dont have the pattern you can get variations at level v but none at level vi or the person wouldnt be here one person has not made different types of actual gpms than another you dont get variations at level vi but lack of data and an overburdened case could bring about an apparent difference in the case the differences are only mistakes made by the auditor andor the pc every actual gpm is similar to every other actual gpm in basic composition the goal as an ri is always the first ri in the bank it then runs on up the line on solve basis not on an oppose basis each item is problem with its opposite item going on up the bank but those masses are actually very huge spheres they are all the accumulated energies that anyone ever had anything to do with on this particular subject they have been lived through and they have been accumulated now an actual gpm has varying numbers of ris on the middle track the gpms have 16 to 18 ris in them late on the track closer to pt they go to 22 to 24 ris each one has crossover the middle pair of ris if gpm has 20 ris at number ten you will generally get the crossover the crossover is very important that is where the pc ceases to be for the goal and starts to be against it on the oppterm side you get progression up through the crossover point from the bottom oppterm which is dead opposed to the goal to the top oppterm which is dead for the goal and on the terminal side you have the goal as an ri at the bottom and it progresses up to the cross over for the goal and then on gradient scale goes against the goal the top terminal of actual gpm is dead against the goal if the goal were to be strong the top terminal would be something like weak or being weak that pattern has to be understood or the pc will get in trouble the patterns are all similar matter what the gpms position on the time track is as you go earlier on the track however there is this change you get more items for the goal ie the crossover point drifts higher but the position of the crossover is also monitored by whether the pc as thetan liked the goal or not the crossover would occur very near the bottom of gpm whose goal the pc detests eg to be obedient you can have the crossover appear almost at the goal on goal that the pc detests perhaps in the first couple or three pairs but this is not an important eccentricity dont be alarmed by it that is the only variation in crossover another variation in actual gpms is that earlier on the track the time span for gpm is longer eg modern gpm could span only billion years an early gpm could span trillions 20 to trillions 30 years there are about as guess 26 gpms in bank very few the closesttopt gpm can be 419expected to be truncated which makes it difficult to enter the track because the pt gpm may have any number of items in it in case analysis you can only count on what blows down the ta the emeter is not wholly reliable here the meter is only of relative use if all is perfectly correct on the meter you have chance of being right gpm when found will read if not forever it does give you nice long rocket reads and blowdowns when you find it but dont expect it to read forever now the pt gpm being truncated will have less than full complement of ris which makes it hard to find its top the present gpm has some top short of total attainment of the goal on the oppterm side and short of total opposition to the goal on the terminal side how short is the pt gpm dont cut your throat if you find after 75 hours that it only had two ris or if you find that it is really the second gpm and is there in full you may not find out that this is the case until you reach the eighth gpm you cannot be sure that you have the pt gpm or any other particular gpm you do the best you can and always suspect that there are more ris into pt once the thing can be repaired and you are getting charge off all the way it is not fatal to make mistakes in doing this but dont underestimate the ability of these processes to nearly kill the pc if mishandled say you skipped two gpms and started to run out the one below it the pc would feel like hell pc never feels worse than on r4 done wrong but he can live through it it is the auditor who is in danger wrongly worded gpm will shut off the rr the pt gpm is the one you are working for but it may not show up until you have run an earlier gpm the programming is done only one way in running these things that is you find the pt gpm you find its top terminal you list the top terminal for two items the first oppterm and the second oppterm from the second oppterm you get the solves it by asking who or what would it solve and you go on down the bank so it is always the same you find the pt gpm you run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm and get its top oppterm and then run all items out of it and find the next gpm etc until you get to the beginning of the time track you can cut in and find the second gpm first by accident and find out later on that it is the second gpm and then by doing goal oppose of it you can find the actual first gpm but that is at the risk of the game that is just fixing mistake properly you find the pt gpm or something that you could believe was the pt gpm you then run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm you get its top oppterm and run all items out of it then you go on down the bank to the beginning of track and that is the only program that is successful taking any gpm that fires and then trying to goaloppose it to pt is not hard to do it is impossible you end up with messedup track you do this same program on every case including cases that have had goals found and run out in various ways you start with listing for the pt gpm what is your present time actual gpm this can be long list it follows goals list format when you get fifty items past the last rr seen on listing and you are getting ta while listing the gpm is on that list somewhere and you find it by elimination this sounds impossible but this pattern has been successful whenever tried pcs come up with the pt gpm every time of course it has to be an educated pc if not you dont have prayer it takes terrific stability on the part of the pc to hang in there when things get tight an untrained person wouldnt stand for it it is not that he couldnt be gotten into it but he will panic when things go wrong and he feels terrible he wont have the security of knowing that he can get out of what he got into it is basically understanding that will carry him through here is tabulated summary of the r4 procedure as outlined in this tape 1 do pt goals list and get goal list for the pt gpm using what is your present time actual gpm you use goalslisting procedure that is you list fifty items past the last rr seen on listing if the ta is all run out then the list is complete you then find the item by elimination 4202 try to count the number of ris in the pt gpm then plot it up accordingly and observe where the top of this gpm sits in relation to the crossover point eg say youve got 12 ris then you know that the top pair is one pair past crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal 3 find the top terminal by listing what terminal are you sitting in now 4 list two lists from this same top terminal to get the top oppterm and the second oppterm of this truncated gpm charge will expire on the top oppterm so then you will get the second oppterm because that is the way the pattern progresses going down into the bank after getting the top oppterm list ww wd solve top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm 5 solve this across and continue to the bottom of the gpm 6 do goaloppose list to find the goal of the second gpm using goalslisting procedure 7 take the goal as an ri from the pt gpm and list who or what would it solve to find the top oppterm of the second gpm 8 take this top oppterm and list who or what would solve the top oppterm to get the top terminal of the second gpm 9 solve it across to get the second oppterm of the second gpm 10 run all the items out of that gpm in similar manner and continue on down the bank using steps 6 to 10 above to the beginning of the track it is the pc who comes up with the answers he finds out what is going wrong if you can get off any bpc he will start giving you some good data about what has gone wrong eg the pcs next gpm is found but wont read so gpm has been missed there is so much inval on the goal that it reads as wrong goal so the pc says that some inval is present so the auditor prepchecks the goal and on the rocket read comes and off they go but repair is too complex to do without help from the pc however pc can sell an item and if the auditor buys it it can land the pc in the soup also if the rr doesnt pack up in the first five items down the bank dont let the pc sell you on the idea that it is wrong goal wrongly worded or misworded lrh once let pc sell him on the idea that goal was wrong goal he listed and found two new goals without realizing that the pc had merely gotten into dramatization of one of the items of the goals gpm and therefore so despised this goal that the pc wanted nothing to do with this goal rule if it is running all right keep running dont make trouble until trouble happens since it is trouble that consumes session time take up trouble as it comes if the pc does get in trouble dont try to force the pc on stop and find out what is wrong and fix it otherwise you can invalidate goals and items and make them read like wrong goals and items the read you get on listing actual gpm items and goals is like nothing you have seen elsewhere it is not an rr and it is not fall and it is not anything else you have seen elsewhere tick will never be the item the real item hits rubber bumper and forces its way through like breaking through stone wall and then falls on through to bd these are item reads only an item read looks that way nothing else does it goes the whole dial and brings about blowdown the rule in itemfinding is to list as long as the pc wants to list and then find the item on the early part of the list that has variation the item could be wrongly worded early on the list and reappear correctly worded later on the list so that it looks as though it actually appears later on the list the item lists are short especially compared to most goals lists you might have shorter goals lists however when the pc gets pretty educated he can spot the goal right away the meter blows up heat comes off etc etc here is an example of an lrh bank the goaloppose question who or what would destroy oppose gave the next goal which was to worship to create was rocketreading implant gpm worship had nothing to do with religion it was too early the earlier you go on the track the simpler and more direct the goals and items are as you go later the items get more dispersive and complicated items like certainty and predictability and solved by unpredictability it will be less neat pattern the thetan is thinking more complexly more involvedly he is in more dispersed state on the middle and back track the thetan is simpler as you get back to the middle track word 421like the goal appears in 80 of the items on earlier track word with the sense of the goal appears in almost 100 of the items close to pt you get tremendous variation in items and more complex goals that are hard to get oppositions to with the goal almost never appearing in the items the hard end of the track is the pt end the thetan has less scope the gap is less wide between opposites there is more dispersion the thetan is nattery picky and so forth you can see the dwindling spiral of the thetan as you look over these gpms the chances are far against getting simple goals in pt middle track goals are simple when you get two or three gpms back you start getting simpler goals on the middle track for instance you get goals like to do to think to postulate in later gpms there are more items and greater complexity the items disperse more quickly from the basic goal area as was said earlier the goal word appears less frequently in the items but the pattern doesnt change the top oppterm is definitely the goal and the top terminal is definitely against the goal the hard things to list are the top terminal and the bottom oppterm thats shootin into the blue the top terminal is very often but not always controlled by the goal that you are about to get ie the next goal up the top terminal may or may not be similar to the next goal it could be quite disrelated you can get fooled here the pattern might not hold eg the next goal might be the goal to postulate and the top terminal might be sitting you cant predict the top terminal except that it is opposite to the goal of the gpm that it is in the bottom oppterm is the reason he done it of course the real reason he done it is the gpm he just lived through but his particular penchant is usually expressed in the bottom oppterm because it is opposed by the goal as an ri the bottom oppterm is going to say what the person is mad at in the pt gpm like civilization or financial institutions this one is hard to get so the pc might miss it like mad the two bottom oppterms and the two top terminals in the gpm forecast some difficulty the toughest to get are the bottom oppterm and the top terminal how do you list one of these things first do your pt goals list and get goal then try to count the number of ris in that gpm the presumptive pt gpm then plot it up accordingly observe where it sits in relation to where the crossover point is say youve got twelve ris so you know that you are one pair past the crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal you can get the top terminal of the pt gpm by listing what terminal are you sitting in now if you want to ask why dont you list for the top oppterm it is the same as asking why dont you try to list the bank its the same question the pc doesnt know whats there relative to the top oppterm but he is sitting in and intimately connected with as himself this top terminal because that is the one that he is living through life in therefore it is easy to list for the top terminal so list for the top terminal and find it then list two lists from this same top terminal and get 1 the top oppterm 2 the second oppterm you are able to do this because charge will expire on the top oppterm when you have found it and therefore there wont be any more charge on this oppterm you then get the second oppterm because that is the way the bank progresses going down into the bank gpms always proceed downwards from the top oppterm why this pattern for running the gpm because if you get this higgledypiggledy in the first gpm you are going to be kittycorner from the oppterm to the next terminal below it and that doesnt solve the bank doesnt run that way and it doesnt solve that way and you will be in trouble so you get the two top oppterms 1 and 2 sometimes you almost wreck yourself by getting both oppterms on the same list both firing but you really need two listings so you can tell which is which so after getting the top oppterm do who or what would solve the top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm solve it across and go on down the bank that way now items always solve goals always oppose never do goals solve list eg what goal would solve goal the goal as an ri sounds like goal but it is an item and that would be an item solve list for the next lower top oppterm so after you get the whole of the top bank now do goaloppose list to get the goal of the 2 gpm you now assess by elimination to get that goal thats the end of all oppositions until you are up to the point of getting the goal for the next gpm but you still have an unsolved ri which is the goal as an ri at the bottom of the top gpm opposing the goal as an ri is the most critical action in the whole operation take the goal as an ri and list who or what would it solve and get the top 422oppterm of the next gpm using nice beefy long list on this one that is the touchiest part of the bank if you get it wrong it will be wrong from then on out if you get wrong top oppterm you will go all over the place you will have the wrong gpm it is also the easiest to get wrong because it looks the simplest the top oppterm is the final achievement of the goal that you have just gotten from the goaloppose list the pc is now against it eg on goal to sneeze the top oppterm would be sneezing or people who sneeze or sneezers or having to sneeze etc if you get the top oppterm slightly misworded you have had it so do nice long top oppterm list you want 20 or 30 item list so dont take an item as the top oppterm just on the pcs sayso you can tangle the whole bank dont promote the pcs itsa on this one if you buy the pcs delighted itsa you are likely to get the third terminal from the bottom and get the whole bank upside down the other place where you disregard the pcs itsa is when you are halfway through gpm with the rr still on and he tells you that it is not his goal so get the list on listing for the top oppterm null it with the pcs attention on it ask which item had heat look around the area of that item on the list especially few items above the item that he mentioned see if you can get that area to read get the top oppterm and check it out mow be very careful when you get the top terminal the wording is critical the terminal has an opposite meaning to the bank at large when you have the two top ris make sure that both of them are absolutely correct before you go on the alternative is to get circular invalidation going where you are leaving wrong items behind you and listing from wrong items correcting and going ahead into messedup areas as you correct one item another gets messed up when you find wrong item behind you accept items that you found after you found the wrong item redo all the later lists the way you check out bank when looking for wrong item is to go back over it from the top reading the items off with mathematical precision with the session ruds in the wrong item that you left behind you will tick or rocketread that is proven rule if it reads it is wrong item invariably it is not that it wasnt opposed being wrong it reads and throws into question all succeeding items any items that occur after that if they are right are so merely by coincidence so you have to list again through muddiedup bank to correct the wrong item take the list you got it from and look earlier or later if it was the first or second item on the list or the list could be incomplete but two items reading in the same items list means nothing listing rules dont apply to items lists listing rules apply to goals lists and only to goals lists you can have six items reading on an item solve list and it doesnt mean that the list is incomplete one of the six reading items is the item and you dont continue the list on wrong goal everything you write down reads for awhile then nothing reads the only thing that shuts off an rr is wrong goal wrong item will not do so you can overrun the gpm and run into gpm for which you have goal the only thing that shuts off an rr is not having the goal what shuts down the rr is not having the goal and this is the only way to shut off an rr even slightly misworded goal will turn it off so if the rr continues youve got the right goal so relax and once you get your goal dont call it again until you get to the goal as an ri refer to it by number and dont use the wording how does this ri relate to the goal use how does this ri relate to this gpm or to gpm _______ the reason for this is that every time you call the goal you pull the goal as an ri up towards pt and disarrange the bank you save it so that if you have to use it later to prepcheck off inval in straightening things out you can or you might want to save it for use in later cleanup even then you still say the goal as little as possible if you are prepchecking gpm goal use on this goal dont keep repeating the goal as this will drive the pc to the bottom of the gpm there are lots of things to know lots of indicators but only few simple rules and they are dead on for instance you ask is this an actual gpm after you have found the goal you always check it out when you have run five or six gpms you get response on the meter until the pc says it then it reads as you go down the bank the items will read when the pc says it not when you call it at first when the case is unburdened with r3sc etc the subitsa comes up towards the surface however further on down the line you lose the subitsa again the subitsa line reverses with the itsa line eventually basic auditing must be very well in and the pc must be easily auditable youve got to promote his confidence and itsa so that when you run out of the emeter the pc can handle it youve got to be able to talk to the pc and the pc has to be able to talk to you because in few cases itsa is all that you will have to guide you through 423the only thing that makes bad basic auditor is person who is afraid of becoming ot or who sees great deal of harm in being exteriorized or in being set adrift alone without body or the idea of setting people adrift or alone without body restimulates all those people that they have held down and stuck spears in the stomachs of that is exteriorization too someone whose basic auditing is poor at levels ii iii or iv will have it fly out at upper levels because he gets so restimulated at the idea of exteriorizing exterization restimulates murder so you get the idea that he doesnt deserve to be clear etc dont look for the significance to explain fear or terror of exteriorization it is just gpms shifting around and colliding caused by the thought of exteriorizing you can set someone up so they will do flawless basic auditing for one session by running ow this shows that they consider auditing to be an overt this was first tested in melbourne in 1960 there are arc breaky pcs there are only bad basic auditors the pc who is dangerous is the one who goes into propitiation or lower when arc broken such pc is harder to handle than one who screams any pc audited beyond an arc break will go into the sad effect you could audit the auditor on ow for short session and he would give flawless sessions this is very important tape the exact patter is on the demo tape of last wednesday probably 6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing pp 551552 above lrh also mentions color movie with all the tech in this area and the area of gpms 6312c31 shspec1 indicators this was the year in which we achieved the technology of ot and in which we laid the bridge with all the older processes from dianetics on it is the year in which we had our hardest attacks since 1950 these attacks are losing or have lost the irs lost its suit on lrh and msh irs means infernal ravening the work for 1964 should include codification of materials writing textbooks for the different levels etc several techniques have been developed for higherclassed auditor to run on lowerlevel pc we are ready to open the door wide on the subject of psychosomatic healing we could put it on an ethical basis by saying that if you dont get results on patient you refund his money anybody who is receiving level vi auditing see above for description of this level from an auditor who flubs goes through more illnesses and psychosomatics than anyone can count lrh understands the phenomenon of psychosomatics and is consequently little contemptuous of doctors treatment of these conditions it is rather horrifying from an auditors viewpoint to see what is thought of the illness and how it is treated the auditor would like to be able to see what goal it is what ri what service fac etc when chaos reigns caused by misalignment of the psyche this is fascinating in its complexity and disillusioning in the simplicity of its cause the technology for handling the bank has finally been worked out it is complex it takes expert auditing and an educated pc but the result is an ot this is far higher result than was expected before 1962 to degree that it is unreal to most people at times it is even unreal to lrh even when the auditor and the pc have tremendous skill they can make huge mistakes for instance lrh has been looking for his pt gpm for months he has found seven so far each one thought to be the pt one he has been unburdening the track by running them as they were found he is aware of good case advance since starting out now his goals lists go for five or six items one rocketreading then it goes on by stacking it up putting the gpm on top of it listing in to the top oppterm to see if there was anything there to see if there was gpm closer to pt we handled four of them like they were old sacks of straw he finally got the pt gpm for the first time he looked forward and saw nothing there he woke up wondered if couple were backwards creak got his considerations creak this is far cry from few months ago when he was wrapped around telegraph pole with regularity you made the early gpms without having body so it is tough on bodies to run into ris etc it is nice to be outside not subject to the bodys intolerance of temperature extremes the problem lrh ends the year with is as an ot how do you drink cocacola it doesnt evaporate like liquor and lrh is too big to get into the bottle he thought of putting it in tub with ice 424if you have wondered whether you will ever make it all the way while you are making it all the way you will have many other periods when you will be certain that you will never make it all the way that is the greatest certainty that lrh can give you he has known many times that it was impossible for you to make it but he has recovered the final end product of scientology or of thetan in this universe has been achieved in 1963 whatever else can be said for the year indicators this is new subject routine 6 this is probably the procedure given in the last tape see hcopl 5may64 summary of classification and gradation and certification p 4 see also above for summary of this procedure cannot be run without knowledge of indicators and of the proper actions to do when certain things are present or not present indicators are present at every level there are good indicators and bad indicators to know about bad indicators you must know what good indicators are one needs to know both in order to have datum to compare with for instance you dont cut the pcs itsa because you want the good indicator of smooth needle and cheerful pc not because of fear of instructors in the field of say music one has some standards and expectations of how it should sound on hifi equipment etc that is the comparative datum the good indicator the standard test for hifi equipment is how should it sound poor hifi equipment sounds like you are in the lobby of the theater when the aisle doors are closed if you walk down the aisle to about the center of the theater and listen that is what good hifi equipment should sound like people watching lrhs auditing on demos have shown that they dont have standard to judge the session by lrh worked out good and bad indicators to make the standards known and explicit if you know what is right with session you can tell what is wrong with one good indicators people should be happy in session the only frame of mind that you can asis in is cheerful high toned one the pc should be cheerfully itsaing to the auditor if he runs secondary he runs grief off of it and comes out of it etc we get picture of what the session should be with good indicators if they are not there then bad indicators are there these bad indicators should be handled so as to get the good indicators back gis mean that the auditor should continue what he is doing bis show that the auditor should so something else the particular bis that are present determine what the auditor must do eg if the pc makes critical remark about the auditor pull missed withhold do session arc break assessment or run ow how the pc should look and sound how the bank should respond how the meter should behave all these are the good indicators note that at levels v and vi the male and female clear reads longer apply since thetan doesnt have sex the time to do something about bad indicator is when you cant go on with good indicators not just whenever bad indicator shows up the broad range of optimum ta range is 20 to 40 the common range of ta excursion is 275 to 35 there are three grades of bad indicators light medium and heavy they compare to the suddenness with which you must take action 1 the light indicator shows you that something is wrong so that you can be alert for need for action but nothing necessarily needs to be done 2 on moderate bis action must be taken as soon as it can be comfortably done 3 on heavy bis emergency crash action must be taken right now an example of grade 3 bi would be the pc not wanting auditing 4 grade 4 bi would be something like car going over cliff you hear dwindling scream this pc is never going to be audited again gis mean expected not extraordinary wanting auditing is more common than you would expect it is gi we take for granted if lot of gis are present few bis dont matter too much an ordinary bi not vbi would be the fact that the pc has ptp you tend to it promptly since pc with ptp makes progress pc with an arc break gets worse with auditing so that is vvbi that is the only time that auditing worsens case so the gis are pc in session with ptp and arc break this is something that one should know for auditing supervision you cannot supervise by bis only by gis because when gis cease to exist your action must be directed towards recreating them not just at eradicating bis 425you could base your expectations of case progress on how many gis are present for every gi not present some bi is present do the appropriate thing to remove the bi and get the gi back know gis more by heart than bis since if there is bi you can always go to the textbook to figure it out for instance you notice that the pc keeps having ptps you eventually think of the datum that when the pc keeps having ptps his goals must be totally divergent from the auditors goals and the session itself becomes the ptp dont act when bis are not present only correct what needs correction dont let win on repairing one pcs bis become the stable datum for all pcs who dont have the same bis this disposes of the idea that some pcs are auditable and others arent you are an auditor and the standard procedures on which you are being trained are the way in which you materialize gis in session they are all calculated to bring about gis in the pc the gains of auditing are astonishingly automatic these days you just audit the pc on standard program if bis pop up always take care of the worst one first naturally you want to get the heaviest bpc out of the way first and keep patching up the case only until you can get back on the road the gi on an auditing question is 1 the pc has received something to inspect 2 he inspects it 3 he tells you what he has inspected he answers the question fully as far as he is concerned 4 then you acknowledge it doesnt matter if you gave him one command and he inspected fully and took half an hour to answer or if you gave him many repetitive commands and he fully answered the question he is going through an electronic circuit and he comes out the other end free of it having inspected it if you cut his itsa along the way he gets lost in the middle of the labyrinth of electronic material this gives rise to dirty needle just keep the pc going with gis building his confidence and not cutting his itsa moving him along up the line 6401c07 shspec2 good indicators some of the material in this tape is also contained in hcob 28dec63 routine vi indicators part one good indicators the good indicators listed in hcob 28dec63 dont all apply to all sessions but most do they dont just apply to r6 sessions for definition of r6 see above if you learn what good indicators are you can spot bad indicators an auditor tends to look for wrongnesses that is the nature of scientology because if there werent something wrong with man he wouldnt be here unlike other ologies we see an individual as basically good able and powerful this is the reverse of most peoples approach so the way have to improve man is also different we have tremendous evidence that our concept is true and that the opposite one is erroneous for instance we found that childrens iqs drop more and more the longer they spend in school because the longer they stay there the more false stable data get shoved down their throats truth is demonstrated by workability though some dispute truth because its workability challenges their favorite theories all present sciences have built up to their current state on the basis of workability the idea of deleting something in order to bring about recovery from bad condition is not new with us but the simplicity of asking someone for solutions that he has had to the condition is new departure you can ask what solutions and decisions person has had relative to his lumbosis and get recovery from deletion of additives this is all part of the idea that adding something to being makes him feel worse take being who is feeling blah when we put in midruds we are subtracting actions we are subtracting the livingness of some period and he will feel better lrh has made more extreme test of this theory he subtracted an insane beings body from him by exteriorizing him when exteriorized the being was immediately sane back in his body he was insane again this is not therapeutic it is just an experimental technique 426the good things of life are havingness at ones own choice the individuals power of choice is the only thing he had to begin with which gave him power capability etc that power of choice has been consistently and continually overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things that he did want someone who solves something and fixes the solution instead of just confronting the thing is putting himself down in power in scientology the only right we have to educate anyone is that we are teaching things that are as close to fact as they can be made and the technology of how it is put together is so close to how it is put together that it runs itself out this is the reason why scientology education doesnt have to usual bad effects of education scientology education runs itself out because it is so close to the truth whenever you have solution to problem it gets stuck except in the case of scientology scientology is the only solution in the universe that erases itself you can do almost anything with scientology because of this when scientology solves something it solves what has solved it its truths are shown to you so that you can reach other truths the data of scientology is so minor so sweet and so pure compared to all the other types of solutions gpms ris service facs electric shock treatment etc that we dont come under the heading of adding aberrative data to the individual as solution to his difficulties even if scientology data sits there for awhile on top of some aberration it will eventually reach through the thing on which it is sitting uproot it and the truth of the data will cause it to blow asis along with what it solved you are all sitting in some ri that could behave in this way an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are calculated to degrade and depower him all you have to do is to pick up to asis the mess and you will return him to power if you handle his school education for example his iq will rise the data of scientology is restimulation of more basic and fundamental truths which restimulated tend to blow later data some people can just study scientology and leap out of bed well this adds up to the fact that man to date is an addedto being everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope we have gotten him dependent on tools and that sort of thing the more you give person to work with eg the more machines etc he is supposed to work with the less he works his ability to work is reduced by these additives primitive cultures with minimal tools work long and thoroughly to create aesthetic elements as part of ordinary workaday objects someone with lots of tools doesnt get much done for instance the esquimo with very simple tools elaborately decorates his spear whereas the person with drill presses lathes etc says i cant do this thing because i have to have that other thing first theres relationship between having to have and getting things done the more you have the less you tend to get done have to have becomes never do the fellow who has to have and have in order to get anything done does very little the chinese carpenter working with handmade fish bone dowels and bowdrill didnt have to have anything elaborate to drill hole etc yet he was able to get more done by good deal than his western counterpart with his elaborate tools you could have added to the universe of this chinese carpenter the postulate that you cant do without certain tools think about that wording to the point where he could longer do that is an aberrative side to some thetans bent for collecting havingness eg lrh and his cameras in collecting cameras he has paid less attention to any one of them so now he gets fewer pictures with more cameras there can be minimum amount of equipment needed to get job done but an overwhelmed being has to have and cant do the more you add to the workman the less he can accomplish because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses that is what is wrong with most auditors the recognition of the fact that truth is present to be amplified or increased is vital part of auditing if you dont notice the rightnesses present you dont see the truth present that can then be used to promote more truth so nothing gets done if you only recognize wrongnesses you wont be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think that you have any rightnesses to work with our only purpose in finding wrongnesses is to increase rightnesses you have to look at wrongnesses to remedy them but you have to look at rightnesses to increase them progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop away processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightness is present in the session you cannot take case that has rightnesses present and delete any wrongnesses auditing is the process of maintaining rightness so that you can delete wrongness you are trying to get right being if you dont continuously encourage right beingness you will never get right being to correct wrongness you have to have at least as much rightness present if rightness and wrongness are equally balanced it is dangerous situation you are better off if the rightnesses far outweigh the wrongnesses this will give you an easier job of auditing the pcs ability to asis is rightness of 427varying magnitude pc who is pretty overwhelmed cant handle or asis large wrongness if you delete good indicators from the session the pc wont be able to asis anything pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in the session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators in the session if the good indicators have dropped out of the session the pcs ability to handle wrongnesses is much less you have got to get gis back in before you can expect the pc to handle what you want him to handle you have to retrograde the process to match the state of the pc if he becomes bis for instance you may have to run the pc on touch assist or havingness you must watch and if good indicator goes out you look for the bad indicator if you are slow find out what happened and correct it bad indicators dont necessarily appear when good indicators disappear they are separate breeds of cat the auditor must always find out what is wrong in session before the pc finds out that is how you maintain altitude to maintain optimal altitude handle the scene when the good indicator goes out but before the bad indicator comes in spotting the absence of good indicator and remedying the situation with remedy of appropriate magnitude will avoid the expense of auditing time on expensive repairs light indicator means that you should be alert medium indicator requires correction heavy indicator means emergency any process has its own series of bad indicators bad indicators come in when good indicators go out dont spend your time looking for bad indicators just know the good indicators so well that when one of them goes out climb on and handle be alert but dont always be looking for wrongnesses good indicators in routine 6 and lower levels 1 pc cheerful in r6 misemotion is allowable at lower levels for instance the good indicator would be the pc getting more cheerful in r3r misemotion should be diminishing but at level vi the pc should be running like grinning idiot 2 pc cogniting this should happen sometimes on any level lack of cognition indicates that the pc has ptp or an arc break or that he is running at level above his reality at lower levels the good indicator would be the pc cogniting at level vi the pc should be cogniting on ris and goals 3 pcs items found are the ones that the pc thought they were at lower levels it often turns out that what the pc thought was wrong is what was wrong the pcs fundamental rightnesses assert themselves 4 at level vi pc listing items briefly and accurately at lower levels the good indicator is giving things to the auditor briefly and accurately the pc is finding things accurately and speedily 5 properlyreading meter at level vi items found are not rocketreading at lower levels things found give the proper meter responses 6 at level vi short item lists at lower levels it doesnt take long time to get things done 7 items found without lot of wrassle at lower level this translates as being able to get data from the pc without big hassle 8 ta continuing in motion ta not stuck this good indicator can be overridden by the good indicator of the pc easily and rapidly flattening processes 9 active needle the needle is fluid or fluent moving not stuck mark v meter can be set at too high sensitivity giving the appearance of more fluidlooking needle than you really have it moves around on the other hand you may need high sensitivity for pulling withholds etc where it doesnt matter if you clean clean once in awhile on the other hand if you leave the withhold by using too low sensitivity you have had it for r6 sensitivity 8 is maximum for listing and 16 for midruds you can have ta action with gummy needle watch for that this is still missing gi the needle should be swinging cleanly 10 pc not being troubled by pains and somatics when answering auditing questions or any somatic the pc runs into discharges very rapidly somatic that stays there and gets heavier is bad indicator you want change somatics 42811 ta goes down when pc cognites you should get further blowdown of the ta when the pc talks about something 12 pc gets warm and stays warm in auditing or gets hot and unheats in auditing the pc doesnt get chilled getting chilled is bi 13 pcs somatics turn on occasionally this is gi at lower levels it is bi in r6 14 ta range 25 to 375 ta range 225 to 30 is excellent this applies at any level 15 good ta action on spotting things the expected ta action for any level is the best indicator 16 getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong 17 pc has ptp this is good indicator unless the pc is in total propitiation the bad indicator would be the pcs developing ptps about the session in session 18 pc satisfied after auditing and staying certain of the auditing solution 19 pc not critical or arc breaky always gis 20 pc happy and satisfied with the auditor regardless of what the auditor is doing 21 pc looking younger by reason of auditing this is not common but it is good indicator 22 pc without weariness 23 pc without aches pains or illnesses developed in auditing 24 pc wanting more auditing 25 pc confident and getting more confident 26 pcs itsa free but only extensive enough to cover the subject under discussion if the pcs itsa is too extensive he is trying to stop the auditor from auditing the pc should itsa but not too much 27 auditor understanding why it is the way it is when the pc explains it or how it was the way it was the pc is saying things that make sense the auditor should be able to understand the pc 28 pc there under his own volition taken from next tape if all these good indicators are present you know that you are doing good job 6401c09 shspec3 bad indicators in trying to relay truth it is always necessary to break it down into system by which it can be communicated the system that breaks auditing down into basic auditing technique and case analysis is useful one see the tape 6 11c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing case analysis now breaks down into the general subjects 1 case analysis 2 good indicators 3 bad indicators case analysis consists of keeping continuous eye on the pcs indicators case analysis is 1 noting when the gis are still present 2 being alert and noting when one has dropped out 4293 looking to see what bi has appeared 4 programming to remedy the bi with some appropriate technique actually there is shifting back and forth between technique and case analysis case analysis contains programming see the book of case remedies bad indicators include the fact that the pc is in body not an ot the corresponding good indicator would be that he is there of his own volition the first bad indicator is that the pc looks like he doesnt want to be in session anymore that is good indicator is gone namely the pcs being there of his own volition the bad indicator is unwillingness to be there that is our first hurdle free choice not there of his own volition that ends the case analysis the above is simple example of case analysis from there on it is matter of selecting process to fit the case level what technique to use to handle this bi depends on the level of the pc and the auditor so case analysis starts out with the observation that the expected indicator or behavior ie the natural behavior of being the good indicator has gone out good indicators are actually the natural behavior of being the world particularly since freud with his idea of the censor has been crashing along on this lie that inhibited behavior is social behavior and that any uninhibited behavior is antisocial so the criminal is uninhibited so you have to punish him and put him in cell and if you inhibit him enough you will make social being out of him actually superinhibition brings about social catastrophes if you cant fix behavior you can always inhibit it you are suppressing it though and thetans forward actions and desires do not fade away they only submerge impulses do not fade away they only submerge this is axiom 0 thetan never gives up trying to create an effect holding grudge is 11 characteristic eg henry viii got even with the pope by creating the church of england this gives you better understanding of people in general seeing what happens when impulses meet with inhibition people get even you will understand history teen agers criminals and everything lot better if you realize that thetan never really gives up this is the secret of behavior this is why teenagers so commonly reject their families the child never forgives the parents for certain things often tiny things you have to find the source of rejection or revolt auditing easily brings this to the fore the child rejects his parents to get even besides forgiveness per is propitiation the source of mans ingratitude and the secret of leadership is just the fact that thetan never gives up as an auditor you are just auditing all the nutty aberrated inhibited times when the pc never gave up when he postulated something silly when he tried to do something stupid you can actually graph how some innocent goal or impulse goes through this process of degradation 1 it becomes inhibited submerged and warped 2 it emerges at lower level as an overt 3 below that it emerges as withhold you could graph that on any ambition 4 below that is unawareness which submerges down to 5 unconsciousness 6 humanoid that is how goal becomes an overt withhold unawareness unconsciousness and below that humanoid so when being comes in for auditing his being there of his own volition is the biggest good indicator there is he is surrounded by bad indicators which you are going to eradicate the hope factor is put in by validating whatever good indicators are present the next best indicator is that the pc is getting better betterness to us means less present in the sense of my ankle is getting better the pain confusion etc is less present betterment is the lessening of bad condition so the pc getting better wrongnesses less present is good indicator this is negative gain if all you did in session were to validate the good indicators that were present and attack and 430handle one by one the bad indicators that were present thereby restoring more good indicators you would get amazing results you would be enormously successful the pc would approach native state dont try to train or audit someone against his own volition assuming that you have tried and failed to change his mind it is bad indicator all you need to be able to do is to spot gis and when gis are not present to spot the bad indicator that is present and to go ahead and handle it if case goes on talking about something he hasnt gotten rid of it and you havent yet achieved negative gain in the area all your lowerlevel gains are based on destimulation and removal of bis progress on case is measured by the number of gis that you are restoring this applies to level iv or below note that this is the precursor of grades auditing bad indicator 1 pc nervous about auditing level 0 at the lowest levels you assume that the pc is not there on his own determinism and work on fixing this up you want to have pc who is not nervous about getting auditing at level 0 discuss scientology with him let him know what it is about try to get him there under his own determinism get him to decide level i discuss auditing healing therapies etc get his ideas about these things reassure the pc that you are not auditing him to make him guilty you are only concerned with making the able more able get what others ideas or opinions are about treatment and what it might do to him try to cope with the pc intellectually get into general discussion of his being audited level ii here you could run repetitive process which could go as follows what have you had to do which you didnt want to do or what orders have you had to follow about your health general ow would also be runnable at this level level iii pull missed withholds on auditing past auditing or treatment prepcheck any of those or something like on auditing goals or on being forced to be audited you could run r2h now renamed r3h you could do arc break assessments or find the pcs basic ideas about being audited how he originally felt about it level iv here youve got service facs arc breaks with auditors practitioners arc breaks that the pc has had in past processing etc etc at level iv we can find one session that the person didnt want in the past because of withhold or something that would be key point to knock out of the way you could run how would refusing to be audited make you rightothers wrong why shouldnt you be audited is crude but workable process at this level bad indicator 2 pc unfriendly or cool towards the auditor unappreciative of the auditor or auditing this opens the door to large area of withholds overts cut comm cut itsa etc you can run out of itsa by specializing in solutions only not problems even though the ta motion comes from solutions thus you sacrifice some present ta motion for greater amount of future ta motion you could spend fifty percent of your time on problems and fifty percent on solutions and get more ta by not running out of itsa it is fiftyfifty proposition this is because gpms are fifty percent terminals fixed solutions and fifty percent oppterms fixed problems both give good ta unfriendliness to the auditor could stem from the auditors keeping the pc from itsaing as area of interest including problems you must get into problems somewhat so that the pc has something to talk about at all the pc will get unfriendly if the auditor never gives him anything to talk about level 0 get the pc to discuss what damage the auditor might do to him or her this is lousy solution since it asks for more critical but it is better than nothing get the pc to explain why he shouldnt be audited this can get him quite friendly and right into session level i another lowlevel remedy would be how could you help this raises the arc of the pc you could also get the pc to explain any trouble he has gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely that also gets off few missed withholds you could use what are you willing to talk to about level ii you could use similar processes here as well as general ow on auditors level iii you could pull withholds missed by auditors you could prepcheck auditors practitioners help or failed help as indicated 431level iv you work on help and failed help on service fac basis using if you were really helped by auditing how would that make you wrong if you werent helped by auditing how would that make you right when pcs at levels v vi and vii are unfriendly to auditors there is some foulup in the root of the bank bad indicator 3 pc nervous about being audited in particular auditing room thats the auditing environment these things always run down to some horrendous ptp or arc break level 0 discuss the dangerousness of the environment level i discuss dangerous environments in general the trouble he has had in auditing rooms in practitioners rooms get solutions off how he has solved it level ii finding things that are safe level iii havingness level iv get associative restimulators here is suggested exercise make list of bad indicators that could be present if homo sapiens were dragged in chains into your auditing room then figure out what you might be able to do about these things given enough time perhaps over course of months you should be able to turn him into highflying pc by 1 seeing good indicator missing 2 noting all the bad indicators 3 selecting the one that is most in the road of auditing 4 eradicating that one first 5 continue handling the bis one by one by getting considerations off etc until more bis are present using this procedure you could get anyone matter how initially hostile he was to want auditing on his own determinism and not by overwhelming him auditing is converting bis to gis as you work the case remember that the person has had some impulses somewhere along the line that got inhibited and submerged handling those by getting back to them will give resurgence of the case 6402c04 shspec4 auditor selfcriticism enough of this goofing off as auditors and students the subject of selfcriticism of auditing is very misunderstood because it is too simple lrh has been researching r6 see p 568 above during january on the theory that it is better for him to get the body knocked off than for the rest of you to get it r6 is incredibly complex but totally necessary you need very smooth basic auditing in order to make r6 work selfcriticism simply means taping your session listening to it and spotting what needs improvement one gets amazing responses to the question what happened in the session selfcriticism of auditing is vital from level iii on up the deeper you go into case the more reach the processes have the more nearly perfect your basic auditing must be flubs impinge to the same degree that the auditing does at levels 0 and i the auditor isnt impinging very much hence his flubs dont impinge much either at level ii with repetitive processing there is more impingement and less tolerance of flubs at level iii you are using the meter to reach deeper than the pcs unaided itsa here we have moved into an area where we can get hold of things that the pc wasnt ready to give there is more impingement so the auditing must be better since the flubs impinge more too the greater the charge you are dealing with the greater the bypassed charge can be the meter mines subitsa it increases the impingement of processing there is one thing that always happens when you run somebody above his level and get him into areas that he finds hard to confront you will get more bpc and arc breaky sessions the level of impingement of an error is greater than pc can 432tolerate when the pc is audited above his level so up to level iv the best handling of an arc breaky pc is to reduce his level this certainly doesnt apply at levels v and vi where the bpc comes from wrong goal wrong item or whatever at these upper levels reducing the pcs level will just leave the wrongness and the pc will go into sad effect if you give person wrong goal he will dramatize it more than the right goal this happens consistently in psychoanalysis the only thing you get off psychoanalyzed pc is psychoanalytic computations bunch of bunk invented items wrong goal doesnt asis it beefs up find the persons right goal and he will dramatize is less which makes somewhat goofy test for rightness of goal person tends to dramatize validated error more than genuine aberration someone who has had errors validated also tends to be very careful all the time this comes from some old advice he got you can find the error by finding out what the person is being careful of if you scan someone through his psychoanalysis you will turn on all his old symptoms if you keep it up they will turn off by erasure analysis cured its patients by inventing new evils the id etc it is an alteris negative itsa then analyse and examine things that never existed an auditor can wrongly date somatic then later auditor can date that somatic getting the same wrong date and he can in fact get some improvement of the somatic by getting off some of the charge of the somatics being wrongly dated but he may be deceived into thinking that he has the right date person dramatizes validated error more than an actual aberration that has been contacted if you find that the pc is selling something to you do case analysis 1 find out where he got the idea where he is sitting 2 get his considerations off 3 find out where it really is or whether it is really true the reason why one attacks process errors in upper level processes instead of since midruds is that everything that happened between sessions is sitting on top of the r6 error and it is much quicker to find and correct the error than to do the midruds at level iv you are dealing with service facs assessments etc the pc has to be able to spot and as is his own wrongnesses and overts by that time by level v auditor errors impinge and any piece of bpc left lying around will get restimulated at level vi the amount of charge you are handling ri by ri is huge and ferocious now that the precisely correct commands have been formulated you have gotten away from some arc breaks but if the auditor fails to clear the command it can act as giving the pc wrong goal or item or if the auditor fails to understand what the pc said you can get immense arc breaks for instance the pc said the second ri from the bottom the auditor thought it was the seventh ri that the pc was talking about he asks about the seventh ri to repair it the pc has huge arc break new demands are placed on ones basic auditing as one moves up to higher levels so as he moves up the levels this can make the auditor feel as though he is auditing terribly the division into levels is primarily based on what is demanded of the pc and secondarily on what is demanded of the auditor but the two are almost parallel it is not possible to selfaudit r6 r6 requires the impingement of an auditor calling the items to get the charge off there is point where person becomes total cause over his own mind up to that point an auditor is necessary if you have an arc breaky session you can straighten it out by running ow on the auditor to yourself you are in perfect order to use assisttype processes on your own mind but solo auditing doesnt produce ta action because of the twoterminal nature of the universe in this universe one terminal all by itself is inert thetan has become so enmeshed in this universe that he has taken the physical universe laws to apply to himself there are two things that chain thetan down 1 mass including space energy and time 2 significance since 1950 we have known that someone could either dramatize nuttiness physically or in thought the mass gives you somatics and the significance makes you think that you are nuts gpm contains both thought and mass when you get the right mass and significance aligned with other 433masses and significances it vanishes amazingly enough as the thetan stops creating it it doesnt dissipate into energy although you do get heat it vanishes as nocreate without fireworks if you keep changing only thought and not mass you cannot make change in someones condition you cant handle the mass which is causing eg an illness the levels are approaching the gpm by cleaning up charge on all the locks and ramifications that are hung up on gpms the levels are familiarization with what could blow your head off at the very least the levels familiarize the pc with heavy somatics the auditing cycle is the basic discovery of dianetics and scientology all the way from level 0 to level vi you are using the same auditing cycle this is twopole universe and without an auditor or if you dont use the auditing cycle properly you dont get ta action adequate to case resolution in comm courses the comm cycle does things to people all by itself it is so powerful that by itself it produces results the auditor should recognize it as his main tool it has to be as polished as you have charge that can be bypassed on the case it has to be better and better as the auditor audits higher and higher levels the auditors auditing must be adequate to the level he is running his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing which is creating tone arm action only somewhere in level vii does the auditing cycle cease to be necessary if you havent got an auditor you dont have ta action if you havent got enough charge off your case you wont be able to do anything with it if an auditor is aware that his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing that gets charge off the pcs case because the auditing comm cycle is what makes him an auditor then he also knows that his auditing comm cycle must be adequate for the level he is auditing auditor selfcriticism allows him to see whether it is adequate you have tendency to overcomplicate the auditing comm cycle for the level you are running tr2 is the most important if not the only important tr for raw pc since if you can let someone know that you have heard him that you have really received his comm you could get big result the other trs have to come in as the pc progresses up the levels here is the auditor selfcriticism procedure 1 do normal session 2 record it you should have 1 12 hours of tape with the voices well discernable this is because the auditors error is always earlier than rough spot in the session so you want to be able to listen to good stretch of time 3 as the session goes forward the auditor notes bis in session very carefully meter misbehavior any criticism by the pc dirty needles any worry etc 4 after the session the auditor notices in the session record when in the session the bis dn etc appeared 5 listen to that area 6 go backwards bit by bit few inches at time to find the breakdown of basic auditing that caused the bi or dn this should be few minutes or seconds earlier 7 find what the auditor failed to communicate or carry out 8 do that with every rough spot every noted bi if you follow this procedure you will find the errors and see that you didnt get away with the breakdowns in your auditing cycle although at the time you may have thought that you did you will find that if the pc snaps or snarls there is rough auditing comm cycle just before that pc never has reaction in the session independent of the auditor anything that happens in session good or bad happens with the auditor as cause the auditor is the source of the session 100 lrh found that as he moved up in levels of auditing his auditing had to improve so other auditors can improve too knowing what is wrong one can put it right both with ones auditing cycle and with the pc at the time before the arc break hits youre as good an auditor as you can handle the communication cycle and you are as skilled an auditor as you can choose the right process to put onto the auditing comm cycle 4346402c06 shspec5 comm cycle in auditing the magic of communication is all that makes auditing work if you sat down at onehand electrode emeter you would be amazed at this fact you would get tone arm motion beyond perhaps brief residual flurry at the very start with another auditor you would get 175 ta divisions with yourself you would get two it works this way because the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mass so he is subject to the laws of physics consequently he cant asis much mass he has to have second terminal to discharge the mass or energy against if an auditor thinks he is mest he is apt to get the condition of the pc because he mocks up or envisions the pcs charge in himself making himself matched terminal but that is not what makes auditing work it is all consideration backflow actually hits the auditor the ability to hold position in space or to hold two terminals apart is definition of power in the auditing situation there is an apparent exchange of energy from the pcs point of view which doesnt hit the auditor but because thetans think of themselves as terminals you get an exchange of energy going on nothing hits the auditor and it asises as far as the pc is concerned but you have set up twopole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass that is why there is nothing hitting the auditor the magic of auditing is contained in the comm cycle of auditing you are concerned with the smooth interchange between these two poles which is necessary for as long as the pc considers himself to be matter and therefore considers that he must discharge against something eventually the pc will get up to point where he longer considers himself matter when lot half of the bank is gone the meter will longer read on sneeze when pc cognites that he is not mest the auditor cant knock any energy off and the meter goes dead running r6 the meter only reacts when the pc decides what something is you have to ask the pc if that is it when the pc looks and decides if that is it or not only then does the meter read the pc is advancing away from the automatic physical energy manifestations of the physical universe you get to point where you have intention gpm is just method of limiting the persons ability to intend that is the whole idea behind implanting to foul up intention by fixing it so that every time thetan intends positive he gets negative and vice versa so he cant decide if you talk to person and every time he says yes you say he will get to an indecisional state of mind where he can longer intend yes fully this wears him down it breaks his spirit this is the whole idea behind implanting to get being unable to effectively intend or determine anything successfully he intends to write but something is intending that he not write therefore he cant write all ideas of power of choice self determinism etc stem from the ability to intend something the more enmested someone is the more trouble they have with intention with the twopole arrangement person can be influenced without his knowledge the difficulties of auditing are just the difficulties of the comm cycle you can hit the parts of the comm cycle as buttons the auditor must permit smooth flow between himself and the pc if matter is to be asised by the pc using the comm cycle when you dont permit smooth flow between yourself and the pc as terminals you get noasising of matter part of the trick is knowing what has to be asised but that is matter of technique if the auditor is capable of getting the pc to be willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit particular button in order to get ta action basic auditing and the comm cycle is senior to the technique the fundamental entrance to the case is not in tech but in the comm cycle in case supervision you can look at the points of the comm cycle that are missing in the pcs case and heal those points up there can be the comm cycle between the pc and the auditor and between the pc and the auditing room you can address the pcs comm between himself and the environment by looking at what he is worried about with an unconscious person pick up his hand and have him touch the pillow your arm etc giving the command at the same time you are just getting him in comm with the auditor and his surroundings but now you are into technique communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when the auditor speaks to the pc he is reaching when he ceases to speak he is withdrawing when the pc hears you he is bit withdrawn he reaches towards you with the answer he is in withdraw as he looks for the answer he reaches the answer and reaches the auditor it is communication exchange that asises energy and registers on the emeter meter action occurs in the absence of that exchange namely the comm cycle if the comm cycle isnt in the pc selfaudits and you get case gain and ta 435that is the fundamental discovery of dianetics and scientology it is so simple that everyone has overlooked it because mest is very complex stuff being composed of atoms molecules wavelengths etc it is so complex that nobody can understand it people who are ploughed into matter who think as matter think very complexly they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted they observe none of this the ease with which you can handle comm cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training now all observation should focus on the pc the comm cycle you watch is the pcs the true touch of genius that makes an auditor that can crack any case is the auditors ability to observe the comm cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks this consists of asking question that the pc can answer observing that the pc has completed the answer to it acknowledging the pc and then giving the pc something else to do that is the auditing comm cycle see also p 450 above for an illustration this includes clearing the auditing command so that the pc can answer the question ask the question in such way that the pc can hear it and know whether the pc is answering that question you can tell when the pc is finishedit is piece of knowingness an instinct you should know without having to ask the pc if he is finished then knowing that he is finished you use the acknowledgment to tell him that he has said it using only the right amount of stop to stop that cycle not the whole session then you give him something else to answer when you dont see when he is finished and therefore fail to acknowledge he thinks he is not done and looks for more he even takes up humming if you dont give him something else to answer he will go on automatic he will self audit with ta action the degree of lack of ta action measures the degree of selfaudit that the pc is indulging in get your comm cycle good enough so that you dont have to pay attention to it and give your attention to the comm cycles of the pc spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repairing the basic communication inabilities of the pc and you will be genius you will crack 99 of the cases that walk in for instance the case that goes on and on with his comm you may think that you are acknowledging him but he never gets it it is up to you to get that communication acknowledged so he knows that it is heard or take the pc who takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question and then in that answering doesnt answer it the very smart auditor knows that he would have to do three processes because 1 the pc cannot have an auditing question he didnt answer it so he never got it this gives you the first process what auditing question wouldnt you mind beingshould you be asked 2 since he cant have auditing he is wasting it so after you have comm line going you can run wasting auditing run it as concept since you cant expect such case to recall anything you could use get the idea of you wasting auditing or what could you do here that would waste auditing or what could an auditor do here that would waste auditing and maybe get him to waste communication elementary havingness is the ability to do 3 run who would i have to be to audit you 4 after that perhaps you could work on his memory you would see the whole case change take pc who is sitting there not saying anything find what the pc is doing and dream up something accordingly eg what could you say to you get long comm lag then he says something build it up until youve got him in communication with you then inspect the rest of his comm cycle for other wrongnesses maybe now you have to find out whether he can have an auditor it is what the pc isnt doing that the auditor might be able to get him to do that determines the auditing question if you are alert you will see these little disabilities showing up for instance someone stammers obviously he is having trouble communicating dont ask the pc to do things the pc cant do for instance the auditor asks from where could you view catfish the pc says uh im sorry ive never viewed any catfish the auditor has asked the pc question he couldnt answer he is guilty of not having cleared the question clear questions beforehand to make sure the pc can do it before asking it always respect the pcs saying that there arent any more answers otherwise you give the pc loses your entrance point to the case is where the pc breaks down in his comm cycle with the auditor and with the environment for instance if the pc cant look at the auditor you could run if you looked over here what would or might you see these are the ways you crack cases there are tons of processes that you could use 436suppose you are running scs on pc who you find cant stand still dont ignore the disability take something else to remedy it eg stand stilldont stand still which gets rid of automaticities if the pc knows that he has the disability he can itsa about it because it is real to him but often what the person is worried about is not what he is bugged with you could still trigger the bank and run it out on an automaticity as in dianetics but then you would get pc who gets better and doesnt know about it pcs will run off total automaticity of what is wrong with them and they wont even listen to themselves talk an auditing session is highly artificial but it is only artificial because it approximates to such harsh staggering reality the exact points of contact with beings and existence like lycoming engine in model t ford auditing highlights the exact important points of communication here is capsule version of what is wrong with the mind the only thing really wrong with people is that they have withdrawn from communicating the individual has gone out of contact he has stopped looking the last time he looked there were three sabretooth tigers ready to bite him of course he believes that there are still three sabretooth tigers there he does this throughout enough trilennia and hes got an awful big stack of tigers all of which have left but he doesnt know this fact he cant be sure that they have left person who withdraws from contact with tigers all the time and refuses to contact the area doesnt see whether the tiger is still there or not but keeps mocking it up just to be sure the tigers actually are gone but this individual is in condition of total withdrawal he is safeguarded with automatic bank with automatic beingness valence stands where he ought to be total withdrawal is capsule summary of aberration thetan has as his remedy for safety shortening his reach when he gets to the point of zero reach he inverts it into an inverted withdrawal and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down he comes away from actual reach to zero reach but he still has to reach so he figures out some other way to reach zero of what he is doing always has remedy that is lower so you can get an inversion of an inversion of an inversion of withdrawal this shows up in an auditing session right away in the pcs inability to talk to the auditor about pertinencies so you must remedy his communication by reaching him in order to get him to reach with person who is on compulsive outflow you have to get him there before you can run anything eg by touch that chair you have to have session before you can have technique this is how to get one you use observe and remedy the communication cycle and after you have remedied it notice that it has been remedied note that the pc is now able to communicate with the auditor and notice what else needs to be done sometimes the remedy of the outpoint happens so fast that you are astonished dont overrun it if things are going all right dont remedy them if things are going all wrong find what you can fix up and fix it up if the pc is fully in session you can run almost anything and he will sail but technique by itself will put the pc in session the auditor has to do it 6402c25 shspec6 what auditing is and what it isnt lrh is the first survivor of the battle of the goals plot gpms contain trickery and treachery that is why one hitherto has figured them out routine 3 didnt bite deep even running oppose didnt get much depth of bite when you move it into solve you are beginning to get into dangerous areas the tiger can bite your head off but you cant get back at him in r6 you are handling pure starving tigers for definition of r6 see p 568 above someone who could handle the oppose line easily will find enough aberration to make powerful being unpowerful on the actual gpm line quantitatively and qualitatively the data of this lecture is valuable at all levels but it is vital at levels v and vi it is so simple that you may think that there is nothing there to grasp there is also confusion that blows off as one attempts to grasp it the following is pure piece of data that is incredibly difficult to tr3 over to somebody i am going to tell you 1 the difference between auditing and assessing 2 the difference between destimulating and erasing 3 the difference between ptp and an arc break 4374 the targets of the auditor which are the pc b the bank the auditor speaks either to the pc or to the bank auditing and the auditing cycle is addressed to the pc assessing is addressed to the bank when the auditor talks to the pc he often restimulates the bank he has an influence on it but he is still talking to the pc sometimes during an assessment the pc talks and the auditor must acknowledge the origination but these are separate actions auditing has only two products destimulation and erasure see also pp 486487 above for illustrations of destimulation and erasure or discharge you can get the pc out of it or you can use the pc to wipe it out the first is destimulation the second is erasure destimulation gets the dogs that are barking at the pc to lie down and be quiet and the pc to come away from there auditing wipes out the dogs dont try to erase ptp that requires auditing and ptps prevent auditing you destimulate ptps so that you can audit you can get the pc to dust himself off destimulation or you can use the pc like an ink eraser erasure some auditors specialize in trying to erase everything but never really get anything erased it is ok to erase anything as long as you complete your cycles of action but the lower levels of auditing are practically all destimulation not erasure if an auditor cant destimulate pc he can never take up his own cycle of action because the pcs restimulation takes charge if the pc is elsewhere when you start the session and the cycle of action you will never complete the cycle of action that you start destimulation is the only action that you can undertake to get pc located and oriented dont try to audit when all you should or can be doing is destimulation where did it happen where are you now is destimulation so is prepcheck since an auditor cant complete his cycle of action unless he first destimulates the pc destimulation is very important skill running engrams ris implant gpms etc are all erasure even in destimulation tiny amount of erasure takes place just the pcs attention on the subject for short time brings about erasure of bit of it the fact that certain amount of the incident runs out during destimulation is shown by the fact that pc experiences somatics during assists we just hit the keyin and erase that you can also destimulate something and then run out the incident you could use effort processing or run the engram cf running locks secondaries and engrams on subjects if you do this though complete the cycle of destimulating first or you will leave some attention stuck on what you were destimulating which in the course of destimulating you also restimulated somewhat not completing the destimulation cycle will make it that much harder to erase what you wanted to erase you dont want the pc to come out of destimulation attempt involving mata hari with his feet still all tangled up in silk stockings and old german documents complete cycles of actions once started if you start to erase something erase it dont abandon it in order to go erasing something else in level vi ideally when you get gpm you erase it this is complicated by the fact that that gpm is connected to the one above it and the one below it but you could erase the middle in practice you consider the whole first series of goals one action and erase that or half the first series then the rest of it see below for an explanation of the goals series the heart of certainty is arrival at the end of cycle of action the anatomy of uncertainty is failure to complete cycle of action rapid methods of destimulation are necessary for instance sincemidruds are needed to keep incipient bpc cleaned up and out of the road for the rest of the session life is restimulative the purpose of ruds is destimulation when the pc brings up something that is not in the auditors main line of action the auditor destimulates it and goes back to his main action case analysis is the tech that destimulates unwanted resurgences of case its purpose is handling ptps as they arise the activity of figuring out where gpms fit which has been called case analysis we now call track analysis case analysis is widelevel activity that can be used at any level it is just finding what the pc is sitting in and getting his considerations so while you are working on one gpm if the pc gets his attention on another one destimulate it with case analysis and go back to the first action otherwise leaving him stuck in one mass you let him go to another mass and he will get over restimulated the rule applies to all levels make up your mind about what you are doing and complete your cycle of action 438what is auditing auditing is the action of asking pc question which he can understand and answer getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him for that answer and then also when the person originates auditing involves understanding and handling that origination that is all auditing is it is tr0 1 2 3 and 4 when that occurs ta action occurs and sanity occurs auditing is not assessing auditing may have the purpose of making someone feel better but that has nothing to do with the definition of auditing or with what auditing is the fact that someone feels better after an assessment does not mean that it was auditing therefore from the above definition you cant have selfauditing the technique is scientology but auditing is this one action if you understand the above to apply to all auditing you will be fantastic as an auditor you will find gold at the end of the rainbow nothing is very difficult about getting result if you just do what is in that definition what makes the pc better is not the technique you use it is simply the auditing comm cycle auditing is cycle of action and that twoterminal aspect which is what this physical universe consists of is what gives you tone arm action and is what makes pc better its not technique that makes pc better and it never will be auditing is the carrier wave that handles anything and everything for the pc there is another activity an auditor can do besides auditing assessment auditing goes mainly to the pc assessment never goes to pc it goes to the bank therefore by definition it is not auditing you can never assess pc who thinks that he is being addressed if you are trying to assess and the pc is trying to communicate with you or if he thinks that you are trying to communicate with him you will get messed up when the auditing cycle is out assessment cannot occur in that the pc hasnt understood that it is not an auditing cycle that he is engaged in and he cant just sit there and be assessed he is nervous and restimulated and his mind is darting all over the place even so if you ask the question just where the mind is it reads through all his mental busy work r2h is not really an assessment even though you go down prepared list because you are really asking the pc those questions and setting up 2wc about things that have occurred in the comm cycle if pc gets arc broken during an assessment it is because he has originated something which you havent acknowledged he does not get arc broken because you are assessing sometimes you sandwich auditing in with the assessment but they are still two separate activities the ta action that you get when you find an actual ri occurs when you have an auditing cycle going it does not occur without the auditing cycle an assessment even of correct ri is not what gives ta action it is the auditing comm cycle that gives ta that is why when you ask is that your item you get ta action in the form of big blowdown it is not because the pc contacts the item he is already in the middle of it so on solo auditing the pc would get needle actions but not ta action assessment doesnt give you ta action an arc break assessment is given when the pc has an arc break this assessment list has other uses but the arc break assessment simply consists of assessing the list getting the read and indicating it to the pc during an arc break you must not audit an arc break is when the auditing comm cycle cannot take place it isnt anything else the pc is upset and accusative he wont talk to you if you force comm cycle at that time you will only deepen the arc break at that point you do nothing else but an arc break assessment when you have real arc break you assess it always know your tools so that you can do the right assessment whether it be session arc break or an arc break from the particular action that you are on as long as you are addressing with auditing an area of disability in the pc you will get ta 6403c03 shspec7 auditing and assessment the most complete body of knowledge there is is at class vi it took fantastic amounts of auditing to get it and codify it fortunately it is codified unlike other levels for instance prehav levels are mostly items out of actual gpms or locks thereon you are used to regarding assessment as something you use to find something to audit more recently you have regarded assessment also as way to find the source of an arc break assessment is an activity which is totally independent of auditing as you move up from class iv you find that assessment commingles with auditing arc breaks can occur because of the auditors failure to recognize the difference between assessment and auditing and failing to shift his gears from one to the other or schizophrenically trying to do both at the same time you must keep them separate for 439instance if the pc originates during your assessment you must instantly shift into an auditing cycle to handle it then you return to the assessment assessment is addressed to the pcs bank it is not addressed to the pc when auditing occurs during the assessment it is because the pc got restimulated by something assessed so the pc is now in need of an auditor to duplicate it so that it can asis the auditor must really understand duplicate and acknowledge so that the pc knows that he has been understood all bad assessing where the meter isnt operating properly comes about because the auditor cant shift gears smoothly and rapidly enough between auditing and assessing an auditor can get the idea that assessment is impossible if he has made mistakes in assessing that resulted in the needle tightening up the failure in this case is really an auditing failure eg the auditors inadvertent question of the pc is it all right if we assess this list an auditing question since it has not been fully handled will now get in the way of successful assessment in some cases the question went to the pc an analytical being the pc now expects to answer he may also be insufficiently indoctrinated not to think that he should answer the assessment questions too but if you dont complete the question cycle you tend to direct the rest of the assessment at the pc not the bank now the pc feels as though he should be answering each item assessed you will be assessing through the pcs withheld comm when the auditor starts to assess many pcs go on an automatically withholding state of mind they got into this state of mind because the auditor disobeyed certain tenets eg the rule that when you ask the pc question before you assess you should be sure that the pc has answered it to his satisfaction and that he gets acknowledged and that everything is handled first before you start the assessment and when you have assessed and have gotten an item and you ask the pc is that your item this is an auditing question which may take awhile for the pc to answer you have just put him into the middle of his longstanding whirlpool so dont be amazed if it takes awhile for him to complete the cycle he could be going yeah yeah thats why etc etc etc without having answered the question is it your item assessment must never interrupt the auditing cycle but the auditing cycle may at any time interrupt the assessment therefore the auditing cycle is the senior action that doesnt mean that you necessarily spend more time auditing than assessing in any given session especially in r6 auditing is senior because auditing errors can wreck assessment the auditor has two lines going out one to the pc and one to the bank when these lines cross you get sparks in assessing you might use the form is it which has the form of question but dont expect an answer during the assessment there is one home in the bank dont fool around with entities using questions in assessments can bother pc sometimes it works better to use statements so as not to make the pc think that he should answer you wont get any reaction from the bank if the pc intervenes but you dont want the pc on withhold or decision not to be involved or something that gets in the way the pc has to sit there with his ruds in and co operative assistance and in good comm with the auditor if his bank is to be addressed keep in comm and keep your cycles complete if the pc is in good comm with the auditor you can then address the bank easily therefore the way to put yourself in good comm with the bank is to put yourself in comm with the pc but the pc being in good comm doesnt have to mean that the pc is talking the auditors who assess pcs well are those who are in good comm with the pcs repairing assessments when what is wrong is outcomm will make things far worse it invalidates things found on assessment etc if assessment goes out repair the comm cycle dont just look for bpc in general clean up the comm cycle on any case there is always bpc to be found that doesnt mean that you should spend much time looking for it you could spent lot of time trying to clean the question have i misassigned the bypassed charge because the read you would keep getting is from your assigning the bpc to bank phenomena not session outnesses it could go on reading for twelve hours in the presence of session arc break you can go on finding other bpc continually without the pc feeling any better and you will invalidate and suppress all sorts of auditing work that was done so arc break assessments should begin with is it session arc break is it an r6 arc break or is it an r4 arc break it can be as crude as what list do i use presenttime upsets always seem more important to the pc than past events however tremendous the past events may be never use heavy steel electrodes 440ninetynine percent of your assessment trouble is really auditing cycle trouble assessment errors themselves can be so productive of upset that the fact that there can be another source of arc breaks can easily be ignored even with the comm cycle in perfectly with the auditor and the pc in complete rapport the session can go up in smoke because of an assessment error especially on wrong goal for instance if the pcs item has been bypassed all you should do if the pc arc breaks is to assess dont try to wc it with the pc you must not audit or address remarks to the pc in the presence of an arc break you never ask the pc single question nor do you acknowledge anything the pc says experience has taught that you cannot communicate with somebody who is out of communication dont audit in the presence of an arc break dont ask question dont acknowledge what the pc says you assess if you get confused and go into shock when the pc suddenly throws the cans at you take break that is better than sitting there slackjawed dont stay near the pc dont try to talk to the pc get your wits sorted out find where the arc break started and go assess find the bpc indicate it get back in comm with the pc and go on doing what you were doing the meter will read during an arc break but only on what is causing the arc break if you find some bpc on case arc break list and the pc doesnt go vgis know that there is something else there is session arc break or some different case arc break r2h can be done either as an arc break assessment or as an assessment for bpc where you stay in comm with the pc during the assessment everything from level iv on up depends on accurate assessment so the auditor must be able to shift rapidly and smoothly from assessment to auditing just because r6 is mostly assessing dont think that you can delete auditing from the session if you try you will have disaster you assess when you assess you audit when you audit dont ever do them both at the same time assessing is straight from auditor to bank 6403c05 shspec8 case analysis healing ian tampion audited pcs on tv for the benefit of the victoria legislature at some hearings in australia this is the ultimate tvd the legislators were very interested lrh has started running his goals plot the research activities have left holes in his bank there are about 350 different goals series in sets of 42 since the same things went in over and over if you run one too deeply you can drop through into the next series you also get awful somatics if you do this the goals series are consecutive and it just goes in over and over again with different gpms same line plot same goal series they just go on and on so if you run out one you are convinced that you couldnt possibly have run it out because it is sitting on one of the same gpms of an earlier series so it looks like all the goals are still alive there so if you run one too deep you fall through into an earlier goals series so you can leave bpc by going on to the earlier one which gives you bad somatics youve got 42 goals in series for total of 15000 gpms they get bigger and bigger as you go back early track ris are about the size of mountain if you dont get the first pt series right the pc will go into sad effect of great magnitude with great speed it will take only four or five seconds from where where you found the wrong gpm to start from to the toboggan this can happen because you may well not have completed the current series only some of the 42goal series closest to pt is formed because the current series has not yet been completed therefore it is easy to fall back into the next series also the pt gpm itself is truncated so you can get the first actual goal but it is hard to get the first actual gpm everyone has the same actual line plot in common we learned our lesson well before the track began the consequences of running these gpms out of order and with wrong line plots are pretty horrendous which is why we are not broadly releasing the line plots incidentally there are 2d goals on the actual gpm line plot as far as lrh has been able to tell there are plenty of implant goals on the 2d however case analysis tells you how to become healing wizard and upset the ama man has real tradition of healing there is lot of charlatanism the ama is into plumbing not healing anyway of course doctors are necessary like plumbers they never reveal their stats or not often enough you hear that 600 people have received kidney transplants what you dont hear is that all of them were dead within two years previous attempts to heal overts have consisted of things like calling for 441repentance this is not an adequate process man got healing closely associated with structure and became successful where structure is concerned he knew nothing of disease infection may or may not have to do with bacteria there are too many variables to say for sure the fact that you can see the bugs under microscope is insufficient lrh has found that infection many be the result of gpm healing is done by the body the doctor merely arranged the parts so that they could go back together and hoped that the individual would do the rest until you have solved the problem of how the individual influences his own healing process you can do nothing broadly about healing so the healing professions have tended to be monopolists or frauds the modern medicos and psychiatrists have gone towards monopoly they have also made research lucrative profession but they tend to keep the door shut on real search into healing by others not part of their club authority has become fact in courtrooms we dont communicate with the medicos not so much because they are evil as because they have certain stylized ways of thinking into which we do not fit they use research as way of raising money which is another incomprehensible we would have been incomprehensible anyway because we have gone forward on the basis that there is such thing as truth and that using what we know of it we can help our fellow man our real goals as scientologists are unreal to the public so there has to be bridge we do want some way to bridge in to the fellow on the street healing can be part of the lower part of such bridge because it is real to people freedom from psychosomatic illness is something that we can produce easily at lower levels even though healing isnt our main interest this makes the monopolists attack us the second thing that we need to know about healing is if you are going to heal heal dont heal in order to _______ you would gain great acceptance in community if you worked on that avoiding or handling the attacks of the monopolists and escaping the wrath of the frauds if you do go in for healing someone make sure that you also teach him little and broaden his horizon beyond his goal of getting rid of his lumbosis you do have technology for healing any chronic disease or illness provided that you can read meter and keep the auditing comm cycle going chronic disease is disease that exceeds its expected duration but dont assume that because you can see that someone is sick from something you should heal it to say what someone is suffering from is very adventurous the persons mental mechanisms can bring about and perpetuate virtually anything actually all illness is psychosomatic even broken bones it shows poor judgement to put ones body in position where its bones can be broken after all the genus of psychosomatic illness is in suggestion the hypnotic variety and suggestion comes down to postulation nothing can be suggested to the individual with any effect that he has not earlier postulated himself thus an overt would be to key in something that the person had already postulated for himself the person must have willed the destruction of bodies before he could get his body in bad shape it really isnt what has happened to person that brings about psychosomatic illness it is what the person is willing to have happen eg to another but it is neither possible nor necessary to trace psychosomatic illness back to the individuals basic intention to have it to cure psychosomatic illness though all psychosomatic illnesses are selfcaused and stem from early thetan postulates the keyin of such an illness can be otherdetermined he doesnt have to have keyin to make his postulates come true but when one of his early postulates sometimes mysteriously materializes in the physical universe and he doesnt know anything about it it is necessary for something else around him to key it in he did it himself and knew he did but if it is happening and he doesnt now know that he did it himself it must be the result of keyin hypnotism for instance is merely keyin of persons earlier postulates cf hcob 10aug73 pts handling to keep an environment calm you must be careful of what gets keyed in for instance war environment is restimulative enough to cause the keying in of lot of brutality thetan is unbelievably numerously prepostulated with 15000 gpms each containing 16 ris with locks galore there is lots to be keyed in so when you heal psychosomatics you are not dealing with the thetans basic postulations unless you are auditing at levels v and vi below level v basic postulates are out of reach of the thetan they are neither necessary nor possible to use in handling psychosomatic illness it is fortunate that you dont require them here are the steps in the formation of psychosomatic illness 1 the thetan postulates it ie he postulates that it could be done or that it could happen this was trillenia ago probably 4422 then he did it to someone else 3 then he could and did have it keyed in on himself and he got the experience the keyin could be anything it could be something quite mild symbol for instance step 1would be taken up at level vi if anywhere but trying to handle illness at level vi is too restimulative someone who is sick is probably not up to any part of it and you dont do level vi partially anyway handling step 2 getting the basic overt on the track is equally matter of going way back and is therefore probably impossibly difficult to get at but you can easily handle step 3 picking up the keyin in pt which is some tiny motivator or small overt that keys in the big overt and you can make the person well by using it to cure somebody find the most recent keyin that you can get your hands on or the latest overt on that subject again cf hcob 10aug63 pts handling dont try to heal with heroic methods take care of the keyins even though you know correctly that there is far far more behind it you want the lightest keyin that you can approach by the nature of the case you wont be able to reach that big postulate until the case as whole is up to level vi try to pick up the keyin that is as close to present time as you can get not as far back as you get if the recent keyin is too heavy to confront eg if it is something three lifetimes ago you can even pick up the keyin of the keyin go easy use feather duster the lightest of methods is what succeeds in healing curing bunions is not the same game as restoring to being his full powers but it is useful skill and very lightlylightly one you are not trying to get to basic the heroic measures indulged in by desperate doctors are just physical dramatizations of needless search for basic cutting out the brain to handle things is the effort to arrive at prime postulate dramatized as physical action the mystery is how something can be keyed out but it can and it heals the pc to do so he is likely to get the somatic back when he gets up to level vi but there you will be running it out 6403c09 shspec9 summary of lower levels there has to be bridge between level 0 and level v level v is becoming catchall level of everything necessary before level vi we are in danger of getting up to the esoteric levels of vi and leaving bridge resulting in thirty to forty ots and nothing else someone off the street is in position to recognize any part of an actual gpm scientology progresses on reality the lower levels are the contest of achieving reality you have to achieve reality before you can make anyone better there has to be bridge to clearing its done by gradients the pc must be walked from position of norecognition of reality through recognition of some reality eventually to an ultimate reality by gradients if you skip step in gradient you get an unreality unreality is associated with charge they are the same thing an ri that is too overburdened with charge inval suppress etc will be unrecognizable to the pc matter how obvious it may be to the auditor person with too much charge on his case cant understand or achieve reality he must have reality and understanding to go free understanding is related to reality per the arc triangle therefore understanding is related to charge which you have to get off case first in order to clear it someone who has got lots of charge will do very silly things stupidity comes about from charge ie unreleased unresolved stored masses of energy for this reason you cant get person to solve his problems by mere significance the significances dont enter into it it is persons overcharged environment that makes person too stupid to solve his problems the way out of the problem of not having bridge is to attain consistency of result it breaks an auditors heart for results to vary from pc to pc to get consistent result and to get reliable bridge to clear you have to attack the common denominator of aberration in all pcs not the particular quirks of particular pcs otherwise results wont be consistent and the least common denominator of all aberration is charge if charge is what causes stupidity then obviously what we should attack is charge so the lower levels levels 0 through iv have to be aimed at getting off charge in the absence of any ability on the part of the pc to face the actual source of the charge and erase it we cant get anything but trouble from trying to put the pc into the actual cause of the charge so at the lower levels you dont erase much charge you get the pc out of the charge destimulation is what we must aim for at levels 0iv so that the pc will be moved out of masses of charge we destimulate by attacking keyins we are not trying to get rid of the charge we are trying to pull the 443person out of it the person cant recognize the actual goal until he is separated from the keyins that stupefy him to get the pea under the mattresses ie the bank under the keyins and upsets you have to move the mattresses out of the way another analogy there is drain at the bottom of murky pool the pc cant see it or find it but he can drown trying what you have to do is to clean away most of the water and guck then the pc can find the drain and let the water and muck drain off you have to understand an ri for it to blow since it is thought not the symbols that represent it in english that is why session arc breaks inval or whatever can prevent ris from blowing life is all jammed up for person with ris and gpms the guy with his attention gruesomely and howlingly concentrated on some little tiny piece of mattress ticking see above must be shown that he can do something about the mattresses he can do something about it and he gets big reality and hope factor and his confidence resurges on this basis if he could get his attention off just one piece of mattress ticking for few minutes it would make him feel so different and so interestingly alive compared to how he has felt that now he gets big upsurge in reality and you can get him to tackle lot more youve got gradient in some cases the environment is so charged that the person cant take any attention off of it in this case you have to give the person change of environment to nonrestimulative environment here is an analogy say you have lion tamer faced with four ferocious lions and all he has is weak chair and he is running out of blank cartridges you are trying to interest him in biteproof suit but he cant put any attention on it you have to handle the lions first lion by lion and then sell the overwhelmed trainer the lionproof suit this would be type 3 pts handling the next level up above total overwhelm level i is the person who is so engrossed in his ptps that he is obsessively solving everything solving his pt such person goes around with wild strings of sol5tis i hi1 haadann the time if i do i could and soandso wouldnt and then id and theyd etc his solutions are so pyramided that you dont dare touch any corner of the pyramid or the lot will collapse you can handle this pc by using your lowest level of actual processing with itsa on solutions which takes over the automaticity of it see above on auditing problems and solutions as well as 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions below level ii is the first processing level it contains repetitive processes and objective processes here there is danger of restimulating gpms unless you use only things that are not in actual gpms is there something that isnt in an actual gpm and can therefore be processed with impunity yes nouns and most pronouns some pronouns are in goals but at level ii you are far enough from the gpm that pronouns are generally safe but farther along you had better avoid such pronouns as myself i appears as rare item in gpms also but nobody has goals in the form to be noun nowhere in gpms do you have noun terminals and oppterms there are only nesses ities and tions adjectival and adverbial forms so you can process noun terminals with impunity think of communication would perhaps lead you straight into gpm think of communicator would not that is the missing secret of why the twentieth acc made clears nouns were processed in brackets nouns can only be locks therefore when you process them you get keyouts you would key out actual gpms by keying out locks on ris adding pronoun or noun can make an unsafe process safe what is an actual gpm or an actual ri it is mass with significance that is what you need to know at level iv therefore keyin is and will always be mass with significance almost anything in short that you could think of so masses with significances key in actual gpms which is why an environment is restimulative pt is one huge mass of restimulators present time is haunted area it is not the significance that keys in the gpm or the ri so to key one out you have to get masses plus significances if you have an actual ri with significance and someone keeps throwing the significance at you it will key you in so process like how could you helphow could i help would throw the pc into the ri to make it safe you have to put in help you or so that youve got mass plus significance running masses with significance is important because since masses with significance key in actual gpms running them keys out actual gpms at level i the mass with significance that the pc gets accustomed to is the auditor recall terminal would be good process arc straightwire works because and as long as you have terminal pronoun like someone or something in it and for the same reason you can prepcheck mass that has significance as long as its there and you are running it you can run it in brackets etc at level ii you have the pc do objective processes this fact plus the fact that control communication and 444havingness contain basic laws of life make 8c highlevel workable process the laws of life like control communication and havingness are senior to gpms but it is the wall that makes 8c workable it was the wall which since it was mass with significance had keyed in actual gpms so when you get the pc familiar with the wall the wall keys out and the gpm destimulates the auditing cycle itself is helpful and beneficial as well the auditing cycle is probably the basic process that makes level ii the pcs awareness of the auditor as friendly helpful mass with significance is also destimulative this awareness of the auditor tends to destimulate masses in general for the pc furthermore the auditor is not just mass with significance but also involves hope factor this is twopole universe as bucky fuller once taught lrh in elizabeth nj the twopole nature of communication showed up when lrh tried solo auditing himself on line plot he could go through it but there was ta one terminal gives ta one terminal plus thousandth of terminal gives bit of ta etc the auditor has to be real to the pc for there to be session and ta early on this isnt true so it is up to the auditor to remedy the unreality of the auditor to the pc ie to help the pc to find the auditor reality should increase with auditing new process introverts the pc enough so that at first the auditor is less real to the pc so at first you could get less ta than when the pc gets used to the process early on the pc is so charged up that he has reality on any other terminals and there is terminal for him to discharge against he is mobile standing wave such an only one gets ta since there is one else around charge has accumulated on this pc to the point where other terminal exists he is trapped in the standing wave of noflow this is an animated standing wave that blocks all incoming and outgoing flow the pc is stuck in series of wins or loses he has lost terminal that he could talk to so he solves it by being in continuous communication with that terminal now if people arent that terminal they are nobody or he wasnt in comm with that one either he mustnt be there and he mustnt communicate there are tremendous keyins involved here to get ta we would have to rehabilitate otherterminalism at level ii we would do it with pronouns since we cant assess for terminals at level iii you would assess by observation discussing things on list with the pc and getting all his considerations you dont do much with the assessment this applies to r3sc slow assessment and r2c assessment by dynamics etc along with terminal we get period of time time is very important to the degree that you can destimulate somatic by dating it this works because all restimulation depends on mistake in time the pc thinks that the time something occurred is now his head hurts in 1964 because he got clobbered in 1944 the basic lesson that you are trying to teach about engrams is that the pcs time is awry the only thing that fouls you up in handling an incident by just dating the incident and having it blow is the fact that it has already been wrongly dated eg the pc already wrongly dated it you can find the date of the wrong dating you can find what the wrong date was there can be several wrong dates then you can find the actual date on which the incident occurred in view of the fact that you cannot easily run terminals that have not been accurately assessed we can use this time factor at level iii especially if an assessment has been done by higherlevel auditor to get something to run in problems intensives which involve getting the time of the incident terminals etc problems intensive is explained above and in hcob 9nov6l the problems intensive use of the prior confusion we have made class iv clearing level it is an assessmenttype process to make keyedout clear using prepchecks you use r3 do list of the pcs goals find one that stays in so what if it is an implant goal or wrong goal it stayed in do terminals list for that goal both goal and terminal lists should be short lists listed to clean needle you dont get somatics from wrong goals you get them from right goals that are suppressed or invalidated so you list for the terminal with who or what would have the goal find terminal that is noun then prepcheck it up to point of high level cognition or more ta then do another goals list and find another terminal this cycle repeated will give us clear by keying out the actual gpm keep the goals lists for later on you could use higherclassed auditors to do the assessment steps the only thing that can key in an actual gpm is mass with significance so prepchecking the mass plus significance tends to key out the locks that keep the gpm connected to pt keep it light in agreement with the pcs reality so that you dont get him protesting or invalidating the actual goal 445if you sum up the terminal into service fac you probably have another family of processes to use the terminal was what the pc was using as makeguilty mechanism this is cousin to ow so if the terminal wont prepcheck you could use service fac brackets on it how could you make yourself rightothers wrong about it however it is not likely that you will have to do this you can key out actual gpms actual gpms are keyed in only by masses with significance and oddly enough there will be only one mass with significance in the environment that is really raising the devil with the pc when you get that one you can key him out you can fish him out of the bank so that he can go back and clean up the actual gpms 6403c17 shspec11 the road to perfection lrh has had gamble on time going since january of 1963 the question was could he complete the job before the roof fell in he neglected organizations and scientologists until february of 1964 in order to research full time msh caught the brunt of it august marked the point at which he found out that it could be done the materials were there from then until january of 1964 the material was labelled codified and put together so that it could be communicated at the same time bridge had to be created from the man on the street up to reach for the upper levels one that would be real to the man on the street that was more difficult operation person has to be walked forward with wins at every step that are real to the person so that he will keep going forward and not get discouraged some pcs in fact most pcs cannot have win that amounts to anything at all the tiniest of wins is all that would be tolerable to such person at apathy there is low acceptance level of win eg nothing terrible happened to today would be the highest acceptable level of win to such person so you may have to rehabilitate the pcs ability to have win too for this reason it is more difficult to get someone from level 0 to level iv than to get him from level v on up he has certainty yet it is easier to climb mont blanc with an experienced mountaineer than it is to climb foothill with girl in tight dress and spike heels there is political problem in that we are faced with world that is getting more and more pessimistic and bent on giving people wins the acceptance level of win dwindles away to practically nothing anyway lrh did the job in time so now he is working out organization classification etc basic auditing has been put into good condition it has been rough but it has made seasoned individuals things dont have to be smooth if they are certain giving someone gradient series of wins can be interfered with by his having minor arc breaks and stopping auditing for awhile or there is someone who is openminded win isnt available and you get discouraged and give up seeing that win is available you dont create one dissemination hangs up on this one point the available win you write off someone if you see win available but that is monitored by your acceptance level of win you have to be able to accept level of win that is so low that it is real to the public person the scale of win is gradient scale it is important to anyone trying to get somewhere with scientology it has two sides an outward win of assisting someone and an inward win of being assisted it is win for someone if he assists and lose if he fails to assist based on his intention to assist if an auditor helps pc and the pc doesnt recognize the change in order to feel good about it the auditor must have certainty of observation that requires agreement from the pc that something has been done you have to be able to see and be certain of having seen win in pc whose acceptance of wins is so low that he doesnt know that he has had one your certainty level has got to be high that is an almost impossible level to attain but if you dont attain it you will go into agreement with the pc on acceptability of wins comfort relaxed frame of mind and some serenity about things requires that you know the exact situation and know that it is the exact situation true selfconfidence and poise as opposed to the ability to endure or suffer depends on the ability to conceive the truth of any situation knowing the truth of the existing situation is the only thing that supports selfconfidence most departures from the truth come about as an effort to attain safety and selfsecurity from fear of what might happen to him mans civilization forces lies on him at many points by making telling the truth uncomfortable or even fatal it promulgates the idea that if you said nothing but the truth for 24 hours you would lose everything but if one fails to announce truth one is to that degree protecting lie at this point person begins to surround himself with lies so society brings the individual to tolerate lies it sees virtue in lies it aids lies recognition of the truth is therefore converted into enduring the truth this is downscale mockery of an upscale item 446recognition of the truth in situation is the only way to asis the situation however one can be confronted with so much truth that one cannot asis it and one gets swamped by it this discourages person from recognizing truth also it leads to notis of truth it is lack of gradient that brings person away from recognition of truth and makes him less clearsighted there is gradient and youve got to have one time enters into it since it is part of gradient for instance the french revolution was the result of ramming in couple of major truths too fast political freedom is ok people could be educated to advantage but there was gradient so the french people ended up more debased after the revolution than before the truth of the situation wasnt gradiently recognized or approached there was evolution from darkness to dazzle the true believer has real reality with the truth that he espouses truth requires reality which is the ability to assimilate truth if someone reaches with gradient with reality they wind up with reality on truth it is not ever assimilated assimilation depends on causedistanceeffect on communication and on an even balance of mind affinity while assimilating truth without arc is denied to the individual and can wrong and harm him truth must go hand in glove with understanding if there is understanding truth is not truth to anyone it is just truth all truths are attainable transcendentalism the notion that the truth transcends our ability to understand is lot of baloney there is point in studying the route to truth if you dont know what the truth is studying the truth when one has idea of what the truth is when one has idea of what one is looking for is like looking for memphis without having any idea that there are any towns called memphis or even that there are any towns it is an idiotic activity lets all sit down and study how we can get to gmpsxgrtz and then nobody ever asks what is gmpsxgrtz what do you mean how to get there is it road across space is it measured by time is it spacetime journey that we are making what kind of journey is this to gmpsxgrtz the answer is we11 lets just discuss how to get to gmpsxgrtz the above totally bogs down philosophy kant solved it by saying that you could never find out what gmpsmgrtz is he cut off speculation the work of all current gurus adepts and of lao tze etc is all concerned with how you approach truth with idea of what truth is this is ridiculous lrh performed the flatworm experiment in 1938 and found that memory was transferable in monocell lrh points out that current experimenters in the area will quit soon because their results will shortly get bizarre enough as with the advent of past lives in the wichita foundation so that their appropriations will be cut off since their researches will be too unreal to their money sources we are in an optimum condition with regard to knowing what truth we are trying to approach since we can demonstrate by exteriorization separation between the person and the body we know that we are going towards the free individual we know that our road to truth is the creation of such an individual we know that there is difference in orders of life between man and vegetable we know what truth we are trying to attain everybody has some sympathetic harmonic with that truth what is their reaction to it it depends on their reality on the approach to this truth we know that life is right there where the pc is sitting so to get to truth journey across time and space is not really required the journey consists of undoing the lies by which the person has walled himself in all we have to do to recover the individual and his ability is to undo the turns for the worse that he has taken we are traveling road that has been followed only backwards the way the tao whatever we know what it is it is the road that the individual has followed from degree of perfection and beingness and selfness on down to disintegration forgettingness bluntingness until hes in the state you find him in all the auditor has to do is walk him back that road its all there its all metermarked we are taking each lie in turn that landmarked further degradation and undoing it we are recovering the individual and his potential so the road to truth adds up to 1 the individuals potential 2 the situations in which the persons potential got lessened and what has happened to this individual 3 how this individual is related to the rest of the universe 4 what we can do to restore the potential of that person that is all part of the truth truth from the viewpoint of the auditor is what actually happened or the situation that actually exists at any moment in the state of beingness of an individual it is not the ultimate that we are seeking to attain 447it is not something transcendental truth is that which exists the road to truth might be better called the road to perfection or to an ultimate truth truth is usually all hedged up in so many pitches and so many directions that people want you to go so many curves on the line that you cant separate the wheat from the chaff we know where we are going and how to get there what it takes but we have not mastered an estimation of the individuals ability to conceive of truth you may be talking to grocer about scientology but actually you are talking to him about the road to perfection the composition of himself who are you what do you consist of what potentials do you have what potentials have you robbed yourself of where are you going what is life what is your relationship on any dynamic you may be using the word scientology but these are the things you have embarked upon to discuss and the unanswered question is what can he recognize we need to master the estimation of persons ability to assimilate truth it is not hard to overwhump someone with big chunk of truth eg by exteriorizing him you have had the experience of exteriorizing someone and then having him say omigawd im and its it and then two hours later what exteriorization i wasnt exteriorized well possibly something happened but i dont know youve shot the guy momentarily into the rarefied air of being able to see it but he couldnt have it so you can show people things they cant have and thats how you generate an unreality if we had gradient between wog and ot we would soon get very unreal to everybody but ourselves you can show people things they cant have thus generating an unreality the common denominator here is hit with too much truth the individual degrades you hit this guy he exteriorizes bang he says im im spirit i dont have mass body is body im different than it two hours later hes harder to process his ability to win has been exceeded and he has lost it puts you on withhold not to lay the truth before people so lay out the truth but provide the road by having levels of acceptable truths or realities that an individual can attain establish and rehabilitate his ability to win so that eventually he can have truth and that way you wont just throw the person into complete frothing ecstatic worshipping apathy this is the condition of the true believer in the past when people got some truth they built up secrecy about it but the route must exist and must be wide open not cloaked in secrecy training and skill do have to be there but there is other effort at secrecy the main point is to provide gradient scale to get people up to higher reality the route must exist wide open even if 100 of the people dont travel it 6403c19 shspec12 flattening process an auditor can lay aside some basic fact do something else and then wonder why he is having trouble flattening process is such fact there are two aspects to ending process both having to do with what you are doing with the process 1 fixing the pc up so that he can be audited rudiments 2 auditing the pc this gives you two different endings in rudiments you are doing just enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc you dont want any ptp to get in the road of auditing use the ruds kit to brush off pt hassles destimulate the pc and get on with what you started as major cycle not knowing this you will never complete cycle of action on pc you will keep on having to audit outruds never finishing cycle because you dont use tools of destimulation to push the out rud out of your road the other extreme is to abandon prepcheck or some major action because the pc had little cognition about something dont use rudslike whisk broom on major action you dont end off in three minutes with little bitty cog you use the ta and you get action off the area you have to unflatten subject before you can flatten it running all the ta out of it that is mainbodyofthesession auditing mainsession auditing is all done with the ta never as with the rudiments if you use the wrong approach you will get the wrong ending and the pc will go nowhere you have to restimulate the pc to audit him you only leave major actions when the ta is off you dont chicken out and say oh it is seeming bit better now is it fine thats cog so we will end off now flunk auditing by list is like r2h you could use sec check list carefully not impinging on the pc not restimulating anything to audit but that is not the way to handle the body of the session where you 448really want to handle things the approach you use in the ruds is to restimulate nothing so that you can get in and audit something else later auditors who treat bodies of sessions like rudiments damage the pc because they leave processes unflat all sorts of charge will have been left bypassed if this happens the effect of this is dramatic and fastacting in r6 it is less so at lower levels but the long term result is the same you could run what process has been left unflat and get considerable gain what happens if you start prepcheck on one thing and shift to another thing before you finish for one thing the pcs ability to be prepchecked will suffer he will be harder to prepcheck also if you prepcheck with bad comm cycle the tool would get blunted you could even prepcheck prepchecking or prepcheck each prepcheck button the basic reason why prepcheck button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action thetans have bug on continuing they like to see cycles continue that gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe at low level any case is subject to the cycle of action fatalism is total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be the individual is at total effect people are in agreement with the cycle of action but not because it is ultimate truth however it only fades out way up there at higher levels you can widen your timespan and do various odd things with time everybody is used to and in agreement with the cycle of action so it is reality but not truth that you use in auditing violations of it bring about an unreality that is what happens if you start an auditing cycle with pc and dont finish it the pc is parked in the middle of some incompletely asised mass which he carries on into the next process and so on things start looking more and more complicated to the pc as these incomplete cycles stack up freedom is real to him as completing cycle of action so there is both the mass that he hasnt asised and the incompleteness of the cycle the idea of win usually goes along with the cycle of action one wins when one accomplishes something even if it is just the accomplishing of still being there the upper echelon of this comes under intention intention is part of but senior to the comm cycle it has in it every power the thetan has including the power to throw lightning bolts to hold position to make something continue to do away with something strength accomplishment and wit when you are halfshot as thetan when you are pretty bad off but not yet in body when you are pretty gummed up with mass your intention is still quite good enough to intend the emeter across the desk or crayon into the air or the telephone receiver off the cradle the ability to intend is all there is to thetans power all you have to do to weaken thetan is to foul up his intentions which you can do by blunting or giving him loses on his intentions weakness is the only thing that traps the thetan that holds him down etc so the main thing we have to watch in auditing is that we dont weaken the pcs own intention never blunt the pcs own intentions to avoid doing this we must differentiate between the pcs intentions and his bank dramatizations dramatizations are not intended validate the pc not the bank you dont ruin pc by blunting his intentions but you can key in incidents where his intention was blunted if you interrupt cycle of action half way through failure to complete auditing cycles validates the bank and blunts the pcs intentions getting the pcs goals for the session if possible is important in this regard you should at least get them cared for as ruds before getting the body of the session going so that his gis are in and his attention is free so that he has had win in every ptp the pcs intention has been blunted person makes progress when he has ptp because his intentions are blunted he has an intention which something else counters with equal force so that it hangs up in time level v demonstrates this marvellously oppose was the way the power of the thetan was knocked out by taking his goals and intentions and implanting an automatic blunting mechanism the implant gpms themselves oppose each other opposition is the keynote of an implant and it is the only way in which they are aberrative they have too little mass to be really upsetting by themselves it is what has been done to intention that is upsetting children get spoiled not because the get all the want but because they get their reactive intentions validated eg they get rewarded for tantrums and they get their analytical intentions opposed ie the child is not allowed to do what he wants analytically the auditor who only pays attention to pc when he arc breaks is doing the same thing pcs dont turn nasty they get overwhumped by the bank when their own intentions are blunted and the bank dramatizes person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him if you dont so anything about the pcs intentions you get the pcs dramatizations 449the auditors intention is valuable to the session because he is less susceptible than the pc to dramatization in the pcs bank his intention is senior to the pcs but if the pcs intention is neglected it weakens and we get an increased chance of dramatization the pcs analytical intentions are also valuable to the session down deep the pc intends to get freedom and return of power ie return of intention he can now go all the way if he works along certain path the intention for him to arrive is sotto voce in the pc and more explicit in the auditor since the auditor isnt getting distracted by the bank the pc can mix up freedom and escape and not want to confront things person is weak to the degree that he has allowed his intention to be blunted and strong to the degree that his intention is free thetans become worried about and hold back their intentions because they have been convinced that their intentions are out of their control and that they can cause bad effects as result if you asked pc what intentions do you have to keep under wraps you would get roaring automaticity scientology can get ahead partly because people attacking scientology have idea what our intentions are world of wars insanity etc is very unreal to them they think that couldnt be their real intention so they attack nonexistent intentions which is why they come off looking like asses if case is recovering he is really just removing his blunted intentions ie he is removing the obstacles that he has put there or agreed to doingness intention has time added to it therefore it is tied into the cycle of action pure intention doesnt necessarily involve time or cycle of action or space you could make an intention in the past present or future time and space are the result of intention which is senior to them as pc comes downscale to normal levels though his agreement with cycle of action results in the disappearance of his intention out of the cycle of action if you take someone who is having terrible time you can show him cycles of action with shortsessioning cchs etc eventually his own intentions start to free up out of the mestiness of it all the only way the auditor can foul this up is to leave his own cycles of action incomplete if we are going to have wins we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatizations and complete cycles of action by flattening processes within the reality of the process involved and in accordance with how much is there to be flattened if you can get an auditing cycle completed you will get win if you dont you will get lose it is that simple 6403c24 shspec13 international city communication is necessary to stop fights as well as to start them the communications that start fights generally occur over distances that are quite great the distances set up high voltages and the terminals have to shout too loudly so the communication is imperfect great distance in communication enters confusion and misunderstoods they have to shout at each other so they consider that they are mad at each other the leaders have the illusion that they are far enough apart to shoot at each other with impunity one can blow up moscow without destroying washington it is an illusion of security lent by distance but this is longer true none of these national governments can really operate broadly for everyones benefit but they try to go out and influence areas beyond their borders the result is continual brushfire wars eg vietnam where washington and moscow fight by proxy the ultimate result is to bring about dangerous environment in its obsession with defense the government absorbs tax money and spends it on arms so we get economic upset and inflation because of shortage of goods peace doesnt pay literally if money wont buy things it inflates we are told that there are plenty of products in the us but the inflation continues because the us dollar has gone international and there is too little production elsewhere inflation leads to communism and money it leads to slavery because one can keep up with it so everyone therefore has to turn to communism russia however has never succeeded in feeding its own people one reason for this fact is russias defense budget and the large army that they maintain another is the fact that the communistic worker is perpetually on strike because he gets reward for his labor politics has entered into economics where it doesnt belong national degradation results from things like draft laws which put people in choice scene being where they dont want to be and doing things that they dont want to do this leads to apathy the governments are at war not the individual american and russian farmers when in comm get along very well only when depersonalized as soldiers can people act for the organizations of earth 450and slaughter each other the planet is going to blow up or otherwise become very unpleasant unless some changes are made to bring about peace this has been long think this question of how to promote peace ever since egypt in political spheres perhaps impractical but interesting solution is based on the fact that the two sides of the body would perhaps be at war except for the fact that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa so if washington governed the us from moscow and moscow governed russia from washington the chances of war would be immensely reduced advancing the cause of peace pays nobody as things stand now and war does pay the more trouble there is the more importance the political figure has man deifies what causes trouble marie of rumania had very peaceful prosperous government but she didnt get lots of publicity or admiration in the us the war presidents are the ones who get remembered not the peace presidents the common citizen however doesnt make his personal fortune out of such chaos if man is to make any real forward progress he must have peace the only way that government would lay off income tax for instance would be if it werent being faced with demands for military appropriations length of time since the last war determines the state of calm of country the easiest program for international sanity would be one of reducing strife and dissonance in the environment making less threatening environment with less fixation on an unconfrontable future person with future acts weird man is tied to the idea that he lives only once this gives him certain irresponsibility for the area he lives in cf neville chamberlain i bring you peace in our time man wont buy the idea that he will live again there is too much responsibility in this idea to have an effective world peace program the following problems have to be solved 1 the importance of the politician must be maintained he has to keep his importance or he wont support the program 2 continued activity for manufacturers and industry so that the economy wont collapse without war industries 3 shortening of the comm lines among the capitols of the world so that there is greater understanding 4 reduction of individual nations initiatives for waging war 5 reduction of the danger in the environment 6 offering some startling dramatic objective that is very complicated to bring about you need some attractive constructive and hardtoachieve goals the solution would have to be big enough to make the problem of war seem soluble lrh put this together initially as an exercise on capacities of ots one of the things that we have to remember is that we have base called earth we dont want the base any more enturbulated than it has to be nor do we want the base so aware of itself as base that it will resent being one also there are exercises that one should be able to do to improve ones skill they should not be of hostile nature at least towards this planet i am being very vague purposefully so but i think you understand it takes long time to develop technology we have the assets of our technology so our interest in peaceful earth is not only altruistic but also first dynamic interest in its continuance so that our technology can survive earth also has value as base because for one thing it is in nice quiet backwater of the galaxy and likely to be overlooked by others in the galaxy so lrh dreamed up project on which thetans could work together its name became the international city project lrh reached the conclusion that if all the nations capitols were in one geographical area all the major problems mentioned earlier would be solved the governments would be far less prone to go to war they would be close enough to each other to communicate easily there would be false security from distance there would be pleasant social atmosphere with constant parties with heads of states not just diplomats the bombing of such city would become 451rather remote possibility particularly if you never let people who seemed to be angry at each other leave the capitol at the same time this would create problem of long comm line to the home country you would have to prevent the development of new capitol in the home territory by having the comm line go directly to separate states or counties the comm lines from the governments would not go on via to one major city or central point inside their countries but would go to all the states prefects counties or whatever this would also prevent revolution in the home country it would require building lots of comm lines also building the new capitols in new place would take an immense amount of building additionally you would have an international parliament of earth housed in completely bombproof bunker under mountain it would have appropriate representation based on population production etc there would be plenty of politicking to keep the politicians happy the oneworldtogetherness idea is popular one on earth if elementary steps are taken the rest might follow easily one preliminary step would be 1 all governments turn over nuclear weapons and supplies to the immediately 2 have the and all governments select site for and construct an international city preferably in north africa on the mediterranean coast where land reclamation can expand its area and its comm lines can be easily centered 3 persuade all governments to move their capitols to international city complete with heads of governments confesses and parliaments prohibit secondary capitol or even comm relay center within the country itself 4 secure comm lines and command lines from international city to each internal county or state regard each of these counties or states as an autonomous unit under control of the government in international city 5 reorganize the on formula recognizing land area population figures and production value remove all favored nations categories and the exercise of special privileged and the veto by few form the into judiciary division two houses and an executive branch key officials are to be popularly elected within the nations that they represent and by voting by both upper and lower houses for the head of the reform the charter into an instrument specifically engaged in governing the heads of nations and international affairs forbid in the charter all interference with individuals or smaller communities 6 forbid all warlike treaties of mutual assistance 7 create small effective military force for the abolishing all other war facilities 8 persuade international monetary activities to stabilize economics 9 limit what national government should be up to in the we go ahead with this plan on the basis that general agreement among scientologists would push all the individual efforts into coordinated activity so that they would count here is big plan that is sufficiently sloppy so that if it went pretty far awry if everybody were moving in that direction you would have some possibility of attaining the final objective it has good figurefigure value it is sufficiently interesting plan that it would cause lot of conversation it also has kind of lonely individuality in that one else is doing anything at all for world peace it coheres what could be lots of individual actions it is feasible because it doesnt have to be done perfectly to be done ideas from scientology occur and appear in the world to surprising degree so there is more chance of this plan coming to pass than one might think if scientologists were involved in bringing about what amounts to complete political revolution of earth there would be good dissemination in it scientologists would be available to handle personal upsets etc so their influence would get expanded keep the word scientology parked somewhere on the fringes of this thing and we would get monopoly on mental healing within the boundaries of international city 452the main virtue of this plan is that there has been complete void of ideas for world peace and this is an intriguing one it is something which if adopted would certainly make the planet less dangerous it has its liabilities but they are outweighed by its advantages someone could perhaps try to take over the central government and become dictator but this would be pretty hard to do hitler failed to take over the world true the international city arrangement does put all the political control in one place but it also puts into that place lot of wily guys not being able to attain their political objectives by war they will try to attain them by diplomacy and they would welcome the proximity of other capitols and large legislature to lobby in they are not about to give this up for dictatorship they wouldnt cooperate with such dictator what about national revolts well that possibility would be equally apparent to the head of every state in international city and i think he would tend to govern in such way that it wouldnt happen the political government of international city itself would be independent of the it would have enough force to balance any house guards or bodyguards that might be around the product of this city government is the safety and security of individuals in international city it would be kept as itself by being made very profitable not political international city would originally be financed in such way that it itself becomes property which becomes very profitable to some people it doesnt matter who they would consider it governmental responsibility because it is profitable the russians would hate this last bit but then they are always goofing up in that area anyway the way to have calm international city is to make sure that the ownership of the land and property of international city brings in money to small group who sit as council in international city and make sure that things remain nice and peaceful and profitable politics would be involved this makes international city hell of piece of bait for some construction company after it has built its buildings it is going to draw rent on them from here on out member of that construction company is going to sit on the governing board of that city with government over its head and all it has to do is sit there and keep the peace in international city youve put very hard core of very hardheaded guys who want to make awful sure that they keep dragging down the rent you see from the white house you are also splitting up political control if you want to see lousy capital take look at capitol that is owned by the government governments take very bad care of things they own because theres profit in it for anybody our direct public interest in international city would be limited to acting as clearing house for information concerning it overtly it is something for scientologists to support help out on and talk about just like everybody else covertly it is training ground for the budding ot nice exercise for him it becomes very fruitful it gives him something useful to do perhaps the main thing that this plan offers is some hope for people it gives the scientologist town it puts piece of this planet into his hands to be interested in i chose the location i did because it is where the oldest comm lines on the planet were located there is lot of coast and country in the area between tunis and tripoli many old comm lines have gone through that area it should be fun for scientologists and ots it should create fantastic amount of new wealth in desert it is busy its broad fourth dynamic method of dedangerizing the environment as process just saying that feasible plan does exist puts in some hope and to that degree it dedangerizes the environment there is more future in it it is method of disseminating to the heads of nations in one small area all at once we have had trouble with governments recently they have been disrespectful we shouldnt stand for it the way you can really upset government is to move its capitol the fact that you are talking about moving all the earths capitols depowers the nations of earth with regard to scientology even if they agree that it is good thing to do removing the nations capitols from their positions makes the nations weak terminal is as powerful as it can hold its position you are threatening them with not being able to hold their position it puts scientology in position of being of comparable magnitude the governments of earth rather then just being of comparable magnitude to single government since it would be controlling the positions of all the governments of earth they dont know the tech so they couldnt explain the odd feeling that they would get at the idea of moving they dont know that it is very important to hold position if you want power just espousing such plan would lead to shift of relative power between you and the government they would feel as though they were slipping 453if we hold to this as central agreement it will eventually come about it depends for its power on interest there is moneyed group behind this but there is huge vacuum provided that would pick up such people and put them into it but then they are not now ie wont then be in back of it behind it theyre in it we are in back of it 6404c10 shspec14 how to manage course some of the data in this tape is also covered in hcopl 10apr64 scientology courses there are three zones of responsibility in course management 1 providing valuable subject materials scientology now embraces and culminates anything desirable in the fields of religion mysticism spiritualism or mental sciences so we have valuable subject materials 2 organizing and codifying the materials so they are highly effective and comprehensible lrh and msh have figured out the right form and organization of bulletin there are twelve headings 3 instructing the student in those materials to high level of competency and comprehension the largest potential randomity comes in 3 above students need individual handling to clarify their individual misunderstoods there are slow students there are only slow instructors fast course is well instructed slow course is poorly instructed bad course gets bad enrollments if you want full course give wellinstructed course we do have to develop methods of handling students who throw lots of complication and questions into learning the materials the instructors attitude should be very tough and very helpful he should be able to discriminate between student who is genuinely confused and is putting in some arbitrary of his own and student who is merely being an obstructionist the instructor must not be concerned with the students knowledge of inessentials but must be very tough about the students knowledge of essential material examine essentials only dont bother with inessentials instruction is fast to the degree that the instructor gets the essential data through to the student and gets the student off of his concern with bricabrac ill health depends on the broken dramatization of gpm 6404c14 shspec15 the classification and gradation program the classification program applies to auditors for pcs there is the gradation or levels program such program became necessary as it became evident that one was bringing people up the line from reality to higher levels the levels became necessary to bring the general public up the line on gradient what gave auditors trouble was that pcs didnt know anything about what they were doing or where they were going in the west there is tradition of philosophy in practical life the healing tradition is one of failed help since time immemorial members of the public have had nothing but failed help that is what the member of the public compares us to psychiatry etc so people have tradition of treatment healing improvement ability etc there is tradition of selfbetterment our biggest task is to define scientology to people where there is datum to compare it to gradient and common communication ground so they cant get their wits wrapped around scientology the pc just sits there in the midst of confusion getting processed without knowing what processing is so we have to create not only science but also communication eighty percent of untrained people will vanish because they never got out of earlier practices that they didnt like auditors were losing these pcs because of not getting the pcs educated to know what they were in furthermore the auditor in the field was upset about pcs having to take formal course to get up to class iv so there is compromise the pc must get educated as he gets processes but the training is done by the auditor and the pc must pass training requirements lrh proposes checksheet to go before each grade on which the pc will get checked out before going on to the next level the pc learns definitions he gets an idea that there is something here that aligns with his goals the pc failed in his goals long time ago and is in apathy unless someone else helps him going on up to 454level iv the pc would have to be trained on clay table this would never have been possible without line plots and goals plots even now the pc needs good training to understand gpms and to be able to follow commands about them whats more when he gets on up the line he wont be completely ignorant ot there are three routes to getting up the line 1 the pc route 2 the coauditor route 3 the classed professional auditor route on the pc route grade is something pc has that compares with the levels of scientology the pc is not welldisciplined lrh says that he has found it hard to audit someone right off the street or even to get him to answer sensible question such person reinterprets it etc this gets straightened out as he goes up the grades each grade has an ability that the pc attains the pcs conquest of the environment is the index of his grade this gives him measure of his advancement the grades are gradient scale of confront of the environment for instance at level iii the pc is not always dwelling on things that happened in the past he has relative freedom from the past there is difference between hurting and worrying about hurting at level iv the pc has stopped trying to make everybody wrong and himself right thus the levels are defined in terms of abilities regained processing improves confront of the environment so does training training gives the pc something to look forward towards instead of providing merely negative gain book can evaluate for pc without the auditor having to an auditor can process pc up to the class that the auditor is trained to the second route is that of the coauditor on this route person isnt classified but receives certificate as coauditor he may not charge for his processing or call himself professional he has been through the training courses but he hasnt been classified the coauditor can get an hca certificate but not an hpa certificate someone who goes on through the academy and gets classed gets the hpa certificate he has been formally trained examined judged competent to audit pcs etc person can coaudit getting auditing in exchange for auditing sooner or later he will either get up to getting professional class vi auditing or he will get on class vi course at central organization and go up that way the professional or classed auditor gets his training gets his classification and now has some selectivity about his coaudit he probably gets audited by another pro he is likely to get more precise processing this way and any errors would be remedied quickly he would probably get up the levels rapidly furthermore pcs can help him get further trained by getting him more pcs there are points in training that are easily overlooked or forgotten matter how much they are emphasized and stressed these get straightened up when auditors come to saint hill the classifications for auditors are stiffened up changing the original issue to this degree someone can go to the academy and get his certificate but when he wants to be classed he has to be good at that level if someone has certificates up to level iv but classifications he would have to get classed up from class i on tough requirement for actual performance all training and all courses depend on 1 having valuable material or data to impart weve got that in scientology 2 the material must be codified in must be in condition in which it can be imparted to others so that it communicates 3 the material must be instructed because the questions that will arise will be individual to the student instruction consists of handling those questions by showing where the correct answer is the second point is being handled now to clarify codify and simplify the available material down to the necessary amount there are only about thirty operations that cover all of auditing at all levels 455instruction is the most random area since different levels of application and understanding may be demanded of the person being checked out on certain piece of data education should not be merely to keep someone occupied 6404c16 shspec16 auditing by lists the auditor is success as magazine fred hare is the editor one of the goals series has turned out to be nonexistent why does it always take lrh to find these things it puts lot of responsibility on him this puts some extra strain on his case he is currently in zone of overcorrection looking so hard for things wrong that all he finds is invalidation of what is right auditing by list is done at level iii the needle level lower levels are tone arm levels few auditors getting started in auditing are aware of the skill needed for good metering with the needle unlike the ta the needle can be upset by session events although the ta can show if the pc is not getting gain but the process has lot to do with the ta too the needle registers first the session and second the process or reaction of the pc ta is not direct representation of the reaction of the pc to the session the ta does not analyze the session beyond saying whether the pc is getting gain not so the needle which first and foremost registers the session and secondarily registers the process or reaction of the pc the only difficult manifestation of the needle for the auditor to learn to cope with is the dirty needle its source is always the auditor nothing else it traces back to the auditors failure to handle the auditing comm cycle or the larger auditing cycle the absolute of never having the pcs needle dirty is unattainable but it is the auditors reaction that produces the dirty needle by not accepting his answer not acknowledging cutting his comm cycle or whatever level iii is almost totally devoted to needle at this level if you follow the needle you will get ta action and if you dont you wont the pc may have charge on question he may have interest in it if so the needle will not register if you miss seeing the noreaction and give the question again you get read by virtue of the pcs considerations protest or whatever the first reaction of the needle is to the session the second reaction of the needle is to the process or question if the auditor overlooks this the pc goes out of session and the needle will never clean up on the question etc therefore you dont let auditors at level iii assess anything since if they dont realize the readon sessionfirst rule they can foul up arc break assessments repeatedly and worsen the arc break the mark v emeter is beautifully balanced to read maximally on thought and minimally on body motions it reads just below the pcs reality at level where the pc can have reality the meter has greater degree of workability than you will ever need so calls for improvement are passe bad meter wont give you needle response on thought when needle is moving fast you can miss reads because the inertia of the needle prevents manifestation if the needle is quiet it is more sensitive if someone can really handle meter at level iii he will have trouble with assessments at level iv at level iii you have to learn to keep the needle clean by keeping the session good so the session at time gets in the road of the needle reads that you ars getting as you audit cleaning clean causes the pc to go against the session the needle is now not reading his bank it is reading his reaction in the session the auditor must know first that this can happen and second what to do when it does and how it manifests lrh claims to have made all these errors with the additional difficulty of not knowing that they were mistakes any change of pace of the needle is read it will be discoverable by the pc if it read on the meter on level vi there comes time when the pc stops reading well on the meter anyway because he doesnt have much reactive mind left and the pcs postulates in session are what give rocket reads if one has an ability with which one has lots of problems there is reactivity mixed up in it giving problems and taking the power out of the ability getting rid of the reactivity gives person the full scope of his ability the magnitude of his performance is then much greater pc who fears that he will lose his creative ability by getting rid of the bank needs to know this 456at level iii of course there isnt too much of problem the being is mostly reactive and the needle behaves pretty well on reactivity and doesnt get in your face too much on the session somebody can still be upset about the session and sometimes still even read bit on the needle at level iii the reactive read is larger than the analytical read but you have to be able to keep the needle clean by keeping the comm cycle straight and you have to be able to tell when the pc is running right and not in need of sessioncorrecting dont harass the pc when things are going all right and above all dont blame the pc for the strange behavior of the needle be aware that something has happened in the session that is showing up on the needle knowing these data you can do auditing by list auditing by lists has nothing to do with assessment on auditing by lists you are not interested in which level or item of the list reads best you are simply interested in going down the list and making sure that each one in turn is cleaned up if it reads youre not trying to go down list and find one of those levels assessment means reading down list to find which item reads best because that is the item auditing by list is effort to find the item it is just making sure that each question taken up in turn is longer reading which requires reading the question to find out if it reads and then continuing to get answers until the question longer reads noticing that the question is longer reading and passing on to the next differentiation between reads on the list question and session reads caused by the pcs reaction to something going on in session is necessary part of this action so you clean up the right things on the above cf method 3 and 5 list handling what if the needle gives one indication and the pc says something else for instance the pc may say and the meter reads then clean up possible session outnesses with protest inval and cleaning clean then recheck the question this keeps the pc from being invalidated by your insistence on somethings being there these lists by which you are auditing are nothing more than the plusminus misdemeanors and upsets that person could have an auditor should be able to make up list for particular pc only few prepared lists can be done over and over again l1 and l4 are the lists used for auditing by list with the questions asked for broad scope you can alternately clean l1 and l4 and keep getting different areas cleaned up rudiments and prepchecking are in fact kind of auditing by lists level iii is that level where you clean the list if one can get through that then he can assess at level iv you are using list in different way you are looking for the level to use in looking for service fac the reads that you get at level iii are much tinier than what you will get at level vi so dont take little reads at level vi pc who has been arc breaky gets all his bpc cleaned up and will come up shining when audited by list on l1 and l4 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions there are some research maxims standing apart from and monitoring the body of scientology having to do with how you figure it out excalibur was whole bookfull some of these maxims are in dianetics the evolution of science these maxims give the rationale and the how of how you figure it out every once in awhile one of them gives you grip on existence for instance one maxim was take body of knowledge that has produced bad effects and results you move it out and pay further attention to it you can eventually corral the truth by elimination by this approach you use this all the time when analyzing cases you see what didnt work so you dont run the pc on that the reverse maxim doesnt happen to be workable something having been true in one instance doesnt prove that it has any wide workability auditors who dont realize this get stuck in win with some offbeat process or approach and wind up with failures in trying to pilot way through the goals plot when items read one day and not the next when they checked out and then turned out to be something else lrh had datum to cover the situation problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions it is the number of solutions not their complexity that determines the complexity of problem this defeats the idea of the one shot clear beautiful though the dream may be the problem of government must be terribly complex since it has had many many solutions it is not that big solution equals big problem it is that complex problem equals many solutions this could be the situation that you are faced with when pc doesnt respond well to processing it could be that you have complex case on your hands that will only be 457resolved by complexity of processes if persons problem in life has required many solutions then it must be very complex and will require complexity of processes to resolve simple solutions dont work on complex problems you dont resolve all political problems by voting democratic there is another maxim solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem in this context potentials means threats along the dynamics here you are talking about dangerous problem for instance problem that has the potential of knocking out survival along various fronts is big problem you will get defeated if you offer simple solution if person has dangerous problem and you give him simple solution he will reject it problems that are simple dont become dangerous only complex ones do they require complex solutions if this were not the case the person would have solved the problem already problem wouldnt be dangerous if the problem hadnt been allowed to coast along pretty far the proper course of action in handling problem is to find out all aspects of the problem that must be solved there are bound to be some that are not apparent at first find how many solutions will be needed you could look it over by dynamics the procedure is 1 get what the immediate pressure is indicate that there has to be solution 2 get the situation differentiated out into its component problems indicate the necessity for solution for each this takes the confusion out of the situation just getting the guy to sort it out makes him feel better because he can now at least see the area better also you have put the buffer of needed solution in front of every element of it the pc will be half way handled just by that action then you can find solutions on gradient he could start gradiently to see which problem could be solved now this makes level 0 breeze when it is usually rough level 0 is rough because most peoples problems are so big that they dont know they have them they dont look at the importances in their vicinity at all man is in this condition because solutions have been possible simple solutions to complex problems fail the international city idea is good and complicated it has to be because of the size of the problem that it is trying to solve the usual solution vote republican is utterly useless as you go up the levels it may appear that you are confronting more complex problems but actually both problems and solutions become simpler as you go up the levels as you go up you are actually confronted with fewer problems and fewer demanded solutions the psychologist and psychiatrist think that you go down through mans psyche to the bottom they are wrong you are there you have to go up to heightened awareness person on his way up has to get more and aware of kinds of awareness and of existence his only route is up psychiatrists think that you have to go down in mans psyche to get to rockbottom motivations etc through three or four subvolitional layers this is untrue you dont go down in mans psyche you are there there isnt any hidden deep motivation all you have left is the individual and he is motivated you have to go to higher levels this fellow hasnt got an unconscious to be probed he is unconscious the psychiatrists are looking for the wrong thing they are looking for the hidden depths below guys level of awareness those deeper levels of unconsciousness that they are looking for are sitting in the chair right in front of them it is not the recesses that are hidden you cant get the individual further down with drugs etc and learn anything in order to discover anything about the individual youve got to make the individual more aware not make him less aware in order to find out more about him psychiatrists are asking the fireman in ship to help them find the fireman and the fireman having lost his identity and beingness will willingly try to help out by looking for himself you are looking for mans spirit but he is the spirit thetans increasing awareness of his beingness his awareness of existence and the problems and solutions of life are what delineate the seven levels of processing you could draw up the levels just by asking people at various levels what is problem to you if persons awareness of his relationship to existence is increased you can bring about heightened condition of livingness performance ability etc and that is the only way to do it regardless of claims for drug enlightenment or high performance on drugs drugs reduce awareness people can think that they perform better when drunk or drugged that is because they are less aware of their condition the logic that if we became little less conscious we would be lot better off has been extant since the beginning of this universe the final solution to problems has been to become unaware of them the penultimate solution is im doing right the assumption that whatever you are doing is right 458so if someone wants to improve himself he has two courses 1 to become more aware 2 to become less aware and hope that you dont get run over the latter is treacherous it is hoping that everything will be all right hope substitutes for control confront awareness and certainty ill just forget about it and hope that it doesnt bother ill become less aware is the idea for instance women in the 19th century fainted as solution this is like the black panther mechanism only worse because one is not simply ignoring the black panther one is becoming unaware people get somewhat terrified when you reverse the flow on them and get them to confront all the things of which they have become unaware the trick of becoming unaware is that you never actually get there this universe is progress towards less and less awareness its the route to total sleep and the trick is that its so rigged that you never get to sleep the lower you go the more problems youve got because now the littler problems seem bigger becoming unaware of the big problem brought the thetan less power or force it reduced his confront so now he is less able to confront little problems so the little problem now seems as big as the big problem seemed one stage back it seems far more threatening the power and threat of the big problem is vested now in the smaller one there was bigger problem of the same gradient that he had ceased to confront say gale he became unaware of it almost purposely and this put him into confront only of slight wind but the big problem was full of terror so the breeze is full of terror there is the trick of uncovering hidden memories occasionally you can uncover memory by trickery and increase the pcs awareness slightly and he will lose little fear but it doesnt improve his condition much he just shifts to another fear symptom substitution all little fears are irrational and are based on bigger fear freud pointed this out this happens because the individual solves the bigger fear by becoming less aware you can find the bigger fear that caused the lesser fear this is what freud was looking for but you can also throw the pc into the bigger fear and knock him for loop by not bailing him out you mustnt increase persons awareness beyond his ability to confront he has the choice either to cognite or to bolt he is very likely to bolt that is why analysands commit suicide in analysis when they do dont process by reaching into the deeper states to find the fears that motivate this individual there is deeper subconscious for the individual to go into if you exteriorize person without taking off the charge of why he was in his head if you take him out of his head and make him confront problems that he had gone into his head not to have to confront you will find that now you cant get him out again with can opener you can put someone into higher level of awareness he now becomes aware of the problems that he has not handled this alone makes it necessary for him to progress by gradients you will make it as long as you let him sit down for awhile and enjoy the view he is victim of selfcreated charge great masses of it when he gets more aware he backs off from it you have to take charge off by getting ta action then he can easily move up to where you can get more charge off it is not spectacular activity as the pc moves up the line his problems look bigger but only because he can see more reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions this is the key to processing person at level 0 has dangerous problems and must have complex solutions how do we get around all this the old solution is what he is sick from cures cures cures it is use to solve somebodys problems for him what gets us away from this is that we arent giving people solutions the basic error is the most fundamental part of the problem that can be asised because of the chain of solutions as an auditor you are not giving the pc new solutions for his livingness you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist in the form of problems youre asising what has been solved in the past and caused the person to become more unaware youre asising old problems you are asising past solvents you are backtracking the way he came down running solutions is running yesterdays problems you are taking out the old think that made him drop doing and be unaware on r1c and r1cm this is r1c with the meter you follow the bd after you complete the cycle of action you were on see p 623 below you are backing the pc through yesterdays problems by getting his solutions if you run such thing as problem you are running it below its proper level of awareness here is the trick problem by definition is something that you cant confront and solution is way by which you dont have to confront something so your 459effort to handle the problem is to solve it and if the way in which you solve it is to become less aware of it you have moved into lower awareness levels you are looking at yesterdays solutions whether you are running problems or solutions you are actually running solutions when you ask for problems you are asking for something that the pc couldnt confront when you ask for solutions you are asking for something that the pc could confront running problems requires you to confront only the pcs noconfront therefore you dont run problems you run solutions which latter really are problems but which can be confronted its the difference between running noconfront and confront though you are actually running the same thing from different point of view if you call them problems then you are saying the individual couldnt confront them if you call them solutions then you are saying he could so when you run solutions you get rid of the problems that he sets up to avoid confronting things by backtracking his solutions when you do this the pc becomes more aware and more capable of confronting up to the point where he can confront the problems that made him decide to become unaware in the first place and he finds that those in turn were solutions so he finds out what that was solution for etc and he is all set to move on out to freedom this way out is route 2 this principle holds true all the way up gpms were very complex solutions which must have had complex problems behind them the main problem was an unwillingness to confront so you dont ask the pc to confront it all at once you do it gradiently that is why levels are there they are there on the basis that the individual at any given time is at his lowest level of awareness you bring him up from there not down you reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions youve got to walk him back up into further awareness for him to hold his own in the environment he has now entered that is how to process someone that is why manic sometimes turns on where the pc gets boosted up bit too high for him at particular time so realize that you are getting off the charge that debars the individual from confronting the problems that he has the most complex being you will confront is the lowestlevel pc if you reduce the complexity of the problem by asising yesterdays complex solutions you can get charge off and the pc can act better now because his awareness level came up when you first ask for datum you wont get it but you will get off charge then when you ask for the datum again since you have gotten charge off the area you will get it this is how processing works the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses and the road out is successive awarenesses he got himself into trouble by solving himself into trouble there are lower levels of awareness for you to explore there are only upper levels the road out is not spectacular you take the pc out via the road he came in successive unawarenesses undone 6404c28 shspec18 wisdom as an auditor australia is in only one difficulty they have yet to follow an instruction or order scientology is under investigation by the australian government which should beware because when you cut theta comm line you will get an explosion this is because the secret of power is that truth is on theta line power is truth you can extend untruth in certain direction and derive power from it for certain time but what you are really deriving power from is the amount of truth in the situation censorship is cutting of theta line so is failure of the mail interruptions etc government ever survives war you get new regime at least the government that caused or allowed the war cuts the natural beingtobeing comm line and gets thrown out as result the violence of the war is secondary in effect to this the result of cutting the natural thetaline between people the effect of this is obscured because the same being or state may still be there the war itself is temporary the real effects of the war last much longer when the violence recoils upon those who started it this is the mechanism that gives people their almost pathetic belief in retribution you have to cut or interfere with flow before you get much of an explosion as result of flow the cutter of the arc will explode sooner or later the whole auditing cycle is based on this and this is the mechanism that causes the arc break that results from cut comm line this can happen in auditing with rough auditing comm cycle cut theta line in session gives rise to an arc break it is always the auditor who started it and he usually started it much earlier than he would have thought the result is that you get dirty needle then stuck ta then an arc break maybe 1 12 hours after the first auditor mistake if the auditor doesnt realize what he has done he is confused and mystified about where this explosion came from that is 460why the auditor should tape his sessions and find the point where he cut the pcs comm line cut arc line is similar to cut itsa line the comm lag can be an hour which makes it hard to spot the first minor mistake is the starting point which permits further mistakes pc loss of arc etc the auditor can see it coming before the arc break hits his error there is to ignore it and hope it will go away this is the black panther mechanism you can make lot of mistakes but never be dishonest about your mistakes or you become unreal to others the mistake should be handled when the first signs of it show up in looking for the point of cut comm you can find all sorts of bypassed charge you could take someone and treat this as frontrank auditing problem by running when has your arc been cut this cant be run as the only process since it is an outofarc process you could knock pc to smithereens with process like look around here and tell something you could go out of arc with anything similar to that will do someone in because it cuts his comm line right and left look around here and tell something you dont have to have would be killer too the way the psychologist gets in trouble is in not knowing this datum nor the datum that thetan never gives up thetan never gives up he says he does and that fools people but he never really does the way to handle revolutionary is to channel his revolution slightly not to stop him in his tracks with force people get fooled because the guy will say he has given up but this is window dressing if you see nation that cant produce you know that it is composed of people who are unwilling to do or support what they are being required to do or support cf castro there can be communication but if there is reality or affinity and arc returned from people to government you would only get shadow of return flow from the people you can make tremendous number of mistakes but dont be dishonest about them that breeds unreality selfimmolation isnt the answer either complete ignorance results in great bravery and lots of opinions system of education based on noninspection like that of scholasticism results in something like the dark ages it cuts the arc of knowledge part of being wise individual is being able to perceive when and where ones arc is being cut this would be persons ability to exercise wisdom when there is problem with group wisdom consists of discovering what what r and what c is being cut between what terminals you could locate the problem in the group by finding the area of maximal confusion eg the area of maximal number of dispatches and minimal production there must be two terminals where one is trying to flow arc and the other is trying to cut it or both are trying to flow some arc and also cutting it get the terminals involved and find what is being cut by which it could be both locate the cut the cut r and the cut c then unblock the arc all ptps are suspended and nondelivered communications you cant run out ptp by running undelivered communications because the person with the ptp went ahead and solved it which stuck it you cant solve the problem for him and have any beneficial result solving others problems doesnt work witness the poor results obtained in marital counselling give someone hand sure so how do you unravel messedup being you have to find what his arc for his environment is you will find that his c is to nobody it is at people his r is continually changing and full of doubt so it is shot and his is tossup between his hating everybody andor their hating him oneshot very limited process you could use to alter it is what communication have you been unable to deliver this is not repetitive question and it should not refer to the past because the guy wants to do it right now if you keep trying c without r and you spin in because of the incomplete cycle of communication this could have something to do with people getting spun in by prayer they cant locate the terminal god j virgin mary saints etc so all the communications go undelivered how does q and failure to complete cycle of action tie in with cutting arc an incomplete cycle of action causes an undelivered communication which involves cut theta line thus it is inevitable that you will blow up as his auditor i have two different frames of reference by which to look at an auditors auditing one is teaching him how to do it and whether he is doing it the way he should be doing it and the other is what did he do that is making him do it wrong ie 1 what is he doing wrong 4612 what is happening in the session that throws him off so that he errs under the second heading i always assume he knows perfectly how to do it but that something is disturbing him i start looking for something that has gone adrift in his auditing i dont immediately then go into the subject of dressing him up on the subject of drills you have to have two frames of reference critique of his ability to handle preclears and critique of his ability to handle drills if he knows how to do the drill he has fouled up on handling pc it could be as corny as giving the pc an undelivered communication with an rfactor that says we wont cover what we were on last time because we have finished that when the pc had more to say an overt act is the other side of the coin from the undelivered communication it is communication that one didnt want to deliver but did deliver what saves your bacon in auditing is that the overt act is worse than the undelivered communication in terms of aberrative value because you have now perverted the theta line by causing it to deliver harm this really mucks up thetaline our materials are not dramatization of parts of the bank luckily lrh has gone through moments of fear that such things as the tone scale were based on implants or gpms they are not we understand the situation that we are looking at so well that we sometimes err by injecting more into things than are there all the other data about problems are true but problem is still basically an undelivered communication an overt act actually withhold is not problem it is withdrawal from putting out an arc line because you know that you will abuse it it is selfdiscipline to prevent abuse of arc the basic withhold is dont cause harm this is more fundamental than gpms it is complex reason for undelivered communication ow is an undelivered communication the thetan delivered it far too well so he had better not deliver any other comm along that line and he better not have delivered that one look at person with lot of ptps you could say the following about him 1 he is having an awful time for whatever reason because 2 he is braking himself because he might communicate and therefore he is withholding because these are all rationales basically 1 he is in that state 2 he is there because he hasnt delivered communication the arc break process depends on regretted communication the only way you can run an outofarc process is to make it an alternate process with positive side it is then barely workable it doesnt necessarily run well the only difficulties in this universe or out of it are based on these factors what comm arent you delivering because you have delivered lousy comm you may have to approach it through and r but you want to increase c 6404c30 shspec19 effectiveness of processing the australian flap was caused by one pc wern who had psychiatric history and couldnt have passed sec check he got run on level vi material flipped out and went to court the legislature has been investigating upperlevel materials have been appearing in court document has turned up showing collusion and plans for how witnesses should testify the org is ignoring instructions to use the document because of their lawyers advice the lawyer is protecting the government of victoria and cables keep coming through begging for money this has interrupted research it shows what happens when an org goes offpolicy and you cant get orders executed policy has been developed out of past errors when it is ignored errors appear and trouble follows jane kember took two years to put johannesburg back together after they went offpolicy the effectiveness of processing and effective processing is you the auditor bringing about desired effect on the pc that is your one activity this applies also to your activities as an instructor lecturer or just to the way in which you produce an effect on someone you are talking to one can produce an effect through threat of destruction and by destruction that is fifty percent of existence fifty percent of all effects in this universe are produced by force if we study that fifty percent we will find that nearly all mental healing activities drift into it this includes electric shock etc it is the solid form of effect psychiatrists do not realize that they are trying to influence thought they have definition of thought they dont even think that anything is there thinking they are 462trying to influence matter man to them is matter and they are using matter to influence matter they are actually in the field of physics so an auditor runs danger in operating in the remaining fifty percent producing beneficial effects the danger is that the auditor will leave the other fifty percent on automatic and occasionally drift over into it thus everything may be fine for awhile then the auditor suddenly explodes this may be the mechanism of failed help destroy an auditor in blowing up at pc never has and never will have good effect on the pc who provoked it what cures you of doing that is finding on level vi that you did have it all upside down and backwards and that you did actually skip whole code on the pc ultimately you keep to the auditors code for your own good as an auditor since violating it makes auditing much harder taken at random fifty percent of effects would be destructive fortunately by the laws of life it is the other fifty percent that has lasting benefits eradication has to be 100 percent to be effective purity of destruction would be notthereness but destruction doesnt go in that direction it leaves pile of rubble an asising of situation is not looked on as destruction it is seen as constructive beneficial action actually it is an ultimate in the fifty percentdestruction bracket if you want to free someone you dont just blow up the jail he is in and create shambles so the effect that you are trying to produce on the pc is simply to set him free by asising that which is keeping him caged without knocking him around or leaving rubble around it is actually pretty easy to do the way you would leave rubble around would be by giving advice but not asising anything you have launched an otherdetermined action you have set up conflict between two or more other terminals life could be handled by setting it into more violent countermotions as in war this leaves lots of debris those are the mechanics by which life handles its problems ie countermotions terminals vs terminals etc as an auditor you are being asked to decry and put aside the standard dramatizing actions that life is prone to you are asked to assume better more workable discipline you are asked to find out what the problem is what considerations they have had about the problem and what they have done to solve it we find that these are the building blocks of the prison 1 the problem itself 2 what they have said the problem was or what has caused it 3 solutions they have had that is all the cage is built of 1 conceive the problem was there 2 alteris it 3 keep on solving it there doesnt have to have been problem before someone conceived of it since thetan is always capable of postulating then he justifies it assigns it to someone other than himself and makes that person cause and then starts solving the wrong problem he will submerge the problem the solution now becomes problem to him so he solves that one etc etc eventually all he knows about it is that he is unhappy abstracted and cant concentrate that is the prison that he has built as an auditor your art is in asising these bits and pieces rather than adding to them by giving him new solutions if you give the pc command that would asis some problems and you fail to discover that the pc is doing something other than the command you gave him he wont improve you may then change processes still get improvement and end up mad at the pc you would thereby have slipped over into the other fifty percent of effectproduction the only reason why an auditor would start this cycle would be from failing to understand that he is supposed to be knocking out aberration not letting the pc add to it another deficiency in delivering processing to the pc is where the auditor fails to realize that problem has gone green auditor may not know that things blow by asising just by the pcs inspecting things and communicating them to the auditor there could be too little horsepower in the problem for the pc even to cognite it is so insubstantial there is nothing more to it than its isness be on the lookout for the problems having blown on the comm cycle alone before you have chance to handle it the 463new auditor may never realize that this asising is what his training in trs comm cycle etc are for ideally you want the pc to blow by inspection remember on the other hand the auditor can get so used to things blowing fast that he gets shock when something doesnt he has run into one of lifes little problems that instead of floating free has roots problems come in two kinds 1 loose problems 2 problems that have roots some things that worry people dont have deep roots then there are fee subjects and items that are just little flags which turn out to be very deeply anchored indeed and which dont blow dont mistake the one for the other if you do you will get overrun or unflat processes r1cm is r1c with the meter follow the bd after you have completed your cycle of action it is mistake to take up something that has flag that goes all the way to china but gets needle reaction or ta bd only clean rise when it is mentioned although it is something that does bother the pc it may be an obvious condition like the pcs wife leaving him or his lumbosis but the more you talk about it the more trouble you have because as you force the pc into recognition of the reality of that condition you pin him to his most fundamental bank the condition will be something the auditor brought up it is an unreal subject to the pc the only cage that the pc can asis is the one that he is aware of you can force the pc into oddball modifications this is where testing deadends because you can read deeper into the psyche than the pc can asis lrh recounts papiermache incident the pcs head may be made of papiermache and this may be very obvious to the auditor but the auditor must not evaluate for the pc the pc cant asis anything that he isnt aware of and if he is not aware that his head is made out of papier mache and if it doesnt read on the meter dont try to handle it if you do you can restimulate the pc without any hope of destimulating him if it reads on the meter it has potential of being real to the pc the meter has the value of only reading on things that are real to the pc if it doesnt read it is unreal or it is well suppressed you can asis in pc what he has reality on this takes bit of cage away so he can see more and asis more you could do almost anything on pc if you audited him on what he could recognize things he had reality on that is the magical trick everybody has some level of reality on r and c so they can get something out of processes involving arc matter what level the pc is at stick to what is real to the pc look around here and find something thats really real is probably one of the most nebulous commands ever given but the pc walks over and picks up that wire over there and he says that is very very very real i dont know what he means but it means he can recognize wire i dont know what he means i dont even know what he means when he says he can recognize it but it means to for the benefit of just the process itself that he can see it recognize it and direct his attention to it great thats all im asking i dont care what else he means what goes on in the pcs head when he answers that question wow who knows who cares the only time you would care is if the guy was being glib beware of the pc who runs glibly rattling off answers etc it is an automaticity of circuit answering for the person the pc may come up to awareness of somatics that he has had all along learn to look at pc from the viewpoint of what the pc can see the auditors ability to estimate what he has asised is part of his effectiveness in auditing youve got to know what youve already just taken care of and therefore you have to know how it is taken care of it is taken care of by being perceived and asised and thats the only way it is taken care of you ask the pc to look at something you know he can look at he looks at it and he asises it and thats the end product of all auditing it is all very well to have theories about what is wrong with the pc as long as you dont try to get the pc to asis your concept of what is wrong actually the division of the world into the destructive and the constructive is an artificial one at the top of the scale there is only the free since asisness is destruction paradoxically what at lower level is viewed as constructive asising is actually destructive and what at lower level is viewed 464as destructive force suppression is actually constructive in that notisness causes persistence auditing is simple because it evades the complexities of life by undermining them if auditing were solution to life it would have to be as complicated as life fortunately it isnt it is an asising of life 6405c19 shspec20 the pc and getting auditing to work any auditor who is having hard time making auditing work has mystery about how auditing can occur whether he knows it or not he has assigned some value to auditing that is different from and extraneous to the actual value of auditing he looks for something more complicated than what is there if student is having trouble third of the time it will resolve if you ask him why auditing doesnt work and remove that barrier to his understanding of why it does work the session will be unmanageable to the auditor if he has trouble with his comm cycle doesnt understand why auditing works and the pc introduces normal or extreme amounts of randomity into the session with his own outcommcycle as an instructor you have to get as much confusion out of this as possible person who cant get auditing to work is likely to have hidden standards you can ask why doesnt auditing work and why does auditing work and 2wc it person cant understand why it works because he understands why it doesnt work and he is caught in this discussing why auditing doesnt work is not quite auditing because you are taking ta blowdowns on what he has told you and getting him to relate these blowdowns to the question of why auditing doesnt work you are steering him towards cognition that will straighten out his auditing another third of the time you can fix the erring auditor by getting him to discuss help you do rot get him to discuss failed help because you will run into the line plot he may spot some weird stable datum on help that impedes his ability to help or be helped take up whatever bds you get independently and clean them up so he will start using the comm cycle the comm cycle is almost too easy to use as long as the auditors intention towards the pc is good and he is trying to assist the pc the things that make person unable to use the comm cycle are those things that make person believe that he cannot or should not assist pcs who get ta action also have one of these buttons awry so this procedure works well on pcs too the third category is more esoteric it is very interesting it could be called life among the lowly this was the subtitle of uncle toms cabin people who are being hounded by life who are under duress tend to offer up supersympathy and grief at the same time that they are knocking someones head off there is mechanism here by which the lowly hold the lowly down which is pretty vicious it is the poor you mechanism how you he or they were wronged it is the victim syndrome you are victim this is the common denominator of sociology it is why someone can never get out of the slum it is how people get trapped we had this ourselves in the early days of dianetics lrh got away from it seeing that if you cant take responsibility for your own actions if you cant recognize the cause of your own difficulties then you are in trap and will continue in trap forevermore for any war against poverty to be effective it would have to contain an understanding of why people in groups remain poor an individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts you cant get off overts if you cant recognize yourself as cause you cant get out of rat race unless you recognize your overts you keep someone in rat race if you dont let him recognize his overts eg by saying poor you look how you have been wronged you are telling the person that he was incapable of cause you are directing his attention to moments when he was not at cause and pointing out to him that he doesnt cause things they just happen to him you put him into the dwindling spiral and hold him on the bottom of the heap forever by convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wronged anybody you never had chance how does person become obsessed with problem obsessed with problem describes 90 of your pcs they are stuck in some problem via the om sequence they never recognize their own overt in the area so they get stuck in it there are several systems that can be used to unpin them chief among these is the ow system you cant get your hand cut off in buzzsaw without reaching for the buzzsaw and somehow putting yourself in the vicinity of the buzzsaw invented overts as in guilt complex that is just another alteris so watch out for this and be sure that the pc doesnt give you untruths all dwellingness on subject is associated with overts against that subject you cure it with one or 465another version of ow this is something that is part and parcel of life which is senior in its power even to gpms you could be free of gpms and still be subject to the consequences of your overts so it is always safe and indicated to audit ow auditors do this industriously but not always well they can make complete mess of it chopping comm cycles buying trivia as overts having mutual outruds etc the reason tacit consent enters auditing when it does is because of the victim syndrome mentioned above it has entered the session to some degree when this happens there is some thread of poor you youve been wronged in the session if the auditor sits there and buys motivators he is not auditing the pc at cause he is auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better nothing can hold onto thetan if he gets caught he must have grabbed hold and forgotten that he has grabbed hold to be trapped what he grabbed hold with is overts it is his own actual gpms that are holding him if you dont get him to spot his overts you are dramatizing life amongst the lowly the reason why people cannot get out of slums the victim syndrome slums operate on the basis of you cant do anything about it luck is all that can help how you have been wronged etc that is why you see numbers rackets and lucky charms in slums you cant do anything is the message of social welfare labor relations the war on poverty etc thetan basically doesnt want to commit overt acts when he does commit them he pulls himself back and withholds himself how does this affect the auditor who cant audit it is not as simple as they believe that they have been wronged so you have to get their overts off it is that this person has been so wronged that he has longer any concept of an overt the christian ran into this from another angle with the idea of repentance he wanted people to admit guilt which is an inversion people get off false overts in an effort to repent enough this doesnt free them the guilt complex leads to an inversion where the person isnt getting off actual overts but is really bragging about overts that he would never have the guts to commit dont let the pc do this check for untruths if guy is in victim valence you get him to define an overt act and then get him to tell you why it isnt an overt you will get an automaticity there is reality on it as an overt act so you have to follow the reality scale and find something possibly quite mild that he knows and feels is real overt act do this on discussion basis getting why it wasnt an overt act not as an auditing action once you get something the person really considers to have been an overt act you might run out his justifications for having done it see hcob 7ju164 scientology iii and iv justifications and hcob 8ju164 scientology iii and iv more justifications you then proceed on gradient nobody in prison has ever committed crime 6406c09 shspec22 the cycle of action its interpretation on the emeter the most confused maligned area around is the auditor and the cycle of action it is difficult subject because it is all over the gpms it is not natural you scientologists being cut above the naturalness of normality of course see something slightly wrong in the whole idea of time and its forward progress in his auditing lrh found himself in an interesting state looking at zero or absence of time he found it not wholly pleasant because without time there is lot of other stuff missing he had pressure on the face that turned out to be not from something but from utter nothingness there this was very peculiar it was an escape from the timestream which at the same time was more natural than being in the timestream at one time thetan was quite capable of moving back in time to straighten out goofs then he slipped into the time stream and has been moving along with it ever since you therefore have natural antipathy for the idea that time is there or that something has beginning middle and an end because this cycle is an authoritative action laid down by time but you are processing in the physical universe through and across the agreement of the physical universe you are apparently going along with the timestream and processing bank that lays the timestream in with an axe you are trying to resolve subject the bank that is cycles of action to terrible degree mary baker eddy erred by shooting for too high gradient as long as you are processing through mest you must take account of the cycle of action even though it is not true at the highest levels unless you pay attention to this you jam the bank and the pc will get into horrible difficulties high ta etc the proper precise order of things is very important particularly at lower levels of things especially with regard to the bank the bank is fiendishly precise the pc has to come up through confusion to confront this much order one of the keynotes of order and the bank is that things have beginning continue and have an end 466there the cycle of action is violated in the pc the order of his bank is violated and therefore it doesnt asis so the road out follows the cycle of action where the auditor has nothing to do with the cycle of action he has trouble because he has thrown the pc below the fiendish demands of the bank we have found empirically that what you have to do is to parallel the cycle of action there is detriment involved in doing so every time you process pc without paying attention to the cycle of action you are processing the pc against the bank as result the bank will jam which will be manifested on the emeter as high ta and badlyacting needle pc who is not running well has first and foremost violated the cycle of action this is broad enough statement to be fairly meaningless unless you get more details you could also say that the reason case isnt living right is that the cycle of action is being violated there are two ways in which cycle of action can be violated in life 1 too slavish an obedience to it where the individual was out of agreement with it in the first place but is forced to follow it 2 ignoring it all the blessings of the machine age lie in the first zone dont follow cycle of action to the extent of overwhelming someones power of choice oddly enough there is one zone where persons power of choice can be overthrown and he can be improved by following cycle of action repeatedly to point where the person is used to it you will then begin to asis enough bank to compensate for the loss of power of choice that you started with which will when return you could force pc through sop 8c against his power of choice but only so long as you repeated the cycle of action it isnt the persons power of choice that gives him reactivity power of choice and self determinism get imprisoned in reactivity cycle of action is the prison so following and running and running out cycle of action will bring about nothing but freeing of power of choice whether the pc consents to it or not you have the determinism of the thetan his power of choice versus the fiendish cycle of action and precision of the bank and this universe the biggest overwhelm and loss of power of choice in this universe is in time this universe is trap because having started here you inevitably get to there that is an overwhelm because there is nothing that you can do about it the thetan knows that wherever he may be in space at 855 in ten minutes he will be at 905 matter how much he protests you can do something about being moved in space so space is less overwhelming hence movement in space from point to point b is smaller gradient you can approximate the action of time with the cycle of action progress through time is paralleled by the cycle of action it is very close to process you might call make some time this is very funny process you can start the pc at point and move him to point b and have him run into confusion between distance and time he has the illusion of moving through time in doing this drill one differentiates space from time and thus obtains new level of observation and freedom this improves the individuals power of choice at least to the degree that he has increased freedom to observe as person gets out of overwhelm relative to something he can perceive what is happening to it instead of what it is doing to him ow in its essence has never been understood ow is not lesson in morality it is lesson in causality it is really lesson in what power of choice have you exercised in life however it is hard to get someone to admit that he has done something wrong because society tries to get him to restrain admission of overts which is big overwhelm justifications refute the cause of the individual to justify is to state that one had power of choice and therefore not being responsible committed overt in running justifications you are getting the pc to own up to having been cause when you go for overts you are going up against the social mores as the point of overwhelm you just choose this as the point of overwhelm society tries to get the individual to withhold overts in an effort to suppress him in lower level processing youre choosing society as the point of overwhelm of the pc and you are running ow you want the individuals revolts against this overwhelm as an expression of his power of choice some point of agreement with society can be found in the course of running ow that will undo attention from society the mechanism is 1 one does things 4672 one cant own up to them 3 one then gets caved in on because of this you could ask what third dynamic activity have you gone along with weirdly enough this would eventually lead into overt acts the individual gets free to the degree that he can step back and look at the situation when we apply this sort of process to the sixth dynamic we get much more subtle level one that is much less easily perceived freedom from the timestream freedom from the cycle of action time and the cycle of action are so woven into the pc regradless of what level he is at that even your address to the third dynamic junior though it is to the sixth dynamic is involved with the sixth dynamic the pc is shooting someone across space standing on matter in an action across time there is sixth dynamic agreement that is overwhelming this is going on matter what the pc is doing so in processing person if you violate that to an enormous degree by outcyclesofaction the person wont know what it is that is being violated but his tolerance of that violation is terrible there are quits few cycles of action that you could violate one is the auditing comm cycle that is the first one that shows up on meter even on lowlevel pc the dirty needle you get expresses the jamup of energy in the pcs bank because of the violation of that cycle of action there is disagreement with the reactive bank when the cycle of action is violated the meter measures energy manifestations taking place in the pcs bank if the pc has one erg of attention or awareness and you are asking him to confront 8000 gallons of reality he wont be able to do it for instance if you take nonscientologist and tell him that he is the source of all his problems he cant confront it on the other hand if guy has tons of awareness or attention available and you ask him to confront one pint of reality he is going to view it as pretty unimportant just look at the horrible conflict between russia and the us yes well what about it so what when the individuals attention level and the reality to be perceived are more or less balanced cognitions occur you could violate some things which wouldnt be expressed on the meter because they would be above the pcs reality but violating the comm cycle will be real to the pc another cycle of action that you could violate is process cycle of action this one is expressed not on the needle but on the ta so 1 the auditing comm cycle is expressed on the needle 2 process cycle of action is expressed on the tone arm if you get ta motion on something you have found an overwhelm that the pc can potentially get on top of providing that you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm but complete the process cycle if you get ta going on some subject or area and keep on the subject until there is more ta action you have done completed cycle of action on the subject at that point the pc will longer be overwhelmed by the subject if the subject is real to him at all it will register on the ta at least slightly and the pc will be able to overcome the overwhelm that he has experienced in that area he will process to wins as long as you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm on the subject by failing to complete the cycle of action he will object to not being brought through it and the meter will react by freezing up it wont freeze up immediately but it will freeze up as you continue to leave unflat processes behind you can go on past the point where ta action has ceased people dont usually err in this direction more often they take an hour to get the subject in full view and the ta well started and then they quit this goes against both the pcs selfdeterminism and the cycle of action of the bank which is what locks up the ta the trick is to find the point at which ta action ceases if the pc is stuck you can go back through his folder and complete the old cycles of action that were incomplete when you do this the bank will unjam dont ask yourself what will produce ta action on this pc that is an easy question what you should be asking is what has produced ta action process in the direction of arc let the pc tell you about his problems long enough to find something that moves the ta and then get into that with an inarc process or something about solutions always flatten what has moved the ta matter how long ago it happened flatten what you get ta motion on this cycle of action is the only zone or area where you can overwhelm the pcs power of choice 468legitimately dont evaluate for him but finish your cycles of action you can be smooth and slippy about it direct the pcs attention back into the area and run the process to flat point find out what is real to the pc before you start by getting him to itsa on anything and watching for ta eg on the white form if you are having trouble getting ta on new pc and you cant find any unflat processes from his earlier auditing you still want to know what has given ta action if it wasnt an earlier process or something in life suspect immediately that the pc was involved in some other practice analogous to scientology that did get ta but was left unflat now crank up the sensitivity to 128 and ask what other mental practice have you been in and watch the needle like hawk be specific ask all kinds of things and sort out what cycle was incomplete there flatten the earlier practice when you find it get the ta off of it all you have to do if you dont get ta action on the pc is find out what gave him ta action that wasnt completed if he is an old pc suspect not an earlier practice but objectivetype processes when looking over auditing for unflat processes you may find lot of them and have to choose which one to start with in this case you have to be careful especially if you are advising someone else what to audit case supervising where you have less control and ease of observation on the things you check you want to be more certain and take fewer risks under these circumstances and one thing that you can be certain of is that any objective process that gave ta will give ta if it is unflat the objective process is the one thats most likely to have stuck the guy because its right here in the physical universe and its closest to the sixth dynamic subjective processes are the least likely to have hungup ta the pc could have cognited later on subjective process in the course of running something else in advising auditors case supervising give advice that is very downthemiddle and certain and if the auditor tells you that it didnt work find out in what way he failed to take your advice meter manifestations at level vi are different from the level iv ones you are used to ta action taking some time to occur or run out below level li but two to three sessions worth of ta at levels 0iv occurs in ten to fifteen seconds at level vi and thats all the ta action there is to be had you dont even see all the ta action that occurs some of it doesnt go through the meter the ta action flattens fast at higher levels dont overrun the guy you will drag in ta from somewhere else if you do if you let the pc go on and on you will get ta action from the next item or bank which violates the cycle of action all the bank objects to at level vi is overrun the cycle of action being extended beyond its end if you overflatten ta action you get an exaggeration of the dirty needle that looks like small rock slam sharpedged dirty needle tocky needle the dirty needle expresses ta action prevented from being completed the tocky needle results from taking more charge off an item then is really there it expresses the fact that the ta action is all completed if you continue you can finally drive it to stuck needle and stuck ta when you ask am i invalidating correct line up the needle smooths out if you are dealing with the thing that enforces cycle of action on the pc and on life it objects to cycle being overrun it resists created cycle of action that isnt really there if an item has been left charged new item wont read properly until you clean it up suppose you havent left anything charged but the new item is suppressed or something in this case when you look for an earlier charged item the needle will go tocky all the bank objects to at level vi is the cycle of action being extended beyond its proper end the bank raises hell when you create cycle of action that wasnt there the needle will show you that this is happening by getting tocky and you can indicate the overrun and continue to the next cycle 6406c16 shspec23 communication overts and responsibility people who have been in processing for some time can forget the degree to which other people are wrapped up in and in contest with their environments this is the direct key to the case your first job as an auditor is to find out what the pcs environment is you should also be able to recognize that pcs can get down to the level of where their only concern is to handle some problem in their environment this pc is not going to ot just to sigh of relief contest is not necessarily fisticuffs it is just that there are different ways of reacting to the environment at lower levels anything the pc is doing is an effort to handle the environment this effort could even amount to 469catatonia or complete immobility the method is not necessarily smart but down to the lowest rung the person is still in contest with his environment and trying to handle it thetan never gives up the methods he uses are solutions their frailty is so great that you can unsettle them quite easily the more irrational the solution the more easily it is unstabilized it is amazing that this fact hasnt been realized much sooner by earlier practitioners an irrational solution has more points to it therefore it is harder to maintain madman works at staying mad the only requisite to unstabilizing this solution is communication there has to be contact to do it probable reason why earlier practitioners didnt see how easy it was to unsettle the irrational solution was that the first step getting into communication was so difficult person could have so much trouble with this point that he forgets that if he could communicate would be simple to unsettle the aberrated solution psychotherapy parks on the subject of communication therapists get so frantic that their efforts to achieve communication get more and more frantic and brutal culminating eventually in electric shock and prefrontal lobotomies part of the trouble is that the psychotherapists think that they can reach the patient by doing something to his brain gestalt and touchiefeelie therapies satisfy this same need of the therapists to reach the patient in less destructive but equally ineffective way to do anything for person you must be in communication with that person you must be reaching him and receiving comm from him dont assume however that communication solves all communication is necessary but not sufficient condition for helping someone in the lower levels where scientology breaks down it is in the area of effort to communicate to the being that is why the auditor gets weird notions about what he should do to and for the person that is where every psychotherapy breaks down and it is true for scientology too you have to keep acknowledging the pc and giving the next auditing command that is what you have trouble getting across to lower classed auditors and that is why you work on keeping the comm cycle in you are working along communication channel in order to accomplish result with the pc so you must keep the channel in good repair what makes level in scientology is gradient scale of what communication can be entered in upon with the pc for instance at level 0 pc cant yet be talked to once you are reaching the pc and he is responding to you you can take up the goofiest solutions he has for his environment you are trying to alleviate his contest with his environment the fact that he is in contest with his environment barriers communication from his environment person solves his environment by withholding from it he will eventually solve the fact that he is being communicated to from his environment during auditing by moving you out of his environment the pc is having trouble with his environment he is not having trouble with you therefore you cant be part of his environment you are thus longer part of his normal environment hence he will talk to you even if to one else he says there are human beings and i dont want anything to do with them and then there are auditors they are different so the auditor takes on holy proportions this seems to be the real explanation of transference similarly attacks on scientology make scientology supernatural to justify their overts on us scientologists cant be considered normal people or the overts would not be justified the melbourne inquiry goes along this way the organization has taken on supernatural aura if you can reach and talk to people when others cant you will immediately assume some special status with the pc who is aware of this dont bother to deal with this issue with the pc unlike psychoanalysis which dwells on the transference once you have your communication line in use it to handle whatever contests the pc has going with the environment you can use whatever you know of the communication formula to get some communication established then gradiently improve it and move into other processes just getting into comm with the pc is likely to give him some benefits but dont stop with that communication isnt the endall it is merely the channel now you are set up to do something for the case scientology is the only discipline that can uniformly 1 accomplish comm line 2 use it to increase communication and then 3 do something for the individual dont stop when you establish communication even though the mere establishment of comm line is beneficial the pc will look better around you because he is in arc with you so dont forget that he may still be batty around others if you dont do something for the pc you may find that while he is calm and sane in your vicinity he is just as nutty in his environment as ever you may feel that you have cured his battiness when it is only resolved around you so you dont believe him when he talks about how bad life is dont make the mistake of saying ive cured him because i can now talk to him all 470you have done is to set him up to now do something for him communication is the beginning not the end now after establishing communication you must find out what in his environment is dangerous and menacing and what means he is using to combat these elements you shouldnt use problems and solutions too long beyond the opening part of the case or you will restimulate the problems and solutions in his gpms problems and solutions isnt the basis of his activities with his environment at all it is what the pc does to solve his environment that keeps him obsessed and pinnedin against the hostile elements in his environment how do you know that you havent handled the pcs ptp he is going to do something about it so it is not handled that is the biggest index you have so you want to find what the individual is continuously doing in his environment this falls under the heading of ow not problems because the more he does about the problem he is stuck in the more he will be obsessed by it and the more he will be stuck what brings about an undue concentration on subject and conviction that person has tremendous conflict with his environment it is because he doing something about it all the time for instance person who is hung up on the must be doing something to or about the this lifetime persons way of fighting some part of the environment can take innumerable forms he feels that he had better not communicate with the environment because he is going to commit overts he is mucking up his communication with the environment therefore because his communication with the environment is series of overts so therefore he has to not communicate with the environment because it is an overt against the environment so he had better have some kind of wild solution so he wont have to communicate with his environment in summary 1 an individual keeps doing things to solve his environment this doingness amounts to continuous series of overts 2 so the individual considers that his communicating with the environment is an overt 3 therefore he has to stop communicating with the environment 4 so he develops wild solutions so that he wont have to communicate with the environment like not looking this is not at the communication level it is just riding on the comm line the individual has put up screen against tigers so he cant see the tigers he just knows that he has to fight in that direction this may take different forms eg never looking in that direction someone who doesnt look at something has something there that he is doing something to or about he does lowlevel overts because he is afraid that he will do highlevel overts the bank is manufactured in such way that 1 the individual is forced to commit overts 2 he gets in trouble after committing those overts people are kept insane because the bank enforces commitment of overts and insures insanity if the individual does commit overts even if the individual didnt have bank he would get into trouble by committing overts because committing overts violates the communication formula this is above the bank there are two mechanisms above the bank 1 the communication formula cf axiom 51 2 ow that puts the auditor in the driver seat early on because he has two things that are superior to all the aberration that the pc can muster ow is one of the frail spots of auditors you would expect the perpetuators of any trap to talk lot about invasion of privacy and how people should keep their withholds so they seize emeters the most craziness is at the door to sanity auditors reticence in pulling withholds is based on fear of breaking down the communication channel they preserve communication so well that they never do anything with it an auditor can pussyfoot on getting overts from pc because he wants to preserve the comm line but he hasnt done anything with it the fact is that if the pc is pinned into something he must have originated 471something that got him connected to the thing then once he is pinned to it he gets into an obsessive do to straighten it all out this gives him more worries when person is pinned he thinks that he can unpin himself by more doing actually he can unpin himself by stopping obsessive doing anyone can get caught in this mechanism since it is the basic mechanism of entrapment what the individual originally did may not have been intentional but he starts having to do more and more to handle it sometimes the doingness in resisting thing is to blow having failed to handle it so if the person cant leave physically he may for instance get groggy or show people that he shouldnt be allowed to stay around there are innumerable ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically all the way down the neuroticpsychotic spiral for instance if one cannot leave marriage physically one may leave nonphysically complication stems from the number of ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically for instance thetan can make others sorry they didnt let him leave he can appear nasty where he was happy before psychotherapy could be called study of ways of leaving without leaving physically so the sequence is 1 an individual commits overts asserted thereness 2 he commits more overts to get out of previous overts 3 he invents solutions to not leaving asserted notthereness all this occurs on comm channels being on comm line it is resolved by communication ow regretted reach or action and the communication formula are senior to the bank the bank boobytraps this the word withhold is in the bank so you shouldnt use it it is too restimulative and gives false ta ie ta unrelated to discharge by virtue of just moving banks around in running withholds therefore substitute for withhold what the pc didnt say use what havent you said one of the principal factors that you bat your head against in case is the inability of case to admit any action or take any responsibility for action if case can take responsibility for any action ever committed that case has had it thats any act not just an overt act lost soul thats being shredded between the worlds with soundless wail is the person who can take responsibility for any action he has ever done that is where case ceases to be in range of any assistance the case must be able to take some responsibility for some action in order to be salvageable this makes those things that you cant talk to pretty irresponsible doesnt it well they are i can imagine conversation if you could achieve one with spider the utter irresponsibility of any action ever undertaken by the spider would be amazing inability to communicate is an index of irresponsibility as the ability to communicate drops out responsibility for action as factor falls and vice versa they rise and fall together stutterer has some deteriorated area of communication and therefore deteriorated area of responsibility madman is as mad as you cant get into communication with him the biggest problem with the madman is how you can get in comm with him what gradient of comm to use and how you put it to him that you want to find out what part of his environment he can be responsible for you could get in comm with him one way or another he would eventually differentiate you from the rest of the environment then you would have to find out where guy is stuck and what he is stuck in then find what responsibility can he take for his own actions in that zone or area expand that perimeter and you would return his sanity all you are interested in at lower levels is responsibility for own actions or responsibility for lack of actions the real difficulty is the getting into comm and really finding what he would take responsibility for an undercut would be to get done by reason of placement where have you been that you know you have been even though communication is in the bank the formulas of communication are superior to the reactive bank responsibility is also superior to the bank it is the woof and warp of being thetan the questions are can you decide to do something and do it can you be somewhere at will can you be in or out of something on your own determinism the overtmotivator sequence is not an ultimate truth but it goes out as consideration higher than any other consideration it is still truth after other things have become lies before it becomes lie it gives you all levels of processing and cases from level iv on down if youve got those two factors communication and responsibility youve got all lower levels of processing 472there is real reason for you to be in the dark about why you are not making progress with case whatever other factors are present these factors are more present there is one thing that gets in your road someone can have gpm keyed in to such degree that it is driving him round the bend at lower levels you had better leave it alone lrh has tried reading pc list of words that might be causing the condition if one read lrh told the pc that that word was an integral part of the reactive bank that was influencing him and the pc ceased to be obsessively worried this is bit dangerous though if person is glibly telling you what he has done in an area it may be that he is not really taking responsibility for that the rebuttal in this case is to get the pc to explain at length how he has not really done this thing eventually it begins to dawn on him how he did have something to do with it this is an indirect approach to lowerlevel case you cant run it too long because it is an outof arc process at little higher level you could run what reasons did you have for doing that as long as you dont let him get into inventing them 6406c18 shspec24 studying introduction if you cant learn anything you cant find out how to do anything if an auditor cant learn anything he will never know how to audit this is very fundamental but all great successes are built on fundamentals better than fifty percent of scientology consists of the discipline technology and knowhow of application you could give the commands of scientology processes to another group of mental technicians and they would get results failure to duplicate failure to understand failure to apply lrh and reg dreamed up course having to do with business and commerce with scientology applied to them reg executed the course and it has been very successful it is goodwill gesture the only trouble is that everybody tried to get into the act teaching their own courses to the same end reg wasnt worried about others duplicating the course people are aware even with perfect duplicate course that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship even on the copyist this enters enough in the way of an overt or something like this so that he then goes into an obsessive alteris and then it is true that they cant duplicate it professors in universities cause the loss of technology by writing their own books on their subjects instead of teaching the real source material which they alteris there were thirteen heavierthanair methods of flight the fixedwing configuration wasnt necessarily the best though it was one of the easier ones to manufacture the fixedwing system won out the other twelve have lost even though some were more efficient than the one that was easy to do in civilizations it is customary for body of knowledge to come into existence then for some part of it to be duplicated and developed and other parts of the tech to get lost civilizations die out because they lose their technology apart from one gimmick that has nothing to back it up technology gets lost because people cant study civilizations tend to rise to peak then under stress of combat or whatever they lose their technology because one studies it for instance the technology of the british silversmiths got lost when the labor government taxed silver out of existence one problem with study is the amount of false knowledge around if person studied without any judgement of what he was studying or any evaluation of it he would study very poorly study has to do with one thing basically willingness to know in order to study one must first be willing to know without willingness to know you can get systems that add up to knowledge in scientology we have one thing that is not easy to put into texts the discipline of how you do it it is easy to transmit by example and is at least fifty percent of what we are doing this is frailty for the future success of what we are doing it is the most likely thing to get lost what needs to be learned is not the commands of processes it is how to apply them in scientology one is learning the doingness not the processes the processes wont work in the absence of the doingness trs comm cycle metering etc 473lrh decided to learn about study by doing course in photography he had done the course up to the third lesson already and wondered why he stopped there and why he occasionally bogged down eg in the parts about optics and chemistry he realized that he didnt know anything about photography despite having done it since age twelve he realized that he had entered the course in tolerant state of mind willing to learn few gimmicks and he realized that this attitude was incredibly arrogant he had always thought that the trouble he had had with photography was that they kept changing the methods he realized that the basics and fundamentals in the subject which he didnt know had been present in the subject since 1860 at that point knowing that there was something to learn he really started to study from three books in 3 12 years he sped up to eight books in two weeks arrogance and tolerance the attitude that i know all about it but im willing to learn few tricks prevents person from studying lrhs standards of criticism have shifted what he was willing to take pictures of changed utterly he mastered fundamentals and reached position of judgment and opinion on it previously he had had judgment only fixed ideas there is big difference between an opinion and fixed idea or prejudice one has fixed opinions when one lacks understanding of an area in the absence of knowledge judgment becomes fixed ideas lrhs former ideas on photography had not been resulting in finished picture also before this realization he was the victim of external conditions if there was sun he could not take picture after this realization knowing your tools and darkroom tech you are not monitored by conditions around you the breakthrough was there really is something there to learn this is prime condition necessary for study so the first barrier to learning is the consideration that you know all about it and you wont let your certainty that you know be affected by the fact that you are not getting result judgment depends in freedom from fixed opinions and on need to protect yourself from your lack of knowledge in some area judgment is impossible in the presence of fixed opinions to judge one must know what one knows and what one does not know judgment depends on knowledge it is not what person knows it is what he can do an auditors ability to learn then depends first on his willingness to learn i know all there is to know and i get results shows lack of judgment on ones own skill it is silly statement status has lot to do with this one considers he must appear wise or clever or whatever and pretends knowingness to give this appearance but in the presence of genuine knowledge real esteem takes the place of false selfgenerated esteem it comes down to test of what person can do there is argument with competence psychiatry serves as wonderful example of this to be good critic of some area you would have to know what could and what couldnt be done in that area person who already knows something about an area can learn more about it without feeling challenged threatened or insulted by the suggestion that he learn it unlike someone who doesnt know all about it but wants to think that he does the only place our technology might break down is from unwillingness to learn it stemming from the belief that one already knows it all this is one of those stupid fundamentals that stays in because nobody bothers to asis it there is always first lesson to teach basic entry point to learning subject on the subject of study itself this datum is fundamental where you fail in instruction you always omitted the first datum to teach 6406c30 shspec25 cause level ot and the public what is wrong with you is this you are so birddogged onto the glories of ot that you are going to leave the rest of the world suspended between the lower rung of ot and the ground the bottom rung of ot does not sit on the ground there is large gap so there has to be another ladder there the lower ladder could be called cause level person cant vanquish the sun and stars who is having hell of time with his wife we have had the definition of causativeness for long time if you could imagine an expansion of reach from an inverse self notimagined unbelieved self which he cant reach because it aint because he doesnt know he actually sort of has to reach in in order to reach out if you can imagine reach that is this confused that person doesnt even know which direction to go to get it youve got level and 99 of the human beings on the planet 474they are following the pied piper of science the blind alley of science is that man is intelligent meat machine this leaves out the being himself according to this view man is thinking brain nothing more there are two kinds of sciences 1 classification or naming things 2 extrapolative science that derives answers modern science is just classification science eg biology is nothing but classification it doesnt let you learn anything to modern science the science of man is just another classification science when they dont know anything they name everything if you dont know the right name for the nonexistent parts of the brain then you know nothing about the mind they go on the basis that man never creates they try to understand the mind on the basis of the law of conservation of energy ie that nothing is ever created or destroyed from that viewpoint man doesnt make any sense something would have to be done to him before he could do anything to anybody else this isnt true so neither is stimulusresponse theory since man isnt really understandable on the basis of his never creating the stimulusresponse mechanism is likewise untrue after making wrong assumptions about the mind modern science cant understand it so they sweep it aside as an incomprehensible subject the humanities so we just classify and appoint authorities is it and say that it is an unworkable field then the scientologist comes along and says heresy man is not machine hes thetan being weve taken that as our basic assumption because we can demonstrate it this violates the idea that the scientist has that nothing is ever created or destroyed the fact is however that man mocks up his own mind this disagrees with the law of conservation of energy when you say mind the scientist receives brain when you say that you can run out troublesome part of the mind he thinks that it would be easier to cut out part of the brain he has already accepted two falsehoods 1 man is machine 2 man never creates anything you can prove the scientist wrong by getting result on preclear that is difference between us and the humanities form is more important to the nonscientologist than the result they have end results so theyve begun to believe there are end results in the field of the mind you say an end result can occur in the field of the mind you have to follow very exact discipline to get this end result and they dont believe that the end result is more important to us than how you arrive at it they lost interest in end results because they couldnt produce any they couldnt produce any end results because they couldnt accept these basic premises 1 man is being independent of his body 2 he is capable of creating his private universe including his mind complete with mass and spaces we cure leukemia case and the doctors say they couldnt have it must have been misdiagnosed in the first place you ask why couldnt he have had leukemia and the answer is he couldnt have had it because it is incurable ie leukemia is incurable by definition they are trying to protect authority in an unworkable rationale that they themselves down deep know has failed their question is how long can we put up the big bluff all analysts know that they arent getting results to get workable results one must accept two things 1 being is an independent thing that can exist independent of body 2 being is capable of autocreation all by his lonesome by doing this he builds mind persons own universe or his bank is not stuck in his skull but is plastered all over the physical universe the scientific premises about the origin of man require at least as much assumption as our premises about mans nature the life springing from an electrified sea of ammonia bit is at least as bizarre as the virgin mary story science starts assuming that man is an inflow mechanism the reverse is actually true the former assumption wont cure anyone the latter assumption will always if you 475want to help man dont get him to inflow get him to outflow that is why scientists cannot make man well or solve the problems of the mind man is actually an outflow mechanism you solve his problems on the basis of outflow if you want to prove this watch what happens if you run someone on an inflow eg think of motivator this will give you high stuck ta and pc who feels worse and worse sicker and sicker fuzzy and foggy etc actually mans basic action is outflowing and his basic error was an outflow he is restraining himself from outflow because of his experience of causing bad outflows he learned not to outflow so he decided to inflow only then he thought he could only inflow then he caved in we get an end result by operating on this assumption we rehab the ability to outflow and win however society and religion train people to operate on this reverse basis we are really in the line of religion rather than science if science means conservation of energy science has only recently ie in the past hundred years presumed to have anything to do with the field of the mind in spaceopera of course science took over the mind but without comprehension so you got oddball damaging actions however spaceopera science was capable of more damage than modern science our assumptions about the nature of man are violently opposed to the assumptions of science that is the first ladder that you have to jump with people they have to get past the current belief that if you stuff something in the body something beneficial will occur this is something that has confronted us in the past few weeks wi h violence practically one comes to st hill who is low on causativeness since it takes outflow and causativeness to get here out in central organizations or in the world at large you run into more noncommunication than is comfortable if you flee the nonscientology world after standing it for just so long its the level of causation that gets on your nerves it isnt that they dont talk your language its their non communication its the fact that they dont seem to connect with anything people have to be gotten up to recognition of the world around them total introversion has to be changed to slight extroversion before there is any way that they can asis items guy cant go ot until he has been gotten out of his total introversion the grades enable the individual to break through to the environment they get person reaching causative to degree extroverted and able to asis person has to be able to cause slightly at least before he can asis something when person cant asis the bank he is the effect of it small percentage of the level iv coauditors were type b when they started they werent really low on cause but only when they were spoton on the exact item with all ruds in could they asis it these were people who had had fair amount of auditing if you put green pc into gpm even spoton he would do nothing to the gpm the gpm would make him sick you can take type pc who can usually asis anything and if he is underfed run down or underslept so that his body is soaking up energy he will run poorly with packedup meter if someone cant asis his personal problems he wont be able to asis gpm this barriered lovely idea that lrh had which only works on him if he finds himself thinking too hard about something he can always skip down through the endwords and pick out the one that has gotten into restimulation and let it blow down this is bit heroic he thought that you could just take someone at level iv and assess the end words but you cant the meter packs up almost at once when person cannot asis his bank because his cause level is too low he will be the effect of his bank and he will get disappearance of that is worrying him so whatever process you use your whole task is to put the pc more at cause you run ow to raise someones cause level since ow is big barrier to his cause level in that he has done something he regrets and furthermore isnt communicating about it you run ow to raise his certainty of having done not just to asis regretted doingness you will find that it is probably that few of your pcs have been answering the auditing question since while you are looking for something they have done they are looking for an explanation of what happened to them some pcs go plunging madly into the bank searching madly for some answer that explains it all such pcs invent things or give things that they are not sure of in an effort to find the right answer a11 you have to do is be sure the pc is certain that he did the thing without alterises in other words you want an asising of doneness all you want is the answer to your question what have you done not what have you done that is bad antisocial etc i ate breakfast and that is probably why is not an answer to the auditing question as auditor all you have to do is police and make sure the person is certain he did do that it isnt the quality of the deed its just whether or not he has done it just make sure the pc is sure that he did that otherwise ow will not work 476so you build up the persons idea of what he can cause and what he can reach until he can reach the lowest rung of the upper ladder you can convert sop 8c and run it in such way that the pc is sure of doing it distance has to do with reach so on sop 8c you get wider perimeter of what person can reach then on subjective processing you get gradient of what the pc can asis in his mind the object of all lower level processing up to level vi is to raise the cause level of the individual dont expect recognition or appreciation from society around you when they dont even recognize themselves as existing we dont really have opponents except ourselves if we neglect the lower ladder that people need to climb before getting on the ladder to ot ow is the only thing that will key out gpm without the pcs having to pay attention to the gpm this is because ow is senior to the bank and can therefore make keyout clear then you can erase the bank to asis person must have done something promote the idea of raising cause level not so much the idea of going ot people could understand that 6407c02 shspec26 ow modernized and revised there are two stages to auditing 1 get into comm 2 do something for the pc it is notorious that few scientologists will inquire deeply into exactly what someone did this is because in order to do something for someone one must have comm line which is supported or made possible by reality and affinity and where person is too demanding the affinity tends to break down so the auditor doesnt want to break the affinity line hence he never gets into the second stage of processing the one after comm line has been established in which the auditor does something for the pc the pc may feel miraculously better just from having comm line established but the two stages are like walking up to the bus and driving off if you dont drive off you never arrive anywhere any upset the pc has is actually so delicately balanced that once you have gotten in communication with the pc it is easy to do something about the upset batty ideas and doingnesses are particularly easy to get rid of since they are based on very slippery logic you could have the guys case fall apart before your eyes just from your asking what are you doing that is sensible and why is it sensible once your comm line and auditing discipline are perfect so you dont disturb the comm line you can forage around amongst his aberrations to great effect comm line is only valuable to the extent that you can use it to move around in the morass which he calls his ideas if you used the process given above aberration would fall to pieces use perfect discipline to keep in the comm line audit well get your comm cycle in let your cycles of action be completed then you can do something for the pc the discipline of auditing is what makes it possible for you to do something for the pc unlike other therapies that is all it is for in fact this gets you up to the door now you have to go through it the magic of auditing and the difficult part is to get in comm with the pc once you have done that doing something for the pc is very easy since his aberrations are so delicately balanced if you are not in comm with the pc he presents himself as accused by you he justifies himself pc who is in comm with the auditor wont be trying to justify himself and uphold his status you can go out of comm with pc by not doing anything for him you lose the rfactor with the person and you go out of comm process is simply combination of mental mechanisms which when inspected will pass away all auditing is subtractive it consists of asising things on the case you can overaudit by trying to get more ta action from process when you have gotten it all you can underaudit by leaving off before getting all the ta action out it takes only observation of the pc when you have done something for the pc you will have gotten the ta action off the process if you have done something for the pc ta action will cease and it wont stop until then dont do something for the pc after you have already done something for him on particular process or in particular area if you go on in the area you will only restimulate something else in the pc if you are clever you will run process that cyclically runs out of ta and end it there at the end of cycle in r6 you develop sensitivity for when an item is dead and you will leave it if you ask for it one more time you are dead you will get tocky needle and an arc breaky pc at lower levels you can get one thing run out acknowledge it very well and go on using the same process in way which makes it whole new 477minor cycle within your major process cycle auditors who cant do this have to run lots of different processes but they could get much more out of one process if they got slick at directing attention you dont necessarily change the process when the pc has cognited if it is general process that can apply to lots of areas get the cognition out of one area then find another area you dont have to change the process you can just change the subject of the process if you use this approach you have to ask yourself all along have i done something for the pc if you notice that the pcs answers are dodgy recognize that your comm line isnt established some processes such as what could you say to mewhat would you rather not say to do two things at once both getting into comm and doing something for the pc eg by getting off withholds all this is prelude to ow because ow is the greatest comm line wrecker that an auditor has to deal with withhold running is peculiar in that it can put in comm line but it is avoided for fear of breaking down comm line it can get confusing when the same process that puts in the comm line to the pc also does something for the pc this tends to cause confusion in which the difference between putting in comm line and doing something for the pc gets lost ow is senior to the bank that doesnt mean that when the bank is gone you will still have ow it means that ow keys out the bank handled rightly it puts in the comm line but if the auditor permits the pc to sit there with withholds in the session instead of protecting his comm line as is his intention he ends up destroying the comm line by missing the withhold and letting the pc arc break another thing that makes ow dicey is that the word withhold occurs in the bank furthermore withhold is an outofarc process and cannot be run by itself done fortunately does not appear in the bank so you can run donenot done however the common denominator of the bank is done done is high order of lock on all forms of reactivity done to is another part of the bank unless the auditor uses specific name with it that is not in the bank see p 595 above re use of nouns in processes ptp can be created by failure to complete comm cycle method of handling ptps would be to ask the pc at start of session are there any communications you have left incomplete the pc would then rattle off several and not register further on ptps the reason why he hasnt completed the communication is because of the overts he has against what he has the ptp with you never have ptp with something that you dont have an overt on so first ptp is based on or connected to an incomplete comm cycle then to done this follows the pattern of what to do in auditing see p 642 above that is the way the bank stacks up even psychosomatic illness is based on an incomplete communication in extremis you can handle psychosomatic illness as ptp you can handle it nonadventurously with what communication to or about the illness havent you delivered or you can ask what comm havent you completed to the blumjum the more adventurous cycle is the done and notice that you have just got the same cycle as that of auditor to pc establish comm then do something the severity of the illness has nothing to do with the speed of release of it or the difficulty of handling it the what communication hasnt been completed is easy it requires nothing of your auditing discipline but it is the lickandapromise the done takes more skill knowledge and perseverance the session patter could go like this auditor ptp pc yes auditor any comm you havent completed pc blah blah if the ptp is then gone then there is need to continue if the ptp is not gone then get off the pcs overts there are seventeen ways to get off series of overts there are overts in chains recurring withholds 478recurring overts basicbasic of something etc etc you have to ask the proper questions to get the overts suppose the pc keeps giving you the same often minor overt it is part of chain you need to ask the right question and audit by chain you must also be prepared to find overt at the bottom of the chain but man is basically good despite his reactive bank the bank is only composed to make man commit overts which is against his better nature the bank is the perfect trap because having committed the overts the individual wont go on communicating you do not want to talk to people that you have wronged you withhold to prevent further overts that is the fundamental think of man before he goes so far downscale that he dramatizes obsessively what have you done has two branches 1 what have you done that is socially reprehensible and prevents you from communicating with others 2 just having done something both are valid but watch out for the pc using the process to look for an explanation of what has happened to him this pc will give suppositional answers which you dont want he will invent things he hasnt done to get rid of the consequences that he is experiencing he is trying to find good enough overt to explain what is occurring in his life he will often go far backtrack to find it steer this pc back to where he belongs all you want is what he is absolutely certain that he has done so you have to make sure that he is certain he did the thing if the auditor is asking and the pc is doing b the communication factor is out so the auditor wont do something for the pc you might ask what are you quite positive that you have done ow is likely to be the biggest area of recovery for the pc provided the auditor isnt too tender and will steer the pc you have to observe when the pc thinks that it wasnt an overt if the guy gives you something he did as an overt but obviously doesnt feel that it was an overt then you must ask why wasnt this an overt and get itsa then you might ask was this really an overt after all at this point you might get the glee of insanity then you might get long worry about this with ta action eventually he will realize that it was an overt meanwhile you are raising the cause level of the pc you could go into done in numerous other categories however you may fail in trying to direct somebody in these fields 6407c07 shspec27 dissemination lrh took pictures of the circus at the request of its management he projected them on 12 x 12 screen in the ring and had party he told the elephant man who had swelling on his knee how to do touch assist two weeks ago it worked if someone asks you for help do something for him i never tell anybody anything people come to see wherever i go putting practice together has always been mystery to how anybody could miss the only thing an auditor has to solve is the problem of what to live on while he is building practice it could take three to five months get in contact with people join social clubs people listen to you because you seem to know your business dissemination is not problem with lrh because he doesnt make it problem name and reputation dont matter it is what you can do that counts lrh has signed things rene lafayette ken martin kurt von rocken winchester remington colt etc there is easy way to do anything there are some ways that are not as hard as others being pro in any field takes work of one sort or another physical or otherwise you have to invest some of yourself in it you have to know how you are going to use the data you had better know all there is to know about your subject if you hope to be able to solve technical problem that may or may not have been covered in what you have been studying you may find that the problem is actually very simple even though you know that what you are studying is inapplicable to what you are going to be doing go ahead and learn it well if it is part of formal course finish studying it if you are in training because you are liable to find out that its principles do apply after all when you get round 479the corner after you have completed the study make your adaptions put some of yourself in it ask yourself how will i use this stuff how will it apply to study does you good whatever unless you go through this process students in many fields engineering courses economics etc dont consider what application they will put the data to which is one reason they have trouble learning it solutions are evolved not from inspiration but from observation inspection data and familiarity reach and withdraw runs off the barriers that prevent you from observing something you can overdo the studying by spending far too long gathering data this would indicate some defect in getting familiarity with what you are studying to gain knowledge or understanding of something you need to be in touch with it arc u you can get too concentrated on one line and get so withdrawn that you lose touch with other things that is why lrh periodically goes charging off into contact with different areas once in awhile you ought to go look and see how people operate so that they dont get unreal in building practice youve got to work at it but you cant force it out of its own timeframe im not creature of ivory towers i get impatient with sitting at desk snowed under with dispatches thats why we have scientology 6407c09 shspec28 studying data assimilation these are the points to watch in assimilating data 1 nomenclature knowing what word means 2 the subject matter itself arrangement and understanding of the subject matter part of the issue of nomenclature is knowing what definition means we cant use psychiatric terms in scientology because the field of psychiatry has different basis and purpose than ours and their terms have implications that would give utterly unwanted twists to our knowledge if we used them it doesnt matter that they are the authorities an authority in fact is someone who can produce result the world has elected people as authorities on subjects when these people cant do the subjects so if you recognized these authorities you would get all crossed up with fields that had failed and that would enter degree of failure into scientology so we leave their technology and nomenclature alone we get results so we are the authorities the existing terminology is actually false since it is from field that gives result our terminology has evolved and has become fixed on the printed page we have to safeguard what weve got or knowledge gets wiped out we must first try to evolve nomenclature cleverly so that it wont conflict with earlier terms then we must carry it forward as standardized item to maintain constant another responsibility is to avoid developing too many new terms any technical field has specialized terminology they are all snob languages showing superior understanding you dont dare use carnival terminology in front of circus performer when referring to the same thing as one becomes more expert in field and gets more familiar with subject his terminology becomes less formal and serious it becomes more like slang having passed through phase of formal terms we shortcutted this process by leaving out the pompous formal nomenclature stage reverence for nomenclature is symptomatic of being at the novice stage of memorizing the terms knowledge is tremendously dependent on nomenclature this fact is almost never appreciated by teachers and students they are trying to talk and use language that they dont know this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehensible or that they are incapable of understanding it when in fact they just havent grasped the meaning of some symbols being used to designate things or their grasp is fumbly not instantaneous as person goes on studying past point of uncomprehended nomenclature he stacks up the opinion that he doesnt know about it carried on forward from the one term that he didnt totally grasp he thinks he doesnt know or cant know subject when in fact he only doesnt grasp the nomenclature the basic lie that makes incomprehension persist is that it is the subject that is not understood when it is word that is not understood person will develop an automatic comm lag at the point of the nonunderstood word 480he will misassign the lack of understanding to whatever area it appears in comprehension of the nomenclature used is vital in studying anything you put yourself in the soup as soon as you leave one word not understood behind you besides the subject of nomenclature we have the subject matter itself the arrangement and understanding of it ie what is being named one should get very thorough grasp of the thing under discussion person can misunderstand something that he has read because it conflicts with the usual idea or he can even find it unbelievable if you dont agree with something that is true it is either misunderstood or there is button that you are running into when you find something unbelievable be sure you know what you are unbelieving first be sure that you have understood the words used then be sure that you have got the thing the phenomenon right ninety percent of the time you will find that you had something in crosswise in the other ten percent of the cases you can handle it by setting up examples of how it applies to you and to life get examples of how it is that way and how it isnt that way you will generally find then that some button was in the way of your grasping it following this sort of routine you will find yourself able to study former methods of study what few there have been have not been very successful when there is training available about the only reliable method of studying is to read everything you can find on the subject from cover to cover in studying scientology it is imperative to know how to study since we are studying that which we are studying with to classify students as fast or slow or bright or dull is to make false classification since this classification leads to improvement of anyones ability to study there are students who can memorize words and pages virtually at glance but this does not guarantee that they will be able to do anything with what they memorized you can find out by seeing whether they can define the words the direction and end purpose of study is understanding with an unknown word or phenomenon in the middle of subject you will have mystery and nonapplication one of the primary criticisms of modern education is that it doesnt immediately result in application you should be able to take any textbook direction and if you have understood it apply it directly and effectively without familiarity if you also have familiarity as in studying auditing while auditing you should be whiz 6407c15 shspec30 organizational operation your practice as scientologist can carry you into the fields of organization and business your perimeter of action goes out wider than just processing people it includes the economic woof and warp that makes the trap that keeps civilizations interiorized into themselves it includes relationships on dynamics beyond the first dynamic we dont evaluate for the pc however outside of an auditing session advice can be valuable and nonevaluative the individual has eight dynamics you can handle his first dynamic in auditing but he has stresses and impacts reaching him from the second third and other dynamics only two things give you trouble 1 significance 2 mass when someone cant confront mass he goes into significance figurefigure etc and sometimes but not necessarily handling mass is substitute activity for one unable to handle significances also some people who can handle mass very well cant think but there is reason why someone cant do both occupationally person could be in position where he mainly handles one or the other and considers that he mustnt do the other or that he cant society tells you that you mustnt confront certain things if you accept this dictum you can find yourself up some blind alley someplace when life offers person reward he will lose interest in playing the game anymore destruction of reward factor is more contributive to psychosis than punishment 481you could have conflict between fourth dynamics if terrans came into conflict with another race of beings the fifth dynamic tends to be out of comm with people so does the sixth man finds the seventh dynamic unreal one this planet the eighth dynamic is the subject of nuttiness up the line the common denominator is understanding and communication the only reason why you have trouble inside dynamic or one dynamic against another is lack of communication and understanding with it or of it the less communication and understanding is feasible the more trouble you would have in doing something with it the reward and punishment factors are out to the degree that the communication or understanding is out the english and germans keep having wars because of differences in culture slight those these differences are understanding can exist even in the absence of significant communication on the fifth dynamic or at least between men and the fifth dynamic there is not much mutual understanding within the fifth dynamic there is lot of mutual warfare this doesnt mean that the law of the jungle is senior or the only one operating there are also assistive factors in the fifth dynamic points of high understanding as in symbiosis we are in the field of looking over the dynamics and finding out how far communication is out and how far understanding is out the easiest way to square somebody around in life is to process him however sometimes you have to start out by approaching person with advice before he will even get processing you can advise someone who is going to get processed to move out of his normal environment for week and so on you may have to give him very complicated advice to match the complexity of his problems as you move up into dynamics besides the first you may find that you have things to handle that you cant handle by getting all involved into processing when you depart from handling first dynamic practically speaking you have advice or instruction as the main activity instruction is more directed advice you use this on the upper seven dynamics so training instilling cultural patterns etc becomes part of scientologists activities advice is casual undirected instruction basically it is what you use everywhere but on the first dynamic when people ask for advice go ahead and evaluate if advice is all you can get them to have it would be irresponsible not to give advice if the person cant get some processing within the reality youve got and the data youve got give the best and least partisan advice you can you only get into trouble when you move away from being pan determined in the advice you give or for that matter in whom you will process remember though that advice that isnt partisan is unacceptable do give advice but dont spend whole lot of time mulling it over just dont pretend to be completely detached if guy wants you to get mad at his motherinlaw you dont have to but you dont have to pretend that you are detached and part of the conflict either bleaugh look interested and give advice you can offer advice urging communication if that is not accepted realize that you dont know much about the situation and you might as well give the person something that he can and will apply and do estimate the degree of understanding that can occur in the situation and advise that presumably this would also apply to communication dont assume that you know very much about the situation or that you can give him the perfect solution if you had the perfect solution the person wouldnt take it he would only take as much as he could apply so give him what he can apply and do the equation is what is the best advice you can give him that will be taken when you know that person will take particular piece of advice put pressure on and put in the hope factor advice is anything that you can deal off the cuff that the person can do that is more beneficial to him than what he is doing the point is handle it you can do lot besides processing person hunt and punch around for what he will accept dont assume that everything you are told is true and dont get partisan the advice you give can be slightly destructive just dont give advice that is widely destructive 1 try to bring about auditing 2 if you cant bring about auditing try to bring about communication 3 if you cant bring about communication try to bring about understanding give the individual something practical give him something to do in this way you will lessen the amount of peoples troubles that you listen to even if people dont do what you say you will have catalyzed the situation and it will have smoothed out if they dont want to handle it they will stop talking to you anyway the fact that you are helping the people in your vicinity handle life does put you kingpin and aces up and you actually occupy role that you will increasingly occupy as scientology rolls along 4826407c28 shspec31 campaign to handle psychosomatic ills there will be small popular textbook on the handling of psychosomatic illnesses healing is nobodys monopoly if it becomes anyones monopoly it will be the monopoly of those who can produce results he who can do the job should be the authority there are three actually four aspects or types of illness 1 predisposition eg rats carrying disease impure water etc 2 precipitation 3 acuteness ie acute illness or injury 4 prolongation ie any illness that goes beyond its expected term when there is an acute injury or illness one that exists right now but is temporary then there is job for medico he is the authority in that field that is where he is trained we should grant him that beingness if someone gets cholera he is sick get the medico where the medico errs is in trying to take in terrain that is broader than the sphere of his authority there are two other things that happen in illness the predisposition or cause of it the medico is just faintly into this it is more the province of the public health officer who is often an engineer not an md efforts to handle predisposition factors are put on physical level tb testing industrial health programs etc medicine cant often determine the length of time involved in predisposition it begins with an indeterminate point as far as medicine or doctors are concerned with physical cause eg germ or malarial mosquito or the alcohol that drunk driver who injured himself drank before he drove such things are what the medico attributes predisposition to they are physical things not mental ones the other area of illness is prolongation the perpetuation of an illness the failure to recover speedily by the expected term of the illness doctors know the expected duration of the acute phase of an illness they have way of estimating the period of predisposition unless they can establish disease contact even that is not really accurate since person can be predisposed to certain illness before contacting germs contact with the germ is really precipitation of the illness so medicos are only slightly involved in predisposition they have acute illness as their exclusive purview and they are totally ineffective in the area of prolongation prolongation is fuzzier area since the treatment of the illness can contribute to it the medicos whole idea of prolongation is 1 treatment not soon enough 2 improper treatment 3 complications but prolongation can only be controlled to limited extent by medicine if an illness enters the stage of prolongation with complications setting in the medicos tend to go into apathy just like the patient because there are elements in the prolongation of the illness that they cant control medicos understand predisposition by physical means they understand the acute phase in physical terms in scientology we would say that the cycle of action would be from the first contact with the predisposing factor to the end of the expected normal term of the illness the doctor can handle this cycle but sometimes complications occur because of poor or absent treatment in his view again it is physical but the medico tends to be rather apathetic about it or to go into frantic activity eg repeated operations or heroic measures shock or postoperative shock is physical thing to doctor usually he can neither prevent it nor do anything about it he neglects any possible mental influence when you say illness and healing the md of course thinks of physical address to these since this is what he means by these terms however most doctors know that they are up against 483something else when they are dealing with psychosomatic illness if you say psychosomatic healing this is way out to the doctor how the doctor somes to recognize the existence of psychosomatic illness is puzzler since this type of illness is not started by physical contact the faults that the doctor finds with psychosomatic healing are only that 1 it encroaches on his field 2 he doesnt understand it the psychosomatic healer tends to overreach himself and to enter the field of physical healing in which he is not trained and he tends to inhibit or prohibit treatment of physical illness when it exists for example doctor will therefore condemn chiropractor he will point out that the chiropractor adjusted the slipped disc of ten patients and of course nine of them felt better but he did the same thing with the tenth patient who was really suffering from tb which undiagnosed by the ignorant practitioner subsequently caused the death of the patient therefore chiropractor is dangerous to the doctor that is the professional mds professional objection in its entirety this argument is neatly handled by us if we send sick patients to an md before we handle them the md also recognizes that when he gets into the field of psychosomatic illness he is in nevernever land he knows not of because it is not purely physical an auditor cant do much with someone who is acutely physically ill such person has too much ptp and not enough ability to asis heavy acute illness is ptp and you cant audit over ptp so dont try get the ptp handled first by doctor if necessary then the field of prolongation of illness belongs to scientology dont audit over high temperature you could perhaps use very simple process reachwithdraw from the pillow perhaps and see if it works but thats all the proper approach is to try to put such pc in communication at very low level if you dont get sudden resurgence leave it there is point in trying to complete whatever action you were on because the pc is too distracted by his body problem to asis what you were on prolonged illness is in the field of psychosomatic healing ie scientology touch assist shifts the pcs attention off of the place where the pc decided to stop the shock wave and it discharges that part of the incident thus touch assist allows the incident to run through the places where the shock wave did go to can be run out if you continued the touch assist you would put the pc back at the beginning of the incident again then you would have to run the incident out again the reason why an engram persists is that it contains lie the pc has tried to stop the motion and with the stuck picture has apparently done so but actually the pc did not stop the incident or the movement of the shock wave through the body so it has to be run through to be asised so when accepting pc for auditing you would be wise to have him get good physical exam first so that any acute physical illness can be treated before you start auditing him however if the pc has an untreatable illness there is point in telling the doctor that you are going to heal him you are not talking about the same kind of healing so you will just get into big disagreement you can get into communication with the doctor on the basis of his expertise in his area get him to write report on his findings dont appear to challenge him in his field when you are in the field of psychosomatics you are in the field of prolongation of illness your argument with the md takes an interesting turn at this point there is nothing that he can do you can tell him this is question of psychosomatic illness there is probably some mental condition holding the illness in place he can agree with you in oversimplified terms you can tell him that it is more complicated than that and he will agree it is something that has exceeded his cycle of action so he has to become the effect of it if you can do something about psychosomatic illness when the doctor cant he will be glad to send those patients to you because those are the patients he can do nothing about which makes him feel like fraud and gives him loses these are the patients whose illnesses go on longer than they should you can tell the doctor simplified version of what you will do as one specialist to another then you get your result and the doctor will look on you with awe the md knows that the psychiatrist is failure because among other things he cant handle never solved the problem of prolongation for the md if scientology made its position completely clear to the medical doctor namely that we are not interested in trying to heal obvious physical injury and illness our view would become much realer to the md and we would be seen as doing him service in handling the crocks just agree to the truth that skull fracture for example is nothing 484that psychosomatic healing should be practiced on that there is purview that belongs properly and exclusively to the md and surgeon and he will stop fighting you instantly psychosomatic healing actually has an old tradition older than the mds this includes witch doctoring magic etc naturally it is the oldest tradition it has truth behind it because it is the tradition of the spirit this is just small part of scientology but it is where we belong in the field of healing 6407c30 shspec32 psychosomatic its meaning in scientology medical treatment lies in what they call psychic trauma within 24 hours of lrhs setting out program of helping the medicos they goofed with saint hill student bill websterjohnson they gave him the wrong bloodtype during transfusion and thereby possibly cost him his life thats pure damn foolishness in the first place they monkey around when they get outside their limited proper field this caused lrh to take sharp look at possible cooperation and made him question it legislatures pass laws about things that they know nothing about theres nothing in the constitution that says you have to be sane to be citizen and yet if you are pronounced insane you are longer citizen and have civil rights whatsoever the right to say who is insane is given to people with training in the field of the mind who think that the mind is the brain by law they do not have to be trained in anything but medicine anyway there is bill or law that says that psychiatrists can practice in the field of the mind only that one must be an md psychiatrists do not have to be licensed and the term psychiatrist has legal standing to train an animal you wait for the animal to do something and then say the command word and reward the animal association according to pavlov and thompson is concatenation of events by which one reaches conclusion freudian psychiatry is not currently practiced none of the current practitioners was trained by freud and the original system may have called for more intelligence on the part of the practitioner than seems to be used now freud probably used savvy and word association to cone down on the problem free association is the lengthy procedure for contemporary freudians amassing enough data appears to be their system but by the time one amasses enough data one is simply confused you need chance to apply the data technology is dicey stuff the more vias it goes through the more errors it becomes subject to lrh handles lots of tech queries from students instructors msh etc the right to practice depends ideally on the ability to do not on some state legislators decisions promoters and lobbyists determine what laws and appropriations shall be made anyway in order to get more money for their department or industry or whatever that is why there are periodic attacks on scientology it is being used as an example of how bad it all is over there if you hit someone mentally or physically with enough force duress or bad news you can make him give you something mass physical blow significance saying how bad it is eg is seepage troubling your loved ones this is mortuary bad news comeon for expensive caskets blackmail is based on the same principle so is taxation and the draft the medical doctor uses this technique in diseasefighting campaigns that scare people with how bad it is instead of getting their income from curing people they use the scare tactic as large source of funds if you understand how this law operates you can usually put together good defense or counter attack this scare tactic is also used by patients im so bad off youve got to give with the next bad news artist you run into ask him boldfacedly what am i expected to give you you will stop him cold in his tracks this completely discombobulates him you apply the second half of the law that he is operating on albeit unknowingly before he is ready for it you complete the cycle unexpectedly 485you may not get sensible answer to your question but you will change what he is doing his attention he may not doing this consciously he may have you misidentified and be dramatizing something he surely doesnt expect your response if you can make people laugh when theyre crying and cry when theyre laughing then you would know something about the human mind this is an interesting point but knowing the mind doesnt mean manipulating the mind the medical profession means something else by psychosomatic healing than what you mean by it they mean the minds influence on the body but they consider the mind to be the brain so psychosomatic means the brains or the nervous systems effect on the body this is like saying that the switchboard is the causative element of the phone company so psychosomatic has come to mean the bodys effect on the body thus the subject of psychosomatic illness has disappeared as meaningful subject the word psychosomatic actually means psyche soul plus soma body so proper definition of psychosomatic would be thetans influence on the body that is our definition but not the medicos the first downgrade was to translate psyche as mind the thetan had lost his identity and had become identified with the masses and machinery of the mind the second downgrade was to make mind mean brain and nervous system this makes psychosomatic mean about what the influence of the switchboards and telephone lines on the government would mean that is what the mds mean since the brain and nervous system are part of the body you are just dealing with the bodys influence on the body case has just fallen out of it better term then might be spiritual healing or the spirits influence on the body you can educate or process someone to recognition of the effect he as being is having on his you could ask him for times in his life when he was ill following being upset he might comm lag long time but getting few of these out of the way will improve someones case we have advanced beyond the tradition of psychosomatic healing because we recognize three stages of influence the thetan psyche influencing the mind psycho which then influences the body soma we recognize that the mind is doing something to the body some retained memory has held pain or an experience in place keeping the body ill or predisposing the body to illness or injury you wouldnt have somatic body feeling of feeling good because it would be you that felt good dianetics was at the level of mind over the body but even here the mind was not totally causative we had to recognize that something was doing something that was not the mind we recognized that the thetan existed and could influence the mind to make it stop influencing the body for the worse and that makes us different we have found the thing that the thetan can influence the mind he may not be able to influence the body directly but he can influence the mind which in turn is influencing the body this is more effective than earlier healing practices because asking the thetan to influence the body directly is too great gap for him to jump scientology handles predisposition to illness and we are the only ones who can just as we are the only ones who can handle prolongation of illness 6408c04 shspec33 summary of study there has not been technology of education or study there was school technology but it didnt have much to do with education education seldom has much to do with school education as opposed to schooling takes into account the relative importance ie the applicability of the data being taught schooling has real thought of applicability for instance there are people in art who think that knowing names and dates is knowing something about art when they couldnt tell you what picture was painted with in education mass and significance must be balanced dont get too much significance for the mass when you get into significance vs mass you get into action action could be defined as significance versus mass of some kind the reason why one engages in action is that one has purpose of achieving or avoiding something in education when the significance is never added to the mass you get jammed curriculum there is doingness significance that has nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting is disrelated datum all it does is to throw you curve school is 486expert at doing this you could have school system that would teach but that wouldnt educate anyone or train anyone for anything because it failed to add any mass or doingness to the significance the data in such school system is all curiosa it is not of any use that is why you almost never turn an artist out of university universities separate significance from action so that the student gets introverted with confront of the subject you cant have education if you detach doingness from significance if you do this you get highly impractical person who never leaves school professor for someone to teach who cannot do is terrible mistake instructors in scientology should be able to audit any trouble an instructor has in teaching has at least little to do with inability in the area person merely writing reports of people who can do is too far removed from the mass to write good textbook when you have thoroughly learned something you can use your textbook knowledge to think and you will get better result than the pure textbook approach would give lrh also found that the pure darkroom training that he had had wasnt enough in itself to make good photographer there is ample evidence of this fact in the daily newspaper pictures which are mostly by untrained photographers photography has the common denominator of the public taste it is new subject only little over century old it hasnt had time to get snobbish when subject is all mass and significance it also fails professionalism has to do with significance doingness and mass you need all three to get final result education would treat these three things equally this isnt new thought but the photography course confirmed it for lrh professionalism is sweated for professionals work hard dilettantes dont you dont have to have done everything that has been done to be pro you dont have to have made human mind to fix one up or to have built an emeter to know how to operate one this would be an overstress on doingness the way to keep things in balance is to design the course such that if someone isnt going to do something you strip the significance out of it doingnesses become converted to significances if one isnt going to perform them you should never thus convert doingnesses to only significances ie never take something that is never more to be performed and describe it far beyond necessity you can work it in the other direction and convert significance to doingness if you take something that has been done but isnt currently being done and teach someone to do it eg bromoil prints the doingness and mass of subject that should be taught are the currently applicable doingnesses and masses of the subject the significances that should be taught are enough background so that the individual doesnt get stuck in the doingness so that the doingness has framework and the principles behind it are clear and understood this is little more significance than you would expect that is why you show the student how the subject evolved what other doingnesses there have been and the principles behind the doingnesses then he can think as well as perform mechanical act that is the difference between pro and practical man when doingness changes the guy who has grounding in the subject can understand why and evaluate it properly professional therefore can advance where practical man without theoretical grounding would become antiquated or obsolete mere theoretician could be welltaught but he is seldom educated since his doingness would be missing he might have some other doingness that would be useful eg he could be an art expert who knows nothing about art but whose doingness is the detection of the age of canvasses or whatever most of the protest of the young is that they are being schooled not educated an instructor could think someone was doing simply because he was in motion but if the motion has nothing to do with what the student will be doing it reacts like significance and the student will feel bored and stuck as though he was up against something that he couldnt move through education should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another in such way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof it permits the recipient to think on and develop the subject and not to become antiquated on the subject the information is loose and flexible in his head not fixed in such way that it relates to only one thing the basic thing wrong with education has been that it never defined what it was trying to do it got confused with schooling education got in trouble the second it started to do something that it didnt define 487by starting with the thetan as the basis of our theory we exceed the reach of other subjects we have to process someone to get him to understand because the thetan is relatively incapable of understanding in degraded state there appears to be close relationship between miseducation and aberration you could get resurgences in many areas of case just by getting someone to find and define misunderstood words from life 6408c06 shspec34 study gradients and nomenclature bulletins are now being written in form that is easier to understand since lrh started to study study scores on exams have gone from 5 in the gos to 60 in the 90s since this material started to be communicated the aim is to improve the ability of the student to learn by altering the methodology of teaching this is an unusual approach we are now handling the students subjective reaction to the subject by changing the method of teaching the usual way to change the students reaction to the subject was by punishment the normal physical universe method the grade system is punishment system on rare occasions the participation of the student has been invited by some teachers education is not normally very successful although educators dont often recognize or admit this fact in scientology we have the unusual situation of being able to see the end product of our education in action this makes it easy to see how well the students learned the material in studying study lrh avoided fields where the students ability to apply what he learned is readily observable we have instantaneous inspection of the results of our study this is quite rare most fields of study expect the student to be very amateurish in the field of photography you get results almost as rapidly as in studying auditing which made it good comparative field for studying auditing is complicated activity in teaching it we apply the principle of gradient scales which was discovered long since we have someone learn fairly simple basic action very well then we add second action etc modern universities usually err by entering the gradient at too high point and assuming that the students already know basics that they dont in fact modern education is the art of teaching on an outgradient our basic gradient on education is to start by getting someone there this is step that elementary school teachers overlook and that works very well when used for five or ten minutes day brief time though that is at the start of the day for instance you could run look at that wall etc the fact that body is there doesnt prove that the person is there nobody is smart where he is not so getting the person there raises iq you always have to start with an action that is simple enough so that the student can get it rather easily otherwise he will feel spinny and confused as he goes on you could discover whether this had happened with person by checking on the emeter for early difficulties in studying dianetics or scientology if you got ta and continued reads as the person discussed it you would know that there was something there that bad never been resolved the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden forward with them into the present those are the ones that must be handled you can always get one read on difficulty or confusion that someone has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the track as having been difficulty but it wont keep reading if it hasnt ridden forward in time as an auditor you are only interested in the things that the person never resolved which are active now those things will read repetitively this applies to clearing up someones difficulty in studying because the confusions that the person had which are now cleared up have power to confuse him now arc must have preceded all misemotion and bad reaction the confusion that sticks the student in pt is never his basic confusion if student really cant learn something then there is lower point on the gradient that the student skipped at that point he had enough confusion to be overwhelmed that second point is the one that you will get on the meter you wont get the earliest point this follows the pattern of the mind person doesnt have trouble from what he knows is wrong what the student is very confused about which the instructor cant seem to teach is not the right point to try to clear up the way to handle this student is to go back and find the word in the earlier material that wasnt understood you can pinpoint within few words the exact spot at which student started to have trouble then look earlier and find the skipped gradient if there is some word that student doesnt understand with violence you look before that you go back as far as you need to 488the physiological manifestations will be feeling headachy spots in front of the eyes walls getting closer spinny weird feeling the skipped gradient can even be in an allied subject when word is misunderstood words right after it vanish teaching is relaying data to person that he can receive and understand in such way that he will be able to use the data that is the definition that was given the other day to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now instruction would consist of guiding student along known gradient not dreaming up solutions to his confusions good instruction consists in backtracking to find the point where the student thought he understood when he didnt study is concatenation of certainties string of confidences and competences so before you help student out let him get in trouble never trouble trouble til trouble troubles you that is the difficulty of group study teachers have to make an average of trouble for the whole class dont ever help student before be runs into trouble it is interesting that it was in 1947 that lrh started investigating the effect of mislearned word on life following the data from commander thompson on wordassociations lrh established that when he cleared up some words what had been troubling person ceased to trouble him though he could well have new problems another aspect of the misunderstood word phenomenon can be that the word or phrase used can be inadequate leading to omitted data one can get hung up by being deprived of some information eg by typographical error so it could be omitted data as well as misunderstood words that causes trouble for the student the fault could be in the text the common ingredient is that something is not understood 6408c11 shspec35 study evaluation of information psychologists are working for advertisers in order to find out what makes people tick motivational research but they are the wrong people to go to since they dont know what the real buttons are scientologist could be much more successful at motivational research degrading though the use of knowledge of the mind for such purposes would be in order to live calmly in the midst of confusion person must have the basic answers then the confusion doesnt bother him 90 of the time and the other 10 of the time he can do something about it knowledge is achieved by study the subject of words boobytraps persons efforts to find out about the world the individual generally assigns to the wrong part of the study material the reason why he cant study it because the right part is something that he isnt confronting and he feels he cant confront it so he disperses and confronts something else study could mean the same thing as inspection ie observation to find out something about something person can observe something directly or he can get knowledge on secondhand basis from the printed page the second system speeds up the amount that you can learn since you dont have to do all the basic legwork even when you have direct experience it is best to have some fruits of others observations and experience from which to profit illiterate cultures dont survive as well as literate ones those who do not know who do not understand get overwhelmed and tossed out between the two extremes of 1 observation necessary because one knows everything dying civilization or individual 2 observation possible because the words arent known lies the middle ground of knowing the words and staying alert never become complacent about what you know and you will survive nicely this applies especially to someone who knows more than those around him this danger of stultifying because of thinking that there is more need to observe faces scientology the person who survives is the one who can observe understand and do second hand observation in particular has to be very well understood the understanding has to increase in proportion to the directness of the observation understanding is substitute for mass in studying something there are two things to understand about second hand observation and understanding the understanding can be indirect because of 4891 time 2 being relayed by someone else the difficulties of secondhand observation are innumerable so part of our understanding must be evaluation of the reliability of the information that we are being given that is where the bulk of beings get fouled up evaluating an information source is matter of experience among other things you must be able to go on past something you know you dont understand being prepared for any misunderstood phenomena and knowing the source of these phenomena what person studies and the way in which he studies should depend on what he wishes to do with the information specialized words are used for specialized observations you can approach subject at various levels you can think that you know more than you do if you have had superficial contact with the subject but how much do you want or need to know about the subject do you want to be able to discuss it at parties or to use it for something and if the latter for what do you want to use it for instance art could be used as discussion topic as interior decoration as investment as something that one will teach others to appreciate or as something that one will create oneself study that winds up only in understanding with activity is ok there is lot of it around in society but dont make habit of it you can think that you know all about it when you cant do it that is not very prosurvival neither is the consideration that the subject is too complicated for you to ever use it doingness does require much more understanding than lookingness if you are studying for doingness study on gradient give the student series of doingnesses that he can do and have wins at doingness increases understanding as well as the other way around 6408c13 shspec36 study and education education is acquiring knowingness in subject and an ability to act in that area the whole subject of education has as its end the accomplishment of certain doingnesses study that doesnt have that intention is only directed towards acquaintance dilletantism or doodledaddling that is not really education education is to accomplish certain things with that subject if person is educated in subject he can accomplish the results of that subject because he knows that subject this is why education in schools isnt really education at all you cant really separate education from some role some professional doingness as the end in view that is the modern quarrel with education in schools much is spent to educate students but they dont get educated people dont get educated in arithmetic because it doesnt have an end product it could have an end product but the end product hasnt been defined or described in universities the student is expected to use higher mathematics to solve problems that could actually be solved with arithmetic if arithmetic hadnt been degraded by being thought of as nothing but groundwork for higher mathematics as the purpose of subject deteriorates or is purported to deteriorate the subject itself disappears if the individual learning the subject has purpose for the subject it will die away in him live study is one that has use dead study has use you can cause subject to die away either by making its use die away or by omitting its purpose as part of the educational process ie not telling students what the subject is for this brings to mind the dissemination formula this is related to the fact that you need purpose to study something getting persons ruin and applying the formula gives him purpose for looking at the subject of scientology it is possible to become obsessive in the study of some subject that has use in talking about scientology people will think of it as subject only when they see that it has purpose that is real to them as an attainable purpose for an educational subject to continue to exist it must have purpose that can be seen to be an attainable action to the individual addressed in his view the value of subject depends upon the value of attaining its stated purpose culture is held together only by education the achievement of an education is remunerated to the degree that 1 its service is understood to be valuable this shows that some odd services are thought to be valuable eg undertaking which has survived as technical line for thousands of years 4902 it is understood continuing need for subject will preserve the subject but its technology must be relayed which it will be if it is needed one could destroy subject by destroying its purpose or by destroying its technology or by adding things to its technology that are unnecessary in educating person in certain subject the longer it takes to get to the point of using the subject the more opportunities there are to fail at it this is is the reverse of the toosteep gradient cf the analogy of the runway if it is too short you cant take off but if it is too long you are likely to damage the plane on the ruts and stones before you can take off true knowledge gives correct emphasis merely theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis this can result in technology getting lost as would happen if for instance you studied three weeks on how to make emeter varnish and other such matters unrealities enter when you teach solutions to problems that dont exist or when you fail to solve problems that do exist by experience you learn where the problems are it is hard to teach subject with which you have immediate personal experience this is one reason why education gets bad name since most professors dont know what they are talking about those that can do those that cant teach all subjects wind up in finite doingness if subject doesnt wind up in finite doingness person cannot be educated in that subject anything that winds up in specific doingness can be educated education in the absence of the mass with which the technology will be involved is hard on people it makes them feel squashed bent sort of spinny bored exasperated sort of dead pictures of the mass would help you would expect the greatest incidence of suicide and illness where people were studying subject whose mass was absent too steep gradient gives different physiological reaction confusion and reelingness the bypassed definition gives blank washedout notthere feeling followed by nervous hysteria the eventual manifestation of this is blow from the subject to remedy the absence of mass supply mass to remedy the toosteep gradient find the last point that was well understood and find the misunderstood right there or just after to remedy the misunderstood word get it defined and used manifestations of study problems absent mass 1 squashed feeling 2 bent feeling 3 feeling sort of spinny 4 boredom 5 flatness 6 peeling sort of dead 7 exasperation 8 headaches 9 stomach aches 10 eyes hurting 11 dizziness too steep gradient 1 confusion 2 reelingness bypassed definition 4911 blank notthere washedout feeling 2 followed by nervous hysteria 3 followed by blow from the subject this is the final manifestation gradients are more involved with doingness though they do hang off in the subject of significance but it is the action that we are interested in the misunderstood word is the most important thing in establishing someones doingness the restoration of doingness depends only on getting the misunderstood word defined and understood though to do well or with talent may vary from person to person person say doesnt know word in psychology so he cant move over into scientology the misunderstood word opens the gate to education so it is the most important aspect of study tech 6409c01 shspec37 the pe course here is some data from the field of study that relates to the pe course new people hear incomprehensible words and dont return thats it that is the reason why you have fifteen people on monday who dwindle to two people on friday what has been discovered here is the act that exists prior to the overt and which illumines the overtmotivator and ow sequences before there is an overt there is noncomprehend so the overtmotivator sequence goes 1 misunderstood word 2 noncomprehend 3 belief that it is ok to commit an overt 4 the commission of the overt 5 the withhold of the overt 6 blow an attack or withdrawal this can be big or small see also hcob 8sep64 levels ii to iv overts what lies behind them critical thought is justifier lessener of the overt and therefore symptom of an overt if you ask the pc for an overt and he gives critical thought of course you dont leave it there you ask for the done having gotten that you could ask for the noncomprehend and behind that for the misunderstood word get the nattery student to find on his own before the next coursetime all of his misunderstoods in previous courses or studies and get them cleaned up someone who cant do anything about anything is reasonable about it all this is disease that civilized person gets into being reasonable doesnt solve anything you cant do anything about it so you get reasonable about it being reasonable is what someone does who cant make his goals anymore if you really find out what the score is you dont have to be reasonable you can do something about it if guy is having trouble understanding and is nattering about scientology before he has had time to find anything to natter about there is word or words in prior related subject that was misunderstood someone who has misunderstood words in field that is allied to scientology will be unable to learn scientology this is why someone who is psychologist has trouble learning scientology he could do some clay table processing to handle it or you could assign him self audit looking up the words in psychology that he didnt understand this takes care of the natterer in the pe course as very precise action if you get someone in the pe course who is trying to get it but cant ask him for the word that you have used that he didnt understand if the guy is simply trying and failing to grasp word he just has an incontext misunderstood word find it and he will brighten up then there is the perfect pe student who sits and nods but hasnt clue this is handled by having people give written examples of the point that you have made taken from real life this permits 492return flow and lets you spot the fellow who is utterly glib and cant apply the fellow who hasnt connected get him to give you list of words that he hasnt understood since starting the course take up those words and clean them up probably some other people on the course havent got them either suppose that you were offered course to teach you all about automobiles and you had never seen one but you had sort of vaguely heard about them you had heard that they travel over the ground at tremendous speeds this sow ded rather neat and intriguing so you decided to take the course then suppose you got hit with three nights in row of how neat cars are and how fast you can go in them and how intriguing they are and you never got word one about what an automobile is what makes it work or what its parts are so when you teach scientology teach it an overt against scientology is justification for not having understood some word or concept in scientology keep it simple and keep it defined as much as possible keep it familiar people like the familiar people dont like things that are totally new the public likes the old with maybe little bit of improvement not new subjects so you had better represent scientology as what it is which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind it follows the traditional patterns of philosophy religion and the mind your own interest in it may have come from your recognition in it of the philosophy of greece and rome and of faculty psychology people justify not having understood subject so they commit the overt that shows that the subject is good presentday psychologists think of man as machine psychology has stable datum perception depends on association and sensation according to the psychologist there is perception in the absence of sensation and association that is machine in the absence of someone tickling its gears and certain things making other things happen is incapable of noticing anything that is happening this notion puts conditions upon being able to perceive anything and it is not true it would be true of machine with nobody in charge but it is not true of being being does not require sensation with association in order to perceive only if person were piece of meat would this be true before i can look at field of id have to have received sensation from it and to have associated it with my childhood robot would have to do that it would have to have associative memory etc psychologists believe that man is robot when you say that perception is engaged upon by the being himself as means of communication with the universe around him and other beings you would have been welcomed by the sixteenth century faculty psychologists but you are damned by the moderns you have introduced volition volitional and nonvolitional acts you have set up the individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesnt want to see you have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice and you have set up the dignity of the individual and that they want nothing to do with because they in not understanding man have gone the route of the overt see earlier part of this tape thats why psychiatry cuts out brains theyve got to make nothing out of man because they havent understood him and the misunderstood word that it goes back to is psychology every psychiatrist is in the frame of mind of man they are arc broken with their own subject they know it doesnt work this is where their contempt for man comes from they dominate thought in universities they teach that man is good he is just machine such philosophy became necessary when leaders entered wars that killed off thirty million people at crack this philosophy justifies the overt you have to have philosophy that man is good in order to go on committing overts so mans mental subjects first didnt bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts and then employment was found for these blokes by fellows who had to have their overts justified the hitlers and the stalins man is not more degraded than he was it is just that mans mental sciences have departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man wundt made his big mistake at leipzig in 1879 and pavlov and psychiatry came riding in scientology is in the great tradition of the dignity of man the ideas that we are moving along with are the traditional ideas these ideas have to do with attention perception power of choice and motivation of behavior we do not go on the basis of how wicked everyone is we just ask what these things are the idea that men are animals was always there to be bought but it wasnt until 1879 that it got taken up so modern psychology is the upstart subject modern psychology and psychiatry 493came from the russian and the german two groups of people who have enviable reputation for humanitarianism if the germans had just stopped with music and cameras we would be fine but every once in awhile they got careless with guns psychiatry came from germany and modern psychology came from the russians psychology is really substudy of scientology and as such it is our property after all psychologists cant even define psychology it should have its spelling changed to psycheology study of the soul so as to reflect its true and traditional meaning it is the psychiatrists and psychologists who are the radicals scientologists and the traditionalists we are the conservatives psychiatry psychology philosophy and religion and all subsumed in scientology the radical approaches have had their chance and have failed to produce results they should stand aside in favor of the more traditional approach psychology as psycheology should be seen as being part of scientology the eyes can see by putting something there to be perceived as well as by perceiving what is there learning nomenclature is equivalent to learning what is there treat the pe course as an area where people can learn the language and find out what is there to be named and students will come up smiling if they dont understand the words they blow natter and commit overts thus we build our own opposition 6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is clear means what it meant in dianetics the evolution of science which is the same as what it means on adding machines computers have complex circuits sometimes drop of solder gets dropped in which shortcircuits the circuits and adds some wrong constant factor to the computer in mechanical adding machines if you never pushed the clear button after the previous operation you would get the old total added in that is the uncleared answer where old data modifies pt data the mind likewise will add old answers into current computations and get wrong answers persons memory will be bad in the area where the old answer is stuck amnesia is all the helddown fives adding up to total blank memory is not broad condition it is spotty as leopard person has bad memory in an area of aberration traumatic experience is surrounded by locks so sometimes it is hard to find there is such thing however as uniformly good or bad memory the worse off someone is the more areas of nomemory there are insanity becomes way of obfuscating overts as well as motivator and justifier for them if we could get person to see the overt all that insanity would become unnecessary if you want to improve someones memory you must ask memory on what person is aberrated in the area where his memory is poor there is fairly goodsized piece of nuttiness occluding some area of his experience and memory all you have to do is to monkey with it little and it will start to clear psychiatry errs by trying to make sense out of the incomprehensible it cant be done by definition you should not try to figure that square shapes make people nervous because some patients were nervous around doors instead you should find out how come the patients got nuts on the subject of doors you dont try to make sense out of the incomprehensible all you have to do is to understand that he the person who has presented you with the incomprehensible doesnt understand it and to start looking for where it came from people are far more normal than they are crazy cf hs sullivan nobody is totally crazy other mental sciences go crazy on this fact because of mans thirst for allness which is just the craving to identify with psychiatrists going aaa think that there is such thing as total insanity and that therefore there is such thing as the state of being insane even in his legal systems man has to have something called insanity this is not correct person is insane in one or more areas or subjects there is such thing as total insanity gibbering idiot who asks for glass of water when he is thirsty is sane in that area the sentence this man is insane requires three dots at its end to show that it is incomplete psychiatrists have never completed the sentence so that it reads properly and accurately as this man is insane on the subject of _______ but if psychiatrists knew that much about the subject of insanity they could cure it it is the missing link 494actually they have never defined their terms if you ask psychiatrist what subject is this guy insane on he would say maybe exhibitionism bull pucky thats condition not subject you cant classify insanities because insanity is the same on the same subject as any other to finish the sentence this man is insane on the subject of _______ psychiatrists would have to observe the patient then they would see that there was similarity to others insanity find the subject on which person is insane find the source of the subject and he will have cognitions and the aberration will blow if you are in an area where the pc is cogniting you must therefore be in an area where the pc was aberrated you are tracking down and clearing held down five cognition is returned memory when the pc is cogniting it is an indicator that he is getting rid of helddown fives and he will be remembering better in that area if person never cognites you arent tracking down any helddown fives clear means on any given subject not nuts anymore especially where the person has been pretty nuts you could say for example on the subject of children this person is clear you would have to put it into the framework of relationship of some kind when you have hit enough stuck fives you can call the guy clear which means cleared being with cleared ability to think guy who has been cleared in given area of aberration cant go nuts in that area again it took fantastically off thewall set of circumstances to aberrate the person in the first place to aberrate him again you would have to get the same weird circumstances all together again and then some because now he is educated too he knows how it happened cleared person or clear would be person with obvious aberrations and with majority of areas cleared who has cleared ability to think the basic business of an auditor is to use scientology tech to locate areas of aberration in the being and then to follow those areas down until the person recognized an earlier causation for the condition he would then be unable to reconstruct his nuttiness in that area because the thing that had him aberrated in the first place is gone and he also knows that he has been nuts in that area so when he sees something approaching that could be recurrence of the condition he preunderstands what might happen again and it wont happen having had the experience and being aware of it is like being inoculated he couldnt go nuts again in that area if he tried therefore clearing is stable the state of total causation is not the same as the state of clear the state of total causation is ot which is different from being unaberrated clearing is something that applies to the mind it is related to finite state of existence the ability to survive well in everyday existence in the universe across time when we try to make clear an absolute we go beyond that into another area that has the side effects of clear although you are not trying to fix the guy up the final result is total resumption of beingness at total causation which isnt necessarily in the physical universe in finite time clearing is an assist to finite existence not some supernatural thing man doesnt leap from state of total aberration to state of total divinity it is long walk which starts with the guys present environment the gradient scale only breaks down when the pc gets into running the things that make up the mind gpms now you are handling uncommon unnatural problems like why did the being make time track what is he doing in the physical universe etc an individual who had time at all would not be normal it takes different framework to explain this now you have an individual who through his understandings of what is around him and his exact handling of the masses and significances in his immediate vicinity has gradual emergence and cognition of what is going on we are knocking out his concept of existence and replacing it with total knowingness of existence that individual is emerging towards causation not towards being cleared he is going towards point where he causes the past not where he is cleared of the past the aberrations you are taking away from him on r6 are not timed aberrations that is what makes them build up and that is why they are rough they cant be blown by meter dating they date now however you can date and blow an implant gpm isnt something that happened in the year 2681 b that is quite different from something that happened within the universe that you can fit in on the time track if you find an engram all you have to do it date it and it goes bzzt the pc wouldnt have prayer of getting it back after the guy is clear you begin to ask where is the time coming from that you are dating the clearing in now you are into r6 and ot the guy is more causative over the universe less worried about what the universe is doing to him you are going from the finite to the infinite the field of recreation of the individual or the individuals rising up towards total cause is long and arduous road you dont run out of gpms very fast 495the point is that there is separation point between the finite universe and the world of total beingness people going towards clearing are interested in physical wellbeing and their relationships with other human beings they are interested in accomplishing finite goals in the physical universe like keeping job etc if person going up the other track hasnt totally followed the clearing track he is still interested in those things too although perhaps not so aberratedly but only people who are interested in clearing are interested in finite physical universe goals if someone is insane you remove the individual areas of aberration as they become accessible and leave growing core of sanity that was always there somewhere along the line he ceases to be interested in becoming clear of his past and he begins to be very sincerely interested in causation personal individual causation what is the individuals relationship to and responsibility with regard to the physical universe the individual is also capable of going nuts in this direction and thinking that he is god but only if he isnt really past the gates on the road clearing ceases when the individual can recognize his basic gpms and knows where they came from etc ordinary clearing procedures wont touch gpms so clearing ceases now you go into running gpms the person soon gets over being interested in blowing out the electric light or wondering if he could do this etc he gets more seriousminded about the situation as it becomes more real to him and more natural to him he stops worrying about other people getting to be ot the end of the road is in view and it is finite road so the two roads are different one has to do with processing somebody within the limits of time and experience deleting things that keep the individual from getting right answers in existence the other is different auditing changes the individuals responses to auditing change you can still shift the preot back little onto the other road if you do this too much he collides with the next gpm and it jams the meter the locks are now all on top of gpms not on traumatic life experiences charge on subject could lead to misunderstanding word on the subject clarification of the word would cause dropping away of some locks on the subject this could apply to gpm words also it isnt how big or how little persons aberrations are that counts it is how many aberrations he has the closer the aberrations are in subject to each other the more there are these aberrations are not necessarily based on dramatic or interesting experiences either although the pc may try to make more out of them than is actually there 6409c15 shspec39 scientology and tradition you have to understand something about policy policy is not just something that lrh just dreamed up it is something that has been worked out and that has held true over period of time if someone who was supervising staff knew all the policies on central orgs that have been worked out over the years and if he did what they said he would never have to solve single problem looking over any scene in an org and the policies for the area lrh could routinely give the policy covering that situation it is interesting for an organization as young as this one to have this much policy policy makes communication possible between two points this is its main function not forcing people to obey orders in the absence of policy you dont have communication between two points because the two points are not agreed on anything tradition is likewise an agreement the above points about policy therefore also cover civilization civilization has mores and guides to conduct which are agreed upon and which assist the general survival of the individual and the majority of the group policy is or should be based on experience and should lead towards survival so we have policies customs and procedures these are sequential doingnesses if you dont know and follow these you fall out of agreement with the people who are following them and you will feel strange you might have better way to do something than the agreedupon way but if your way is at wide variance with the accepted way the others may shoot you if society is too dissonant it is longer civilization because it does not have agreements there are all kinds of ways of getting married these days this bunch of mishmashes shows that there is something wrong with the institution of marriage as it now stands the rise of animalistic psychology has violated the individuals right even to have customs behaviorism invalidates the idea that people should have customs there are only supposed to be pushbutton responses one is supposed to react to stimuli etc instead of policies you have manipulation people and societies object to 496manipulation especially hidden manipulation it violates the right to have right way to do things it denies the individual the right to any sense at all it is longer based on considerations of survival the dignity of man involves the ability to decide policy with others policy and customs are things that make sense at least at the time that they are formulated customs and policy look odd when they persist after the problem that they were created to handle has vanished when tradition that originally made sense loses its sense it may now have as its rationale politeness or some such thing people tend to carry solutions into the future after the problem is licked policies can conflict if realities are different for instance in miami during the second world war american planes had habit of practicing dive bombing on hips entering harbors they got fired on by dutch ship returning from the south pacific in scientology we appear to be out of step but what we are out of step with is the new technology of control which assumes that men are animals that should be handled by having their buttons pushed lrh was taught at princeton that law proceeds from the customs of the people law that proceeds only from central source and ignores or seeks to change peoples customs will either be ignored or will bring on revolution as with prohibition the civil rights act also sought to change customs by legislation it violates the first amendment and other amendments of the constitution it violates the right to jury trial something that one seemed to notice this produced breakdown in communication which resulted in disorder and rioting because it was violation of custom and an attempt at central enforcement of custom the way to keep the peace is to keep the customs of the people military governors had this fact laid on them with an axe since this was the way to keep civil bodies in back of the front lines under control having them out of control was embarrassing when you violate the expected survival pattern of an area you have said die bucking custom is bucking theta comm line you have cut the comm line between point and point b now their actions dont mesh since they are operating on different policies custom and policies are methods of bringing about communication and agreement along certain matters that lead to higher level of survival if policy leads to higher level of survival it is good policy poor policy leads to lower level of survival and bad policy leads to complete disaster this accounts for the ebb and flow of civilizations civilizations could die out because their customs have become antiquated but far more often civilizations are smashed by the fact that the central government or an external source an invasion has smashed the customs of the civilization today on this planet communism is engaged upon this process using the wundtian psychology of 1879 scientology is not in conflict with the customs of the planet or the universe quite the contrary if you can communicate with anyone on the subject of scientology he will agree with you unless he misunderstands word since you are talking to him out of the traditional technologies of healing and the human spirit and the traditional philosophies and psychologies know the truth and the truth will set you free this is an ancient policy of psychology that is now being violated for instance washington is now claiming that the government has the right to lie this violates the custom of tell the truth and the policy of the courts governments justify government lies in all sorts of ways but individuals arent supposed to lie it is legal for governments to lie but not for the individual to lie this is bad news the man in the street will agree with you as long as you dont use words that are strange to him he will agree on ideas such as the idea that man has right to be free to control his life etc our target is not to make an insane person quiet but to make him sane that has been the target of mental healing since the stone age but not in the last halfcentury that is why we are looked upon as dangerous by the new faddists who are interested in manipulation not freedom they would argue with the idea that it is good for people to be free an idea that has never been contested in civilized society try asking psychiatrist what are you trying to do with your patient he will never tell you that he is trying to make him sane he will obfuscate the slave philosophy was practiced in sparta communism is similar but bolder we have made progress in how to accomplish goals which man has had as long as he has been man what we have developed that is new is technology to attain the traditional goals of philosophy and religion scientologys way of expressing mans basic goals and our organizational methods may be new but not the basic goals of scientology which are the goals of man we can improve on the idea behind the witch doctor healing by manipulation of symbols we have the advantage of being able to 497communicate and have session by witch doctor we do not mean someone who uses an african black magic juju but real healing witch doctor in the absence of orthodoxy anything can be called unorthodox society that has right conduct is society in which anyone can be punished and criticized by art critics scientific agencies etc because he is not conducting himself rightly you can longer comply there is nothing to comply with they pretend there is custom there when there isnt any that there is 1234 procedure and then will never tell you what it is and yet punish you because you dont comply with it the material wealth of society doesnt demonstrate its longevity or endurance greeces greatest art and philosophy was produced in its decline the communication of custom is itself technology when it breaks down the custom can be abandoned conversely when the custom itself has broken down you get communication breaking down we get breakdown of civilization when its customs break down because of failure to communicate them you get cooperation when people dont know the customs on which they operate the means of communication of customs are longer taught in this civilization this is where study tech and misunderstood word tech fits in so you could be remiss in teaching scientology by using words that are strange and misunderstood if you do this you have not established communication being comprehensible comes ahead of being effective since comprehensibility makes your effectiveness apparent if youre truly comprehensible people will forgive you almost anything as witness my life so the proper order of importance is 1 comprehensibility 2 necessity demand 3 effectiveness 6409c22 shspec40 review of study there are textbooks on how to study even in schools of education lrh plans to write one that would revolutionize the field of study and education in johannesburg tests on school children showed decrease in iq that was more marked the longer they stayed in school the longer person studies of course the more words he runs into that he doesnt understand and the more confusion he piles up artists writers etc in the workaday world have this peculiarity the successful ones have never taken course in their art field or even finished college at party given in new york for professional writers lrh did an informal survey to determine the educational background of the guests he found that most of them had either been expelled from college or had never attended college in the first place the one exception was man who piped up and said that he had obtained phd in literature he turned out to be literary agent failed writer in the years following lrh found out that writing courses dont teach writing they teach some technology that writers dont use and various gimmicks that writers also dont use writers do have and use technology but writing courses dont teach it the trouble is that writers are professional liars when then tell you how they write they tell the most incredible tales they never really say what they do so there are lot of pretended technologies in the area in any technical subject technology builds up in the area of correction such technologies as photographic retouching or correction lists tend to be more complex than the technologies that they correct if you have the technique of how to do it in the first place everything will move smoothly from there on but if technology is missing not known or not practiced we will now get complicated technology arising as lowerscale subject that will be corrective of the upperscale subject medicine is another example of corrective technology the upperscale technology would be that of making bodies properly in the first place as practiced today all education is corrective technology it is trying to correct its own failed corrections there is duress in the field to get students to learn this must be an effort to correct the students failure to get the material in the first place caused by early confusions duress in education is substitute for the missing technology of the misunderstood word and the cause of the failure of 498education the duress makes it impossible for the student to use his education he is left on suppress and an onlyone basis because the duress has caused him to go out of arc with the subject so he does nonapplication of the information he might even get weird and revengeful towards his subject schools keep kids in line until they are old enough for the police to take over the job freedom from is fighting something or worrying about it not true freedom one way in which you can have misunderstood is by getting what the writer is saying but having misunderstood or missed something perhaps earlier not getting what the writer is driving at how does the state suffer from miseducation in russia many students were given onthejob training for key posts but after their training 100 of the students left the posts that they were trained for what must have happened is that way back in school the communist love of changing the meanings of words got in there the english upper governing class lost their influence by being educated to death so the continuation of culture depends on having technology of study the government is trying to bring in law and order while creating disorder delinquency and stupidity in the schools once again scientology and dianetics collide with an area where there is pretended technology unlike the area of medicine and drugs the field of education is not one of vested interest because there is not as much money in it when you are teaching teachers about study technology you should recognize that you are moving them up from level 0 to level i see pp 521523 above for description of level 0 above for description of levels i and ii for summary of levels and classes iiv you can tell the teachers the iq of your children could be increased by study instead of decreased or your school could run with less upset or juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation this will be very acceptable to them and they will never think to ask where this data and knowledge is coming from because they never think about anything in the first place you havent realized that they cant see where it is coming from because they cant see at all this is because they have been trained into stupidity when you fail to communicate to someone about scientology it is because you are talking to them above the level at which you should be talking to them youve got to give them the idea that there are data that data can be comprehended and that they can learn something then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge people dont expect anything to work because nothing ever has they dont think that there is anything to know if we are unreal to them it is because everything is unreal to them we have high commandvalue over them scientology could probably put the whole society into some kind of obedience basis but that is not our purpose you would have win if you approached someone on the following gradient 1 getting him into state where he could learn 2 showing him that there was something to be studied 3 showing him that there was body of information about study 4 showing him that there was body of information to study this hasnt been our normal approach we have generally overlooked the fact that if someone cant learn he cant even receive your message in fact his basic ptps have to do with not knowing if he knew that there was some way to learn about anything he would be very interested if he could know that there was some way to gather data he would be on your side because he could apply this to his ptps you would teach him that the first step to knowing about something is to observe it both you and he have probably taken it for granted that he is already doing that when he isnt you could ask him something like have you ever taken really good look at what your wife is doing or some such when you are teaching someone about study you take the obvious and expand it as an introduction to the field in dissemination you are not up against societys ignorance cussedness or unwillingness to be helped but against incorrect study tech and charge on study this jams your comm line 499incorrect study tech prohibits people from learning that there is more to know thus stultifying the intellect creating stupidity and discouraging observation therefore study is an excellent dissemination tool when disseminating stay simple concentrate on something like one learns through observation which is accomplished by observing tell them about the value of observing gaining familiarity etc dont start with the arc triangle the person that you are disseminating to doesnt know that knowledge hasnt already all been found out he has to come to realize that he can learn and that there is more to know since he first tried to learn something he has been subjected to technology that stultifies the intellect he has weird ideas about study that make him flinch from the idea of learning things you have to make him reach by giving him the obvious which he can see take the obvious points and get studious about them you can get away with being studious about what is obvious person isnt going to get anywhere except by observation anyway let him get complex about the subject of observation he will only wind up back at observing he will get to the fact that you observe by observing after he blows through the complexity by reach and withdraw of observation he gets more familiar eg with his wife thus study can bring him out of it 6409c29 shspec41 gradients gradients are vital in all areas of scientology and life gradient is concept that has bypassed many scientologists as evidenced by the difficulty that some of them have in pulling withholds if you knew gradients well you would never have trouble with auditing pcs what you are really having trouble with isnt what you appear to be having trouble with the same applies to pc or student if you are not getting case gain on pc it could be mistake in the gradient you cant get someone over trouble that he isnt having so if you process his problem and he doesnt get better you have him over his head on what he can confront and handle what he complains of may not be the real problem at all some processes like what could you confront handle this automatically this doesnt mean that you dont have to follow gradient in your address to the case you should plan it on gradient processes are all designed with the idea of starting with little and moving up to lot the classification program is designed the same way as the auditor moves up in class he can handle more difficult pcs and more of the pcs case you can handle just about anything by tackling the first fundamental thing first and taking on more and more bit by bit in lots of research people have never gone to the fundamentals they have never asked what they were looking for or where to approach it or observed some obvious basics for instance you can examine sound gross vibration with light fine vibration but you cant examine light with sound you cant look at it with anything but itself the only thing that can look at color light waves is you the color wheel cant be circle the same color appearing at the other end of the spectrum must be matter of harmonics this gets into taste you are the only thing that can evaluate color harmonics when you dont know about gradients you try to build castle on top of palace on top of condition that you call the pcs case without going to the fundamentals knowing what you are looking for or where to approach it or observing some obvious basics this happens because you never walked up the gradient and never saw the fundamentals of th pcs case you only wind up with notion of the fantastic complexities of existence if ones observations are nonsense then ones solutions will be nonsense and if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without observing one little thing about it you will never find the gradient that leads to observation of the case approach case with the question what is he doing that i can understand you wont be able to remedy the case unless you can find one thing to handle at time on the case to remedy case find one thing you can understand about the case and fix it then find another as this proceeds the case will become simpler dont try to grasp or handle the whole damned case in two days the pc is always at the top of selfcreated gradient of complexity that he hasnt climbed and he tries to get the auditor there too so you get suckered in on it and try to solve the whole case overnight thus you get lose now take overts you ask the pc if he has ever committed crime that could send him to jail if it were discovered that is flying to the top of the building jumping the gradient and making the auditor feel as though he cant pull overts you pull overts on gradient what gradient would work first you have to take into consideration the fact that you are pulling the pcs overts on 500comm line which may be pretty tenuous to start with the comm line must be sturdy enough to hold the level of charge or overt that we want to have come over on it first build up the comm line then start getting some little overts that come across easily leading to bigger and bigger overts always pulling overts of magnitude that the pc can confront there are two gradients 1 the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor 2 the level of overt that he is willing to tell there are degrees of willingness to talk to the auditor you cant expect pc who is unwilling to talk to you to tell you some big overt once you have the comm line in the pc will be able to tell you as much as he himself can confront which will increase the more he tells you people can generally confront thought more easily than they can confront masses or things so on the pe course stick to definitions of things like life or body not necessarily even definitions of scientology terms you can blow tons of charge with nothing but definitions dont get into heavy bank stuff use light gradient definitions about thoughts are easier for people to grasp than definitions of masses if someone cant see the data that you are giving him he cant apply it and he flies up to the top floor of the building adds complexities to the data and then considers that it is complex and that there is fundamental there so he invents bunch of nonsense with regard to it misses it entirely and never gets any result with it so be careful about gradients in training the student has to be able to see and apply what you are talking about what you want to watch for in pc is glibness unreal answers and comm lag trying to find gradient to enter in on with that fellow is fantastic because he is already stuck in the top floor but unreal the gradient had better be low slow approach you have to find something about the case that you can grasp then go ahead the time to start looking for something in the case that you can grasp is when the case gets into some difficulty some lack of advance undercut the case on the basis of ability if you undercut on the basis of sanity you may insult the pc find out what the pc can really do and get him to do it better when pc doesnt advance find lower gradient find something about the pc that you can grasp the next time you feel queasy about pulling pcs overts look the situation over do you have comm line there to pull the overts on when you do the next stage is what could the guy himself confront approach the pc gradiently with questions like what have you done and why wasnt that an overt you have to keep the comm line in while pulling the overts by pulling them gradiently you can err by asking the pc for more overt than he himself can confront having done as long as you are asking for overts he can confront the comm line will stay in and your manner wont even matter asking for things that he cant confront only restimulates him it is not matter of politeness when we pick up points in the gradient of living that the person has bypassed and gotten stuck on and get him to understand them we call this clearing at those points the pc had wrong answers or omissions when those are cleared up he can confront and live life easily dont be so dedicated to the gradient that you fail to observe when someone climbs it very fast as can happen complicating factor that hasnt been recognized is peoples prior education or knowledge of some area or activity this is generally explained as natural talent or knack you can get mistaken ideas about the difficulty of auditing or about your ability to audit when the real problem is only that of approaching the case on the right gradient it is trebly important to train students on the right gradient so that people can win at it and know that they can do it and keep on doing it 6410c13 shspec42 cycles of action the importance relative value or worth assigned to datum is as important as the datum this is evaluation of importances cycles of action are fundamental of which one must be aware there is particular crisis relating to this topic except insofar as auditors have been failing to get their questions answered we are talking about cycle in the sense that wheel going around and coming back to the same place is cycle 501the word cycle has picked up some odd connotations as in the modern short story which tries to give an appearance of nochange by starting and ending in the same place in the same mood in the field of mechanics cycle is total revolution in physics and engineering cycle is the motion between the end of one wave and the end of the next wave ie the motion during one wavelength there is an old definition of cycle that has more to do with what we are talking about that is philosophical concept that doesnt involve the word cycle this concept is found in the hymn to the dawn child in the vedas it expresses that there is nothingness from which comes something that grows matures decays and returns to nebulosity and nothingness johann templehof went to india and got people from krishnamurtis group interested in scientology this annoyed krishnamurti the concept of the cycle of action gives us lots of applicable wisdom cycle of action is plot of consecutive incident against time from r6 we know that time is commonlyheld consideration it is big gpm with lot of rootwords with an endword time connected to them it is an agreedupon progress that we are all making and moving forward in view of the fact that we are all in present time since there is nowhere else to be and that we dont really move in time the incident as it goes forward appears to be plotted against time it is the incident that makes the time old humanoids have time because little happens and there is future kids days are interminable because lot happens you could boil this down to tolerance of incident it is ones tolerance for incidents that give one the impression of time going fast or slow when person has an increase in his tolerance for incident life seems to slow down if you measure time by the amount of incident occurring and then didnt have any incident you wouldnt have any time it is not that the more incident the more time you have necessarily you are dealing with false commodity for one thing and for another thing how much time you have depends on the consideration of whether lot of incident makes lot of time or little time you can practically monitor how much time you have by your consideration of how busy you want to be sometimes there gets to be too much incident so there gets to be not enough time you can manufacture time by deciding that you can confront being busier its the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtracts time from ones existence it is how much you decide that you can tolerate or confront if you have the consideration that you can be busier or that you have enough time to do something you can and will you can consider time long or short and it will be you can also get up to point where you consider time long or short without measuring it against incident you could get high enough toned to consider that evening was couple of years away and live couple of years before evening since you would thus be out of agreement with other beings it would seem that to do this you would have to have considerable tolerance for being alone for long periods of time the three actually five different attitudes towards time here are 1 unconscious 2 incident monitors the persons time here the person is at the total effect of time and he is habituated to incident monitoring his time but it is certain speed of incident that he is used to having monitor his life when the pace changes he gets reverse consideration the person never affects changes or even considers the incidents this is homo sapiens 3 person monitors time by willingness to confront incident here at the state of release the person considers one of two things if i get busy time goes faster b if i do nothing time will go faster the first of these two considerations is commonest here the being gets the idea that he can monitor time by his willingness to confront incident he can change his own pace by changing incident 4 person just postulates time this occurs around level vi here the persons considerations about time alone determine the amount of time he has he doesnt have to depend on exterior incident to consider whether much or little time goes by he can make party last long time if he wants to 5 pandetermined time at the level of ot the being might have pandetermined attitude towards time which would monitor the time of others as with sleeping beauty mesmerism provides lowerscale example of similar phenomenon with mesmerism you can put someone into total rapport where he feels and thinks the feelings and thoughts of the person who has 502him mesmerized the mesmerizer can pinch his own back and the mesmerized person will leap convulsively and have fingernail marks on his back this is form of physical pandeterminism it is quite unethical to do this on some poor sap who has only shred of selfdeterminism left but it is lower harmonic of the upperlevel pandeterminism over time to considerations about how much time is passing you could add other considerations like the consideration that the actions people are engaged in are happinessproducing actions in an area where such consideration had been made everyone would think he was doing fine you could also have the opposite consideration that the actions people are engaged in are miseryproducing actions in this case people would feel as though they were committing overts by acting this would change peoples considerations of time the main culprit in doing this is the newspaper which puts out this consideration by reporting only bad news on pandetermined basis but using very lowgrade finite comm line the newspapers are spreading the idea of worthless series of incidents this makes time worthless to people if society depends lot on whether they feel their cycle of action should or shouldnt proceed this consideration will do something to time and to the amount of doingness an action is simply motion through space having certain speed especially volitional or intended motion it has bad name in some quarters eg in literature or psychology in civil defense during crises any individual in action during an atomic attack would be put out of action local authority who is supposed to act is not being the idea is there must be action intended motion the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent in mental healing the psychiatrist thinks that someone is cured when he becomes inactive person who has label and who is active must be restrained in mysticism the wise or enlightened person is supposed to be totally motionless people would like to believe this if they are scared of ots the mystical mystic is case type he is reasonable but he wont act so the idea of time and whether incidents or action should occur gets messed up action has become dirty word you get an insane generality here the attitude that incidents should take place or lots of incidents should take place below this you get its all going on and theres nothing i can do about it its all happening to it has nothing to do with this is the sign of civilization on the decline even the person who says it has nothing to do with has to admit that it does have something to do with him when he is driven to it if you approach him closely enough with action and you will get cornered rat effect then you get an uncontrolled response like barroom brawl action gets bad connotation because it can produce destruction and pain when people cannot confront pain they are also refusing to confront action and when this happens they cease to confront incident and they wont advance cycle of action and their sense of time goes out by telling sick people to stay quiet doctors are prolonging the time for them telling them to have activity of some sort would make time pass more quickly this has remarkable effect on healing where more action is demanded of person than he can confront pugnacity sets in so you get destructive action which is more action than anyone can confront as with hitler who created too much action this gives people the false idea that the cycle of action always ends in decay and death because this is what it looks like in the physical universe it is here that we depart from the cycle of action depicted in the hymn of the dawn child we are taught this on every hand you have so many examples of cycles of action that end in death and disaster that you get reluctant to complete cycle of action this leads to such foolish ideas as i mustnt complete cycle of action on the pc because it will injure him this is the worry of an auditor who never completes auditing cycles that is what keeps people from arriving they are afraid to get to the final point or there could be something wrong with the persons considerations of cycle or action confrontation of incident may be low for instance some auditors cant confront too rapidly changing pc or too slowly changing pc this could lead to overrun if one cant confront changing the process or underrun if one thinks that completing cycles of action means killing pcs any of these difficulties with the cycle of action means trouble with the auditing cycle one way or another if an auditors comm cycle is out after he is up the line bit then this is why it is not the complexity of the process the auditor has to have his auditing cycle in for sure by the time he is auditing r6 there are 5031 considerations of cycles 2 considerations of action 3 considerations of cycles of actions in scientology cycle of action is simply from the beginning to the end of an intended action ie the start of the cycle of action would be the first appearance of the intention to do something or of the intention to begin doing it now you can also have an otherdetermined definition of cycle of action from the moment mother looks at to where she whips the selfdetermined cycle of action is from the beginning to the end of an intentional action the way to take care of trouble with the cycle of action is itsa on its elements 6410c20 shspec43 levels the reasons for them lrh had cognition khrushchev was overthrown because russia went into compulsive duplication of great britain and the us and tried to hold an election the term raw meat applies to 1 lack of processing 2 the pcs opinion of what he is someone who has actually started on r6 must not be returned to clearing or getting definitions audited etc he is sitting in an item and could pick up some other item out of sequence some endword that is out of sequence this could give him nasty somatics so there are solid technical reasons why pcs progress up the levels the original reason for levels was to stretch auditors out to what they were capable of it became obvious that pcs didnt gain well when run above their level despite their eagerness to be run on r6 the reason why john campbell parted company with lrh was his devotion to the machine he thought the ideal civilization was machines tending machines people who consider that they can formulate infallible plans for utopia dont think that people should have power of choice since it disrupts the utopian plans but the ideal plan has hardly been found on the political front as one can see in any newspaper furthermore since absolutes are unobtainable the ideal state will never be achieved beings are not all alike so who could judge when perfection had been attained you would never get complete agreement man is capable of his own judgment this alone keeps the absolute from being attained for instance what is the perfect piece of music all the way down the line the individual never completely loses his individuality integrity to himself is the last resort of thetan the individual can only be pushed so far richmond kelly turner commanded the uss astoria cruiser in world war ii he was captain blightype guy very grim lrh knew him maybe the source of mr roberts nothing on the astoria worked the crew was on white mutiny in which the crew acts only under direct orders takes initiative and executes nothing that is needed unless directly ordered to do exactly that that was their way of getting even thetan never gives up russia is one big white mutiny it is not that there is anything wrong with having rules and having people comply with them what is wrong is using duress continually to deny people any judgment or initiative with regard to the rules the gradient of ability relative to rules is 1 doesnt obey rules because he doesnt know them 2 total adherence to rules based on understanding of them 3 varying the rules based on higher understanding 504what gets interesting and can get troublesome is when you follow the rules with variations if you are trying to learn some subject follow plan or something there are two conditions that are variation from the must do it 1 total ignorance and rebellion based on aberration 2 skill and judgment enough to know which rules can be varied and how this latter condition is reached when you know the game all the way around the amateur tries to find the perfect instrument to do it the pro knows how to make use of what hes got and the rules in order to vary the rules successfully you have to know the rules cold otherwise you will fail because you are operating out of ignorance and rebellion lrh tells an anecdote about an old chinese carpenter who resists using guard on his band saw he knows what he is doing youve got to earn the right to vary the rules in life or in auditing in confronting variation from the rules the manager supervisor or whoever has to be able to differentiate between the two sources of variation ignorance or familiarity if he doesnt judgment is denied the individual who could exercise it and the supervisor gets into trouble are you dealing with ignorance or virtuosity you can enforce the rule against the person who varies it for the first reason with impunity because life is assisting you by punishing stupidity and ignorance anyway but dont shoot the second type of variation down this person has earned the right to vary the rule whether the person knows his business or not can be seen from his results if he is consistently getting results and protests the rules we can see that he is virtuoso if he is consistently unable to get results he needs more rules not less since his departure from the rules doesnt get good results the only way you will progress is over his dead body but he never dies so you cant win using force and duress against ignorance you must educate on the other hand if you combat virtuosity instead of ignorance and you create leaders for revolution that will unseat you the people who have been exported to this planet all fall into two and only two classes 1 rebellious geniuses 2 stupid criminals there is inbetween the latter rebel destructively and stupidly the former rebel intelligently they give trouble to the stupid state which thinks that it has the perfect answer one gives reactive trouble and the other gives intelligent selfdetermined trouble you had better recognize the difference between the two when you try to handle selfdetermined intelligent trouble with force this is handling thought with mass and it doesnt handle well since power of choice is the main power the person has so use duress on the former but never on the latter all protest is not the former exclusively our question in scientology is why should some people stay debased stupid and protesting becoming an ot has to do with power of choice and power of observation therefore wave of magic wand will produce an ot since it would just be another effect on the person buddha tried to wave magic wand and produces slaves horrible example of postulate gone wrong the asia minor ot j who turned leaves into loaves and fishes or whatever just impressed everyone to the point that they are still overwhumped this is probably not what he intended the unpopularity of scientology levels comes from an unfamiliarity with the road to be walked youve got to get the guy to where he can talk to an auditor enough and tolerate control enough and be keyed out enough from the mass that he is sitting in and under enough discipline to confront the objects in the bank necessary to run out to resolve his case that may take quite awhile the easiest thing to do is to unburden the case by getting locks off you do this by 1 handling the auditing environment first you unburden the session then get the pc educated into what he is supposed to do and willing to talk to the auditor you have to explain this to him and show him the auditing comm cycle get what auditing is over to the pc this is getting the pc sessionable lrh invents the term sessionable 5052 handling the betweensessions environment preparation handle ptps at first just by finding out what they are before actually auditing them we can ask the pc what the parts of his environment are cf expanded dianetics this alone helps him to sort out his problems it gives some gain get the pc to straighten out his environment so he is not sitting in his office with his house right outside the window while he is in the auditing room this is not auditing the environment it is just getting the pc to identify its parts at this point you dont want his problems with his job you just want his job named as part of his environment you are getting him sessionable which might take several sessions b auditing then you ask the pc for problems with the parts of the environment mentioned above find one that his attention is stuck on ask him what communication he hasnt completed to those terminals you handle problems very lightly but wind up with the period between sessions being clean enough so that it doesnt keep coming up at the start of each new session again this may take several sessions 3 beginning approach to the bank now we are going into the pcs past and future in 1 and 2 above we were broadening the perimeters of the pc we continue this now by beginning to handle the pcs past and future helping him to orient himself better we could run give something that happened in the past with date and place this does the same for the pcs past environment that you have done for his present environment at what is now level i you begin arc straightwire orienting the pc to his past repetitive processes if the pc gets to this point he can be audited easily 4 clay table healing using this you can straighten out the concern that the pc has about the body 5 on up the levels in completing the levels you are handling locks on gpms so they get all straightened out ready for r6 someone who hasnt been brought up through the levels isnt ready for r6 and will get into trouble 6410c27 shspec44 the failed case the book of case remedies handles the failed case look up the symptoms and handle as directed but there is one case that will always be failed case the reason lies not with the auditor scientology or the tech in 1954 lrh researched people who had turned against dianetics and scientology to find the common denominator he found about twentyone people who had been in dianetics and scientology but had worked against it and caused lot of trouble seventeen of the twentyone had criminal records also they had had auditing but had gotten case change there might have been twentyone for twentyone but lrh got tired of looking after seventeen recently lrh found out the other factor in the totally failed case the totally failed case commits more overts between sessions in pt than can be picked up in session he is the continuous pt overts case he doesnt asis things well he takes long time to get at anything he takes responsibility for anything he is hard to get in comm with etc in freudian terms he is the detached case dissociative reaction schizoid personality he admits to fantastic crimes but doesnt really consider he did them he is really saying society forced to commit or my hand stole the watch etc he says i picked up the pocket book but means my hand picked up the pocket book such case cant asis the overt because there is lie in his statement of it it is incomplete he says my hand stole the watch but the correct statement is i saw the watch and stole it with my hand he has put an alteris on the line he didnt do it it happened then there is the guy who is putting up social front and never admits anything he has done because he doesnt want to look bad to the auditor this is partly matter of getting in good comm line you can get real overts off the case by asking for horrendously exaggerated overts like have you murdered any little children lately it is trick for another gradient you can ask what are you willing to talk to about you can audit all the sexual overts off the case that you like without restimulating gpms because sex is not in the gpms or endwords as such though it forms locks on gpm endwords and root words sex is humanoid activity and the gpm words dont necessarily refer to humanoid activities 506but the real failed case commits so many overts in pt you dont have time in session to get them all off the failed case is continually committing real pt overts he is so irresponsible that the overts dont react on the meter because they are just not potentially real to him the source of small reads in r6 is running the pc where he isnt which means leaving bpc where he is if he is getting reads on any list you are using to correct this situation either the items on the lists are unreal because hes got reality on gpms being totally uneducated or hes got it all suppressed if you are running prepcheck on pc and he runs out of answers on button eg suppress dont push him on that button just because you are getting ta on it you will just restimulate the rest of the buttons ta action in prepcheck is on the process ie the whole prepcheck not on the button you happen to be running at the moment if the prepcheck is not flat when you reach the end of the buttons go through it again i know of auditing action where pc who has been getting proper ta action in the session who says i dont have any more answers to it has ever had any further answers to it there are indicators in the physical appearance and meter behavior of the pc who is running ow that there are more answers than he is willing to give only in this case do you press the question home this is not applicable to ptps withheld ptps wont hurt the pc they will only be withheld if they are connected to an overt and you will get that on ow buttons so watch out for overrun the slowest rate of change in pc is at the start of the case the case that is winning accelerates in rate of change as you audit it up the line cognitions of given magnitude come faster comm lag decreases so you have to be careful not to overrun the pc the failed case however doesnt change at all you can check rate of change of case by checking to see how many hours it takes for person to have fundamental cog of some kind at first perhaps it takes 25 hours later perhaps it only takes an hour then you get the person who audits almost by inspection the increased rate of cognition goes along with decrease in the comm lag another thing you will notice is the pcs physical posture and mannerisms if there is change in these over time if the pc keeps returning to posture or mannerism then he is not experiencing rate of change of progress another bad indicator in this respect is when nonoptimum condition persists when you see that you know that the case needs remedying the other bad indicators would be there too as an auditing supervisor you should expect to see some change within few days one way to spot what overts the failed case is committing between sessions is to listen for what he complains of in others the way you would handle the failed case would be to extend your zone of influence to include everywhere the case goes between sessions for long enough to prevent the continuous overts long enough to pull the pc out of it this would be very thoroughgoing solution and change but it is about all you could do you do what you can there is fast process to undercut the case either the furthest south process you could use to benefit the case would be justifications but you still have to get comm line established first commoner than the continuous pt overt case is the person who continually committed overts in the past and has this in restimulation the case that has lots of past overts but isnt doing them in pt is easier to handle the proper approach to this case is 1 get in comm with the pc 2 get more and more overts on gentle gradient if the case keeps getting off the same overt it has become problem as far as the mechanics of it go problem is postulatecounterpostulate therefore it floats in time this is problem about the overt it wasnt an overt in his view it was justified so in this situation you can use 1 what have you done 2 how have you justified it or 3 how wasnt that an overt this is not repetitive process ask what have you done that was harmful act and really get an answer that both of you agree was real overt this is not repetitive question it is one question that might take 25 hours of arguing back and forth about what is an overt etc chitterchat to get 507answered when youve got it then ask how was that not an overt and keep going on that one for as long as it takes to really get that answered you want to get what he really thought was unharmful about it why he really had to do it at the end of this process he will really cog dont run these two questions as repetitive process it can take long time to get them answered you are asking the questions right into the guts of aberration you are not going up on it on some gradient hoping some accident will occur you are going right down the center of the road after something that answered that question an unchanging condition comes from postulatecounterpostulate so an overt which created or sought to solve an obsessive problem hangs in time and becomes both an overt act and ptp most overts are committed as solutions this gives you another inroad to the case that keeps committing pt overts handle the overt as ptp that the pc is trying to solve you could find out what ptp are you trying to solve with overts or what have you done recently that was pretty antisocial then what problem were you trying to solve by doing that it would be an oddball problem the trouble with such case is that you are likely only to get bunch of motivators repetitive questions dont work if the question you ask the pc or his answer to it isnt real to him the fact that the pc is out of comm with you makes finding the ptp that the pcs overt is intended to solve uncertain of result however on ordinary cases it works very well to find what ptp the guy is trying to solve with his overts and doing so blows lots of overts into view that the pc might never otherwise have suspected not all overts are efforts to solve problems some are accidental some are out of misunderstoods getting the justifications off unlocks the problem aspect takes lot of locks off etc the pc will cognite on the problem and the effect can sometimes be magical none of the above will work with truly failed case type although it may sometimes nudge such case the only thing you can do with the failed case is to restrain him somehow from committing overts long enough to get him audited long enough so that he will quit committing the continuous pt overts 6411c03 shspec45 programs lrh went on flatout research excursion between 22jan63 and april of 1964 skullbuster of up to 18 hours day on the meter this resulted in the material necessary to get someone running on r6 then he saw that the low end of what was to become the grade chart the bridge was starting to get unreal to him he was beginning to pass out of any interest in levels 0iv he was understanding peoples insanity so well that he was just asising everything left right and center he didnt have to do anything about it it was beginning to look silly to him he noted this attitude growing in him he realized that this was not ok that bridge from level 0 to level vi had to be put together this project was completed in the period from april to november of 1964 with the book of case remedies clay table healing and clay table clearing during that period of wrapup lrh realized that the subject of study and education has to be clarified and improved so that the material that he had researched could be communicated study tech started from the viewpoint of what material should be communicated and how it should be communicated lrh never published his notes for this project and he has twice lost and found them all this is why lrh hasnt himself gone totally ot and departed the other recent work that lrh has done has been setting out organizational programming as laid out in recent policies it is based on selling books as dissemination tool the money received from selling books and more importantly memberships goes into sealed account for book advertising the more books are sold the more students and pcs will come in names of book buyers who havent come into the org in three to four months are sent to local franchiseholders they can longer teach hqs unless they become city offices for description of city offices see above so they will become city offices at which time they will have book accounts this is all based on the idea of pyramiding by 1968 r6 should be getting taught in central orgs training at saint hill would be purely organizational the has course is now one week of pe plus thirty to forty nights of more theory on how it is basic data there will be book of pe lectures with words defined etc the pe evening has one period of reading the text one period of discussing the words with attention to people who have earlier 508misunderstood words or subjects etc and third period in which the students write up whatever examples of what was in the text that they can give from life this gives quiet people chance to say something the pe textbook covers the whole field of ontology very thoroughly this is applied philosophy that is how you can describe scientology to people your advertising for the pe course is just that people can learn how to get along better in life than they have been people are generally aware that they can get along better the philosophy of man is an animal is saying there is nobody there to do anything about anything how can cell cure cell the book that the pe students are being taught from is available for them to have and read the phenomenon of getting more and more out of lrhs writings each time you reread them instead of going into boredom is only true of fairly searching truths and material in which new thought matter can be found it is not true of books that arent designed around the provocation of thought people go into agreement instead of boredom public presence is created it is not natural lrh also intends to write book telling students and how to study and teach what they are studying and teaching how to handle slow students etc that would answer all academic questions with regard to scientology it would be textbook on study and if it worked for education it would give ue stable datum that some part of scientology worked showing that it is workable subject the only trouble that lrh is having with this project is making the textbook complicated enough for college professors to respect it and use it these people look down on things that are easily understood things like awe and reverence shouldnt be mixed in with education i know that if college professor sees something simply phrased in its totality of simplicity then he will immediately relegate it to the first grade teacher i know better than to use prerogative when i mean right but the professor absolutely dies if he doesnt have an adverbial clause modifying participial phrase of some character which syntaxes itself to death people have the idea that there are certain poses and pretences and styles that are necessary however when you enter falsity into subject it may endure longer but it wont work right if something isnt running right or is overly hard to handle there is lie connected with it if the pcs ptp keeps hanging up and ot handling despite your correct attempts to handle it you can be sure that there is lie connected with it either the pc isnt hung up in ptp or the ptp being put forward by him is known and outrageous lie or it is continuing to be ptp because the pc has told someone some falsehoods connected with it we cannot asis it because it doesnt have in it what it is supposed to have in it anyhow the problem is how much lrh will concede to the professors in order to get the comm line and study tech in without going into too much falsity book of policies is also being published which will help to ensure that organizational expansion can occur in an orderly fashion early on some guys thought that scientology was business where you made lot of bucks scientology is an activity which if done well gives you the additional embarrassment of getting rid of money lrh used to amuse himself at parties by telling peoples fortunes by looking at their banks wearing bath towel on his head with woolworth diamond you cant observe the pc without occupying the viewpoint of the auditor 6411c10 shspec46 ptps overts and arc breaks there is another style of auditing between level 0 and level 2 see hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing it is version of guiding style without repetitive commands it is guiding style that goes into itsa coffeeshop style lrh is talking about guiding secondary style here this is outlined in hcob 12nov64 scientology ii pc level 0iv definition processes p 2 you can herd pcs into line by multiple acknowledgment 509the styles of auditing parallel the return of selfdeterminism to the auditor progression upwards through the styles of auditing goes along with an increase in the auditors ability to occupy viewpoint and therefore observe the error in training is to demand more of the lowerlevel auditor than he can possibly deliver eg having level 0 auditor finding out from the pc what is troubling him before having him talk about it listen style is the hardest for the instructor to judge and at first for the student to do because it is so simple that the student adds all sorts of complexities you must adjust your supervision to this simplicity there are three actually six barriers to case improvement 1 ptps 2 ptps ld 3 overts and withholds 4 overts and withholds ld 5 arc breaks 6 arc breaks lb these are potentially present in any session at any level we dont try to handle them at level 0 and 1 they come into action at level ii with the things given in the book of case remedies the woof and warp of any case is composed of certain mental makeup of combination of chronic or continuous nature in any pc there is chronic case messup then you have those things that keep the basic aberrations from unraveling these are the things that keep the case from being entered and that prevent the pc from being in session given that he does have an auditor any of these things can be chronic or immediate continuous or temporary an overt act will go into action only when restraint is put on it in the form of some sort of withhold the person becomes guilty etc since you have to have secrecy you have to have censure and with censure there is need for secrecy when being doesnt think an action is good he goes into being made guilty hence the overtmotivator sequence hence the connection between the feeling of guilt and on the one hand feeling that one has done wrong and on the other hand the feeling that one will be punished the overt is prior to the withhold you should classify overt withhold and missed withhold processes all under overts there are lots of things to know about overts and lots of processes for running them the present existence of problem is worse than its problematic nature the ptps floatingness in time is what is peculiar to it and what makes it get in the way of auditing it was looking at the ptp that got lrh into discovering gpms on politicalphilosophical level the problem appears as dialectical materialism which says that force vs force produces ideas dialectical materialism is making philosophy of and deifying the problem although dialectical materialism says that force vs force produces ideas it is actually the other way round since actually idea vs idea produces force the idea that force makes ideas is just an expression of the man from mud theory if neither postulate of problem overcomes the other force accumulates on them and the forces will counteroppose if they are in balance they will hang up in time only those problems that are held in this delicate balance hang up and become ptps to get rid of problem one postulate or the other must give way if one side can overbalance the other the problem slips and doesnt remain ptp past problems may be solved by overbalancing without really being resolved these may still exist in the past but they are not floating up to pt ptps still have an exact balance on both sides the cold war of russia vs the us has slipped since the idea of coexistence crept into the ussr if as an auditor you realize that not every problem needs to be handled but only the ones that are so delicately balanced your job will seem easier since there have been lots of problems in thetans whole existence the balance is actually so delicate that any little nudge will change it and let it slip away you sometimes see pc struggling to hold onto ptp that has been way of life after the auditor has knocked it off its pins the pc has still got tremendous accumulated forces involved in its solution 510a routine is something you use to change an aspect of the pcs case it always works unless there is ptp overt or arc break in the way an arc break is actually tickling of some major restimulation of something in r6 list 1 is adequate to key it out it is direct shortcircuit into the bank there are actually very few things in chronic restimulation in the bank the primary one is difficulties with communication that is the primary endword that gets into restimulation there is real reason why anyone should communicate with anyone about anything when you run recall time you communicated you are actually running 268 gpms all at once so wonder the pc feels better afterwards and when something goes wrong with your comm cycle that upsets the pc exactly what the pc does at that point is probably the rootword when you quiet it down by locating and indicating the bpc you just drop it back to its former status you havent done anything for the pcs case but you have made him auditable the big buttons in the bank are 1 communication 2 time 3 havingness these things like time problems and bits of items like havingness are the things that are in chronic restimulation but the aberrative value of havingness compared to communication and time is miniscule communication is way back on the series communication and time are in restimulation all the time or for one thing there wouldnt be any time that is one reason why waiting is so upsetting that means that you go after arc breaks with feather touch to key them out dont audit them or you will mess the pc up by keying in communication harder knowing that these three phenomena are what keep case from being audited keeps you from being confused by all the possible manifestations which do in fact boil down to these categories ptps ow and arc breaks the pc can be troublesome case trouble source because he has someone on the other side of him who doesnt want him to improve he will try to get better to prove the other person wrong which gives him ptp resulting in case gain overts carry lot of different reactions depending on things like the persons responsibility level they are source of change not fixedness in case the case shifts does well at times gets sporadic results etc the pc wont let himself get any better he has odd computations like the idea that if he gets strong he might commit overts you would get the same manifestation of rollercoaster gain in pts condition if there is someone in the persons environment who keeps knocking him down whenever he gets better the mechanism is withhold when person has tremendous number of overts that remain constant he is trying to solve problem with overts that is the usual reason for the overts the overt can be on the part of the person or of society over the course of an intensive or longer cycle you have to get sufficient gain to get the pc up high enough so that the gates dont get closed in your face by his committing more overts before you get to audit him again the reason the psychiatrist damages people is that his problem is that of preventing people from damaging other people your problem then would be social problem in dealing with the continuous pt overt case you would have to solve this problem before you could make progress with the case the nochange overt case goes up and down little unlike the ptp case the pc may refrain from committing overts for awhile so overts cause change on graphs constantly but not steadily with fluctuating graph you could also be facing pts situation the main problem relating to overts is whether the pc will be damaged by motivators running overts can backfire if you let the pc get off only wholetrack overts because they are safe or miniscule overts critical thoughts etc such pc is dodging continuous pt chain of overts the pc with continual outrud is arc breaky if you try to get him to put his attention elsewhere because when you take his attention away from the charge of the outrud it hits him hes got to have it remedied before he can be run on routine fortunately not all pcs need much remedying the book of case remedies is basically just batch of methods for putting in ruds you can be as nice as you want about pulling withholds but remember that it must be done and that fact may put you beyond niceness once in awhile eg you might have to say something like ok 511come back for some more auditing when you have decided to tell what you have done thats lfing 6411c17 shspec47 styles of auditing reference hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing getting the different auditing styles clarified and formalized will make learning to audit easier over the years many auditing styles have developed to deliver different processes repetitive commands came in in 195556 along with trs muzzled auditing followed to handle auditors who messed up pcs with interruptions comments etc more recently with lrhs work on the comm cycle and the discovery that auditors werent really listening listen style was developed for prepchecking and sec checking where you steer the pc around another style was developed guiding style now that we have all the processes all the styles are there in order of developing an auditors skill as he goes up the levels the higher you go the more precise your auditing is but also the higher you go the more sloppy your auditing may look at the level of r6 the pc is going through so much and changing so fast that the auditor has to be able to shift and change rapidly in order to keep up with the pc and his mind and in order to do just what is necessary to keep the pc running down the bank pc has to be up aways to be able to have allstyle auditing for the pc to be up to standing allstyle auditing would require high level of confidence in auditors and acquaintance with different styles of auditing so the unpredictability of allstyle auditing would throw the pc off if this was the first style he had encountered auditing the pc at lower levels would give him more certainty if you ran r6 on raw meat you might get away with it but the first mess you got into would be the end of the pc hes got confidence in auditing and reliance on scientologys ability to handle ptps to fix him or rescue him etc there is case factor also preventing new pc from being audited on r6 the worse off someone is the more important he is and the more exaggerated his ideas of his ability are hes got hidden standards outconfront etc etc there isnt much you could do if you put the pc on r6 and he spun so dont do it you are making yourself the effect of his bank most people start their auditing in total desperation in fear of going out the bottom getting up to the point where they know that they wont get any worse release is major improvement it doesnt necessarily take long time to do this you might tend to overrun the pc unless you observe well and note the acceleration of gain that occurs dont cut off pc cogs furthermore you are handling level of case that is voluntarily trying to improve which means that there is some spark of responsibility for self improvement and some idea that the person can do something about it people can go so far downscale that they think nothing can be done about anything then you get socialist or communist state to take care of them one reason why governments call scientology fake is that they have the opinion that nothing can be done and scientology is claiming that it can do something through pcs course of auditing we must keep the pc winning so that self at cause keeps coming up it is easier to make someone better than to make him worse he resists getting worse but doesnt resist getting better when he realizes that he can and must do something to get better and that he will not get worse be will be release the auditing styles can be plotted against the most likely win for the pc at given stage of his auditing how you audit pc is at least as important as what you audit just the mechanics of auditing are therapeutic regardless of the process they are applied to first the pc discovers that he can talk to someone then he discovers that he can answer question when he is asked one there is some 8c in this that is beneficial as well as duplication which he has fallen away from he cant be anything because he cant duplicate anything unless you have gotten someone out of this kind of condition he cant confront existence thetan can only be what he can see he can only see what he can duplicate it is hard to get duplication of an accident or crime because person cant be it therefore he cant see it this leads to slight occupational liability as an auditor you are looking at pc all the time that you dont particularly want to be youre trying to improve him arent you fortunately it isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well because we have the whole anatomy of the reactive bank and there is sense in it if the pc hadnt made the reactive mind and the gpms he would be virtually unaberratable there would be dwindling spiral because the thetan would 512have to determine to have something wrong with him thetan had to decide to be aberrated he did it but almost accidentally having done it he was too stupid to get out of his trap there are different degrees of aberration based on the locks and the tendency of the reactive mind to group bunch up and get into restimulation there are some basic things that can go wrong with thetan which are above the level of the bank and gpms these include duplication and communication duplication and communication can be aberrated regardless of endwords there are endwords there too but these are highlevel ideas common to all thetans with or without banks pc should be able to communicate and duplicate pretty well they do improve up to the point where he can confront his bank at level 0 the pc knows that he has communicated because the auditor received the communication at level i the pc knows he has received communication because he has answered it and the auditor is satisfied with the fact that he has answered the communication if the auditor lets the pc receive communication or question that he doesnt answer the pc is unsatisfied because knowing that he didnt answer the question he starts doubting his ability to receive communication at this level he finds that not only can he answer question but also he can answer it repetitively this is big change for many people when pc can answer question repetitively that is even better than just being able to answer question that is why we say i will repeat the auditing command see abridged style below guiding style at this level we are handling the pcs finding out that there is something there to the pc the whole world is reasonless he is starting out at lower harmonic of the truth namely that there is nothing there and that he has reason to be upset about anything he says i feel nervous today and sees cause for it the biggest cog here is that there are causes for things for one thing he will realize that he is not just natively stupid or that life doesnt have to be mess something could be causing the condition he is in the pc needs to get the idea that conditions dont just happen but are caused by things and that be is longer just pawn if things cause things you might be able to predict if things cause things you might be able to do something about something if things cause things you might be able to do something about yourself guiding secondary style this comes out of guiding style auditing steer plus itsa is the process that goes with it you find it and bleed it remedy and b level ii locates causes without knowing the cause person is dispersed all over the universe finding the cause and then doing something about it is terrific abridged style when he has learned all that it is safe to run him on an abridged style we can look and see what is going on the reason why at levels i and ii you always say ill repeat the auditing question when the pc hasnt answered it is that you are teaching the pc that he can receive and answer an auditing question at level iii this is not necessary anymore and it may be irritating to the pc he already knows that he can get the command so you have abridged style in which the auditor and the pc can look and see what is going on this is an abridgement of lower not upper styles the pc says he has ptp you dont guide him into it you just ask what is it it usually blows so you then drop it the pc can asis things more easily now you audit purely against finite result to the point of getting to happen what you want to have happen and further the pc learns that when he gets audited something happens direct style now weve got direct style auditing getting the exact result applies even more here you go direct to the result 6412c15 shspec49 communication gradient on duplication level 0 and level i are laid out and the materials exist for levels ii iii iv and vi see hcopl 11dec64 full table of courses and classifications the pe course is back down below level 0 and the has course is in the academy with strict curriculum it includes axioms and other bits and pieces hqs is what old hcahpa was when you go all the way to the top it is then very easy to see what lies between you and the bottom that is what has happened mow we can see what an auditor has to go through and achieve to get all the way up unnecessary parts of training have been eliminated without leaving gaps that people could fall into 513you can tend to discount how much auditing you have had when you get up near the top that would be one reason why you would think you could take new pc and run him at once on r6 thinking that he is where you are as case when he isnt person who is perfect and has problems 1 is very delicate 2 commits overts the case who never finds anything to audit because he is perfect must be audited very delicately person may get full complement of motivators from something yet still assert that is was right if such person were to admit to or confront single little fault ie give up service fac it would be to him the final degradation he is very overty but he is at point where if he admitted that he had ever done anything wrong he would slip over the edge of degradation that he has been clinging to and start asserting his rightness by being even wronger like kid breaking windows who keeps on doing it trying to assert the rightness of what he is doing manifest insanity is confirmation of an error you have to increase the cases responsibility by series of steps the only trouble you have had with pcs has come from not going up through the steps necessary to keep the pc winning getting gains that are real to the pc the book of case remedies is the totality of level ii overts and ptps but the pc has to be gotten up to the point where he can be run on the processes in the book of case remedies there are certain things senior to the bank on which thetan would be able to be aberrated whether he had bank or not though without bank the thetan could get unaberrated again without auditing the design of the bank is what gives the thetan the dwindling spiral but if thetan werent aberrated and had designed reactive mind he could determine to spin in on spiral now that he has that skill because he has done it but he couldnt have realized how much trouble he would get into he is capable of miscalculating which is fascinating ability to have the thetan is natively capable of getting into more trouble than he can see thetan is capable of having these things happen or making things happen to himself he is capable of setting up masses to suspend in time the masses gpms create time but it is difficult for thetan to aberrate himself to such degree that he cant recover the only way he could recover is to block out duplication cf the axioms that which you dont asis will endure forever if thetan is unwilling to duplicate something it will endure the only way thetan can erase something is to be willing to duplicate it eg if you are unwilling to be like person you will get madder and madder at the person to the point where he will disappear not by being asised but because you cant see him anymore he is still there thus you have universe thetan is nothing and he is unwilling to be something so you get masses and they endure because the thetan wont asis them so he makes bank which tells him what he should and shouldnt be willing to duplicate this bank had two halves 1 the cowboys in the white hats which he was willing to duplicate so they disappeared 2 the cowboys in the black hats which he wasnt willing to duplicate so they became more real and solid this leads to the dwindling spiral communication can be lower gradient on duplication that leads to more willingness to duplicate as well as the other way around the rough part of the bank is duplication you could take some other part of the comm formula drill it and start to knock out the duplication hangup with communication you might get over the obsession not to duplicate without getting an obsession to duplicate you knock out the ferocity of dont ever be that as when you say to yourself i must never never never be bum on skid row and then you must obsessively duplicate the bum by becoming one you get out of compulsive and inhibited actions by communication if person cant stand the thought of an auto accident he wont be able to duplicate car communicate with it or control it and he will crash the remedy would be to have him touch car this shows why touch assists and processes of communication with aberrated body parts or whatever are so effective you become what you resist in other words that which you are unwilling to duplicate will persist and eventually overwhelm this is not to say that you have to obsessively duplicate either mere experiencing of something is nontherapeutic communication 514with something is therapeutic if you are afraid of being an alcoholic dont try it out communicate with alcoholics or with something relating to this subject then the refusal to duplicate clicks out give the alcoholic bottle or glass to communicate with but dont let him experience it run reach and withdraw on it or on photos of skidrow bums wilson newlyappeared political figure has 48 hour comm lag between his saying i will never and his doing it he is nearly nuts and never notices that he is doing this if hes agin it he is going to be doing it to be it why was i so angry about it yesterday im it the bank says that 50 of existence must be shunned and the other 50 is love it gotta be it cherish it so of course the universe will eventually become the 50 you mustnt have anything to do with you do not have to experience something in order to duplicate it the things that bug you are the things you mustnt be or have anything to do with and if you cant comm with something you cant hold it off how do you keep one boat from smashing another if you mustnt have anything to do with boat hook there are gradients in the field of duplication making drawings is duplication and telling about them is communication so that would help out kid who was having trouble you could get him up to drawing what he didnt like about school drawing school in 3d etc cf play therapy in which the kid is encouraged to demonstrate with toys the various aberrative parts of his life just dont make it too steep gradient having to experience is an outgradient you collapse terminals with the thing that you are experiencing how can you hold anything off if you cant communicate with it also if you cant duplicate something you cant handle it putting it all on communication activity would be less likely to go too steep 8c is steep process because it asks the pc to communicate with mest which is the one thing he doesnt want to duplicate also this process is run duplicatively therefore communication like with the cowboys in the black hats is the key that unlocks duplication it is what you monitor case by and what you try to solve first not only with regard to levels but also at the beginning of every session you could use gradient of duplication instead of gradient of communication though it is hard to assess the gradient properly using duplication and the pc will hit too steep gradient and blow if you approach the whole thing on communication gradient you will give the pc very gentle gradient communication as word happens to be part of the reactive bank an endword but this doesnt matter however just because you have gotten the pc past level 0 it doesnt mean that you have got rid of his reactive mind or his peculiarities as thetan you will never get rid of the latter cleared thetan without bank will still have slump spots centered around communication duplication making things unmaking things persistence any value that time might be and value there is to experience etc he will make and unmake pictures of things he will have an aberratable pattern that isnt planned then he could just look at this small aberration and it would asis he asises things very easily because he doesnt have it all hanging on earlier similars in bank there are certain factors in person regardless of his experiential track for instance the fact that communication knocks out refusals to duplicate this comes up in lot of cognitions nonduplication decision goes along with noncommunication actions 8c is hard because youre asking him to communicate with mest and that is the one thing he will not be it makes quite process 8c also handles unwillingness to duplicate clever auditor always reestablishes the pcs communication where it ought to be before going on to do anything else so if pc is not in comm you must find out why we know the key points withholds ptps and overts they all have outofcomm to them an overt is regretted communication ptp is started but not completed and thereafter refused communication withhold is an unwillingness to communicate if you partially communicate with an unwillingness to communicate youve got missed withhold this is particular kind of problem broader look at this area is given by the fact that the pc has ptp because he is unwilling to duplicate something or someone youve got to be careful not to throw the pc into the bank with gradient if the pc gets misemotional you are on an outgradient because the person is experiencing something rather than communicating push person into situation where there is noduplication decision and communication with that and powie he interiorizes into that very point this can also throw the pc into gpms and endwords of duplication and communication and their negatives communication is the solvent that handles nonduplication as you audit the pc normally youve got destimulative factor you are putting the pc more thoroughly in comm with his bank without throwing him into it ie without experiencing it if you skip the communication you will get the 515obsessive duplication the experiencing the dramatization you could develop process that would do this to the pc one such process would be what wouldnt you mind going out of arc with more direct one would be what dont you like duplicate it though the latter would be therapeutic on some pcs or by making guy wrong you can prove to him that he is duplicating something that he has said he would never duplicate this is the psychiatric approach you hate your father so you are being him arent you the reason why you cant just process pc all the way north with communication is that you have to pay attention to the complexity of the bank eg service facsimiles the bank is complex enough so that the pc will have to confront and undo it you have to pay attention to the pcs physical peculiarities the pc is going to run into some corner of the bank and you have to pay attention to it you must find areas that the pc can asis and walk him into them but you are not just auditing the pc vs the bank there is the environment full of other peoples banks etc so you have to make fast gain you have to have enough of gradient so that the pc knows that he has made gain and enough gain so that he wont get squashed before the next session you can get rid of bad habits in the pc not by direct attack on them but by general comm process washing out all unwillingness to duplicate if thetan could duplicate he wouldnt need habit to handle it cf earlier data on circuit as substitute for confront see p 47 above person getting extricated from his own bank is also mixed up with other banks also he is still eating dont advise people to experience life if you find some guy that is awfully slow to bring up the line why dont bring him up yourself he has had plenty of time to do himself in and some people have simply done better job of it than others 6503c02 shspec53 technology and hidden standards economics and organizations are matter of the mest universe let give you tip if someone around you or your organization is having trouble with organizational matters you just processed them subjectively too long it doesnt matter how long you process them subjectively now they are not going to go anyplace the trouble with them is objective you want to give the objectivetype processes not subjective organizational tech is being formed up into courses for the business world it has taken two to three years to plow this line now that we have product to put on the line it will go like crash dissemination techniques have been worked up out of the materials of scientology which have only to be written up and issued lrh has found all the points where organizations dont expand and found what makes them not expand what contracts them etc you end up with formulas that you can give to the janitor to apply to his job and he will look them over and see that they make sense his willingness to work was jammed by his ignorance of the law that governed that work under its various conditions all you have to do is to know and use the formulas if you apply them backwards you shrink and collapse it is longer question of our arriving before everything blows up we have made all our deadlines the questionable period is behind us organization is important to build scientology up to civilization level our intentions are good so we will make it it is now foregone conclusion that we will make it as soon as the materials are in your hands you cant help but make it in the human race and in the mind there is barrier called the hidden standard when anyone is critical they are apparently criticizing against hidden standard of behavior they seldom tell you what the behavior should be only what it shouldnt be or if they say what the behavior should be it is in antipathetic terms there is definition of normal person hence abnormal is defined against hidden standard the communist ideal would be anonymous this is weird person who is doing job should make known that he is the one doing it if someone isnt known he gets reward it is possible to develop odd tests for deciding what is good or right eg choosing doctor for appointment to hospital on the basis of his sports career examination and selection of personnel gets into trouble continually for lack of proper standard the hospital blames the medical school for not training good doctors but the hospital is setting up hidden standard and blaming the school for not 516delivering without saying what they want delivered marriages are made miserable by the hidden standards that spouses run on each other they dont make clear what they want when they say that they want good spouse eg the wife says you are not an adequate husband the husband says i guess im not an adequate husband but the wifes standard remains hidden she doesnt describe it to him you could handle marital problems organizationally by finding hidden standards auditors come up against this often you as an auditor have to face up to pcs who are running hidden standard on you all the time what you are looking at is not really standard but perverted standard it is not real standard nobodys ever acknowledged this standard and that holds it apart from the time track the auditor should acknowledge the standard so that it doesnt get parked on the time track the standard is the collection of nonacknowledgments that the individual has if you want to end cycle of action acknowledge if you dont want to end cycle of action dont acknowledge in auditing if you dont want to end cycle you halfacknowledge as way of keeping someone going full acknowledgment of cycle ends it nonacknowledgment keeps it going that is why people tend to get uglier not prettier one ever says my you look ugly today one reason why person gets fixed on human bodies is that one said oh i see you are man this lifetime this datum is very applicable to registrars as well as auditors if you acknowledge the person before he arrives he wont arrive nobody will appear for training or processing if you acknowledge heavily the right way to handle letter from someone who announces his intention to come for training or processing is to be courteous and not too definite give some information but not solid acknowledgments people generally work towards beingness they dont function so well just being post this is question of acknowledgment which ends cycle on the post retirement is an acknowledgment of persons total active life it ends the life in many cases it ends life in any form military commissions act as an invitation to overthrow ones superiors because commission is not granted by saying thank you for having been lower post you now have the right to work toward commissioned post corporal would function much better if on attaining his new rank he were to be congratulated not on being corporal but on having been private and on having attained the right to work towards becoming lance corporal if persons rank or position is bestowed as an accomplishment rather than as challenge or becomingness then the cycle has been ended before it began by being prematurely acknowledged the only way person can get in trouble is to be george smith while hes pretending to be his post there is the post which is set of beingnesses and lines and actions and policies all by itself and theres being who runs the set of beingnesses lines actions and policies which is the hat george smith must not operate as george smith when he is supposed to be being or attaining say the post of d of t there is hat and then there is being who runs the hat to get hat on you must put it in category of being in the process of being attained once it is attained and acknowledged it ends so as an auditor you have to be careful what and how and when you acknowledge if arthur says that he has had horrible day at school lrh doesnt acknowledge with good he would use something more sympathetic and really acknowledge it so that it could go onto the backtrack you have the power to put someones past on the past track and to give them future if you want to kill them dead acknowledge everything with crash this gives them future be little doubtful about someones future plans dont use certain solid acknowledgments then give the discussion good acknowledgment recognize that datum like this with lot of uses could easily gang agley on the back track it would get perverted messed up etc from this datum could arise such things as hidden standards and amnesia getting shot is too solid an acknowledgment of lifetime so one forgets it that is the basic mechanism behind nonrecall of past lives things that arent acknowledged because they are totally out of agreement while the good things are acknowledged these unacknowledged things bring about condition where everything disappears out of the persons past except the nonacknowledged things that people thought were silly or that they protested or that they were upset about this gives you decay of personality as person moves along the time track whether the person has gpms or not though without gpms the person could do and undo the aberrations almost at will person should know that he has tendency to collect all those things that were never acknowledged that is because the individual has some dependency on the comm formula as long as person has any desire to communicate he will be liable to malfunction of certain parts of the comm formula and when these parts go awry things do go weird person could regulate his conduct by knowing what parts of the comm formula were good and what parts were bad which parts would natively get him 517into trouble and which wouldnt if youre gonna associate with your fellow beings youre going to have to use the communication formula one way or another you will have to know how it works the part that acknowledgment plays etc the comm formula can have things go wrong with it so there is potential for native aberration there is direct source of direct aberration plus the native aberration of beings the two can work together gpms which are agreedupon aberration can hold lesser stuff native aberration eg failed acknowledgments etc in place and give them aberrative force and importance insanity could be two things 1 the persons collection of unacknowledged things 2 outright gpm commands to be nuts crazy person is doing lot of things that have never been agreed with and therefore have never been acknowledged you dont have to agree with something in order to acknowledge it where you have both factors working together the gpms make the unacknowledged things very solid and very much in force you know that the pc will run into aberration of this sort at levels vi and vii the latter is power processing he runs into the collection of nonagreedwith things the bank itself has lots of charge the nonagreedwith things locks carry very little charge the pc assigns the values wrongwayto especially at first because he assigns aberration to what he can confront so youve got 1 the bank 2 the accidents and incidents of livingness the power of these two is eight billion to one but it appears to be the reverse because that is all the thetan can confront you can key out the locks and pat the bank back into place this in itself is fantastic improvement over what anyone has been able to accomplish before there are hidden standards about what we are supposed to be accomplishing nobody will admit that you have reached any state because they have never told you what state you were supposed to reach in the first place amongst your fellow human beings this kind of cycle takes place you finish the pc up in session he feels good then he runs into the human race after the session they run hidden standard on him and try to make him prove that he is now in better state the hidden standard interferes with delivery there is point in talking to someone about clear or release youve got to talk scientology in terms that are real in relation to the goals of the person to whom you are talking or you will trip all over his hidden standards about the only standard you could have for clear is fn at clear read the standard for release is do you think that you will get any worse people have hidden standards about who you should be to audit them what condition they should be in in order to have had case gain etc you could run who would i have to be to audit you and acknowledge the dickens out of it for any condition you have described as better condition in scientology there is hidden standard and hidden standard exists even for known standards for instance you say we require pink sheet but they keep bringing you green ones saying is this what you want what happens is that the individual with his concatenation of non acknowledged ideas adds up to nonobservational point he cant observe from this point he cant tell where he is or what you are saying to him about how he should be etc cf earlier material on service facs as substitute for observation safe assumptions etc see hcob 6sep63 scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling hcob 160ct63 r3sc slow assessment the pc will keep trying to bail himself out provided you dont overwhelm him with things to bail or give him nothing just give him things to bail with within his understanding and ability to confront and he will eventually float in that way you dont q and with his hidden standards you never realize how much better you are than yesterday because you are experiencing negative gain it is longer wrong with you so of course you are not now worrying about it 518just attesting level and getting certificate acknowledges the entire level the session the auditing etc the attestation keys it out and puts it on the back track this way also the pc doesnt get stuck in win hidden standard because of hidden standards the only safe way to evaluate case progress is mechanical method such as meter and completed cycle of processes it so happens that if the pc does complete the cycle of processes he will have case gain and this can be strung out along levels with such basic processes that you dont have different pcs all the time an unwritten standard is hidden you may feel that there is hidden technical standard this is an alteris what has happened is just that there is material that has not yet been released nobody is trying to hide any technology your best answer to the pcs hidden standards is to hold to your standard technology and just take the pc on up the line with q and 6503c09 shspec54 the new organizational structure expansion shows up weaknesses it is like turning on magnifying glass the problem that person has who is not doing well in business is that he is being and not doing to understand an org you must understand the formula of life living is having and following purpose livingness has to do with the doingness of life here is further test of an org could you take central org pattern and reduce it to city office size see above for description of what city office is and have it still work if the big pattern doesnt smoothly reduce it wont smoothly expand brief org structure div 1 idea hco issues data on processing div 2 management training and processing services div 3 pick up and police collects money and takes care of mest they are

higher in the hierarchy and located elsewhere he judges only on statistics 6503c16 shspec55 the progress and future of scientology in 1950 people used to yammer at lrh about fixing up the organization he was caught flatfooted when dmsmh was published one expected it to be bestseller but it was and it stayed at the top of the list for months the publishing firm that published it was overwhelmed by it when others set up the foundation and asked lrh to run it he said ok but he had management control he proposed some ideas then which are only now being put into action until about july 1950 his attitude was well i just wrote it the name lrh was getting very popular but he was trying to avoid the hat but he was setting the place up giving eight hours or so of lecture day getting the building the furniture etc the building had three main railroad lines one on each side lrh used to fix up pcs that other auditors couldnt handle he started the has course using the data straight out of book one the students all went onto the original hca course the word hubbard in hubbard dianetic auditor and in other titles was chosen by the elizabeth and auditors lrh went along with it with certain misgivings few days before the publication of dmsmh palmer at the explorers club offered lrh an expedition to the dodecanese 519islands south of greece to find sunken ship with statuary the deeper into 1950 it got the better the expedition looked the organization took more and more of lrhs time lrh was still telling people this kind of thing the general manager said to lrh you must front up the organization these people are depending on you lrh found out that joe winter was squirreling telling people that dianetics was developed by some nonexistent group of scientists and that auditing was an art with nothing scientific about it contemporary subjects were things like psychodrama moreno et these things looked good but they didnt work so two hours after the first meeting of the dianetic foundation lrh put his time on the line and took responsibility for the development of the subject rather reluctantly he wasnt prepared to make his life an open book because it was too incredible for people to believe and they would call him liar lrh is not in bad favor with washington senators etc in 1955 if he had wanted to lrh could have gotten legislation passed that would have protected scientology the fbi was very nice when he wanted to find out who out of about 200 staff people were communists they told him who were not communists about thirty out of 200 there was an airplane waiting to take lrh to st louis and put him in spinbin fortunately the people who were sent to get him werent as well trained in combat as he was he took care of them this all occurred subsequent to lrh taking on his hat it has taken fifteen years to get to state where the hat could be worn because lrhs hat assaults the foundations of the society we live in by talking about freeing man bettering man etc ours is philosophy that says that people cant be lied to that we can see through the black magic spells this is an interesting civilization because people dont know who they are where they are where they are going or what they are doing you start laying truth on the line and confusion starts to blow off the early days of dianetics followed that rule we got through it because in july 1955 lrh wore his hat of being him and one has been able to throw him off it since lrh is also capable of occupying subordinate role lrh worried for awhile that he was one of those guys who can only lead and cannot follow however he was delighted to find out in the navy that he was also an excellent subordinate but to occupy topdog role all the way up you know theres government or any mystic vision back of you and confront everything simultaneously and stand there regardless of the dead cats the alarm clocks and bricks and everything else which are coming your way that took some doing and thats all you look at when you look at this early history it was stable datum going into very very aberrated world from where i looked it looked awful lonesome occasionally it took some doing and some confront we have changed things in the world we have changed psychology for one thing it wasnt done alone early staffs took beating at times eg in philadelphia when fifteen or twenty cops came to arrest lrh as witness in bankruptcy hearing by the time the federal marshalls got to lrh they were utterly demoralized they took him downtown before judge and there was great embarrassment when the lies from the wichita foundation were uncovered but we have been standing still waiting for the dead cats to clear from the air our early history is that of trying at first unsuccessfully to just hold position putting in dianetics as stable datum blew off enough confusion in the society so that we could move for long time it was impossible to hold position stably hence the way the early foundations moved around lrh was standing there as being but as an organization we couldnt stand up lrhs idea was to do his research and get it to the point where there was dependable gain there for every case easily attainable and deliverable he paid attention to the dead cats that may have been rough on people the group has been asking him to advance line into society while he has been fixing up the technology so that it could be delivered he has kept organizations running but he has not put much time in on organization comparatively in the early days the reason we didnt deliver was that there was way to enforce the way to do it dianetics got enturbulated because unstraight tech poorly delivered prevented case advance and there wasnt any way you could discipline the administration of the technology to discipline the administration of the tech the following is required 1 youve got to have the technology and not hidden standards 2 youve got to be able to make it known 3 you have to police its use ie to make sure that it is that technology that is applied 520that is the 123 of an administration early on we lacked not only the tech to handle simple things like ow and pt concerns of the pc but also the means to see that what we did have got applied dianetics was not and we are not just an idea book copyright or nice philosophy lying in book on shelf we are bringing live human beings up to recognition of their own beingness and that is live action we dont face it because it is easier to confront concept than live being we have never been anything but beings going through society when we started up the line it was the enturbulation of the trillions starting to blow we had more ways to knock out the whole track than to get the overt out of the last hour we had started to make hole in the collective aberration of mankind it was we as beings making the hole not the idea not with good tools not with administration to enforce what tech we had you are perfectly right to say its rons fault that it didnt all go smoothly i should have been an ot who came to earth and got ahold of someone named moses and said hey moses here are some rules now you go back and front for is there anything wrong with that story can you imagine anyone doing that if he had all that power this didnt happen it just required more nerve to stand up by yourself the people who attacked us are dead or in terrible shape the organizations that attacked us are weaker we have held the fort successfully and we can now begin to do what we want rather than what we have to do we are holding our position as an organization now we are able to get tech applied our organization takes the form we want it to take in 1950 lrh said it will go as far as it works he has been pushing the tech to its limit despite pleas to take over the admin things are becoming more orderly now lrh is in position to put in administrative form and structure we had gotten ourselves to position where we were holding ourselves from expanding now the instructor can wear his hat in the course the action of administration is simply smoothing out the enturbulence of the environment when you introduce someone to scientology he can run into lots of confusion with the other people in his environment he has changed and they havent as an individual he goes through what scientology as group has gone through however it wont take him fifteen years to get up to point where he can hold his case gain there is terrific relationship between the environment the individual and the speed with which process works the earlier auditing on case is race between the auditor and the pcs environment that was true of the introduction of dianetics and scientology into the environment also that was also race the guy who has an early win in scientology tells his friends and confusion blows off which may spin him in he gets inval etc he has put in stable datum and cant hold his position in the resultant confusion youve got to get process working on somebody that is effective enough so that the environment wont knock him down faster than you can pull him up you have to deliver to him the kind of technology that he can somehow stand up with you must not unsettle him eg with r6 you want him to be stable furthermore you want to give him some administrative protection today you have been given weapons of administrative protection for your pc as well as method of forcing pc to take action and not keep messing up in his environment we are more powerful and things are more stable than ever before and will continue to be so as long as we follow the channels of the administrative system as long as our mutual understanding of the existing situation and the lessons of what we have been through are applied we have had lines that were blocked lrh is pulling out the blocks now putting in comm lines etc the trick is to avoid unsettling lines that are already in and working the goal is an accelerating curve we are past the critical point of organizational case gain now we can hold our gains now we have to get in comm lines and put policy to work if you want to strengthen an organization just find the blocks to expansion and pull them out open up your comm lines put your barriers on the edges of the lines to channel them and put life into the group last summer lrh changed the whole org board to make it more workable this action resulted in smoother flows and less upset we are about to complete that reorganization without cutting out any working lines but paralleling them duplicative functions are being cut out so there is less traffic all we ask of staff member is to discipline his comm line there is vast rush to get the tech all published we need to get the organizational lines in first so that when we hit the society with new material there will be lines for the traffic to flow on 521the levels checksheets and processes are ready for release the processes are simpler than you would expect earlier technology was more advanced in some instances than later tech for instance the material in the philadelphia doctorate course is level vii material the old technology was workable ever since excalibur was written in 1938 but the chances of it being received followed or applied were remote we are now moving ahead to some law and order which smooths things out man was too far down to know that he was confused now he can come up through the confusion 6503c30 shspec56 arc breaks and generalities the problem of getting materials out has to do with lrhs pen fingers and the short only 24 hour day nevertheless expansion is going rapidly what is interesting is the number of false data that you can get that create false impression for instance you can get the datum that they say when only one guy said it we were thrown curve last year it was reported to lrh from at least two sources that the gradation program was unpopular in fact the gradation program alone was responsible for last years organizational upsurge lrh let the gradation program wobble and modified it whereupon decline set in most people think that it was the price shift at the start of the year that caused the decline but the decline was coincident with lrh leaving for vacation when investigated it was found that registrars were using the confusion caused by the price shift to deny service they sold lot of auditing saying the price will be prohibitive in thirty days and everyone went into agreement with it the registrars also confused the public about what they could get with what in terms of memberships furthermore there wasnt price rise the price dropped unlike registrars in central orgs lrh never talked about money someone would come in to central org thinking about auditing and someone at the org who had money problems himself gratuitously gave the wouldbe pc money problems lrh never talked about money yet people force discussion of money on him if processing works the person who gets it is more able to have money since registraring to get money was never something that lrh had to do he is considering removing interviews with the reg as part of the regs hat it must have been something added on the line that suppressed the inflow of money it must have been the selling lrh used to explain every datum at least nine times in lecture before study tech came out that got around misunderstood words because the material was put in various ways when telling students to do something he has found that they will do what he said so he has to be sure that he tells them what to do very very clearly instruction is basically trying to cover all of it so thoroughly that there are gaps and room for question on how to do it an old process gets all the quirks and weird ways to do it ironed out as it gets used people in the org got the odd idea that class vi auditor would only audit level vi material class vi auditors can run level 0 only they would use emeters assess for the exact thing to run etc an auditor uses all the tools of the trade that he has mastered if class vi auditor were doing touch assist on burned area and he could see that the area was not getting better fast ie that there was ta on the process he would know that the pc must have something connected with the injury like withhold or an overt having the pc point to where it happened and where it is now is having him contact the environment and letting the whole incident come into view now the touch assist can go to work never accept rumor as something on which to base any action or decision except to investigate use statistics which are particularities if you dont have stats for each individual you get chaos because it is generality an organization will cause arc breaks amongst its staff if you cant get statistic on everybody present week in and week out people will protest an organization as slavedriving system in the absence of stats the stat has to be on each individual or it is worthless it must also be compared with former stats this is what it takes to keep some activity or organization going for long period of time the galactic confederacy had pretty good org board the org lasted eighty trillion years its only flaw was not having any provision for change or improvement it had two billion staff members in the central org lrh set himself the problem of making an org board that could cover from one person to two billion when things arent staticized you get rumors injustice and authoritarianism because generality is operating earth organizations commonly attribute success wholly to the man at the top when in fact 522he is only 60 or 70 responsible general macarthur didnt win the war though he was bright cookie in korea he didnt win because he wasnt good politician he disobeyed condition formula he was in emergency and didnt promote public opinion is made out of someones hat the moral is that when you try to explain condition with generalities that do not apply you muck up the whole situation that is how russia will take the us they have better propaganda they are promoting communism and who is promoting democracy wilson and johnson are reorganizing economies in period of decline emergency when they should promote what they cam eventually deliver be prepared to deliver it etc they are advertising crisis if you dont want to be something dont postulate it if you yell crisis you will get crisis apply the proper conditions formula us business operates an though it is in perpetual condition of emergency it uses heavy promotion etc american businesses never apply the condition for normal when they get there so they never get out of emergency in emergency you handle with sledge hammer in normal you handle with kid gloves all this has to do with dealing with what is actually going on but you can never find out what is actually going on from having just mass of something there is nothing to compare it with you can only find out what is happening with the individual bits of something never with the masses you get in trouble when you generalize what should be particular in scientology we do make general statements about men we can only get away with doing this because we have studied many individuals when we say about men is actually description of thetan there is another interesting fact about generalities we used to know fairly little about arc breaks now we know that an arc break is generality that should be particularity it was single but it was called many only an arc break can worsen graph during processing which makes an arc break more serious than ptp if theres graph change theres ptp there is nothing wrong with generality per only with one that should be particularity if you get generality when asking for an arc break get the pc to particularize it you can fail to find the bpc by taking generality as the bpc instead of going on to find out who they is you would still have to get the specific who and it may take several of these steps to get it eg aud is there an arc break pc yes the instructors are mean to aud who is the instructors pc pete aud there is bpc has he failed to answer you etc pc it is actually the students aud who is the students pc agnes id forgotten completely she said i was lousy auditor yesterday what is basically wrong with the r6 bank all the gpms are generalities that is why people arc break so hard on r6 the above datum concerning generalities also solves loss the loss of something produces generality of where it could be when you lose something it could be anywhere which makes it generality this is lie so the person arc breaks one of the ways to cure yourself of loss is to remember that the thing that was lost can only be in one place not in thousands of places its an everywhere that should be particularity it gives the individual an unflat listing question about where 523the test of what was the bpc is when it is located does the pc cheer up if you have to locate it more you havent found the bpc 6504c06 shspec57 the org board and livingness reference hcopl 3apr65 not available in oec volumes hcopl 3apr65 gives basic organization in detail the present org board is an old galactic civilization board with couple of departments missing the org board is philosophical machine command chart covers only one aspect of organizational functioning true org board must take care of what happens if function is not expressed on the org board it will be worn by everybody unknowingly when you put box on an org board it will be filled men cannot work as team without policy even bad policy will at least make team if it is followed policy is the extant agreement of the group without this agreement you only get individual action if an organization is better organized than other organizations it wouldnt have to do anything spectacular about the other organizations by way of competing with them or battling with them every war traces back to wild outpolicy if we come up the line as people as individuals and also as part of the team we wont get into all the trouble we got into as roarin screamin individuals way back on the track we will be able to make it all the way because we will be able to keep order all the way case stability depends upon the smooth organization of individuals without an organization the tech would drop out in time the organization must be close to flawless once you have put the organization in concrete and started it rolling if it is almost right you have had it because it will become an alldevouring monster and it will fail by the germs of its own destruction and what destroys almost any organization is its own germs its the things it laid in its the things you did not the things that were done to you the only way you can come down is for having made mistake yourself there must always be that prior mistake sometimes it is very slight and unpredictable apparently when curve goes down there are lots of errors there is one major error you must have understandings not understanding there are 265 x 6 separate dynamic urges in man and 265 x 6 x 18 separate causations there was an effort to make them so numerous that one could embrace them actual gpms organizational policy must be comprehensible the org board must express 1 function 2 duties 3 sequences of actions 4 authorities the org board gives the cycle of raw meat to ot the cycles of actions that person would undertake from the public it became public org board too the public enters from the left and proceeds to the right in life 1 you must have an impulse into channel 2 the edges of channel must be held firm 3 the barriers in the channel must be removed 5244 the noncompliance of forwardings in the channel must be taken care of 5 the distractions must be removed from the borders of the channel 6 there must be some place for something going down the channel to arrive at this is the definition of life life without that channel wont exist that is livingness going along certain course impelled by purpose with some place to arrive this also gives us all the levels of the gradation program clear is baby ot his next bank is the physical universe the first point on the org board is the office of lrh this used to be hasi this deals with 1 authority 2 lrhs material 3 lrhs signature the main thing about this department is the issuance of conditions the first cog is that there is condition hence this is the entrance point for raw meat he thinks others will take care of him however he must recognize his condition or he will die others tell him that his condition is that he will die scientology says you dont have to die or get sick etc all processes from that point on contain condition after you have condition you had better communicate with it hence the next department is the department of communications and the name of the level is communication the next level is perception the department of inspections and reports communication must precede perception the next point is orientation the individual finds out that he has been living in nightmare this is the department of compilation after you have accumulated notes you can put them together and hand them to people so that they can get oriented cf these briefing course notes perceptions get compiled into understandings so the next department is understandings ie the department of publications this department publishes what is to be understood or what is understood understanding is just telling yourself what is understood the next department the department of promotion is under purposes the only thing the promreg ever handles is purposes the pc at this level on the gradation chart has arrived at purposes ie r6 he has gotten rid of false purposes he has achieved the state of clear in its new 1964 definition see tape 6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is the above is all under hco hco is doublebarreled division if you cross two divisions on hat from that point on you have jammed the ability of an organization to expand dont have one person on hats in two different divisions therefore six people are necessary in order to have an org one for each division when an organization gets fairly big you cross departmental hats at your peril personnel housing division 3 has to hold things together eg the physical plant it is also involved in financial planning division 4 has to do with what you do the doingness there has been neglected factor on the galactic confederation org board the product an organization has to qualify the product it must find out what made the product fall down ie there is need for lost battles division you must not let the person who trains students examine them scientology is the ability to change conditions but we have to decide what conditions we want to change you have to convince people that the product of scientology is valuable the alternative is sitting on an island out of communication it is the product that is distributed 525you can take your life and find out which division is missing note that there are six divisions and sixteen departments to expand the org board each department would have primarily six sections with sixteen subsections each one of these subsections in turn may have six divisions with sixteen departments each divisional head knows all the department hats in his division and something about all other departmental hats this gives you basically six hats and staff member hat there should be two admin personnel for every tech person if any hats below you on the org board are empty you are responsible for them 6504c13 shspec58 the lowest levels research is not wrapped up new datum has emerged and research is going south lrh is researching power processing it is not surprising that the more one discovers in the upper reaches the more understanding one has of fundamentals that apply to the bottom youve got r6ew that is holding you nicely im putting the capper on the r6 gpm plot r6 has developed into series of starrated processes the first is the method of cleaning up outruds on yourself it is solo ruds process twoterminal auditing is too slow at level vi solo auditing all the gpms on r6 takes about three months at three to four hours per day the end product of this auditing is clear as we knew it in the earliest days reactive bank at all thetan experiences sense of unfamiliarity at this level and he runs into problems like how do you handle body he has to learn to postulate with great rapidity it is condition of too aware he has to get used to reading peoples minds he finds that absolute zero is proper temperature everything else is hot it is in tiny but observable motion and it is bothersome at first he needs refamiliarization he is not quite sure what he can do his framework on whom he must fight changes he can start wondering about his sanity because previously sensible things seem foolish he can also get solutions he can do analyses of situations that were previously blank puzzles the road to ot is one of familiarity clear has trouble trying to reconcile what has been going on in his life with what he is now he is not really able to think very straight about how confused he was sometimes its hard to understand why somebody else is confused for instance try to wrap your wits around some guys saying but we gotta get the republicans back in power you know they are nutty too since you erased your confusion and dont have it around anymore as standard clear is not necessarily very tolerant state but it is not very antagonistic state either its not negative one is far more positive about things than he ever was before his reactions are far more vivid you have to realize that thetan can become aberrated without being implanted or having gpms but what really made him unable was gpms which gave him wrong purposes and smashed him down so that he couldnt have any purpose of his own all his own real purposes are suppressed when you get out into the open your own purposes show up and you start doing what you would like to do not what your bank wants you to do in scientology we have been working with what the thetan wants we only fail with other people when we treat them as other than thetan being all thetans want out even those that are in an insane asylum who fight everybody who comes in the door beings are basically good one reason why the being has consented to have bank is that it prevents everyone else from being bad that is so farfetched that one would ever look for it as the philosophical fundamental in back of the aberration of man there is aberration that thetan can get into based on his ignorance his unfamiliarities his decisions based on data etc scientology is built straight around what might happen to thetan gpms gave him reverse purposes he decided that to keep others and himself good he should have bank to prevent himself and them from being bad the idea was that man is bad and we have to do something to him to make him good so we all have to agree to have bank to keep us from being bad but the bank cut off the thetan from all familiarity with himself as he was the decision to do that to create bank somehow put him into condition where he couldnt conceive of how he had been it was cutoff he is like guy in coal pit who doesnt believe that there is sun or platos cave metaphor in the republic he thinks that what he is in is normal environment he will say look you can see there is sun or light thats proof that was the barrier that made someone unsalvageable before we knew about it 526as you come up the line your r gets violated by the wog world the higher you get the more your r is susceptible to violation but fortunately the more capable you are of standing up to invalidation it doesnt mean anything to you it is vital that someone improve on gradient since pcs case gain must not outrun his capability of handling the new reality you cant travel the road to truth halfway see the tape 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth above it is vital that lrh reorganize and perfect organizations now because we are at the make break point where it requires hard push at first shifting over to runaway forward motion if we released public book right now we would cave ourselves in the orgs have to be able to expand rapidly before flood of new people hits it we can push the boombutton any time all of sudden lrh made discovery that found the answer to cases that wouldnt run successfully on level 0 power processing there are two levels below level 0 1 conditions processes 2 existence processes existence is below conditions this antiquated the plans for boom so there have been changes there are three conditions processes auditing the case on these belowzero processes is walk in the park however it may take class vi to run them because what flies off the case comes off so fast that the velocity might be too much for coauditor or lowerlevel auditor these processes handle the nocasegain case they were developed to handle cases that lrh had formerly handled with justice and ethics these are the new conditions processes which could be run at any point on case and which have an exact endpoint beyond which they wont run further below the conditions processes is existence processing an existence process is one in which person recognizes something about existence mimicry gets at this sideways having these processes makes it hard to write new public book because they should be included in the discussion but not enough is known about them yet to write about them since the new membership pricing system was created based on the idea of having new public book the pricing is premature which backs it up on the orgs we will get the orgs to back up and get their organization and signup line well in hand look around here and find something really real to you is process at the existence level it was wildcat process from upperlevel tech that belongs at or towards the bottom you get person to find one thing that is really real in the room basic undercutting command might be are you something like that its familiarity without contact or communication and without an awareness of what familiarity is arriving you get the shutoff because as youve gone south youve dropped orientation youve dropped perception communication conditions and youre now in existence that existence must be without any of the other thingsso what is this level called existence how would you audit something without understanding orientation perception communication or the recognition of condition what do we have left we dont know but we will the new organizational plan is going in faster than it has been released you cant keep an org out of it despite its current incompleteness it is big magnet that is trying to take existing departments and put them on it it is unique and it works because it is parallelline org board not vertical org board it operates left and right not up and down one odd characteristic is that each repeating department as you go across the board from left to right has nothing to do with the functions that follow it but includes all of the functions which precede it just try to squeeze into department comfortably some action which follows it on the board to the right you get trouble try to get into the orientation department something about understanding well that has its own departmental functions but the next one to the right is purposes now lets put purposes under understanding in other words were going to have purposes before we have understanding you get mess organizationally or in auditing eg if you try to put something about promotion under understanding why people just sit around and understand that there should be some promotion it was working with the org board that brought to light the lower subzero levels because the org board is not an org board at all its philosophic machine to which an organization is easily adapted its an alldevouring monster anything that comes near it gets changed for the better it gives answers to questions that we have had trouble with before like personnel an ad is kept placed people come in they get hired they work for two weeks with staff hat they go to review etc it all gets done without having to go through any executive an applicant who calls up for job gets call 527two days later saying come on in he gets metercheck for ta then he is routed through fp to his place of work for two week temporary assignment at the end of which he goes to review and is either kept on or told that he needs more training for the job even if review boots him out he remains an applicant needing some more preparation before he can have the job review also tells the labor exchange about him to see if he can get other employment right away review also has displaced person division to give him meal ticket get him on pe course or coaudit until he can function then he is hired on provisional basis for year review maintains file of these people for periods of crush labor the only way this whole system wont work is if you dont man up the posts this employment system is also great for procurement people come to work and stay to study thus anything that gets near the organization begins to move this new organizational structure improves things for the better whether people like it or not it has to be completed before we release the field staff member program which will give backup to field auditors private practice mds must be wrong since it is failing it takes quite team to process pcs it is possible to process pcs in an organization but not in individual practice suppose you had dissemination technology that would make it so anyone you talked to would immediately become scientologist it exists it is only two or three weeks old not yet released the person who resists and protests it is the easiest to get and if fsms are sending in all sorts of cases even very lowlevel cases the organization must be able to handle them right off the bat all auditors that were ever trained are now to be called fsms the pay is ten percent of the fee of the person you send in center is nucleus of an organization if it moves even vaguely in the direction of an org board it will wind up becoming an organization so fast it wont know what happened there is policy that you cant be retrained for level that you have already obtained this goes along with the policy that checksheet cant be changed once you are on it there are at least twelve levels above level vi and st hill will be teaching those 6504c27 shspec59 awareness levels lrh makes several observations on recent organizational outpoints wherever the public impinges on the organization it enturbulates and erodes it is the public that is in confusion we are putting the stable datum of an organization or scientologist into the middle of the confusion an individual cannot stand alone against the public in the midst of this confusion he will get knocked appetiteovertincup by the public unless backed up by the organization every scientologist and org in the world is connected with the suppressive thing called the society so they would skid if left by themselves you are dealing with psychotic society there are thirtytwo levels below 0 and the average public is at least fifteen levels below 0and neurosis starts at ten levels below 0 it goes only few levels down then becomes psychosis psychosis is an inability to observe and thats your public last year when lrh first had total reality on the exact character of the reactive mind on exactly how it was there and exactly what it was calculated to make an individual do he was shocked knowing that shock is an indication that there is something wrong with what he is shocked with he went over the structure of the bank suppressed challenged and arc broke it the shock was not actually with the reactive bank but with the pretenses that had been made about the character of man i havent cognited heavily for ages lrh cant get his own ta up masses affect his body but not him here is some more data that lrh has found on the subject of clear clears time track is gone so the eidetic memory talked about in book one is there only if he puts it there clear recalls not with pictures but by knowing pictures are completely unnecessary for any kind of recall at all this is probably the only change theres been from the definition of book one clear there are also energy phenomena mentioned several years after book one like heating things up by looking at them clear can make something warm by staring at it as person goes on up he takes both the new abilities and the lost disabilities for granted the negative gain is gain by absence and the positive gain is regaining his natural abilities after all so he may not notice the change unless he mocks up what was wrong with him last week so dont expect your pc always to be telling you 528what wonderful auditor you are that is bank phenomenon that will destimulate in three to ten days the persons increased awareness may not be all pleasant he can look at some dynamic or sphere of existence and see it clearly with shock the common denominator of behavior is degree of awareness that is what is held in common by all life there is such thing as being aware or not aware it is all degrees of awareness gradient like all the scales the difference between person and person b is degree of awareness or awareness of different things there are certain things of which one would become aware in order to get or as one got case advance if you skip one or two or three of those you cant become aware of this higher one lrh plotted the scale of awareness to get the bridge down to homo sapiens not having noticed the gap that he had created between himself and the lowlevel pc that is how he got thirty two levels of awareness below level 0 he suddenly found himself looking at the human race and it was horrible shock it felt weird he got over it in about twentyfour hours realizing that if you could deal with the average public pc you could process dog you are at least ten or twelve levels below communication with the average public pc the problem is how do you process when you dont have comm line another problem is that as someone comes up in awareness he goes through antisocial bands as well as inoffensive ones there are bands amongst them that are passive and propitiative these are resting places in which society doesnt worry about you ie it doesnt try to suppress you these lower levels are jammed together and it is bit hard to tell the order down near the bottom the awareness scale measures what person could become aware of if you find person anyplace on the awarenessscale then the next action which you have to do to give him case gain is to make him aware of the next level above that for instance someone below suffering might have case gain by being made to suffer you wouldnt necessarily process him up to this awareness the lowest type of process you would use is mimicry he would be aware that he was doing it because you were doing it awareness is always matter of increasing perimeter of reality you get concentric circles of awareness for instance psycho is only aware out to his fist beyond that is delusion awareness can invert and increase into delusion which puzzles you since the person seems to be getting nuttier delusion is inverted awareness youve got to increase his awareness in the direction of sanity or reality process in the direction of something real person who is improving gets more and more aware of what is going on inside wider and wider perimeter you could get guy aware of wall two feet in front of his face and it could be vast improvement you can do this with 8c increasing the distance to the wall when the pc touches it communication begins to come in you can have action without awareness ie you can have the situation where what the individual is aware of and what he is doing are not the same thing ever hence you get longterm headaches therefore the observation of conduct will not diagnose person unless you have little secret awareness scale of your own in other words youd have to know the secret of what the mest universe dictates as gradient scale of awareness observation of conduct will not lead to solution of the situation and man falls down in thinks that it will the field of psychology etc being entirely based on observation and labelling of conduct comes up with inaccurate diagnoses and messedup solutions you cant watch patient and decide that he is gymnastico potico and firebug who is compulsively attracted to water on that account the reason this girl keeps going to the water fountain is because she is thirsty she may be stuck in french foreign legion engram in the sahara therefore the remedy might have nothing to do with water fire etc the moment you grasp this principle you get the stable datum dont draw and conclusions from conduct all unexpected conduct tells you is that you dont know about something but that is something to know labelling is bad science and leads to solution all science is is the discovery that or all science had to find out to become science is that when something isnt working you havent got the answer this explains the advance of the physical sciences the mental sciences got parked by substituting authoritarian statements for searching for workable answer if as an auditor you base what you do on what the pc is doing you will go nuts too for instance if the pc is nattering and the auditor agrees with the natter and takes the pcs data as truth nothing happens conduct can be used only as an indicator that since the pc is behaving in some way that you didnt expect there is something about him that you didnt know that you can ask the pc regardless of whether it is missed withhold or not what dont i know about you will resolve the situation labelling it wont never just label conduct that you dont understand know that you dont know what is going on and find out also consider what the pc can find out about himself 529the nuttier someone is the harder he is to handle he is less aware and you are less aware of what you dont know about him also the nuttier the pc is the harder it is to get his attention so that you can find out what he is aware of and what is going on and what you dont know the dont knows are fabulous you have to push to get the person to become aware enough to get him high enough on the awareness scale so that you can find out enough so you can find out what you dont know about the person the game would be what can i find out about this person and what can he find out about himself by increasing that awareness scale the person will get saner and saner more and more aware more and more himself he can hit dynamic situations which he becomes aware of with shock you have to eat humble pie to begin this subject at all you have to know that there is something in the universe you dont know and that for person who is way down scale is the most dangerous utterance that he could possibly make he is so totally sealed off from things that if everyone realized how blind he was he thinks theyd just eat him up so he compensates for his unawareness by automatic mechanisms of pretense he lacks the courage to say well i dont know anything about that and yet he cant resolve any situation until he says well whaddya know ive got an area where i dont know therefore when you see somebody behaving oddly the only thing you know is that theres something youre certainly unaware of and that he is probably unaware that he is unaware of hell cover that up with pretended awareness which doesnt exist ie delusion having gone through despair on the subject person can come up to realization that there is something you can know about anything you confront you can know that you dont know and that is the first thing you should know about it now you can take the action necessary to find out and in the process of finding out the whole thing will clarify the amazing thing about aberration is that if you did find out about something eg the internal government of russia it would either go clear or collapse just finding out what situation is asises that situation running an engram out of an organization or an individual is just continuing to pull into view what people didnt know about the individual or organization the only way in which you could fail to pull something into view is to suppose that you knew all there was to know about it and that there was nothing more to learn clear has become broadly aware of where he is unaware when he spots something like this he decides that 1 he should find out or 2 it doesnt make any difference you can decide whether it is worth finding out and if you do start finding out it will collapse 6505c11 shspec60 arc breaks and ptps the differentiation releases are being made with power processing with lrh d of ping and msh csing it is getting very routine to get keyedout clears in under fifty hours we know that we can audit anybody 34 awareness levels below level 0 note at this time the awareness scale was apparently in its present 1976 form the bulletins covering the power processes are too simple to be anything but confidential the processes are too pure and simple to be generally released they require both great deal of training and high case level therefore power is to be made confidential power processes can only be audited in organizations there is not enough control or sense among people like homer and berner to do it in the field the idea of running endwords on raw meat it just overwhelms the pc and is tough to straighten out clay table processes have been taken out of the processing lineup when people process raw meat with the clay table they neglect one thing rather uniformly getting the questions answered only few processes are left on students auditing checksheets the international situation has improved in the us the senate and house are attacking or are on the verge of attacking the fda in victoria the report on the inquiry is delayed it will doubtless fizzle out 530people probably thought lrh was exaggerating when he said that we were going to take the planet but he has always meant exactly that we are now just at the edge of dissemination as phase in the development of scientology having the minus0 awareness level scale is great help in dissemination the press will support you on need of change so you press this they will go along with this whatever the press says is protest revolutions are popular until you give them the change that is to be made into then they cool off the scale of awareness is scale of what person group or organization can be aware of it is new having the minus0 awareness level scale opens the door to bringing person right up the line to release on study alone because it has trick if you can locate what person is aware of on that scale you only have to tell him about the next level and he will become aware of that and experience case change therefore you can get case improvement by education dont confuse the level person is at with his conduct for instance someone dramatizing hysteria ie being hysterical isnt necessarily or even generally aware of hysteria therefore he isnt necessarily at the level of hysteria we do know that being must be aware and we mean analytically aware of something to be at that awareness level something someone is dramatizing is above where he is and is overwhelming him what he is aware of can be discovered he what he talks about or seems to be alert to there are lower levels than 34 below zero but power reaches to the bottom and gives release the two levels below level 34 unexistence are false causation 35 and reasonableness 36 these levels are below uncausing 32 the human race generally is near the bottom end of the scale person who is aware of being hysterical is pretty hightoned relatively speaking you cant pull an overt off the person at uncausing there arent any it just happens what will be will be religions fail by being below perception of god the greatest arc break operation that has ever been pulled in the history of the human race the god who is everywhere with mass total generality total unlocatability total power total causation will you please please differentiate between arc breaks and ptps ninety percent of the pcs that you are doing arc break assessments on are in fact in ptps the arc break is usually after ptp unless it is flagrant case of bpc ptp is postulatecounterpostulate the pc is at war with something he is not just worrying about something he doesnt like he is agin something for instance husband has an argument with his wife one wants to go to the movies and the other doesnt this is war not an arc break but it could lead to an arc break on both sides running the arc break wouldnt help though it would run but running the problem will help you could find the problem where you might not ever find the bpc so the sequence is 1 problem 2 overt 3 arc break if you clean up the bpc the case wont improve because the ptp is unhandled they wont necessarily even feel better you have to do something about the fractured postulate the condition of someone in ptp isnt arc broken its war postulatecounterpostulate adds up to war it would have done hitler good to have run him on an arc break he might have been on ptp though probably it would have required power processing to stop him though one commits intentional overts as solution to problem when you define an overt as solution to ptp you can solve any case when overts are defined as arc breaks they are closed to solution the resolution of the case is who have you been mean to process the pc at cause always person commits intentional overts for only one reason they are solutions to problems knowing this even lowlevel cases are open to solution but when you define an overt or series of overts as an arc break you close the case to solution because case is usually struggling along at low causelevel the question have you committed an overt will be hard for him to answer because he has never committed an overt because it was all vitally necessary and therefore totally justified you should ask the more penetrating question why is it so vitally necessary and why is it justified it is because there was problem requiring solution the solution being the overt what throws you is that the problem is so buried in the past that it is impossible to see the connection between the overts and the problem the problem is frequently on the past track often it has nothing to do with pt the person is still solving problem relating to an earlier relationship it is still pt to him hence it is still ptp to him if you trace it back you will find that it made sense somewhere earlier in screwy 531sort of way guy who is always smashing up his car might be solving problem with daddy who never let him use the car by making the car unuseable you look on lot of things as overts which are in actual fact vitally necessary solutions to urgent immediate problems of survival the only thing wrong with them is when you could ask guy when with finger snap and get say 1932 then you could ask what problem did you have in 1932 you will get many many manifestations but amongst them will not be disinterest if you told someone the right problem he would change his conduct having cognited that his solution was nuts these solutions are daffy because of droppedout time the solution is to an ancient problem which is gone leaving an overt to get the major problem on someones track may take power process but if the person has some fundamental problem in his life it has formed innumerable locks which have moved up to pt and they are the overts and withholds that he is dramatizing in pt if you are clever you can get at these locks you dont have to ask for overts if you ask for solutions to the problem the old process tell problemwhat solutions have you had modified to what solutions have you put into effect to solve that problem could be reworded as how have you attempted to solve that problem so you can just use tell problem what solutions did you put into effect to solve this problem this would give you ow or you could use what have you done to solve that problem how have you attempted to solve that problem or what would solve the problem or what action of yours was solution to the problem some such process would get the overts off any action the person took to solve the problem was to some degree an overt because it was against another postulate an arc break is charge that has been restimulated on the back track which hasnt moved into full consciousness and therefore hasnt been identified the pc avoids the area an arc break is bpc and hasnt anything to do with solutions to problems guy who is failing to complete comm cycle because somebody wont acknowledge it only has really the bpc of missed withhold an inadvertent missed withhold missed withhold can be inadvertent not intended it looks and feels much like an actual missed withhold if you wont acknowledge the fact that the pc has answered the question you bypass the charge of his answer but the better part of it is that you have given him problem since he intended to answer it this is ptp by definition he is trying to solve it by force then he arc breaks but that is secondary it will solve rapidly by asking what problem have you had in auditing especially on pc who has been roughed up by not being acknowledged eventually the pc would give you the problem of getting someone to listen to then to get the pcs overts on auditors ask then how did you go about solving it you get string of overts by getting ptps for instance what problem have you had with about auditing well very often you didnt seem to listen to well how did you handle solve this i stopped telling you right answers so the pc has an arc break ptp and missed withhold you can be misled by the bpc and the fact that yes there is an arc break but the arc break isnt fully cleanupable unless you find the problem that it is based on if you clean up the problem and the problems that the pc has had in his auditing whole string of arc breaks and whole string of overts will blow this is the case because awareness of problems is way south below minus thirtyfour cause overts is way north so if you try to pull problems directly with ow the pc would already have 532to be so hightoned that it wouldnt have any effect on him if you did pull the problems you can discuss problems with anybody it seems to be the case that where there is life there are problems where are arc breaks and bpc of course to get an arc break just throw an endword into restimulation get total generality hitting the person outside his awareness and you will see an arc break on the generality of it the whole bank is the most total generality that one can state that is still the truth when generality in the bank is restimulated the person cannot identify the threat and he feels terrible not knowing this is true arc break the pc cannot locate the source of this horrible feeling it isnt because he is sick to his stomach it is that he doesnt know why he is sick to his stomach if you give someone wrong item off gpm he will go from tone 40 to tone 40 so fast that he looks like dive bomber that is an arc break but someone who is arc broken with an instructor really has problem and some overts which were solutions auditors can get stuck in the win of successful arc break assessments and do them on people who really have ptps they will get loses that way problems are far more common than real arc breaks an experimental nontherapeutic but very educational process is invent problem you will see black masses show up as the pcs bank collapses on him if you ran invent solution and the solutions that the pc gave you were all really invented solutions the mass would also move in but if you ran think of or recall problemsolution the mass would move off you could do think of problem invent solution and the mass will move in any totally new inventedness tends to collapse the bank if you started knocking out bunch of wholetrack problems you would find the mass going away similarly with wholetrack solutions the nearfar action of it is very interesting this makes problems of comparable magnitude able to bring mass in if you are really inventing which is hard to do the main message is that you can move mental masses around with the idea of problems and solutions why because of the basic definitions of problems and solutions solution is an effort to bat problem away which usually fails the problem being postulatecounter postulate puts the opposite postulate across from you in hurry when you think of it persons problem is thought of as mass he calls ptp it because it is an it to him mental mass that he tries to bat away postulatecounterpostulate gives you mass so whether he sees it or not when person gets problem showing up he gets mass showing up and whether he realizes it or not the thing he tries to do about it is to do something about it to move it away from him but his effort will move it closer to him so hes in situation when he has problem that he has to do something about something to get rid of the something which is moving in on him this phenomenon of mass moving in happens in life too the pc normally responds by trying to do something to it to push it away but that effort will move it closer to him the guy has huge fundamental problem you get it and ask well all right is that your problem and he will say well really the problem was something else you ask the same question again and he says my problem was so and so and so the pc denies each problem as he asises it they are asising in the course of getting down to the main problem sometimes you have problem of missingness there is nothing there to confront this leads to where is it this kind of problem fringes into generality and borders on the arc break this is where the problem fringes on an arc break that is why problems and arc breaks appear to be cousins its gone and where can i find it are borderline to the arc break so it is easy to confuse them but failures to solve arc breaks should have clued you in to the fact that there is something else wrong fifty percent of the reactive bank is devoted to the compulsion to make reactive bank on every process except r6 you should ask about problems not arc breaks unless you realize that you have goofed in the comm cycle in that case lrh would ask about specific parts of the formula not do long list you dont have overts in the absence of problem the problem may be gone but the solutions are still forthcoming you can run responsibility on problems problems and solutions and any number of things the basic mechanism of the mind is that it needs problem situation to lock up time nothing else can stop person on the time track for instance world war ii is still being fought in literature it was problem with lot of solutions and civilization is to large degree still stuck in it as witness the sunday supplements tv programs etc night club could be mocked up like an air raid shelter and make fortune world war ii was postulatecounterpostulate that is still more real to people than pt any point of the time track where civilization is stuck is seen as more real than any new 533period it is the same with pcs if your pc isnt paying close attention you can assume that the pc is stuck somewhere in back time you can get his attention by finding out where he is locked in time and entering that prior time period if you trigger the back time period you will find yourself there with him you get the pcs overts by going after problems but if he is below causation he wont recognize them as overts because they are necessary solutions just ask for the problem 6505c18 shspec61 organization and ethics references hcopl 1may65 iii organization the design of the organization and the policy letters on staff status pp vivii in oec vol 1 staff status policy letters have been issued on the new org board we will remedy an old evil by putting after the persons name his certification and classification as an auditor his grade as pc and his staff status in the past in trying to appoint someone at distance lrh had trouble knowing who was there now copies of org boards will be exchanged between orgs and it will be easy in filling posts to see who is qualified for promotion to be staff member in tech one needs to have technical certificate that covers basics of the organization an admin terminal needs basic cert on the org then he is qualified as provisional staff status i they can be transferred without permission staff status ii is general staff member this individual has worked for and attained solid position from there on it goes up to incharge head of subsection this is the lowest exec rating an officer is in charge of section for instance the cramming officer is in charge of the cramming section then there are titles that are not associated with rank or status eg communicator post can also have deputies post assigned locally is deputy one assigned from st hill would be acting for awhile then the acting prefix is removed and the person has full status acting or deputy do not refer to rank they refer to permanency deputy is somebody who is in there temporarily small breath of air could dislodge him acting denotes st hill appointment after short time up to year the acting prefix is dropped then the person becomes the title without the prefix deputy hco exec sec is someone holding the post until confirmed it is not at all permanent acting hco exec sec is st hill appointment and therefore official to be an acting the person would have to have the appropriate staff status for the post this is not true of deputy but deputy doesnt draw the pay of an acting you put person on post to see how they do you cant wait to fill posts for someone with the proper staff status so we have the deputy rating this appointment must be confirmed by st hill to get an acting rating and full pay acting applies until person knows his hat cold and can apply it policy letters are pouring out covering everything from organizational theory to nitpicky details of minor hats ethics is there to hold the lines and to get technology in ie to make it possible for tech to go in that is its sole purpose and it is fabulously successful in fulfilling that purpose ethics is the tourniquet before the doctor arrives its purpose is to quiet the turbulence down long enough to allow the auditor to come in you carry ethics in until you get tech in it has looked like the publication of someone as an sp has the same effect as public hanging cancelling someones certs has the effect of getting him back in all straightened up within two to two and half years not cancelling the certs results in his going off into the wilds and never showing up again peter crundall for example had his certs cancelled five or six years ago when he was screaming and howling about something he had to get 500 hours of auditing at his own expense now he is being the featured lecturer at an org it took about two years for him to get his auditing started and he got it all handled so it is an unkind thing to do not to bring order into scientology area man has tremendous reaction to justice the purpose of ethics is to get in tech but mans law and mans justice is not like that man wants to squash people who get in his way his justice has end product save punishment it does not straighten out the community therefore it doesnt work police forces have bad morale because there is end product of penal action people know this and react against it and some on an aaa basis will react against ethics in scientology the same way you jar peoples banks when you present the idea of ethics be that as it may greater proportion of people in scientology today favor decent ethics system than are batting back at it this 534is because they see that good ethics system will give them better training processing and better grip of on scientology you cant sentence someone to technology or to getting better you can sentence him to not getting better one is forcing us to help people if someone keeps getting in the way it is pretty normal to stop wanting to assist him if you feel like blowing up organizations you should very carefully look up the justice actions of organizations and huge governments etc and compare these things if you do this you find some astonishing data the taut ship the viciously conducted regiment the harshly run empire all these survive and flourish with high esprit corps almost forever the sloppy ones succumb rapidly lrh got interested in this phenomenon while reading gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire the only long periods of progressive rule recovery from barbarian attacks and freedom from internal upsets were periods when the emperor was nut the good emperors got killed within few months this didnt jibe with lrhs experience in handling discipline on ship he realized that what works for small intimate group to keep the peace is different from what is needed for big group which gets lots of confusion in an org the points of enturbulation are the ones where the public impinges eg the line of getting the pc from the reg to the d of p this line keeps going out lrh used to wonder if there was something wrong with us to allow us to get enturbulated in this way then he looked at society in general and saw how much worse off their condition is society is deteriorating we are gradiently doing better and better as we expand we reach straight out into the tumult of society we had to have tools to extend our reach so that we could get our jobs done in time lrh found that as people moved up towards ot certain disdain occurred he saw that ethics would be necessary so that ots would take orderly bites out of people when they got annoyed by the disaster to that extent there is need for an ethics system because sufficiently powerful being annoyed at something is liable to straighten it up with such thoroughness that hardly anybody would ever recover and unless they have some orderly method of straightening things up they will straighten things up in their own way and it will make hell of mess the laws of ethics need to be known and understood they need to be predictable they cannot be capricious the question is are you for just shooting somebody down without warning or do you want ethics do you want law that just freakishly strikes down everybody in sight or do you want the kind of law that says here is the path narrow as it may seem in acting on these lines we have ethics rattling around in the orgs people are getting used to the tools you can give someone shock with heavy use of ethics it can be very effective used lightly used in this way ethics backs up tech most amazingly lrh has just discovered the pts case its cause and handling never audit pts the rollercoaster case is one that we have never been able to handle before he is connected to an sp and until ethics makes him disconnect or handle the sp he will continue to rollercoaster ethics can label the suppressive if nothing else you give the pts case the policy letter covering ptsness you dont have to issue an ethics order unless tech doesnt go in ie unless he cant or wont handle or disconnect you can insist that pts bring the sp in if necessary for auditing if things went that far you could threaten the pts person with not getting the sp audited unless the pts person gets him in before he is labeled an sp suppressives are pretty crazy the sp has got to fight he is back on the track fighting the ugbugs he is in an old ptp he is taking the actions in pt that would solve the problem with the ugbugs he is back on the track fighting an enemy that longer exists 99999999999 of his attention units are at some exact precise past period of the track and in that instant he is fighting off something and is trying to handle something by some means which are the ones he is using in pt he has problems with you and vice versa he isnt up there with you and you arent back there with him thats the whole anatomy of psychosis given associative restimulators and aaa youve got maddog type hes just defending himself in some mad insanity against things which are longer there hence the use of power processes on psychotics you can assume that the sp has problems in pt but those are not the problem that he wants to solve that problem is on the back track and it is loaded with crossassociations and identifications he misidentifies anyone who approaches or tries to help him in an effort to defend himself he is driven down to the first dynamic to such degree that one must get any better when he is driven down into the first dynamic he must destroy all around him one must get any better because they are the flying saucer people once scientology is known to be an effective way to help people watch out international city is being looked at by group connected to the we are having an effect 535the true antiscientologist isnt trying to be convinced he is trying to stop you you are the green alligator he is fighting 7000 years ago and if you or anyone else they are all the green alligator got any better you would be stronger and that would tear it and you would eat him up he thinks insanity is just total stuckness on the track in fight this is point that you prove instantly and utterly when you are running power class vii processes on someone power handles the sp and the insane the sp can be processed to sanity in under fifty hours but you had better have the organization and the ethics to hold things together you have to label ptss and sps to get the tech in an ethics action lasts until tech is in you use english to get tech in you stop it when youve got tech in even if stopping at that point leaves unfinished cycles of action along the way its not question of where does the ethics proceed its how long do you have to hold the area down an organization will run as long as it has channels and as long as particles on the channels dont carom off the sides of the channels and collide with the working parts of the organization if you can bring that about you can have an organization that would have total capability of pouring through it practically the whole of the human race lacking clean and definite flow channels your volume stays small because of all the barriers and stoppages that occur if the channel isnt kept open you cant handle the load scientology is probably the only outfit that ever hit this planet that meant exactly what it said and was doing exactly what it was doing and what it said it was doing and was doing exactly nothing else scientology doesnt have the time to do half the things that it has been accused of an sp saying i never said that believes that he really didnt and he is right in sense how the hell could he say anything he hasnt been there for seven trillion years im sure that many enthetaish people believe that weve gone stark staring mad with all this justice were just having little fun with justice just now and when we learn about it why well be able to control fairly well wide sphere of public in such way that they dont all get destroyed the main danger to them is not ethics its having their silly heads blown off because they make somebody mad youve got to have ethics in to handle nonscientologists if you put discipline in right at the start you can work very nicely with nonscientologists make sure that they know what ethics is how it works etc society is losing its grip we are putting in order to make an orderly show for the future 6505c25 shspec62 the five conditions if it isnt written it isnt true is laid down so that rumors and verbal orders dont foul things up condition is an operating state each condition has formula that must be applied in order to change the state for the better dont misapply formulas if you know the conditions and their formulas you blow lot of the mystery that the rest of the world is sitting in emergency emergency is the most common state on this planet it is the condition of stats going the wrong way usually down over some significant period for instance it is declared by down stat for four consecutive weeks if stat that should go up goes down or vice versa youve got emergency the condition has to be declared by secretarial executive directive which is causative order certain steps then have to be done the first action is promote if an organization or produce if an individual when this has been done but not before economize dont economize on promoting if you do you inhibit getting out anything in order to produce enough money to raise the stat if this happens you will find yourself smaller and weaker after recovering from the crisis taxation is page out of das kapital from each according to his ability to pay to each according to his need dont economize until after you have promoted or produced if an artist in need of money economized first on materials he would have little or nothing to draw with therefore he would have little to sell so he would have trouble getting out of the financial hole after promotion is well in hand economize 536and prepare to deliver if you apply the affluence formula and economize when you are in emergency you will either stay in emergency or if you recover the organization will be smaller and of less scope also part of the emergency formula is to change your operating basis or you will head back into another condition of emergency youve got to stiffen discipline you have to stop going down to the pub every night do your homework be little more regular on the job work little harder dont goof quite so much if the activity does not come out of the condition of emergency after that state has been assigned then you have to use discipline because life itself is going to discipline the individual very cruelly cog that is why protecting person from the consequences of his actions is outethics you should give the person consequence beforehand that parallels life but anticipates it if the steps of emergency are not taken successfully even if they are taken and the condition of emergency is prolonged it has to walk forward into an ethics matter because someone must be sitting on most of the comm lines goofing like crazy there must be some ethical problem involved for the condition to be continuing normal operation this is the next condition up from emergency it isnt stable unchanging state because everything in the mest universe either expands or contracts nothing stays really unchanging there are laws against it so in order for normal operation to be stable state it must be continual small increase there must be gradual routine increase the way you maintain small increase is to just let everything continue dont change anything dont put in any harsh discipline ethics and justice is mild and reasonable carefully observe every slightest rise of statistic to see what bettered it and do that for every slight worsening find out why usually it is something nonstandard remedy it jockey change and repair back and forth keep an oic board this keeps your improving statistics going up statistic that stays level isnt normal operation its emergency because one should be expanding if only to keep up with inflation the stat must keep pace with the world around it for instance salary that doesnt rise over two to three years is stable really down statistic and will tend to crash what looks level is really declining if one then economizes which is the affluence formula then you will really be in an emergency continuing this practice will result in collapse sooner or later matter and everything else in this universe obeys these laws or conditions the roman empire went into affluence brought about bv julius caesar but it violated the affluence formula they didnt deliver and they didnt economize instead they squandered the wealth of the empire on socalled conquest they treated the condition as normal julius caesar violated the commercial pax romana normal op which was stable by going off conquering tribes etc britain was trading with rome very happily then caesar came over and fought added britain to the empire gave them slavery not civilization and the empire collapsed in the year 0 ad or 1 ad the chinese conquered russia in siberia driving people west wave of displacement took place with the russians driving eastern european peoples into western europe rome didnt handle them it didnt resettle them or whatever they had boundaries to defend so they resisted the barbarian invasions and got overwhelmed it was all matter of the wrong condition being applied the russians who were in emergency didnt apply that condition either there is such thing as nocondition state state of emergency persists until it is handled even if one loses one gets stuck in the incident and goes on even after something has gone down to collapse it persists the condition continues all the way down even beyond death the dwindling spiral is really just applying the wrong formula for the condition affluence the condition of affluence is one which is dangerous surprisingly enough for instance gambler who hits it big is in danger of getting himself in debt instantly the first thing to do now is economize you must economize first then make very sure that you dont buy anything with any future commitment to it eg installment purchases dont hire anybody with any future commitments that is all part of that economizing clamp it down find every bill and debt you can pay and pay them now invest the remainder in service facilities make it more possible to deliver discover 537what caused the condition of affluence and strengthen it conduct research to discover what caused it it is something you are doing doubt power and power change the condition above affluence is power change for instance someone is very successful and gets promotion the correct formula is usually violated the new man errs by changing things the formula for power change is just because power has changed dont change anything new broom sweeps clean violates this formula if the operation was successful as it was running the new exec would be silly to change things but that is what people usually do it is easy to inherit successful hats just step in the boots and dont walk all the pressure points will come to you to make changes but the person before you must have resisted these successfully if your predecessor didnt sign it dont sign it dont do anything keep your eyes open learn the ropes see how the place is running apply normal operation to it if it is in normal op there are only two circumstances that need replacement success or disaster if it is successful there is nothing to change if someone can keep an organization doing well he is eventually promoted creditably and moves up to higher power position he would be leaving his organization or his post in condition of power if you move into the position of someone who left in disgrace so the place is in emergency just apply the emergency formula promote for starters keep the promotion going until stats start to rise then economize like mad condition of power is most interesting it is peculiar in that it apparently belies what you would normally think or expect to do as an operating thetan because that is condition of power what you mustnt do is disconnect that will bring about catastrophe for you and for anyone else its the violation of that condition alone thats brought about implanting trapping and an antagonism towards thetans guy who becomes powerful on wall street and disconnects from his old home town friends exemplifies this they resent it people are in fact so used to the power formula being violated that they dont expect celebrities that they used to know to talk to them they think you are going to disconnect it is hard to get people to continue talking to you because they feel that you are superior you have to break down the communication barrier when you come back from saint hill people may be in awe of you somewhat again it is up to you to break down the comm barrier people will be sure that you dont want to be in comm anymore beings in the universe fully expect you to violate the power formula if an organization gets to the point where it is fully selfsufficient in need of pcs students etc and disconnects from those around it people in the community will start thinking about implants mistakes and violating any freedom thetan might have they will get very suppressive they are being denied service for one thing one of the most dangerous things we could do would be not to make what we know available when you move out of position on power change the only way you can disconnect is to take ownership and responsibility for your connections the condition of power change is fellow assuming position that has been held from power to disconnect you have to make record of all of your lines you show what is there so that the replacement can then see what not to change make record of your whole post or you will be stuck with piece of that post to the end of time also you might check in once in awhile to see how your replacement is doing guy gets time track by not taking responsibility for something in this universe it is foul trick to permit death people write last will and testament but they dont take responsibility for their former positions by transferring their lines and writing up the post for their successors probably also have trouble checking in from time to time do all you can to make the post occupiable for fun look at the condition of government and the formula it is applying keynes economic law is increase want 6506c08 shspec63 handling the pts lrh is working on the final plots of r6 gpms some corrections have been needed he has found three gpms run out of the middle of the bank by mistake which turned on bursitis he has the first six gpms of the track run out absolutely correctly 538doubt and wonder about ethics is appearing in some places all we are doing is developing systems to handle the public students and staff are colliding with ethics which has the benefit of giving them familiarity with it if you dont have system of law and order you will never have law and order you will just have cruelty duress suddenness revenge sudden acts of surprising retribution etc without uniform justice you would get chaos especially with ots in operation clausewitz said that war is means of bringing about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy in his ignorance of this principle fdr kept world war ii going after germany and japan were ready to surrender by demanding unconditional surrender this was costly and stupid thing to do if you fail to halt war when more amenable frame of mind has been reached you are fool war should not go beyond that point this principle should be kept in mind by scientologists and orgs when under attack there are elements of the society that are at war with scientology because they are stuck in past incidents of fighting enemies you should take action against someone who is trying to keep you from doing your job but how much action just enough to being about more amenable frame of mind all you want to enforce on the entheta artist in the environment is certain degree of politeness dont get fixated on the entheta we want to bring service to the 80 who are doing well and contentedly since fixating on the 20 who are snarling and fuming takes attention from the 80 we should simply cut comm with the 20 once there is set procedure for handling sps once the executive can enforce little more politeness on his environment the exec can then reach because he has method of doing so now there is something he can do about it you want the auditor and the executive in frame of mind to service the 80 not the 20 execs tend to wind up with the entheta comm because they are supposed to handle it one tends to get fixated on the maybe cases the ones that arent running perfectly smoothly there are only two sources of difficulty with cases 1 the auditing comm cycle 2 pts you can make mistakes everywhere else and still get by of course there is also the gae as source of difficulty you can check out both the auditor to review to have his comm cycle checked out and the pc to ethics to see if he is pts the d of p doesnt get chance to talk in detail to the auditor and the pc this can be done in qual you dont just let the poor comm cycle continue hoping that it will get better if the auditor is uncooperative he goes to ethics until he has more amenable frame of mind in an exec cannot handle the isolated goofers he will get savage towards everybody if you cannot handle the criminal you pass suppressive laws that penalize everybody inspection before the fact governments police everybody because of the goofs of few most arbitrary rulings by any authority result from failures to handle the guy who goofed with subsequent desperation and savagery cf earlier statement by lrh that an organization is only necessary when there is failure to handle an individual pc who just wont run on average processing is pts or an sp inevitably and invariably lrh found that we couldnt handle the pts individual with auditing especially with processing below the level of power processing ptss are likely to come to you for help so you had better know that they need ethics or power processing anything else will make the pts individual rollercoaster because someone is arc breaking him faster than you can fix him up when you say that person has been suppressed by the environment faster than you could process him out of it what you mean is that there is an sp in the environment who wrecks his gains the pts pc often doesnt spot the sp you must get the pts individual to ethics and find the sp suppressive persons commonly speak in total generalities they broaden and generalize entheta so their identity broadens and generalizes people commonly cant spot the sp because of the generality around him check the pts individual for who he is connected to that doesnt like scientology do this check on meter and watch it fall off the pin have the pt individual handle or disconnect if you get the wrong person the pc wont handle or disconnect if you are right he will the pts gives enough trouble so that you may not care to help him forther but when you do attempt to find the sp you should hunt and punch around enough to get good result if you find the right person as the sp the pcs face will light up the ta will blow down and the pc will then handle or disconnect with vgis 539no ta case gain pts or sp trying to process pts will 1 raise his tone 2 thereby double the sps attacks on him 3 therefore cave him in worse than he was to begin with you can tell pts by looking for roller coaster periodic gains and collapse gain ever or ta less than ten divs sp that is all you need to look for youve got to have ethics to handle this with this data you can make releases handle students cases free scientology center cases etc you dont have to slam the door in anybodys face the pts gets told to handle or disconnect before he gets more auditing the sp gets told that he has very rough case which can only be handled at st hill in couple of years well have auditors here who can handle you here you could say in the meantime stay away because its very restimulative to you this is true too it is an unkindness not to label someone suppressive who actually is an sp one way to handle someone who sends in entheta comm is simply to deadfile him you have to bring about more amenable frame of mind on his part before you audit him or comm with him dont let auditors go on flubbing send them to ethics so that they realize the importance of applying the tech right know also that we will have an impact on this society that organizations will fold up under the onslaught of the technology matter how nice and theetieweetie we are weve got to hold the line and give service while we expand we would like to have organizations smoothly reorganize to run power processing we need all the backup of the organizations ethics d of p and full admin there is one nastier than someone who has been dished by power processes by the way it would be disaster to have someone trying to run power in the field it isnt the d of ping or the auditing that is hard to do it is the fact that it needs to become an assembly line which requires high degree of perfection of organization even on lowerlevel processes it is best to have team to handle ptss sps and admin psychoanalysis had certain degree of workability it got across the idea that psychosomatic illness stems from the mind the mind monitors and dominates structure if the mind is left alone in large number of cases the endocrine treatment as in the time when lrh psychoanalyzed half of group of people who were taking male hormones and found that those he talked with responded better to the hormones than the others will not monitor structure but when you remove few psychic blocks all of sudden it bites and monitors structure you could change diet exercise operating environment anything and it would make difference lrh just used freudian analysis on that project what we would call today straightwire but as subject psychoanalysis has failed because the individual practitioner had way to ride herd on or handle the ptss and sps in his practice furthermore he had free time or attention to do research he might have discovered power processing if he had the subject never grew because it never developed an organization that would carry forward the research our danger is only that as we move forward the technology will get shattered by alteris that must be guarded against then the technology must be applied now it collides with society psychiatry doctors etc you say all i want to do is go free ok you go into condition of power now the most serious thing you can do is to disconnect its the quickest way to bring about collapse you have been woven into the race and the universe too long to just suddenly pack it up you pack it up itll pack you up we have double route to enlightenment by study and by processing we havent begun to explore what can be done by study alone one area you cant go through with study and thought alone is the r6 bank mere study wont help person beyond release hed finish up at level v grade v there is tiger between release and clear you arent going to go through the h6 bank by just changing your mind that has to be gotten rid of utterly release might or might not occur just from the cognitions you would get from increased understanding the gradation chart actually goes as many as seventy levels below 34 the interpretation of the scale is tricky because it is what the person is aware of not what he manifests that person is always numb does not place him at 10 on the scale numbness what is important is is this person aware of the fact that he is always numb if guy could only be aware of false causes without knowing that they were false then he would be at false cause on the scale if he knew that false 540cause was false he would be above that level as when he is willing to accept your statement that babies come from under cabbage leaves because it is false cause lets say the guy says hey what do you know i just realized that im always after changes well there he is at 4 need of change you might say that the pcs level on the awareness scale is his cognition level the guy who never cogs is just not being trained or processed at the level where he could cognite he is over his head cogs come on gradient too power processing takes anyone matter where he is and yanks them up with thud to level iv the pc recovers terrific ability to know to be aware without necessarily attaining any more knowledge than he knew before probably this will just be redoubled at clear and ot here also he can create things which he couldnt do before he will not know more about how to do that by having been clear or an ot but his present level of beingness is such that his ability to grasp and act upon the potential of situation to assimilate and accomplish at that particular line whatever line he is in is just lightningfast he only knows what he knew before as well as he knew it before matter how clear you clear him he only knows what he knew before you dont increase his knowledge you increase his awareness of his present environment an individual will never make it without being trained in something the first thing hes going to be aware of as he moves out of comatose wog state into higher level of action is scientology its the first thing there to be aware of to study and it leads to higher ability level the cruelest thing you could do to somebody would be to audit him all the way to clear with auditor training he has this terrific potential to know and you havent made it possible for him to assimilate the technology which has brought him to this state it puts him in dreadful confusion he has understanding he wonders how did i get here wheres here it would be better to audit him up to release then train him up as far as hes been audited level iv then give him tools to go on up to clear then give him an organization to use those benefits in he needs to know how others function let him know then you have given him familiarity with the existence around him he has increased his span of knowledge of what is in scientology he has increased his organizational scope he has come up to an understanding of the usefulness of the various tools of scientology and he has also found out that these new states are moving up into type of civilization that can also exist this will raise his responsibility with all this you are not going to have lot of catastrophe you are going to have happy people this is taking totality of responsibility you must take responsibility for powerful knowledge look what happened to the atom bomb the nut who invented that took responsibility for it we have powerful technology for the first time we have total grip on knowledge of the universe and can bring people up with an express elevator we take as much responsibility as possible you have to take responsibility for knowledge to the degree that it is powerful we had better measure up to our power in all ways 6506c29 shspec64 the wellrounded auditor msh audited lrh to firststage release on 24feb63 they went ahead he went keyedout ot then he did more research and plowed himself into the r6 bank then he developed power processes power processes were totally predicted not empirical there they should be and there they were lrh ran the power processes solo when he got to the end all that was there was beginning of track and the r6 bank he backed off and looked for processes that would enable someone to have an ability back he got third stage release va see hcob 28jun65 releases different kinds hcob 12jul65 states of being attained by processing hcob 5aug65 release stages and pp 733738 below you can run it too far into the bank ie into r6ew but now you are at the correct end of third stage release can go into and out of the r6 bank at will he is also able to have selective abilities this probably made class vi easier we are getting an interesting reaction from orgs why are you sending us class vii note at this point class vii is power auditor were releasing all the people we want on 0 i and ii the differences between the stages of release are basically differences of stability the fellow has been gotten to state where he can postulate when he is released at level iv person can remain keyedout clear until he makes postulate wrongwayto and keys himself in again and the r6 bank 541kicks him in the teeth power release is more stable we still dont get keyedout ot at will although it does occur sometimes during power processing it is easy to overrun first stage release we have cleared many people by the book one definition of clear and then overrun them because the auditor didnt recognize floating needle after that the pc could get very arc breaky all that could be done with pc like this is to run him on power and bring him to higher degree of stability power can also be overrun if you overrun power and then audit someone on ordinary processes within power processing you would really be in trouble because where is only one thing there to hack at and thats the h6 bank you could audit some selective abilities with power plus run him up to third stage release playing tag with the r6 bank then go on to audit r6 it is highly unlikely that person will make clear unless he has been released on power the route through the bank is too hard when it lies across an engram that will revivify you are sitting in an engram trying to run r6 and it wont asis properly that is the trouble with it it is interesting to watch raw meat on power they dont know about the r6 bank they feel wonderful and full of awe because they dont know what the hell happened or what is going on after being run on power processes technical advances are out of this world administratively r6 and power look very simple and elementary the trick in instructing class vii note class vii is now power auditing is to get the simplicity of the processes and procedures duplicated when the students are used to complexity confusion has to blow off you run power processes muzzled the study materials have more to them than would at first appear to be the case the evaluation of importances is one area for instance darkroom worker who works for lrh on weekends knows lots of tricks but he doesnt know fundamental importances lrh spotted the similarity to new auditors who arent fully trained in fundamentals they want tricks and shortcuts all of which are interesting but unimportant it isnt the tricks that get anyone anywhere that is what psychiatry and psychology do they collect tricks like stamp collectors but they have effective standard basic tech i have never heard one of them utter one essential piece of information that would have led to the resolution of case fantastic hors doeuvres main course so the study phenomenon is theres the fellow who knows it and can do it and the theres the fellow who knows all the tricks and cant do it it is out evaluation of importances you can take basically sound piece of data eg that pc who never looks at the auditor or who slews around to sit sideways in the chair is arc broken and twist it to something like never acknowledge pc until he looks at you if you did this on power the pc would go round the bend hed go on automatic there is mainline information and then there are tidbits an auditor in training should differentiate between 1 mainline data which is very senior 2 data you should know to apply the senior data 3 parsley data data that if you use it it will make you look very clever nice data but of great value when someone like lrh shifts senior datum people go adrift for instance audit the pc in front of you was senior before grades and organization an org auditor doesnt audit the pc in front of him at all the auditor now audits the process if he sees bis or runs into trouble he sends the pc to review there is policy letter now with all the things on it that could be wrong with the pc hcopl 7apr70ra green form it is asking too much to expect the auditor to pick up the right one in session with form out of 44 possibilities especially when the pc may have overts on that auditor the pc should be repaired by some other auditor the auditor may be part of what is wrong hence the pc needs another auditor review auditors must be experts in assessment they pick up any read and straighten out whatever needs to be fixed whatever the problem is it is not standard tech that is the problem the review auditor is in different division qual the d of p apparently covers also the cs post at this time is forbidden ever to interview pc or talk to an auditor about pc only what can be statisticized is the 542concern of the d of p total ta process run hours in session etc if the auditor is trying to talk to the d of p about cases he gets job endangerment chit if pc doesnt gain in processing there are reasons why but knowing little tricks wont tell you what they are you cant put beings together again with cute little trick the auditors job is to audit standard processes on the pc with standard comm cycle on standard gradation program the d of p does standard d of ping he goes over the session and checks ta for the session he picks up the next folder the pcs goal is not to have too much trouble in this session the total ta was 27 divs for 2 12 hour session the pc is not in trouble continue the process next folder goals or gains pc restive didnt want to run any processes how many hours were wasted here all morning and all afternoon the pc was arc broken through it all auditor to ethics and pc to review handled in this way cases keep winning if the pc rollercoasters he goes to review then to the examiner then to ethics if the pc cant spot the sp ethics just keeps working it over there is someone who uses generalities that keep the pc from spotting him if you get the right one the ptss face lights like christmas tree if you get the wrong one it wont and it is like indicating the wrong bpc the condition doesnt change that is the only time ethics lays an egg when the pts situation is handled the pc goes back to the hgc and the auditor takes up from where he left off ethical standard matches case level ethics has as purpose making people better not punishing people suppose the org exec sec sees declining stats in the hgc processing is not as successful as before now is the time to look at all the review chits he finds that auditing cycles are out on several auditors he tells the d of p the d of p sends these auditors for special training and gets their comm cycle in lower classed auditors have lower ethical standards to be an excellent review auditor you must be crackerjack assesser be able to make the emeter sit up and sing know the processes called for on the green form be able to audit routine auditing on the grades be able to cs any folder know when to send pc to review and when to review auditors know when process is flat know what gis and bis can be read from folder know what process should be run next know what is good ta and poor ta and be cryptographer so you dont get misunderstoods you should know which auditor to assign to which pc your auditors are not all releases and you know that there are quirks that make auditor audit poorly with certain pcs if you drop out one of those skills you are that much less complete auditor there is review for power processing so power processing is done in review with two class viis csing each other an auditor in training is not being trained as onemanband he gets tired and quits auditing if he tries but he should be able to do the above actions so that he understands what is happening when he audits you only change the standard pattern of the session when the pc gets nonstandard the pc goes to review when he is flat ballbearing the auditor should know how to do green form not because he is going to do one in standard session but because as the org grows more review auditors will be needed the effects of outtech are slower to appear in the hgc maybe six months than in the academy few days people are always fighting to own this planet thats silly why dont they just go ahead and own it as we are doing 6507c27 shspec65 stages of release one of the interesting things about releases is that we have been making them for years and auditors have been going on by them running more processes there were probably releases being made in 1951 from 1957 on when lrh made lots of keyedout clears at an acc the 19th american acc 6jan14feb58 tech bulletins vol iii p 204 auditors should have observed what was happening the longer they cleaned cleans the more upset the pc became in exoneration they didnt realize that it is not ok to run process beyond floating needle this goes from ground zero to clear our 543main problem is overrun if someone got an fn on selfanalysis it would be goof to run more recalltype processes the first level of the case is recognition of the environment so if you asked person to look around and spot where he was and the needle floated you cant run any cchs or if you got an fn on the first objective process the rest of them are null and void if you go on you are cleaning clean this is the groundwork for quickie grades even on power if the needle floats even if the expected ep isnt there you end off fortunately you can run the rest of the power processes but when one process goes free thats it for that process our main problem is overrun this has happened many times to lrh lrh says he was overrun so much that he must have been running other peoples banks r6 is the exception to ending off when you get an fn because all other processes deal with keyout of the r6 bank whereas r6 is total erasure this doesnt apply to gpms when you get an fn you cant contact them and you are in trouble r6 is the only process which is dealing with total erasure all others deal with locks on r6 the levels ultimately begin with the reactive bank theres just the guy and the possibility that he could get aberrated on top of that the r6 bank is built and then on top of that is built tremendous accumulation that we know as end words and on top of those is erected whole series of whole track incidents and other types of gpms known as implants see fig 28 the latter prevented permanent releases by restimulating the original bank the r6 bank engrams are among and on top of implant gpms secondaries are on top of those with locks on the top engrams are restimulations of endwords endwords are restimulations of the r6 bank the whole trick in running r6ew is to get only endwords not to pick up r6 material itself surrounding the lot is the physical universe which could also be considered sort of bank what you are doing with pc is carving away at this stack of stuff it contains significances and masses spaces and energies it is also plotted against time but that is all there is in it the machinery and circuits in it are just combinations of energies and significances and as such they are just special case of the above this combination of energies and significances comprises mass that sits there in its own madeup space plotted against the pcs experiential track known as time there is nothing else in the bank although the bank says there is freud and psychoanalysis were popular because they had more r6 in their technologies than other systems they had some written endwords on which they were basing everything by transference freud meant that the pc flipped into another valence the freudians recognized recovery in terms of release of affect by which they meant an emotional discharge especially grief they didnt recognize other emotions besides grief nor did they recognize underlying engrams all anyone has ever been trying to do when he was sincerely trying to help somebody with his mind was reduce the effect of this thing called the reactive mind or the subconscious mind or the unconscious mind upon the individual himself there are many such psychotherapies on the whole track if anyone discovered scientology by himself he probably freed himself and took off there is trace of such an occurrence in the bank however there are many instances on the track where people attacked the gpms of the r6 bank chewed an item or two out or crushed one or some such they would take picture of the area where someone had been and hit big clapstick in front of the photograph to make it look like it exploded they did this when the thetan was anaten or comatose the thetan would get the idea and take his own picture of his misemotional or painful experience and smack it with couple of beams and snap out of it that is what psychotherapy was in the galactic confederacy there were also suppressive technologies which are easily mistaken for helpful technologies implanters developed techniques to have effects on people there are many technologies calculated to have an effect on people when suppressive studies scientology he does so from the viewpoint of trying to have an effect on someone the sp evaluates his action as an auditor by how much effect it had on the pc not by whether it made the pc better the whole subject of alchemy was devoted to throwing the whole r6 level into restimulation throwing the guy into his r6 bank and letting the guy cook thereafter the alchemists had other goal their books writings and practices make it obvious it was the lead of human beings that they wanted to transmute into the gold of spirit transmutation of metals had nothing to do with alchemy it was transmutation of life that they were talking about 544their books are full of r6 dichotomies if you get one of the guys who has been into alchemy on power and all that comes off is dichotomies he has been plowed into r6 since time immemorial you will have to find the practice that got him into it and fish him out hypnotism is another practice that is only intended to make people more compliant not to better them you have to wake people up to make them better not put them to sleep you dont want suggestibility you want self determinism some states on the whole track had thought tower to pick up hostile thoughts and record them so that the person indulging in crimethink would be turned in for brainwashing this is swindle there never was such thing person was implanted with that idea and placed under compulsion to report to the police if he had bad thought there was another idea on the whole track for controlling thetans you would take piece of thetan and keep it in lab if the thetan escaped they would touch the piece of thetan with hot rods this was also swindle the rule still holds that processing pc who is determined to succumb wont work because there isnt enough agreement in the session that is why you have an argument with hypnotists your purpose is different from theirs the common denominator of suppressive technologies is lies the common denominator of good technology is truth the whole test of sincerity is is the fellow doing what he says hes doing or is he doing something else these two questions have to be answered about any government movement or individual is there falsity on the line all these downgrade subjects have falsity on the line they say they are trying to make people well but their statistics show what is really occurring people assume that the psychiatrist is there to help the person and he isnt its an apparency as mentioned above the question is with psychiatry in charge is the world saner their stats are not just down they are runaway down since psychiatry has entered the field of criminology crime is fabulously on the increase theres falsity on the line what you understand hes doing is not what hes doing psychiatric research is done by deepsixing every scrap of data that doesnt agree with the theory being pushed if you tried that in engineering bridges and buildings would collapse but if some scientist is telling you oh well you have to be very learned to know about this you may swallow it if you are not careful this is also true in the field of art as an auditor you know that when the pc finds and articulates the problem it blows saying that it is something else wont do it so you see that the basic crime in this universe isnt making or destroying things it is altering truth any subject has few alterises in it otherwise it would just disappear but how many alterises does it have that is the question if it has many it will harm instead of helping people it will prove to be striving to create effects on people subjects with lot of alteris are harmful and subjects with relatively little alteris are helpful evil practices are identified by the falsity that is connected with them the worse off pc is the more he thinks hes got in his mind he gets on an additive line he collects and accumulates therapies like pack rat the medical student who gets every disease he reads about is on an additive line and in the direction of additive we actually approach evil on the direction of subtraction we approach good therefore scientology is based on truth the isness not the alterisness is what we care about it is what is in the mind not why is it in the mind cleaning clean brings about the manifestations of evil because since theres not anything there to be cleaned the pc has to put something there you are therefore adding it is adding because there is nothing there to be cleaned therefore the pc and the auditor have to put something there before anything will happen there are only five or six kinds of things in the mind when you are out of one of them you have to put something there to run it out there is reactive mind with certain elements when you have disconnected the pc from that class of element he has ceased to be an effect of it and you can regard it as gone the r6 gpms wont disappear by someone changing his mind or postulates because the r6 bank is tangle of boobytrapped postulates there wouldnt be anything else in the mind if the r6 bank werent there there would be thing or isness pc gets full blanks time track with solid locks because it all relates somehow to some secondary or engram somewhere on the track you start with the r6 bank then on top of it you get wogginess and wooziness on the subject of postulates he accumulates r6ew locks then his own goals as locks get stacked up on this and implants are overlaid on top of this then you get whole track engrams then secondaries then locks eventually with time when the thetan finally became human everything was lock on something earlier in the bank and he made picture of it yesterday runs like an engram he couldnt look at anything in the universe right now without it 545hanging up on some experience hes had that he didnt like theres the bank so the thetan gets full time track the thetan is also surrounded by the physical universe which gives him problems additionally there are other peoples universes which are different experientially this can also give him ptp that doesnt have anything to do with mental image picture or reactive bank but it can restimulate the reactive bank and thus be harder to solve ptp can exist as such independent of the bank if you get your hand caught in clothes wringer it is ptp it doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the bank the fact that thetans attention is stuck on ptp keeps him from putting his attention on anything else so he makes gain you can usually handle the problem on the basis that it is problem because he doesnt think he can handle it he has entered lie into it so he doesnt try to do anything about it so it continues to be problem the lie in problem is 1 that it exists and is problem or 2 that one can do nothing about it to handle it if the auditor could get the pc to confront the problem to take it apart and get its elements and take the lies out of the problem the pc could probably confront it and it would cease to be problem however the problem isnt necessarily entirely in the pcs mind every time an arc break is situation where the pc feels under some sort of attack from an unknown source in its inception an arc break is actually an incomplete cycle of action in all likelihood there is some big lie entered into it but the main upset is that the pc couldnt complete what he was doing pc isnt auditable when he is in an arc break because he cant put his attention on anything else it is presence of time that makes ptp as human beings all of us have to some degree an underthegun existence the amount of duress that person is under is proportionate to the degree that he thinks it threatens his survival you can tolerate quite bit of it unless you are on the skids already when the pc is upset the auditor cant get away with making mistakes when the pc is feeling good he can get away with some if you have managed to get the pc disconnected from his arc breaks ptps etc and then go on auditing him on them you are invalidating his ability to confront you are giving him the idea that he ought to be bothered by them when you see the fn dont give two more commands dont get him to itsa some more send him to the examiner let the pc have his win one more command and you are cleaning clean he is out of that outrud the connectors to the bank are gone in that area in trying to find an overrun after the fact youre looking in the goneness for the what wentness and youre looking through mass of it wasnt there anywayness afterwards release isnt just disconnected from the bank he has erased stratum of it in rehabbing you are getting rid of additives third stage release grade va leads the pc through the physical environment contact with the bank and ends up cutting off the r6ew top just going off the top of those floating endwords you can get the pc off of what pins him into those endwords you can just separate that each of the grade v and va processes is run to fn there are four processes on va one having to do with people one with where the pc has been etc power processing is very close to the truth therefore it must be run very standardly after running va there is nothing between the pc and the r6 bank itself now of course he can dive off the shade of this and he has protective coating between him and the r6 bank it stands there naked and raw hes got the r6ew spans that are lying in and amongst the gpms etc he can run those like shot r6ew can run to fn there is actually fourth stage release on r6ew running gpms one can go to fn thus getting fifth stage release by running gpms but these arent important the state of clear is what is important you dont want to go free of the body and leave some of the bank around to key in later in rehabbing you get the liability that you may find yourself working on the next stage up and the rehab process is not calculated to handle the next stage 5466509c09 shspec66 classification and gradation we have twenty people going for clear we are really getting an assembly line going the world is going downhill but we are reversing the curve all the laws passed to hit mr big end up hitting the worker the effect of the east grinstead city councils refusal to permit building as soon as needed is to make the staff work harder in very little space the maharaja of jaipur who used to own st hill wanted to build forty cottages and polo field the city planners denied him permission so he sold st hill to lrh furthermore the council never meets they didnt meet all august during the best building weather technical advances now consist of improvements in application of the existing technology technology that cannot be applied is not useful some things arent even meant to be applied eg pure mathematics lrh while he was in college suggested applying an abstruse form of mathematics to aerial navigation he was told that he would be flunked out of college if he continued this mathematical principle was later developed by the navy into loran we have had more technology than we have had application there was bug in the application which was not teaching auditors to recognize fns so the only thing holding up scientology has been the failure on the part of auditors to know or recognize the floating needle the trouble that we had with r212 was that it is too fast you have to be on your toes because your pc will go release perhaps before you have finished the first list overrun on k212 can be terrible unfortunately it was done regularly we overran our success point by many years on this process the main trouble you have today isnt getting result it is recognizing that you have gotten it saint hill students have had trouble getting classified for levels iii and iv because of the problem of auditing someone up to grades 3 and 4 people went release before they got to the processes required for those classification levels tech exists now we need to get it applied we have enough tech on world basis we need the technology of dissemination supplied this tech is in the fsm appointment letter if you can see it and it is also released elsewhere we are used to being improved or fixed by being passive and letting things be done to us but the individual is what we are interested in as final product it is interesting how long it can sometimes take for the individual to find himself somewhere around fourth stage release r6ew ep the individual finds himself with an answer to the question who am i namely im not as an intellectual knowledge but as total connection with self all the way back what has disappeared is all the times when the individual has been various identities the gains he gets can seem microscopic yet full of impact as he goes up the line these gains can get incredibly simple as things blow and stops get asised the individual feels that he could always have done whatever ability he has just attained he could have but he didnt so any commentary about the ability of thetan has to come off as an invalidation by understatement any assertion of ability is thus an invalidation you could make the wildest statement you could possibly dream up and then assert that as your own ability eventually youd have to get it off your case as invalidation of self recovery from illness could be related to dissemination you might have pain in the head and not know it until you become aware of it and it blows so that you feel much better what the pc assigns as gain is generally great understatement of the real gain the route the bridge when you first say to someone we will make you better they immediately ask better what better bank robber or is my lumbosis going to be better the difficulty is in trying to communicate what we are trying to do in scientology to someone who has inkling that that sort of thing can happen telling someone who thinks that he is body that he is himself is very hard people tell each other that man is an animal and when he dies he is gone dead this happens even though they dont believe it of themselves man has only believed that he is an animal for the past 7590 years psychology has changed since dmsmh was published it used to say that mans intelligence and condition couldnt be changed it is therefore difficult to tell someone on the street that he can get better you have to show him you can use graph the classification and gradation chart showing that there are these various states so he sees that there is place to go he can get reality on the level just above where he is by visualizing the graph he will see which way to go however it is unlikely that he will have any reality on the levels beyond the next level up life is improved on gradient not by leaps into ot 547from db if you buy the idea that you could become ot by inspection etc then you are also buying the idea that you dont have anything to do with life because it is you and your awareness that is improving not the attendant and appendant machinery with which you are surrounded we are handling life you must give an individual gradient that is real to him for instance to sick man not hurting is real after you have handled this then you could get him to consider sitting up if you ignore the gradient you can advance person more rapidly than he can tolerate when you promise person that he will made too big jump in too little time you set him up to get big lose people on this planet were not issued an instruction book on themselves how do you learn about yourself you learn by studying one lesson at time by getting one improvement at time you can advance person beyond his tolerance rate in processing the bridge we have is across an actual chasm the way across is by the bridge not off the edge the gradation and classification plan is designed to prevent people from going into the abyss the grade chart prevents loses by providing gradient ethics is the traffic cop the chart has an elastic bottom some people start from zero some people start from lower states level 34 is unexistence there are states way below unexistence on the awareness scale but someone in one of these states wont be able to read the chart as person at given level on the awareness chart improves he is likely to become aware of the next level but he cant skip levels his position on the awareness chart is not question of his behavior or what he is dramatizing it is what he as being is aware of person at unexistence when he improves becomes aware of disconnection level 33 misconnection would be an improvement over existence at all he gets the idea that hes disconnected from things he becomes aware of alert to the fact that in life he is actually disconnected person at fixidity level 27 wont find power real but he will become aware of ridicule or glee level 26 laugh at him and hell notice the awareness scale doesnt show what the guy is dramatizing it is not his behavior that counts it is what he himself as being is aware of it is what hes aware of not what you are aware of about him if the person is aware that he is introverted level 11 he can then and only then become aware of the fact that he is numb numbness level 10 at this level the individual gets reaction from life need of change level 4 is very high state most homo sapiens wonder how they can endure the thing they cant change the one thing scientology does do for sure is to change conditions so someone has to be up to level 4 before he can become scientologist person who has to be helped may not be aware of help or the possibility of it someone who only wants to receive help and doesnt want to give it isnt really up to the help level level 11 being aware of help is sixflow operation person who is unwilling to help others is not up to help on the awareness chart someone moving up the chart through the levels does achieve the awareness at each level above that the person has recognition he sees where he is his orientation becomes better he begins to recognize himself and others for what they are he gets up to where he can communicate then perceive then get oriented you cant find out where you are unless you can perceive where you are then comes understanding then enlightenment enlightenment never takes place before understanding people think it can and modern universities are dedicated to it above that guy gets return of his energy an adjustment he becomes aware of the fact of body and that he is not body he gets to where he can predict he goes into action he sees himself as capable of production he knows result when he sees one he can review the things of his life and take care of it he regains his ability his own purposes start coming out straight he didnt ever realize he was really running on other peoples purposes he gets clearing of his entire past and other purposes and realization of himself and then he goes into state where he is capable of power comprising conditions existence and source the top of the scale of awareness but by the time he gets into that state he is of course totally responsible and can be trusted with it otherwise he wont make it the grades approximate these steps the gradation chart parallels and makes possible the attainment of these awareness levels there are four states of release up to grade 6 then you get clear this is another state of release an ot is capable of operating with or without body he is himself he is independent of the universe around him the only thing that stands in the way of just getting person to become of each level one after another is the machines and odds and ends that he has around him 548and that have to be dealt with it is hard for person to get close to himself and confront these things you have to know the secret of dealing with these things the actual length of time that it took to find and develop the bridge is more than fifteen or thirty years it would be hard for most people to believe how long it has taken but anyhow it has been done 6509c21 shspec67 out tech references hcob 13sep65 out tech and how to get it in and hcob 21sep65 out tech teachers tend to say that everything is important we are in good position to select out the important data from all the data that we have someone at the has level cant do this to him every datum looks as important as every other datum the guy at the bottom of the ladder is drowning in sea of data that is unevaluated this is true both in life and in scientology the person is already overwhelmed with the confusions of life which also overwhelm him with data so he goes on retreat from the whole thing the hardest thing thetan has to do and the most important thing that thetan can recover is his ability to evaluate importances to know whats important and what isnt the value of administration of processing is different thing from what is processed the duplicative question which is basic to auditing is the examination of the mind for the apparent answer to the question the knocking out then of this that and the other thing until the individual can take look at it and see before him some data that is important the repetitive process itself is therapeutic repetitive processes permit the individual to examine his mind and environment and out of it to select the unimportances and importances the duplicative question is unique to scientology other things work because of this duplicative action moreover to find out what is important and unimportant the person has to find out what is and what isnt he would get great clarification of things because he is being presented with certain vistas of existence and conditions of existence and he is examining them and he is taking them in or he is knocking them out he is handling existence and reorienting himself someone can get things clarified by getting more data about life from study however as he does this he is straightening up his own mind and his real gain when the chips are all the way down largely depends on the auditor someone who is drowning in the sea of life gets repetitive command from an auditor and asises various confusions the pcs statements on the question are handled and asised those statements are then acknowledged by the auditor making full cycle of the situation only then can the pc get up to point where he himself might all by himself confront his own mind only when hes got his mind straightened out can he really benefit from new data hes got his own mind and life so mixed up that he has completely forgotten what mind is all about and in large majority of cases people arent even aware that they have minds at best they think that they are minds and perhaps that they have souls saving oneself seems too egoistical so one saves ones soul man is at effect he looks for the oneshot clear or enlightenment its not that scientology is slow its that man has gone so far down but the big gains arent so much at the top they are at the bottom getting started these gains are startling just getting the idea that there is road out can be big win the individual has had lot of loses on this line to him scientology is like straw in the ocean helped by an auditor the person can look at himself and life and make more gains it is lone ladder contrary to the general idea and desire for fast way to the top the person makes his first real gains on coming to realize that there is road out so there is dependency on 1 the disseminator 2 the intro lecturer 3 the course supervisor they all perform vital functions and they can produce more dramatic results than you would ever expect being used to auditing as the way to get changes the changes on the chart are made in 549session but the biggest mistake you could make would be not teaching scientology and not disseminating people in society are very confused and distracted one of the soundest ways to reach them is to talk about communication and telling them that scientology exists and as their friend is interested in helping them you tell person that if he could communicate to his environment better he could handle it better you tell him that if he were to talk to his wife it would come out better the only dicey thing there is that he has been punished perhaps for communicating so it might be difficult along the way dissemination and teaching lines can be bit wobbly but if the individual makes some gains he will still do ok but auditing lines cant afford to be wobbly when the person gets to auditing that is where there is room for shakiness or flubbiness now tech is tech the comm cycle has to be good the questions have to be understood by and acceptable to the pc they must also be answered and acknowledged up to the point of getting the person in session it is debatable exactly what the correct technical action in disseminating to him is because you are disseminating into such confusion life as it exists it is still debatable what it is best to lecture to people about common denominator is that lecturing about communication is good idea but auditing isnt debatable it works with precision if it is applied with precision there must be gaes in auditing there is leeway in dissemination but not in auditing which must be standard all troubles in auditing stem from auditor goofs so dont butter up nattery pc pull his withholds the ability to observe and tell whether what is being done is right or wrong is harder to do in auditing than in disseminating or in course supervising the auditor can make tiny mistakes that upset the pc so that the pc acts up the casual observer would say that it is difficult pc when in fact it was auditor goofs you have to be good auditor to observe good and bad auditing you will get some gain 30 to 40 of potential even out of bad auditing just by duplicative questions and by the fact that someone is interested in the pc however full gain only comes from precise right auditing what we mean by out tech is not getting the whole 100 gains available on every pc not just obvious goofs out tech is what is happening when the fine points of auditing are missing and when what really goes wrong with cases is not understood when there is out tech the auditor is to be sure sitting there giving the auditing command but he is making lots of goofs with it what does it take to make good auditor first we have the gaes see hcob 21sep65 out tech there are only five gaes 1 cant handle and read the emeter he doesnt see reads he overcompensates when bringing the ta back to set giving falsely large amounts of ta action 2 doesnt know and cant apply technical data this used to be cant read and apply an hcob this also includes nonduplication of css and not knowing that you havent done what you were supposed to have done 3 cant get or keep pc in session this is very often the case the pcs attention is on something other than the auditing you have to be able to see when the pc is not in session distracted etc there is little body of technology in this area you have to get the pcs attention by finding out what it is on and asising it note and find the arc break ptp or missed withhold and handle it the auditor who would try to audit pc whose attention is elsewhere is applying tech to nobody the most obvious and silly version of this mistake is where one got the pc an auditor despite the pc wanting and having paid for auditing or the auditor is so wedded to form that when the pc comes in already in session the auditor carefully takes the pc out of session in order to start the session 4 cant complete an auditing cycle this accounts for the pc who itsas obsessively this pc has been prematurely acknowledged in life or in auditing and this has happened so much that he feels as though he has never been acknowledged eg kid says mommy i just had great idea whereupon mommy says thats wonderful dear failed acknowledgment and host of other errors will also give rise to obsessive itsa such as not asking the question not acknowledging q and etc there are hundreds of ways to stop an auditing cycle one is not to start one as when the auditor just doesnt give the command the auditor can always polish up his comm cycle and make it better but when it is fouling up the pc it is grossly out with q and question ack etc 5505 cant complete repetitive auditing cycle auditors used to have immense trouble just asking the same question repetitively the trs and op pro by dup were developed to handle this inability in auditors as an auditing supervisor these are the things to look for not aspects of the auditors case dont audit the auditor as first action after you find the gae maybe the auditor could be audited say on his missed withholds there are really only four actually six things that can be wrong with pc 1 the pc is suppressive suppressive is someone who doesnt get case gain because he has continuing overts not because auditing wasnt applied well only about 2 12 of pcs are suppressive it is very hard to get this pc to give up the overts or to be made auditable for real case gain about the only way in which we can do it is with power processing occasionally someone can be overaudited so far especially on r6ew that they thereafter get case gain and will act slightly suppressive they have to be rehabilitated but true suppressive has never had any case gain or ta he is continually committing little overts because to him everyone is an enemy each individual is an everyone to the sp who is busy fighting everyone the sp is paranoid who doesnt change institutional cases are all ptss or sps that is why lrh has said dont fool with the insane he didnt know exactly why but now we know the psychiatrist is professionally pts 2 the pc is pts the pc who is pts rollercoasters in auditing this is the psychiatrists manic depressive case he feels good after auditing and then feels bad the paranoid or catatonic who doesnt change is the suppressive pts doesnt have to see the sp between sessions he only has to think what will joe think about this or what would joe say the sp could be 10000 miles away ethics officers sometimes have trouble finding the sp but there is one on the case the sp speaks in generalities which puts up fog making the sp hard to find if you audit the pts and get him better the sp will do something to destroy him so it is dangerous to audit him if you give pts too much gain the sp will either commit suicide or murder him most of our troubles have come from auditing ptss who then threaten the sp who then incites the pts and others to cause our problems you have to find the right sp finding him gives very positive result not just tiny change when you correctly spot the sp in ptss case the pts lights up like spotlight 3 the pc is arc broken 4 the pc has ptp of long duration this includes hidden standards 5 the pc has withhold or misunderstood word the misunderstood word is just withhold of understanding the pc is withholding himself from the understanding or vice versa 6 the pc has continuous withheld overts this makes the pc suppressivethe eleven items discussed in this lecture ie 5 gaes and the 6 things that can be wrong with pc given above are the only things that will act as barriers on case processes are things that work if these six things arent out with the pc and when auditors dont have gaes if they dont work one or more of these is why that is all that drives tech out d of p who doesnt look at these barriers to processing cant make anything work if these eleven reasons why processing doesnt work are ok almost any process will work unless it is overrun in other words the only other reason why process doesnt work is that it has worked all the way to result and it is done overrun is either problem or an arc break hence in fits into the above schema if the five gaes are not present then if the case is not progressing 16 are present you can just assess these six things and find out what is wrong with the case so these things are the points of out tech the whole environment is trying to feed the cs different data than these analysis of out tech would result in getting tech in by not allowing gaes and by detecting and handling the things that are wrong with pcs persons case is helped by the fact that as he advances he becomes more and more capable of selecting importances as you get on up the line the selection of importances becomes more and more an ability that is easily practiced 6510c14 shspec68 briefing to review auditors there are three key data that go out in an org and therefore are essential to be known by the department of review that lrh hasnt been able to teach tech qual or orgs you will hit them in review because one else will have gotten them 5511 high ta is overrun there is other reason for high ta reviews problem is to find what was overrun and how it was overrun when someone comes in who has never been audited and who has never been near another therapy or practice and whose ta is at 50 he has still been overrun on something you just have your work cut out for you in finding it dont throw away the datum the way everyone else has using this datum you are likely to find some interesting things say someone went release on christianity at age six or on exercise at age twenty and then went on past that point doing it some more releases dont only happen in scientology it is likely to be some wisdom or therapy that released him they are all failed technologies all past wisdoms may have had technologies that have been alterised and lost we almost went that route by not recognizing the state of release and the phenomenon of the fn what has been overrun is not necessarily what the pc was running when the ta went high you might have overrun some earlier release it may for instance be restimulation of an earlier overrun communication release the pc could have been problems release and gotten keyed in again on ruds question if the hgc or field auditor didnt repair it by asking as first question what was overrun they would never solve it they would get the wrong overrun you must find what exactly the release was on which or what one was it get the right when and the right what and the ta will blow down and the needle will float youve got to rehab the right release to get the high ta down there could be other overruns on the case too but there is one that is making the high ta get that and the rehab tech will get it to fn quickly or less quickly 2 rollercoaster case has an sp in the vicinity the anatomy of the pts is that of problem postulatecounterpostulate the persons purpose postulate has been or is being suppressed counterpostulate there is other source of roller coaster an sp gives the pts problem when the pc rollercoasters he has run into postulatecounterpostulate situation since his last gain pts really does make trouble for the auditor the org and himself ethics exists to get tech in if it is ever used to throw tech out it is being used suppressively search and discovery is used to find the suppressions that person has had in life the s and d question is 1 whats been your main purpose in life 2 who opposed it this often makes problems release in minutes with pts or with any problem you want to solve find the source of the counterpostulate man gets solutions to problems he leaves the two opposed postulates in place not knowing the definition of problem and then solves the resulting collision as in dialectical materialism the anatomy of problem gone mad any idea is the product of two forces is the backbone of dialectical materialism to solve problem look over the whole perimeter of counterpostulates and find what is the source of the problem if you handle the problem for the pc often the problem will evaporate for the other person also problems sometimes evaporate in the physical universe when you find the source of the counterpostulate in ethics when you see that the disconnection or the handle causes an enormous problem for the pts or for the other person from whom they are disconnecting you have invariably found the wrong person pts is the manifestation of postulatecounterpostulate find who when where and what you could list what purpose of yours has been thwarted you can get grade i release with this suppressives are now to be ated in review because ethics has flubbed it too much ptss go to ethics after review to have note made of the fact that they ar pts and to get statement made of handle or disconnect pts condition can be caused by suppressive action as well as by suppressive person for instance if you overrun pc past release the pc goes pts to the auditor just as mechanical action selfauditing is potential hidden source of overrun you dont declare the auditor an sp it was suppressive act thats all the definition of pts is connected to suppressive person or action the action could be inadvertent 552so you find the suppressive person the person may have only been suppressive for five minutes or he may have been suppressive for lifetime someone could be pts and overrun in that case you must get the suppression off and rehab the process suppressive person isnt someone with horns it is someone who has had counterpostulate to the pc person may occasionally commit suppressive acts or he may be habitually suppressive someone who is routinely suppressive in life invalidative of scientology and trying to keep people from getting well is social menace he is the subject of ethics he is the one who gets declared not the auditor who overran process from some inadvertent or stupid mistake when you tell person the right sp it is like locating and indicating bpc you should get blowdown and gis if the pc again rollercoasters youve got another sp so there could be several sps on the case you dont go looking for all of them at the same time but after you find one suppressive look for another one if you found all the sps and suppressive actions in persons lifetime he would be problems release and if he goes release on problems he wont go pts again unless he goes home and starts selfauditing he can overrun himself on selfauditing so be aware of that 3 the source of overts is an earlier misunderstood word the source of the overt is the other key datum that has been missed misunderstood word causes individuation which leads to overts the word that student is arguing with the course supervisor about is later than the one that the student really misunderstood any confusion stupidity or upset in study always stems from misunderstood word earlier than the one he is upset about it is always earlier so the source of the overt is in the formula 1 something is misunderstood 2 the person individuates 3 he commits overts against the misunderstood thing if what the person thought was the misunderstood was the misunderstood the problem would have blown so it is always earlier this datum is the key datum in the area of study and comprehension of existence it regulates persons iq the review action is to look for the earlier area and the earlier word that was misunderstood cf method 1 word clearing you can unburden few words earlier than where you think the misunderstood word is then get the misunderstood just before it you can date the time of the misunderstood you should ask what subject the pc was in person isnt upset with studying it is only misunderstood word it is not case and it is not the environment remember that you are handling fringes on endwords so dont push all the way back into r6 just find what was happening before he hit the thing he doesnt understand so these three data are the only ones that are really important in review 1 high ta overrun 2 rollercoaster pts who is the sp that question is the source of hangups on the track you must find the counterpostulate and the source of the counterpostulate 3 confusion comes from misunderstood word earlier than the one the person is confused about 6607c19 shspec69 about rhodesia lrh has just come back from rhodesia around february 1966 lrh was holding the mockup his body together with sticking plaster the organization was going fine tech was wrapped up lrh put things on wait his case for one thing he decided to take vacation he spent thirty days in palmas the organization was running fine clear 1 john mcmasters was made during february of 1966 while lrh was in palmas lrh decided to go to south africa he wanted to locate an alternate base for ots in case of war or political takeover he couldnt figure out 553why he couldnt do this the reason was that he hadnt defined the purpose of such base the purpose was 1 an alternate base for scientology in case of war or political takeover 2 to serve as base from which to put in ethics on the planet so tech could go in 3 to put in economics so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish see later part of this lecture lrh went to rhodesia he conceived of type of constitution they could use to solve their difficulties the government liked it lrh recalled that he had some assets in south africa he decided to invest them he bought house and learned that he could buy hotel in the wilderness for 5500 pounds and did he bought farm he was watching the economics and behavior of the wog world and getting kick out of being out there making friends with tough characters his usual friends rhodesian culture is still victorian it is small civilization in the middle of howling wilderness it is more sophisticated than london rhodesia has lots of land minerals precious metals and beautiful climate it is untouched and could easily be developed lrh met the governmental highups he was very acceptable to them he didnt discuss scientology at all he was examining the wog world and he didnt want to unwog it he went on tv and radio he had authority but he was solving lots of problems each individual rhodesian would agree with lrhs solutions but warned him that other rhodesian would agree with him because the solutions were too advanced lrh went down to his hotel at lake kariba he supplied the hotel with twoton trucks local industry started to use his trucks to transport goods and the area boomed lrh started furniture factory colony started to sprout just the fact of lrhs being interested in the country and seeing hope for it caused production to rise then lrh wondered how he was going to leave to go back to saint hill he was woven too tightly into the picture with staff of nine personal staff and twentynine general staff the pick of the ex consular domestic staffs white rhodesians kept telling lrh how to handle the african he realized that they didnt know anything about africans because they didnt recognize that they were people they would say they are sullen youve got to watch them but the reason they are sullen is acknowledgment bad 8c overexpectation and outgradient they were taking people with experiential background in politics or economics and expecting more of them than they were trained to do lrh made his staff happy by telling them that they werent rhodesians anymore that they were americans they were very spitandpolish enthusiastic and hardworking so in four months lrh was very acceptable to both races and even to extreme moderates as well as to extreme rightest whites reporter from the london daily mail told the minister of information what bad fellow lrh was the minister instantly told prime minister smith what bad fellow he was smith told the cabinet the same story and the next morning the rhodesian front committee was charging down to see lrh when they found out that his visa wasnt going to be extended because they knew that it was all lies smith had been built up as too fair and too honest his popularity had begun to decline because he hadnt worked miracles and because his communication was going out then he told the committee various things such as that lrhs business associates were complaining about him lrh had in fact only three business associates and one of them was there and denied the story smith said that lrh had been deported from australia but lrhs passport had record of having entered australia he said that lrh was wanted all over and had criminal record these people however knew that lrhs credit was in the stars all over the world they saw smiths feet of clay and walked out so lrh could leave covered with laurels as result of this expedition lrh found out that you cant locate base that you dont know the purpose of that was why he had trouble locating ot base now he knows what ot base has to do it has to put in ethics on planetary basis so that tech can be gotten in as you associate with the public and try to tell them about scientology you have trouble with the public because their ethics are out and for other reason one sp in rhodesia has wrecked the country and is keeping the whole scene enturbulated 554the only real threat to scientology is that an atom war or political takeover could prevent the organization from going ahead to clear people in addition to ethics but less vital than ethics economics has to be gotten straightened out economics is very simple subject with very plain laws it has nothing to do with politics and ideology actually economics exists as subject the purpose of which is to get people enough to eat etc man violates the laws of economics all the time for ideological and political purposes the already existing economic systems of the planet are usable in modified form and we need them to improve in order to allow for an expansion of our organization there has to be workable enough economics on the planet so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish and expand total subsidy of processing doesnt work because there is contribution from the pc people have to contribute to benefit from auditing so the economic purpose is secondary purpose of ot base also ethics is hard to get in on starving people ethics is out on earth and the out ethics prevents easy dissemination nearly every human being on this planet that is in trouble is in trouble because ethics are out in england someone stole and sold lrhs research papers which were then represented as the current practice of scientology very different thing people are killed in wars because of one sp in the government the only reason for war is few sps we could go and sort out key sps in international situations what we would do about it is something else political systems exist only to solve the problem of succession of rulers otherwise everyone could agree on benevolent monarchy the answer is of course not to have successors clear the monarch but political systems are not concerned with the happiness or productivity of people the only source of our individual personal difficulties is not having ethics in in the society around us the only reason why you are having difficulty as an individual is not having ethics in in your immediate environment weve got to shift gears in our emphasis we have been getting ethics in on our fellow scientologists with great enthusiasm now we are familiar with the system and how it works we have erred by getting ethics in too heavily on scientologists and too lightly on the environment it is time to reverse the emphasis there isnt any point in getting ethics in on willing person just because he is stupid doing that just makes the person sullen ethics should be directed at willful acts of sabotage real sp is not just anyone he intends to damage you he is real nut he intends to knock you down he is not just difficult person he is real monster upgrade your idea of what an sp is like sps amount only to 25 of mankind find out if the guy is driving people into sanitariums strewing social wreckage about and smashing statistics we have only had one real sp on staff just because person shows up on an s and d doesnt mean that he is real sp maybe he is just making someone unhappy dont fling the title around lightly within scientology outside scientology dont worry about making mistake and accusing someone wrongly just get ethics in real hard first and correct the mistakes later weve got to put in ethics fast to prevent disaster it was great to find that the organization could continue without lrh it was great to find that you could make more clears you made 22 to celebrate his return lrhs immediate program is to finish his own clearing he has found that people dont make it with their grades out then he will start ot research every time he tries to put together the scope of ot he has to run off the invalidation any statement you can make about ot falls short of the truth 6607c21 shspec70 dianetic auditing processes today are so fast that auditors cannot be trained see above lrh wrote bulletin in april hcob 3apr66 dianetic auditing course which is now going into effect to handle this situation if auditors cant audit auditing gets done and one makes it up the line follow the fundamentals get your question answered dont change the process because the pc goes unconscious drills on trs are not enough by themselves to make smooth auditor releases can be made with dianetic auditing lrh has done it for years the earliest clears were dianetic releases they were more or less stable but they were in much better shape than they had been in dont go using dianetic auditing in practice joke dianetics is practice auditing however these processes can heal though not with uniformity since the whole reactive mind is the cause of very severe illnesses the way to make someone well is to make thetan clear therefore clearing is the 555real cure for illness so dont specialize in dianetic keyouts but slower process is needed to give auditors practice at auditing they must get to where they are used to the comm cycle can read meter get some wins etc all the bugs have been ironed out of dianetic auditing even turning on visio which used to be hard is easy if you get the exact duration of the incident teaching someone dianetics gives him very basic fundamentals hcob 3apr66 gives an improvement on old dianetic technique since it doesnt require repeater technique etc it was simplified version of dianetics compared to the earlier r3r technique which was closer to modern dianetic technique it involved simply locating an incident within the pcs conscious recall and running through it repeatedly until the pc is up to tone 40 cheerful on it then taking another incident within the pcs conscious recall and doing the same thing the mind is 1 literal record of experience plotted against time from the earliest moment of aberration until now 2 additional ideas the fellow got about it 3 other things he may have mocked up or created on top of it in mental mass 4 some machines 5 some valences these make circuits that talk to the pc the arabs demons circuit is an endowed life object you can audit any of these to greater or lesser profit mental mass is mass but the mass of it is very slight compared to the real object one makes picture of for auditing purposes when you do an s and d you are not looking for pictures you are looking for valence if you want to change someones personality graph audit out some valences the graph is just picture of the persons valences he is hardly there at all in dianetic auditing neglect the machines the valences and the illusions the psychiatrist and the psychologist addressed things that the person himself mocked up his illusions they only invalidated the illusions without finding why the person was creating them you are only interested in experience not illusion illusion is surface manifestation that evaporates when real experience appears illusion is the product of the actual and if you attack the illusion in dianetic auditing you prevent the pc from contacting the actual the actual is so bizarre that humans tend to invalidate it by confusing it with illusion thus people are prone to call the actual and illusion both illusion as with dubin newspaper stories are untrue but usually based on real event the newspaper is the modern gossip newspapers specialize in creating illusions news is social illusion of an event if you are running an engram the pc may start by confronting illusion then come up to confronting the incident so the incident may change as he audits it pcs confront gets better as he audits dub in and he begins to see the real event the pc can himself be confused by the change dont evaluate for him about the reality of the incident he is running just put him through it again thetan is busy little bee he goes along making pictures he clutches them to his thetanish bosom then wonders why he feels sick person isnt aberrated by pleasure though he can get hung up in magnitudinous win pleasure moments dont run out secondaries contain misemotion any emotion or misemotion may be contained in secondary the tone scale was plotted from the behavior of secondaries as they were audited any aberrative secondary is based on an engram an experience or picture of pain and unconsciousness this was originally thought to be cellular memory hence the word engram whenever someone is hurt he makes complete exact record of what happened that is fantastically accurate with respect to time thetan does not make errors reactively about time he gets confused analytically about it the exact date of each incident is recorded but the incident is unconfrontable if he cant get the date he records what he cant confront and that is where he gets engrams and secondaries the emeter sees deeper than the pc can but it doesnt see all the way down it reads on things that are close to being confronted it reaches what the pc isnt confronting but could confront it wont register on the totally unconfrontable eventually the being can confront as much as the meter can see when he is clear you can unflatten things that you have flattened by continuing to go over them in running engrams you should get them down to where there is more ta action the aberrative mind the mind being approached by dianetic auditing is the mind of events the events are often approachable through locks what person knows about is not aberrative 556someone can do total switch in valence he can become another person with that persons characteristics so pc in given valence in an incident may see another person in the incident as opposite who actually represents the pc in his own valence in the incident so if you notice certain trait in the pc ask the pc who had characteristics opposite to the ones that the pc is manifesting the pc will spot the person he had switched with who objected to the characteristics that the pc had before the switch but that appear opposite to the pc because the pc is in that persons valence looking at himself when you ask the pc this question the valence will asis and the pc will then get true perception of the other person in running engrams the pc may thus go into and out of various valences thislifetime address to the situation is recommended because the pc might have an infinite number of incidents to run but you can err in dianetic auditing by running too late on the chain you may be able to stay in this lifetime and key the pc out but you cant insist on staying in this lifetime the danger is in 1 trying to erase an incident that is getting more solid because it is too late on the chain you should go earlier 2 not getting the charge off incidents contacted before going earlier this is the opposite error you can hit the incidents too lightly not get enough charge off and keep going back too quickly if you do this the pc will wind up in ball overwhelmed with the charge he will be all messed up pc may himself skip several incidents and get himself into the glue if the latter occurs just treat that session as an incident and erase it as lock this is something we have almost forgotten how to do in scientology it is quite easy and effective you can erase anything if you are good you can always go through something once but if it is chain watch it about going through it more than once the whole of dianetic auditing is the tracing of experience the rules for it are in hcob 3apr66 plus this lecture additional thoughts if you get pc stuck in some lifetime run out its death the lives that are especially aberrative are the ones in which the pc almost made it there is total bank release at the level of dianetics there are only releases on particular subjects the releases you get are by chain not from whole class of experience total bank releases exist only at scientology levels 0v you can get minus releases from the minus awareness scale in fact you can assess the minus levels of the awareness chart and sometimes produce release just by assessing them and finding where the pc is stuck at but dont go by an fn during this procedure any dianetic auditing is better than dianetic auditing that is still true although some scientology auditor may knock the pc around if the pc is groggy at the end of dianetic session have him look around and notice things in the room audit the pc on locks andor secondaries at first running secondaries will drop the pc into engrams dont try to cure his lumbosis by running out the engram that gave him his lumbosis auditing to cure something is giving the pc attention because hes got lumbosis ie rewarding down statistic it puts the being at effect and he will deteriorate as being you have the technology of total recovery of the being if you audit towards that you will be helping the pc audit towards improving the pcs confront and his abilities not towards curing his illness his illness is his hidden standard he is saying cure my medicosis and i will believe in scientology audit the being not the illness there is value in dianetic auditing it solves the problems that freud was attacking but compared to scientology it is nothing dont get stuck in the wins that you will have with it the road out is the road up through the grades use dianetic auditing to learn the fundamentals about the human mind and to learn how to audit dianetics is not currently for the psychotic the neurotic and the sick 6607c26 shspec71 the classification chart and auditing auditing means to listen and compute and to get result on pc who is person with aberrations and difficulties auditing has to be done in professional standard manner since the beginning of 557wogdom there has been offbeat activity going on that is reason to perpetuate it the psychiatrist exists for the good of the society and to hell with the patient our situation does not compare with earlier mental therapies we are not even trying for the same result we are clearing people by erasing reactive minds unlike psychotherapies auditing is not social criticism we know the answer to why the pc behaves the way he does we also know why the wog behaves the way he does scientology is road out that increases the persons abilities taking him out of his identification of aaa the road has milestones which we call grades there are also levels on grades there are certain abilities gained but these grades are not composed of single points despite the names given on the gradation chart that is the rough public rendition it is really not possible to enter the upper grades without having attained the lower grades trying to do so results in disasters the whole track falls between grade v which enables the pc to confront whole track and grade vi but it doesnt necessarily appear in either though it may besides the disasters that occur from an out gradient other disasters come from not following standard tech standard tech is contained only in hcobs not in any books if i havent signed it it isnt true some day we will publish then all in consecutive order all corrected the main bugbear of someone studying scientology is that he conceives that every time he reads something new it wipes out the old this concept is based on the fact that he didnt understand the old material that he had read in the first place so he doesnt realize that it can be integrated with the new material that has just been issued something developed later doesnt replace something developed earlier the new does not wipe out the old the old generally correlates well with the new there are very few corrections one significant correction is contained in the newlyfound fact that you can overrun things lot of old processes failed because they worked so fast that the auditor didnt spot the release point when it occurred this accounts for the poor results of r212 when it went wrong it works very fast we didnt know about overrun in those days with dianetics you can have one release per chain so dont try to escape from confronting engrams by going release pcs are entitled to make rapid gains and soar on up the line that doesnt apply to students like great singer student has to suffer to be great he learns what errors can be made by being pc who gets messed up someone who has never been overrun doesnt appreciate why it is undesirable getting bad auditing isnt necessarily disastrous it teaches the student not to give bad auditing i have been audited by dianetic auditors who were trained in an academy that taught only the bubble theory nothing will help an aberrated being short of processing standard tech is very very narrow path and its very easy to stray off of its edges it is bounded on all sides by wrong things to do in auditing one wrong thing is to fail to handle pcs while auditing them you must keep the pc handled in order to audit him one way to suppose that you couldnt handle pcs while auditing them is to think that you cant do anything about something which is above pcs grade you can always run an advanced process on pc as rudiment as something to straighten the case out in hurry for instance even though problems grade 1 you can always run level 1 as rudiment for level 0 in fact if the pc has ptp you had damn well better it is not im sorry we cant talk about your problems because thats grade 1 and you are only working on grade 0 and at the problems level you may run into service facs eg the pcs lumbosis these can give you hard time in making problems release after all the reason why the chart is the way it is is that the gradation chart is made up only at the level of the grades of those things which you cant audit in the face of and that is the genus of the chart the real reason why i found the grades and why there are certain things that if you dont pay attention to them prevent all progress in auditing and in life so therefore they must be the keys to aberration and thats where we got the chart only these factors have appeared as barriers to case gain when not handled these are the super barriers to the track 1 ptps give rise to ta asising inability to concentrate inability to answer auditing commands and perhaps some degree of rising ta 2 missed withholds and overts cause nattery choppy and mean pc 3 arc breaks give the pc sad effect 5584 communication problems lead to communication unconsciousness is communication problem the cdei scale can be applied to communication for instance ow must be higher grade than problems because person could confront having problems when he couldnt confront an overt dont think that because someone is grade iv release he will never again have outruds of any sort the product you have is gross product the release can last quite awhile or not it is not gold it is gilt and it can tarnish sometimes it turns green it is the temporariness of this state which is after all state of keyedout clear that boobytrapped the whole research line in the field of the mind there are lowerscale harmonics of everything the thetan can do or be the state of thetan exterior is what the buddhists called bodhi it is not permanent state however even though it is not permanent release should not be underrated it is accompanied by the experience of overcoming that which the person has been released on and that improves his ability to confront also bit of erasure has occurred which desensitizes the whole thing so the releases made nowadays are more stable than the releases that were made in 1950 now we are approaching release on gradient and we know what grade of release we are making always be willing to give the pc win the clear cog is im mocking it up clears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds about the rules and when they do that of course they are ots oddly enough ot processes are upper harmonics of the same things that prevent auditing only they arent processes if you want to audit you must handle whatever rud is out when its out if the pc at grade iv isnt talking he may be communications release but you will get nowhere until you get him in comm communication is the carrier wave of all processing someone whos release is less likely to have outruds but these things can still occur having the grades doesnt mean that you wont get arc broken with yourself and with the auditor if you want good auditor at grades vi and vii become one there are interim release points on the chart that you are probably neglecting someone could get an fn on communications process without being released on every aspect of communication so he isnt necessarily communications release lot of processes were dropped out of the lineup that shouldnt have been dropped you will have to use tech from another grade in running grade at level 0 you have valence processes as well as the usual comm processes you have some more complicated comm processes at grade 1 all along the line there are lots of processes that someone could be released on r4h r2h recall an arc break date it assess indicate bpc cchs were on grade ii also arc processes plus case remedies at level iii you get auditing by lists and overt justifications there are also physical processes meter dating and cause and effect processes dont ignore grades processes as rudiments pcs dont ever object to auditors unless theyve got overts on them matter how lousy their auditing is pull the withhold pc audited over an arc break protests then screams then fusses then gets tired and then gets sad and sadder neglecting rudiments will ruin case you will have to use them on all pcs at one time or another dont ever fail to notice outruds or fail to put them in when they are out that and going nonstandard is the only thing that could bar person from going clear 6607c28 shspec72 dianetic auditing and the mind when you are running engrams and secondaries you are handling the human mind what the mind was coating was the subject of scientology it is coating the thetan in other words you like blob of glup person is static the subject of the mind has been considerably mucked about and misunderstood the engram came from theory that lrh developed at george washington university man had way to explain memory if memory was molecular phenomenon man has enough storage capacity in the brain to last three months lrh wrote this up as proof that this isnt 559how man remembers it is difficult to think about mind harder than thinking about brain fortunately the mind doesnt have to understand itself lrh was there to understand it you would have to be aware of the fact that an individual is able to create matter energy space and time in other words pictures before you could understand the mind you dont have to ask or explain where thetan came from thetan just is this gets us into discussion of reality one has nailed this down philosophically in scientology reality is what is that is all you need to know about reality itself delusion is reality for one person out of agreement with others from these elements it is possible to figure out why man is trapped and why he acts and reacts as he does you can figure this out once you know the basic definitions in dianetic processing you have to know what the mind is the thetan is compulsive mockerupper he is stupid that is the one flaw in thetan if you can get him over this mad obsession to 1 make picture of everything that happens to him 2 then hide it from himself 3 then fix it up so it can impinge itself on his existence you can get him out of the cage he dramatizes these pictures or they enforce computations on him he does this by dislocating himself in time the mind is 1 pictures that have been made of experiences 2 plotted against time 3 preserved in energy and mass in the vicinity of the being 4 when restimulated they are recreated without his analytical awareness what is the mind that you are trying to get someone out of the trick of it all is that you cannot make postulate or an intention through this mass called the mind whenever you try the mind is restimulated so the thetan is not able to handle things or make things by postulate thetans thought cannot go through the barricade of his mockups when he tries to put forth an intention or postulate it collides splat with whatever engrams are in restimulation the less creation of his experiences the person has around him and the less he has around him to be restimulated the more he can think or project his thoughts and the bigger he gets you can delete these experiences and thereby free the being and his intentions and postulates dianetic auditing is the activity by which these experiences can be deleted the pc may be messed up because he is trying to restrain himself from dramatizing person has tendency to repeat in action what has happened to him in experience he tends to replay now something that happened then out of its time and place the thetan could give himself disabilities to prevent himself from dramatizing you are dealing with the basic mind the core of the reactive mind also has this same character but it is so outrageous and overwhelming that you had better not touch it without the map in view of the fact that the individual didnt know what happened he sometimes told himself what happened and got the actual experience overlaid with another experience this is how you get too many julius caesars julius caesar was pretty suppressive which made him the winning side or valence so lot of people whom he affected and overwhelmed took on his valence thetan has trouble remembering when he is all smashed down in the mind the effort to remember gets painful so he would rather not remember one of his favorite methods of handling the bank is almost as crazy as making the bank in the first place it is forgetting about it when you start erasing the mind the person may be upset at the point where you have erased his circuits and machinery and he hasnt remembered how to do things himself as far as auditing is concerned dianetics is play it is far more than man could do before but its benefits are far far less than the benefits of scientology auditing if you tried to erase the mind picture 560by picture you would be at it long time say you have had one pain per year and one major catastrophe every five or ten years if you added them up over all your lifetimes you would come up with too many to erase in any reasonable number of hours or years this is why lrh addressed the thetan rather than the thetans mockups with the grades one could be clear in few years starting from the bottom and not going at frantic pace in auditing engrams there are some phenomena you should be aware of chain wont erase if you erase only the late end of it the only way to solve problem is to handle the elements it contains if it contains past lives you will fail to handle it if you dont handle past lives if an incident gets heavier and more massy hit the silk go earlier if chain has basic before this lifetime that is where you will have to go to get it one of the symptoms of an incident going more solid is the pc bouncing out of it the pc bounces out of the incident into the lock that he has just made in pt running through the incident the first time in this session this can be manifested as the pcs repeating just what he said the first time he has learned better than to go near the incident this is the same mechanism that keeps his bank mocked up in the first place he cant confront it so he keeps it in pt it would erase if he confronted it but to do so is too painful you can get this phenomenon if you use the meter to determine what to run dont use meter to locate incidents if you run what the pc can find youve got something he can confront man can remember what he can confront and that is all he is going to remember if he runs the engram from pt all conceptual and not in the incident it is because the incident is really too much for him to confront guy with amnesia is just guy who is so spooked that he is not willing to remember anything it is not just bouncers or holders which govern peoples ability to move on the track someone who is about to be executed is terrified of the future he will be stuck in the moment before the execution or he will shoot earlier some people thus escape into the past track others are only willing to remember what happens after traumatic experience it is only running pcs beyond their ability to confront which causes trouble in dianetic auditing if you run the pc on what he can confront you wont get into situations for which you need solutions you could run the pcs chronic emotion that would be good project there is probably secondary for every engram so you are likely to drop into engrams while running secondaries the secondary lies right across the top of the engram if you try to run loss you end up running all the incidents on the track there are also overt chains the motivator series each engram has 2000 to 3000 locks each secondary also has 2000 to 3000 locks chains crossconnect and crossreference with other chains it would be impossible to take something that pc was afraid of and trace it back to all the reasons why he was afraid of it it will be found to occur in too many chains and locks the individuals experiential track is important because when we clear someone we get new thing being without bank who has experience when you find yourself in trap it is good idea to find out what the trap consists of that is one benefit of engram running you will find that there will be certain points of emphasis but all thetans have had experience there are specialized thetans if you cant get the pc to run engrams run breakfast if that is not confrontable have him run entering the auditing room for some people the flow of time from moment to moment is continuous pain dont try to get such individuals to confront heavy stuff 6608c02 shspec73 suppressives and gaes normally there is penalty for crime of omission in this society it is being there and communicating that are the crimes that are mostly punished but there are also crimes of omission for an auditor not being there and not communicating are the highest crimes in the area of tech we have gone from total change to total nochange the materials are all there the road to clear from raw meat to grade iv is very fast that is something you can have trouble with is an auditor it is over before you notice there is difference between wog and raw meat wog isnt even trying some processes are dangerously quick so they are not even in the lineup because they overrun too easily r212 is one of these the route is so fast that only gaes can prevent someone from going watch out here come quickie grades every thetan wants out at least for himself even the suppressive suppressive is special breed of cat he is someone with case gain the sp knows that he belongs in the soup so he is sure that 561you want to put him in an sp could be described as someone who is always totally surrounded by martians matter who you are as an auditor he will do nothing but commit gaes he wont just commit few he wont audit at all but he will say see i try to audit these guys and it doesnt work so its worthless fraud he rewards only down statistics he goofs up and vilifies every effort to make people better the trouble with scientology in south africa is that they are afraid that lrh will teach it to africans if registrars kept this nocasegain fact in mind it would save us lots of trouble we wouldnt try to audit them an sp will make case gain and cant resist bragging about it the registrar could route them to the ethics officer anyone has the right to complain about one auditor but not about all auditors as an auditor the suppressive is only happy when the pc gets worse and he is sad when the pc gets better an sp is in state of constant attack on scientology he commits overts 24 hours day you very seldom find out about it another characteristic is that he attacks wrong targets he attacks those who are trying to help him he will not complete cycle of action if by chance he does complete one he will reverse it at time during this lecture have i said that all existing governments on the planet today reward down statistics choose wrong targets fail to complete cycles of action or commit continuous overts i have not said that and your inference on that subject is your own responsibility an sp believes that you are trying to trick him into letting down his protective mechanisms long enough so that you can stab him in the back if as an auditor you observe all these things and the pc is getting case gain you know that tech is out because it isnt working you as an auditor can be an ethics officer if need be you should know some ethics tech you have to know how to locate overts that are so unreal that they dont read on meter the heads of governments are suppressives they do commit continuous overts and they do the other things that sps do they would get case gain if you audited them having them in the drivers seat is dangerous situation ethics must be gotten in not on police state basis but on very narrow precise basis the world is also full of pts people they are the ones who cause most of the trouble hence the name the pc who gets and loses case gain is rollercoastering he has an sp somewhere on his lines either directly or by restimulation auditing is fast but it isnt fast enough to overcome the sp you could take the pts out of his restimulative environment audit him up to grade v let him go back to the environment and he would collapse the reason why the pts individual rollercoasters is that the suppressive person or valence will try to destroy him if he makes case gain therefore dont audit pts you may kill him pts person could make it however if he made it as far as the clearing course grade vi is the makebreak point at grade vi you could barely make it in the presence of an sp below this it is not possible another way to handle the pts individual is to do an s and d to find the suppressive the s and d is an assessment not auditing it is an ethics action therefore you cant have gaes during an assessment because it is not auditing you ought to get the arc break handled by assessment first before doing an s and d what can you do for an sp the only known action that will change an sp is the last power process he is the real psycho the only place that it can be done is in an org that has class viis who could run it and registrar who will throw him out when he comes in complaining of case gain because getting him to answer the question could be very difficult if you did do power on him his next action would be grade 0 or lower but until you have total control of the environment and padded cells send him to ethics if it turns out that he has been well audited with case gain you are taking your life in your hands to put him in the hgc an sp got to be one by switching valences man is basically good but he mocks up evil valences and gets into them an sp is in false mockedup valence to which he has earlier assigned or postulated evil purposes or actions evil is the declaration and postulate that evil can exist thats all in the absence of such postulates man is good scientology would be very dangerous if that were not true the suppressive first mocked up badness in another then took on that valence the suppressive got in the bad valence committed overts then was attacked by other beings he is stuck in that second 562incident it is far more real than pt he is living nightmare anybody has few of these realer thanreal pictures but when most of us run into them we are running back into them the sp never left you and i may go back to an incident of trauma but an sp has never left it the incident is more real to him than pt to the sp all life is the threat of this incident and the personnel in it all life is this incident and everyone in pt is one of the attackers that is all there is to an sp he continuously commits overts because he thinks he is defending himself you could get in this state only if you had lots of overts before it this makes the sp choose wrong targets he cant complete cycles of action because he is stuck in time that is why the last power process works person commits overts stacks up the bank until he cant move on the track then gets the business institutions contain few sp they mostly contain ptss power processes can blast the sp loose from his stuck point on the track so that he can then be normally audited but how can he be audited on power processing in the first place by someone who is perceived as an enemy how can cop or the roman legion audit him psychiatrists fail to put in ethics on their own profession that is lrhs criticism of them lrhs quarrel with governments and politics is the same any system that permits an evil man to rise to power is bad system as an auditor you are only at liberty to handle ethics if you yourself have clean hands and if you have certainty that it is not your auditing that is the cause of case gain you must be satisfied that you dont commit gaes before you can accurately spot an ethics problem the difference between confident and an unconfident auditor is that the unconfident auditor is one who feels that he may be committing gaes the benefits of doing trs are the benefits of the auditing comm cycle itself apart from the processes used we know that the tech is not inadequate if you omit tech or add to tech it fails to work there was an additive until recently auditors were quitting when ta went low saying that the pc could then only be audited on power the truth is that case that is chronically below 20 is in chronic apathy and wont really get over it until he gets power processing but he can get gains on grades the easy way to know whether it is your error or the pcs condition that is causing auditing problems is to know the five gaes your judgment on an ethics problem depends entirely on your confidence in avoiding gaes they are very obvious you could detect them on tape of your auditing be interested in what is going on with the pc observe how he is doing getting and keeping pc in session is under the heading of observing the pc which depends on willingness to confront the pc real justice can never occur in the absence of an understanding of the human mind never our justice leaves artificial justice behind it justice is only necessary in an aberrated world or area 6608c04 shspec74 dianetics scientology and society dianetics has an interesting history it hit like battering ram and the planet hasnt recovered from the impact it got neglected after 1951 but it is the entrance point to what the mind is all about it gives superficial explanation of what behavior is all about it wrapped up the world of mental healing it is very junior subject when it became clear that we were addressing the human spirit working on his mind seemed of far lesser importance the backflash against dianetics and scientology is based on the fact that it works and that it is in competition with psychiatry not that it is fraud not all psychiatrists are really evil some are merely caught up in routine that they cant escape however lot of them are sps those that arent are pretty pts they dont understand what we are doing nor do we understand what they are doing because we dont have the same goals as the psychiatrists on soliciting approval from psychiatrists i rarely go around zoos wondering if i am acceptable to the monkeys in the cages in unsuccessful activities you get change of titles every once in awhile mental healers keep changing their titles at present they are psychiatrists in the 1920s they were alienists etc one reason that they are unsuccessful is that they give all their time to down statistic and keep getting pulled under if we were to approach the same area as our major purpose we would in order to make it first have to be very well and successfully established in other fields the west is scientific barbarism not really civilization yet man has to be pretty civilized before he can be trusted with 563much power current society has power without gentler social graces to restrain it people in society are trying to control human behavior by brute force this is very crude technology it is very dicey to put technology out for those who are accustomed to abusing technology it would only be safe if the technology itself or learning the technology produced enough case gain to prevent their abusing it tech must be able to work rapidly enough to counteract the tendency to abuse tech something peculiar is going to happen you are taking off from the tremendous technical background of scientology and going back to its immediate entrance background of course this is very easy to clarify it is best not to use dianetics as an entrance point for dissemination purposes but to get the person into scientology and then teach him dianetics as training technique we are advancing the most powerful psychosomatic technology on the planet as training technique as it advances dont lose sight of scientology it is great to be able to salvage the body so that you can salvage the being there is use for dianetics but dont put fixing up body above helping being remember that you are salvaging being not his particular peculiarities you could change someones peculiarities by finding and running out engrams if you had an individual with certain aberration you could find chain of engrams to explain it that when run would change his behavior but there is some more basic reason for his being that way his more fundamental life has been dedicated to going wrong in that direction so of course he has accumulated great number of incidents that demonstrate going wrong in that direction scientology technique could release him from this tendency to collect engrams you had better be sure to go back far enough for this you need to have the concept of the spiritual nature of man if you dont accept the spiritual nature of man you cant make dianetics work because it goes back too far there is piece of scientology tech that gets him over his tendency to accumulate engrams on subject reach and withdraw with this technique you can bring the individual up to pt without bothering to inquire about which mass is causing him to crack up airplanes this could work for several lifetimes scientology is just that much stronger than dianetics it is true that in one lifetime several experiences can ruin someone it is true that as long as the traumatic shock is contained in broken leg healing can be normal or prolonged if you ran the incident even just this lifetime you would reduce the time of healing from six weeks to two weeks use dianetics when injury or illness prevents auditing patch the pc up so that you can audit him in other words if actual advance of the being is seriously hindered by physical distractions dianetics is useful as means of getting rid of them you might need to run out the pcs efforts to cure the illness in short space of time it blew anyway on the auditing that the pc had had but there was just moment when it seemed too overwhelming to permit of actual auditing so engram running was used to take the edge off engram running has some use and one ought to know how to do it spectacular things do happen with dianetic auditing for instance goiter the size of large baseball could shrink and disappear in half an hour the insane can sometimes run engrams and go sane they are just pts they keep wanting to run the incident that the psychiatrist said wasnt true lrh concluded that being sane or insane has nothing to do with someones state of case many people in institutions have been put there for other causes than insanity that is one of the things wrong with suspending civil rights because of insanity making the able more able may not be as profitable as it could be but it is much sounder as basis for organizational and personal repute and growth if you set up to cure lumbosis you are standing on slippery log across roaring stream picking up boulder you are in an enturbulated area and it is risky and prone to relapse it takes lot of effort and the auditor generally gets kicked in the teeth lrhs records tend to show that it doesnt pay to reward the down statistic it is getting so that government penalizes the up statistic and rewards the down statistic rioters welfare cases etc you could probably be very agreeable with society by rewarding the down statistic eg if you helped the retarded etc but when you are standing on slippery log over raging torrent you dont lean over to lift heavy rock out of the stream first build bridge and bolt derrick on it so we are swimming against the stream of society so we are holding constant purpose trying to help our fellow man just doing that would get us someplace the rest of society has been slipping if we just held constant we would win but we are doing more than that the size of our movement is growing everyone connected with it is getting more able as an individual the 22 clears are just now enrolling on part i of the ot course the first 30 clears are to get it free so as society sinks we are on rising platform lrh has received an unofficial statement that if he wanted permanent residence in rhodesia he could have it the fda thing has been dropped by the government the lawyers are conferring to see how they can give the seized materials back without getting sued lrh wasnt allowed to appear at the inquiry in australia because they knew that it would make them look silly we win these things but one ever announces the fact in the papers scientology looks bad legally because the newspapers 564and other media always report the suits attacks and entheta against scientology in banner headlines and the fact that we always win in court and elsewhere is never reported in general entheta can just be dropped and neglected this would always be safe for an ot further down the line you must take rapid action the problem of what you do with what you know is determined by the framework of the society in which you are working it is not always the same solution violinist who went to perform for some lumberjacks would do well to consider his audience in deciding what to play working within the human race you monitor your use of technology by the society dianetics could be good entrance point in some societies eg atheistic or materialistic ones it wouldnt be so acceptable in moslem or buddhistic scientology with its approach to man as spirit wouldnt reach them your problem in disseminating is just how to tailor your approach to the group that you are addressing in dissemination you must present to person only that part of gradient of what you know about existence that the fellow doesnt have to protest and argue with to preserve his own integrity you are trying to sell him what he already knows down deep but this is covered with lot of false information somewhere however there is an entrance point get the other guy to contribute somewhat to the conversation so you can have an agreement never give someone false data just to get agreement your force and impact consists of the fact that you speak the truth truth is such fast arrow that it goes through without the guy knowing what is happening he may feel that he is under attack give the person something he can use eg data or processing you can select the pieces of scientology that come nearest to his reality estimate the guys position on the tone scale his problems his use for scientology data etc when disseminating if you dont reach to the persons reality level you will make him feel as though you are attacking him give people data they can use or they wont have much use for it if you do it right the reaction you will get is gee where has this been all my life dianetics has an important role in dissemination it is the finest dissemination material use it people arent ready for example to hear about scientologys ow techniques but dont practice dianetics on people let them practice dianetics the greater truth lies in scientology but the experience lies in dianetics it teaches people something about the mind it gives new auditors practice in auditing lrh has used meter dating with newspaper reporter to disseminate he got the reporters last accident with the meter and managed to turn on somatics the statement in the introduction to book one that says that any two people can cure up to 70 of peoples ills was put there by joe winter not lrh you can direct someones attention to picture and key out the picture you could ask has anyone in your family ever had that problem and key out the picture just by getting him to look at it or you could ask are you worried did you ever know anyone who was worried can you see them worrying etc just seeing his first picture gives person case gain 6608c16 shspec75 releases and clears the problem that we have had with releases is the problem of overrun we have also had lots of unknown data on the extent of the bank buddha made the same mistake not being aware of the existence of the bank or the mind 2500 years ago 10000 years ago there was monk named dharma dharma made the mistake of believing that you didnt have to do anything but become wise from him comes the basic philosophical assumption that if you become wise you become free this is in the woof and warp of todays culture the idea that an individual can exteriorize and that by doing so he can become free was part of gautama siddhartha buddhas teaching that hasnt become part of the popular culture yet so we are slightly ahead of our time it seems to take 10000 years for such ideas eg dharmas idea given above to become central to culture so buddhas idea see above has 7500 years to go and scientology on the same time table has 10000 minus 16 years to go in other zones of the universe the existence of the mind is known in the galactic confederacy they have psychotherapy that consists of recognition of the fact that at moment of fatal accident to thetan picture is made however they think that it is location not picture they take picture of the location where the thetan was hurt and show it to him with movie clapsticklike thing slapped in front of it then the thetan is supposed to follow suit by doing the same thing to his picture and thus be free of its effects that is their way of making releases that therapy is administered to the releases 565in that society that pass for ots they are ot releases that is the closest other therapy to scientology todays concentration on education universities etc is result of dharmas ideas on wisdom the idea that education leads to freedom that you cant have freedom and ignorance he had tough time 10000 years ago man was more of an animal than he is today so it was more difficult for dharma to communicate with them it is interesting that education is an outgrowth of desire for wisdom hence scientology is in this mainline this would be an interesting topic for lecture or chapter of book the estrangement of wisdom from education it was terrific advance to get the idea of becoming free by becoming wise across to the savages of this planet 10000 years ago this idea is now so widely accepted that the secondlargest expenditure of taxes after the military is for education at dharmas time there was the knowledge that freedom was attainable but there was tech 7500 years later buddha discovered exteriorization gautama siddhartha buddha first exteriorized under bodhi tree he thought you did it by becoming wise one of gs buddhas other ideas was that you should be civilized and polite and buddhism civilized three quarters of asia but exteriorization was not generally doable to any great degree the tibetan lamas came along later and squirreled trying to develop an explanation of exteriorization or technology to accomplish exteriorization we are the gainers from this history to the extent that there is history and acceptance of the idea that the soul exists our gain is that the idea of the soul has been accepted by many for long time the idea that there is soul that goes somewhere after death has dominated graecoroman and mohammedan thought for 2000 years socrates originated this idea in the present philosophical tradition there is verbal tradition about socrates in greece that socrates held forth for the existence of personal being or thetan buddhism advanced into the west through the essenes and christianity later the nicene creed developed from the dead sea scrolls hundred years after its development it was advanced by jesus of nazareth powerhouse with an already existing philosophy the christian church today has to contend with the embarrassing fact that the dead sea scrolls predate christ and yet contain the new testament this is just the advance of buddhism in the western world christ studied in the east for thirty years by the time gautama siddhartha buddhas ideas had gone from india through greece spain ireland etc they were alterised to man has soul but it is over there and belongs to god etc buddha thought became unrecognizable there has never before been clear only releases the most that was achieved by any of these former philosophies was release 1 dharma release by wisdom 2 buddhism release by exteriorization 3 christianity release by repentance and being good in scientology we just let bodhi ie exteriorization happen it is not even that significant to us because we are going for permanent state however if in the course of auditing someone he goes exterior you stop right there if you go on you bang him back into his body and into his bank and he will be arc broken pc exterior is on harmonic of ot but cant have it he has had bunch of losses in the past bad experiences like deaths associated with exteriorization and he snaps back in very soon scared he is not competent to cope with it he isnt ready for it you can take someone who has been insane and have him go totally sane by exteriorizing him you can also have someone go out come back in and never know it the formula for popping someone out is try not to be three feet back of your head buddhism spread like wildfire because it was such clearcut truth in one fell swoop we have capitalized upon the idea that man who is improved becomes free we have brought buddhisms twenty year effort to exteriorize down to twenty seconds we have found what kept dharmas efforts from perfection and what barriered buddhism in culture that only accepts dharmas idea but not yet buddhas dont be discouraged by failures to get instant acceptance for scientology but notice also that earlier missionaries had bank and therefore havent had pure version of the truth that they were spreading the christians civilized things somewhat but there were too many vias to get very good results with christianity from buddha through socrates through the original form of christianity through organized christianity through various arguments of christianity buddhism spread faster 566than christianity because buddhas ideas were closer to those of dharma buddha was capitalizing on dharmas idea that wisdom would make you free which was acceptable to his society it carried the implication that it was possible to be free asia knew that there was possibility of man becoming free very hard message to get across matter how information is conveyed if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root so scientology wont really take 10000 years to get across it will be more like fifty years at the outside given how fast buddhism civilized asia and japan and given 1 the result that we can produce 2 modern communication 3 the slightly more barbaric conditions 2500 years ago if you take half century to get scientology around you are really slow man you notice i said you when you first address being then you are capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being you must take this into account the magna carta is direct result on education in dharma through the church the spanish civil war of 1936 was also the result of the philosophy of dharma because in the decade just before the war paperback books were introduced people read french and english philosophers and got the idea that now that they knew something they should be free they actually resisted freedom though so it backfired where you fail in disseminating is where you run into someone who doesnt have this assumption people have to learn that individuals should be free or educated government that skimps on education is either one that hasnt heard of the philosophy of dharma or one that suppresses this philosophy out of fear in the west you are talking to christian people who unfortunately think of the soul as an owned commodity that they should not play with they are stunned to think of someone exteriorizing they are really not up to the idea of buddha though they have gotten the idea of dharma such people have gone past dharma but havent reached buddha it is to such people that you are trying to teach scientology so dont go in over their heads fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of release they understand the idea of clear as someone who doesnt have barriers to his thinking or to freedom of his mind but they will not understand exteriorization which is in the realm of ot so talk about clear but dont talk about ot there are many undercuts that you could teach him dianetics is not the lowest undercut only relatively enlightened public will accept dianetics the public will understand the idea of communication release as person who gets rid of his barriers to communication they can get the idea that person can communicate better that person can be released from an inability to communicate wog who cant communicate will think that communications release is great for stammerers and backwards children etc he thinks its great for others in short but he will buy the idea likewise with problems wog will buy the idea that man would be better off if he could handle problems and so on up the line there is high probability that you will make connection somewhere the idea that wisdom leads to freedom is basic on this chain it releases man from imprisonment by ignorance and that is your first form of release teach person that if he learned something he would be freeer and he will be released from the idea that he cant know this is the earliest stage of release you would do well to argue with people on the basis of this first premise the dharmic fundamental because dharmas idea is the direct ancestor of scientology there is lower level of release one you would use in processing animals it is the idea that an animal could get an idea across to another animal this is not communication you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it that is the main difficulty with communicating levels of release and people psychologists etc are not aware of the mind they see another bloke they dont see any mind so he says there is such thing as mind only brain which can be seen but in fact the brain is just sort of neural shock absorber looking at scientology as philosophy is agreeable to people when you put it this way you are in agreement with the idea that person can become freer released from some of his travail by becoming wiser so use dharma in dissemination your next level of release that is acceptable to the world at large is that man is spiritual being buddhas idea however dont use this wundt of leipzig wiped out buddha in the west in 1879 when he introduced the idea that man was an animal so it was ok to kill him this is like the christian philosophy advanced in the second or third century ad 567that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly ok to kill maim etc it was and is justification for overts the christian has not found out that the psychologist is an atheist this is partially due to the inarticulateness of the psychologist the populace thinks that psychology is silly but suppressives and governments support it because it prevents releasing sps support sp subjects and technologies that is why the government supports psychology and psychiatry in disseminating you could say you are christian arent you then he has admitted that he is spiritual being reincarnation was only barred in christianity in the last few hundred years the former idea was that guys who hadnt been good enough had to come back and live it all over again if you can get someone to buy the idea that he is spiritual being he is released from truth that could trap him possibly this is where you could introduce the idea of exteriorization but i dont advise it dianetics can give one release from this one lifetime that is terrific release you have made an immortal the terrible consequences of death go away you can start with the idea that there is mind looking at b doesnt see bs mind so he doesnt know that b has mind he may think that b only has brain you have to put across the idea that because this fellow the fellow that you are talking to has mind that that person has mind with dianetics it would follow that he is immortal then he is released from the idea that man is matter and that he only has one life fortunately people do know that there is such thing as mind and mental things they havent gotten totally sold on the psychologists theory that mind brain so you can move in and introduce the idea of the mind being composed of pictures with little dianetic auditing the person will realize that he is immortal and you will have released him from the idea that he is matter so you should be aware that you can release people just by talking to them up to point but remember always stop at the fn vgis dont try to just communicate the data up the chart to do so overwhelms people they have to come to realize it as you progress up the grade chart it becomes progressively more impossible to talk them out of what they are sitting in at levels vi and vii it would be fatal an ultimate release would be release from the universe when we say release we mean freeing we can free someone from an idea that entraps him ideas are the only real traps and one can get released from them there are many grades of release below zero at zero and up we are starting to free someone directly from his reactive mind treating him as spiritual being at level 0 we are pulling him out of mass that tells him that he cant communicate so we have to pull him out of mental masses as well as out of ideas at level vii and up we dont pull him out of mental mass we erase it we turn around and eat the tiger that is form of release that we call clear but this being at this level is still in the universe and associated with the body there are therefore grades of release above clear not many people below the level of clear look any higher though because clear is pretty triumphant level when you get an fn shut up because you have just released the pc from something you have to know why he got the fn to get him through qual ie you have to know what he is released on get this data from the auditing notes not from the pc most stages of release have only relative degrees of stability but release never unreleases to the same degree of stygian darkness that he was in before the release clear is someone who has erased the barriers to his postulating freely he can at this point easily postulate bank and some have done so not realizing that that was what they were doing clear can postulate bank and then not realize that he has done so or that he can simply blow it we are making dianetic clears the trouble we had doing it earlier came only from overauditing people also dont ever try to teach guy something that he already knows it is an overrun released person doesnt tend to relapse but he may run into the next higher levels sticky plaster they havent unreleased they are just enterprising and speculative and this drives them into the next level someone who has been released and comes in the next day with fn has just gotten into the next mass that he is going to confront releases want others to be released and cleared but dont release people to make them better for others sakes being released is something that is reward not right 6608c18 shspec76 study and intention 568the name of the source becomes identified with the product like kleenex the name dharma became identified with the product rather than with the source of the product so that today you cant find correct definition of dharma anywhere the word dharma does not have its original meaning preserved according to dictionaries it means 1 supreme law 2 the caste system of india 3 fate 4 love 5 the way in buddhism 2500 years ago gautama siddhartha said that the age of love was to begin in the west in 2500 years we started the age of love by making clears they talk about love lot we are longer in the age of reason thank god student should be aware of his intention in studying faulty source may be important in study student tends to assume that the source that he is studying from has some validity but this isnt necessarily the case in fact it frequently isnt the case difficult exams in universities dont correlate with excellence of graduates because for one thing study is an area that attracts suppressives like the areas of government or healing for instance in navigation the method used is what is tested in exams but the fact that you can navigate is all the sea cares about textbooks on navigation are often so complex that you have to know all about the subject before you can understand the bock many textbooks on the sea are full of nothing but disaster in great detail coast pilots are particularly full of warnings and disasters you could write any subject up to make it suppressive subject by making it seem too dangerous to practice on the other hand you can not give any cautions about the subject like leaving out the fact that wronglydone s and d that gets the wrong suppressive will make the pc sick because it restimulates and bypasses the right one the mind has been made too dangerous to study the writers of textbooks need knowledge of study materials as you study what do you intend to do with what you are studying for what purpose are you studying until you clarify that point you cant study intelligently the trouble with university education is that students study to pass exams not to use the materials in practice that is scholastic or academic study which isnt worth much this is why you get failures in practice after certification if someone studies just for examinations he doesnt have to know the exact meanings of the words thus we get very educated dumbbells some subjects are taught suppressively and are therefore ethics subjects where subject is very suppressive it can be studied for examination needing only to be memorized and spat back but it cant be applied because there was nothing there to be understood study gone wild leads to suicides cf french universities at exam time people who are very successful in life are frequently the drop outs who realize that university texts are not arranged to let you apply anything not single philosopher except mills stayed in school subject that is written up with slant or curve is relatively inapplicable too economics is good example economics hardly exists in its simple purity anymore similarly psychoanalysis has relation to freud anymore scientology is studied along the same lines that it was researched on it has curve to it if anything is inapplicable you will soon run into it 6608c23 shspec77 organization business org pattern wouldnt fit scientology org because business orgs have never isolated the principles of organization in scientology org you are handling life as commodity and you are handling life with vessel made out of life this is like trying to pour water into pitcher made of water in this situation you will find out every frailty in an organization but one law businesses have not violated any organization is better than organization 569individuals as such operating together will fall apart when they collide with an organized group brilliant leadership can only go so far it needs execution otherwise it fails an organization will normally win unless it is confronted with superior organization an organization consists of group of individuals with common goal or purpose there will never be an org that is perfect because it is composed of individuals who are to greater or lesser degree informed of the rules and in agreement with the purpose an organization must to some degree consist of sentient irreducible individuals it must depend on the individuals for instance literacy is prerequisite for democracy england does better than some other democracies because it has high level of education individuals in the us have so many and varying prejudices that none can really take hold it also has high level of education therefore it is the richest country in the world business management in the us is very tight in spite of bad leadership that will eventually cause trouble the us is doing well organization also has drawbacks 1 limited power of choice of the individual 2 an organization often swallows up the talents and potential contributions of the individual 3 it often plays hobb with the very principles that it is trying to forward 4 wrongly led an organization becomes machine that goes straight over the cliff to destruction but the plus points prevail over the outpoints organizations endure better than individuals on the whole track orgs best survived when led by keyedout ot you would think that these individuals would be unorganizable because of their differences of opinion yes they do have differences of opinions but they still realize that it is better to be organized than not they also recognize the liabilities of orgs higher posts shift lot in ot organizations the ots are minority group in charge of fantastic majorities an individual who puts together an organization without knowing how to do it makes mess law of organization large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals when large org is composed of individuals the individual gets devalued you get lack of comparability between the individual and the group of which he is member therefore the individual feels oppressed the people vs john jones makes paranoid therefore the ideal form of organization is individuals composed into subgroups if you try to produce group that is all composed of individuals and expand it it goes all to pieces an org will remain small group as long as it is composed of individuals income tax is violation of this principle because the individual must report to the government once year thus quite apart from the economics of income tax eg penalizing up stats this will make the country grow smaller each person can be jumped on by the government without buffer you must cut out the situation of having an organization vs an individual and stick to the situation of the organization vs group group does have an optimum size seven or eight subordinates is lot if person had only two subordinates he would loaf so the optimum is somewhere between two and eight so we can say that five is optimal big group then would be ten and small group would be two or three by the time you are getting up into group of seven or eight it is best to split things up into two groups the members of each section look to their section leader this also means that an executive spends one sixth of his time consulting with higher management and five sixths of his time dealing with his five subordinates director only looks to his section leaders and an executive secretary only looks to directors danger condition would consist of an exec sec giving orders to section leaders bypassing the director when this happens the org will get smaller you could move this organizational scheme out to where the org could contain the population of the planet size means nothing if you know this law of organization therefore you need an expandable and contractable system the lowest number in group should be five to six people two people isnt really group it is pair when the state breaks down the family as group the church etc the state shrinks 570when manager becomes overworked his area wont expand therefore if you want to expand make sure your manager isnt overworked you cant have section that is independent of other sections if you try to have such section it will float free and collapse it must have service and communication connections with the rest of the group there are seven divisions on the org board the org board is cylinder circle to show this fact we put the seventh division in front of div 1 you enter the org board at the first department of the first division the org board is organized to impel particle from the first division on out through the back door any particle entered early will shunt late div 7 doesnt necessarily catch what is ejected at div 6 so there is way out of the org board if you violate the position of anything on this chart you cut your throat the order of departments was found by trial and error earlier on we got into trouble because we tried to put origin or construction in dept 9 now 1976 the department of records assets and materials in div 3 it belonged at origin so construction had to be back towards source if something is mispositioned on the board it will be nonfunctional and will cease to work the order of the divisions is 1 hco you have to start with communications 2 dissem dissemination is necessary with the communication you must tell people what you are going to make 3 organization division treasury this is the division that organizes the mest for the assembly of products 4 tech this division has to do with production 5 qual this division deals with correction or adjustment 6 distribution this division is to get rid of the product this is also sales division when they are busy getting rid of the product they are also making new customers that enter at div 1 7 executive the first department would be the office of the ed or general manager the problem in an organization is one of succession but if you get management you dont need succession the lrh comm approves anything that is not against policy that the ed wants to do the us should have the office of george washington each department should have less than or equal to five sections or it should be written up again then you get subsections units subunits etc the org board is flow chart an other primary law of management the fastflow system of management dont inspect before it goes wrong this just holds up the activities of the organization and puts in arbitraries you dont run an organization by being supernervous you let something happen then you act dont put in permanent preventers let the flow go an organization must produce something everyone must have stat the org pattern would do for government it is far more socialistic than socialism and far more communistic than communism socialism and communism are relatively conservative in comparison you would introduce individual companies into your organization as service or production units the reason why divisions are in units of three departments is that you have the head of the division representing the thetan and the three departments representing the mind body and product respectively 6608c25 shspec78 the antisocial personality 571reference hcob 27sep66 or introduction to scientology ethics pp 914 the antisocial personality lrh has made complete list of the characteristics of suppressive person the purpose of ethics is to get technology in ethics doesnt intend social betterment it only intends to ensure case advance by getting suppressives out of the environment an auditor must know about this so that he can recognize and handle pts and suppressive pcs this ability to recognize and handle can prevent an auditor from having loses and invalidating himself when an sp doesnt make case gain when pcs rollercoaster dont blame the past auditor or the hgc blame the sp pc who is critical of an auditor has missed withhold from that auditor the pc who goes on nattering about the thousands of hours of auditing that he has received with gain is another matter you can be too propitiative towards people whereupon you cant help them anymore you exert control and dont give effective help lrh never owed scientology to anyone one of the earliest techniques for controlling pcs taken from early dianetics was to walk out on pc who refused to be controlled with the r factor that the session would resume when the pc decided to follow the auditors directions at that point lrh hadnt run into failed psychoanalytic cases and people who had been roughed up by psychotherapy there were lot of these people in the first foundation they were generally pts or sps these cases are much harder to handle with auditing than criminals the sp on the case may be nowhere near the pts individual or the trouble that the pts causes in early dianetics pc who got better and then crashed was said to have been on manic person who is manic and then gets depressed however has just run into an sp and has gone pts there is such thing as manic its just that psychiatrists hate people in that condition and so they promptly cave them in the guy says wow at last i realize that i can be sane and isnt the world wonderful the psychiatrist says ohmigawd youre in manic weve got to give you eighteen extra shocks or pills etc the psychiatrist says that euphoria is very bad this explains away persons getting better and this will be used by sps against you as an argument against scientology the only reason for cavein or rollercoaster is an sp joe winters overt was making deal with the publisher of book one to write book to get the mds into dianetics doctor looks at dianetics he claimed that dianetics was an art knack that couldnt be taught this led to complete squirrel nonstandard tech being spread all over the place with results i couldnt hold in tech because i 1 didnt have control of it and 2 didnt have ethics until ethics was gotten in in organizations it was impossible to keep tech in and working fully because there was way to hold the line and way to get the suppressives off tech lines an auditor who doesnt recognize ethicstype cases ie sps and ptss is setting himself up for loses and for eventually quitting auditing there is such thing as case who doesnt have wall there only picture of wall the universe for such person is very flimsy mockup consisting of dubin you can run contact processes on such person cchs and he will come back into contact with the wall that you and i see occasionally he will be startled while doing objective processes to see the wall getting shaky and disappearing you may think that you are making him ot but you arent because the wall is still there for you if he were ot it wouldnt be he will realize that his mockedup wall is not the wall that is there this individual doesnt have to be an sp to have mockups in place of walls for the sp people every one of us are mockups too we arent there god knows what is there in the place where we are standing paranoid is mild version of this an sp is not paranoid paranoid just thinks people are against him an sp is person who is surrounded by identities which others dont see the paranoid may see purely imaginary people who arent there at all the sp creates his enemies out of the real whole cloth of you and he doesnt see his enemies unless another real person is there to be turned into pink alligator crazed indian or the priests of the spanish inquisition what is really there in the sps universe is something else other than people something very threatening and dangerous yet mostly this person looks totally sane he doesnt hallucinate he is just delusional he is stuck on the track really stuck he has never moved beyond the stuck point on the track an sp doesnt make case gain because person needs to have at least concept of motion on the time track to get from one end of an engram to the other the sp cant run an engram because he is stuck in past moment in time and cant move through through the successive moments of the engram you or i might have had an incident there for long time without noticing it but the sp has had the world there for long time and hasnt noticed it 572the antisocial personality has been looked at before but it has never been fully described in earlier therapies we call such person suppressive because that is more explicit and accurate term these are the qualities of the suppressive 1 we speaks only in generalities he is always talking about they and everybody this effects ptss so they echo it but somebody told the pts newspapers speak of 850 dead on holiday but they neglect to state that 85 million people were on holiday that makes it all look sort of dangerous governments likewise govern the people or the masses not the individuals who are actually there this is where the sweeping generality comes in 2 he deals in bad news continually and exclusively he is critically hostile he never relays good news but may twist good news to bad bad news will be relayed and worsened very sp person is so batty that when he moves up in the world he makes this the norm 3 he alters any communication he never duplicates cf the game of telephone 4 he doesnt respond to treatment reform or psychotherapy the really bad sp wont come anywhere near an auditing chair the one thing this fellow can not do is confront his own mind the sp feels that he would go totally insane if he had to take one tiny little look at his mind that is why the sp goes mad at the idea of getting people to look at their own minds an sp is afraid that if he deals with the mind even slightly those spooks will move slightly sps cannot be reasoned with on the subject of the mind your crime is that you have almost made them confront something that they dont dare confront and you have almost exposed them because they are not under good control and if they love control they will be put away 5 he is surrounded by others in one or another state of ruin and cavein ptss around such person we find associates who are cowed ill failing or not succeeding if not actually driven insane when you try to treat these associates they dont keep their gains 6 he habitually selects the wrong target this is not conscious it is not just getting mad at the boss because somebody is mad at you it is very reactive in the sp for instance psychiatrists wreck people and sps in governments attack us there is complete dissociation it is bill failed at college so therefore we should go on diet not bill failed at college therefore we shouldnt send his brother pete because the sp attacks the wrong target he doesnt succeed very will on job this is saving grace 7 he doesnt complete cycles of action if he finds out that he has completed one he has to redo it he mustnt arrive and he doesnt arrive because his time sense is loused up he doesnt have the idea of consecutive events 8 he will often confess to alarming crimes with sense of guilt or personal responsibility whatsoever he doesnt know that there is difference between good and bad behavior 9 he supports and approves of only destructive downstat and criminal groups and attacks constructive ones 10 he approves of destructive actions and disapproves of good actions he says it is probably good thing that we had the war because 11 helping others is an activity that drives him nearly berserk however activities that destroy in the name of help are closely supported the idea is to get rid everybody or to make them all miserable 12 he has bad sense of property he thinks that the idea that people own things is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned to the sp delusions of grandeur and desires to dominate have nothing to do with suppressiveness the concept of ones own importance does not have any bearing here an sp may or may not have the feeling of being very important as may nonsp there is nothing wrong with dominance this is not the same as suppression it is what person does with dominance that counts an auditors skill depends on his recognition of the situation in which he finds himself auditing when you manage to isolate series of characteristics that give you certain expectancy knowledge of 573this data becomes valuable if you can see several characteristics on an sp in person you can predict the rest and unload this is an ethics case an auditor should know that there could be more than one sp on the case he should locate the other sps if the first s and d doesnt get permanent results even though it was well done you could do successful s and d and at much later date the pc could find another sp and rollercoaster from that 6609c01 shspec79 gradients and arc lrh coaches with the intention of making his student sound and look like an auditor coaching is happy medium between so many flunks that the student quite and so few that he turns into lousy auditor any coaching can be improved it is easy to coach if you know what the tr you are working on is supposed to do the reason for security measures with upperlevel materials is because you have to judge the ferocity of the material against the power of the individual that you are giving it to the only thing wrong with 1950 dianetics was that people were thrown in over their heads the clearing and ot materials look so what when one has finished them but not before if you skip half page or glance ahead accidentally while running them you will get sick the gradient approach has been primary and regulating factor in all of scientology it is new idea as an overall idea thetan in particular responds very well to this approach he responds better than body does you can do gradient that is too shallow or too steep for your pc if you dont correctly judge his reality level confront etc just little bit tough all the way is best but not so tough that you get failures it should just be hard work there are pcs to whom everything is automatic they have trouble on some process because they dont perceive the things in the process they have reality in cchs there are people who will go through it with change at all they are aberrated as coots there is reality to it they dont have to confront doing the process because they arent doing it at person with reality on lions or tigers can walk though cage with lions and tigers in it you must estimate the degree of persons aberration to draw up an estimate of what gradient to apply to it if you cant make eg grade 0 release either 1 the pc is already grade 0 release or 2 grade 0 is completely over his head it is obvious which of these two things is the case if you know what you are looking for you can undercut it if you need to by raising other corners of the arc triangle for instance if the pc doesnt go release on grade 0 you could audit the pc on various processes to raise and r for instance dianetic auditing eg lock scanning words as an undercut this works even on the insane there doesnt have to be anybody else there but the auditor ie the auditor runs the bank usually it is r that you raise affinity occurs in the process of doing this you still have to estimate correctly what the pc can run if the pc is in desperate condition dont do something desperate an early entrance point is mimicry doing mimicry on someone makes you real to them it is low level of communication but it works very well especially as point to at ack with someone who doesnt attain grade 0 release if you imitate little kid or if you communicate with him he will like you he will pick you out in roomful of people not because he knows you but because you are real to him below grade 0 ie if comm is really out or is very difficult you approach with reality as the entry point on the arc triangle so you could use mimicry however if you validate insanity too long you will stick the pc in win for his insane behavior but you cant invalidate him either say the guy complains of spiders all over the wall and himself dont invalidate him pick out the real reality in what he said wall or to hell with the spiders and focus on that and dont agree about the spiders that is lie and basically he knows it so he will know that you are crazy if you agree about the spiders ask what kind of wall wouldnt spiders be on or what kind of wall do spiders like best or who would you have to be not to have spiders on you and you will shift his reality you could get clever with raising reality lrh did in the late forties unfortunately lots of therapies sprang from his ran various things in 1949 every time i audited anybody while others were watching it became school of psychotherapy because they couldnt integrate it so it ill by itself became an approach like gestalt therapy they didnt have the basic data gradient scales arc triangle etc they just copied one thing used in one case the error was made that because this was successful as an entrance point with one individual the same gradient had to be used on all 574individuals for instance if the pc has policemen on his front porch he at least has porch now the chances are that he has all porches identified aaa if you can introduce differentiation amongst porches you get an increase in reality and an improved state of case but the squirrels would be stuck in asking the pc about walls or worse spiders not realizing that in this case the proper entrance point would be porch point of mutual reality you would get the pc to differentiate between porches and drop the aaa the squirrel never cognited on what lrh was doing he thought that lrh had knack mathematics is in kindergarten on this planet people on this planet dont understand symbolic mathematics symbolic math is not doing algebra with symbols it is solving vast number of non numerical variables by the use of comparisons similarities identities and differences and you cant write it down you mustnt follow the lead of math in applying the suppressive generality of number to the specific entity eg an apple person etc which is being calculated two plus two does not equal and never will equal four you have to specify two what when you answerwhat nonspecifically you have an insanity mans math is insane zero is wild variable you must specify zero of what in what interesting universe is this zero of nothing so every time formula involves zero as in nuclear physics it is guess which in fact is based on experiment and not on mathematical prediction these guys really dont know what they are doing in higher math logic ultimately depends on you and your concept of reality math is actually lowgrade expression of r and c r and c add up to understanding mathematicians along with others in denying that you being exist has dropped out that which uses the math and understands it mathematics cannot exist without live interpretation it is always you who asks the question and you who receives the answer if there are live beings to understand there is mathematics math could be defined as method of memory devised by living being to make inanimate objects or other things appear to think or act you will be able to be as much at cause over the whole thing as you are ot because the more livingness you exert the more logical you can be about it you will be as good logically as you are clear eventually you can run up to point where you dont need mathematics one of the baffling things about dianetics and scientology is the question how did he figure it all out there are lots of formulas but it is an old line one lrh is very familiar with its simple matter of arc of potential understanding you cant stand back and hate men and find out any r about them you cant have total unreality about men sitting in some ivory tower someplace and hope to get understanding of or reality on man and communication you cant go about it being careful of what you say and by being afraid to hear anybody who is easily offended had better never go into the business of understanding because it winds up only with prejudice this of course explains somebody whos terribly offended by scientology hes so offended by what he hears shut down communication he cant understand anything in the first place the first requisite on studying life is to be alive not dead or disciplined or approved of in wogs death really gets people together to approve something as in dont speak ill of the dead therefore the basis of all scientologic and dianetic research has been understanding there was mystery involved just arc plus fear of saying things or looking at things awareness depends on how alive you are im not trying to say im more alive than others i just am reality goes lower further south than communication and affinity goes lower in reach than reality this sounds odd but it is observationally true insane people with very low reality can yet feel enough affection to go sane because i asked them to education doesnt work in the absence of r and c r and c are the three pins on which you adjust any auditing session and how you select what you do all auditing sessions go by gradients there is need to depart from what is laid out in the grade chart in auditing but what about the zone between the org and the world around you it is problem in 1 gradients 2 r and c for instance there are two ways to handle intrafamilial relations 1 individual processing on gradient this is the best way it is very senior to education when ethics is used to get tech in it is used to force the family members to act in such way that tech can go in it is not to give advice 5752 r and c this is limited if one is present to understand if they dont understand they wont even start the process of getting into better arc this is the problem here we keep looking for some marvellous solution to any individual or organizational problem just realize that theres solution at any time superior to the ability of the person asking for it to understand there is math that would help figure it out mathematics is as good as it can be employed with understanding and as good as the understanding of who asks and who receives the answer the answer to becoming better at mathematics is to became clearer the answer to any problem is to become more alive and more capable of understanding that is the answer which pays off how do you do this you get processed and you process people you are not in position in society to reform society educationally you cant educationally inform the public all you can say is that there is way the worlds reality on communication is extremely faint what they are using the communication media for is total malicious waste the newspaper is the modern gossip r and c in the world today is not good higherlevel data from scientology is totally outr so what can clear 0t or release do he can remember r and c in disseminating and he can just be dont let affinity overwhelm the reality get the affinity and the reality in dont kid yourself you can feel on affinity and get reality never allow others to cut you back from communication then you will understand understanding washes away everything understanding is universal solvent communication is always within the reality of the person who can hear it so your communication must be within the reality of the individual you err when you tell people any more than they need to know namely that there is way out if you tell them more you bedazzle their understanding an 0t could overwhelm guy he could put him in awe or in religious frenzy but the ot is actually putting the other person in complete unreality is he does this the more vulnerable person is the less capable of understanding he is and vice versa at this particular time our power exceeds our understanding though not by much and this wont continue to be true so we get into crisis situation do we get so tired of them we just overwhump them or do we stay true to our own beliefs and continuing to suffer the slings and arrows that are thrown at us still go along in high state of arc there is real argument the answer is the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics so the question is beginning to come up what are we going to do with this planet the only mathematics that will solve this question and the question of how to protect people at lower levels of awareness is the mathematics of arc and the axioms we have to be gingerly because those on the way up the bridge need protection the power of scientology will inevitably be used for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics the question is how to minimize the casualties along the way but lrh doesnt have any canned answers about what we will do with the planet he has plan for keeping scientologists from being wiped out in cataclysm we are at crossroads as our power increases we have been very forbearing we have to rely on good sense and on keeping our reality from degenerating to where it longer matters what happens to the little guys every religious organization of the past has flunked this test i hope we dont luckily arc increases as one goes up the levels towards ot 6609c08 shspec80 states of identity apparently there is boundary beyond which you dont have thetans you have endowment of form with life the little things that wiggle for instance the amoeba or the cell is endowed an ot comes along and says let there be chicken he leaves puddle of theta to animate it this is the concept of how bodies are built there is some truth in the idea that talking to flowers makes them grow better way back someplace the thetan probably did something like this the green thumb phenomenon is perhaps lowerscale harmonic of this there do seem to be people with green thetan other natural abilities of thetans sometimes get preserved in or by individuals in an outof control state so you get telekinesis telepathy child geniuses etc jung had trouble with poltergeists actually he was subject to form of belowawareness telekinesis some skills that are on automatic will temporarily vanish in the course of clearing suddenly you find that you cant do it anymore but when it comes back it is you doing it instead of machine or something jung went into only one past life that of the english druids 576anything wrong with thetan is lower harmonic of that he can do higher up on the scale when that goes wrong his ability on it goes into an inversion or goes out of his control and still happens in his vicinity as with jung and puzzles him it is just little facet of his ability that has been brought down with him and not yet eaten up boy wonders tend to fold up because they dont know that they are doing it it is not under their control the musical child prodigy has probably been good musician in the near past as you go upscale you tend to lose circuits if we exempt endowed states of wiggle we can find out how far down in the fifth dynamic thetan can go the answer is someplace in the insect or animal kingdom above that you get thetans below that wiggle sometimes you run into horse who is thetan and sometimes you run into one that isnt or bee who was and bee who wasnt when nothing much is required of an animal or insect you can get survival as just piece of automatic machinery unchanging in habit pattern etc it is shadow of thetan because thetan made it you occasionally find vegetables in the human race bodies without thetans maybe sometimes some thetan picks up the body and it changes spectacularly body can survive although not well without thetan when it has been totally guided by thetan and the thetan leaves the body isnt on any automatic functioning and it wont do well also if thetan caves body in the body wont do well body will only get as good as you take away what is caving the body in most mammalian bodies live six times as long as it takes them to grow up thus mans lifespan should go to 110120 years the reason why it doesnt is that the human body is driven by thetan an aberrated thetan causes sick body thetan with service fac is quite capable of keeping body from getting well as society becomes more aberrated it becomes more sick one form of endowed life may destroy another form so it shouldnt upset you that you can cure up the thetan and the body doesnt get well there are variety of illnesses that body suffers from because it is being messed up by thetan who with his intention and aberration is influencing his physical body that body will get as well as you relieve the aberration of the thetan in those sectors where the thetan is causing the body to get sick therefore dont assume that all that is wrong with the body is the mind but in addition to the effects of the thetan on the body there is also different seement of illness caused by endowed life units that are designedly contrary to the bodys life units eg disease germs parasites worms etc then there is physical injury if you hit body with battering ram it doesnt matter what state the thetan is in the body is going to go splash if body is badly guided it is smashed often so you can reduce this category of bodily ills by fixing up the thetan so that he has fewer accidents however some accident is pretty inevitable in an uncleared environment another factor is the repairing ability of the being if one were really upscale as thetan he could patch up or repair the body directly or he could mock up new one lower scale manifestation the thetan stops knocking the body about upper scale manifestation the thetan can put the body back together again so there are three sectors of attack on body 1 endowed life attacking the endowed life of the body 2 aberration of the thetan influencing the body 3 mechanical damage to the body this would include chemical damage poisons lack of air etc and there are three basic means of cure 1 the thetan can repair the body directly 2 you can use beneficial endowed life units as in antibiotics to help the body 3 you can repair the body mechanically as with surgery here you can repair damage or misplaced parts eg from faulty construction of the body or cut out endowed life forms infected tissue or 577cancerous tissue that attack the endowed life of the body chemical repair could be in this category also eg antidotes oxygen water etc therefore to assume that you can cure everything with auditing is as silly as to assume that you can cure fear of spiders by means of neurosurgery beings do tend to an allness cureall propensity as long as you are not able to endow matter with life you have to settle for what youve got you have to live with the body youve got or do without one so you have to decade whether you are looking at 1 endowed life forms countering each other 2 pure mechanical injury 3 something the thetan is doing to the body you are better off in the last sphere the first two need to be handled in an emergency but the thetan is quite capable of preventing body from recovering eg with service fac so auditing can act as before or after adjunct to the handling of 1 or 2 above you could make thetan less susceptible to 1 or 2 and you could come along after the fact and speed up healing to the degree that the thetan was preventing it from happening your only mistake is to run the incident while it is still going on treat it first and dont get into an allness about auditing and its healing effects the mechanism of miracles using religious relics or tokens eg saints knuckle bone is restimulation of the curative abilities of thetan if they existed that is the thetans idea of his own power is restimulated by demonstrating that there is power somewhere nut this is mental intervention faith healing restores momentarily thetans ot ability to do something with the body it has drawbacks since every now and then when body was endowed by thetan when thetan b comes along and puts some life into it it will get sicker some faith healers have not lost the ability to endow life or change the life endowment of body you can look around the eyes and get the stars that you can see surrounding them these are little gold balls throw them away and put in your own and you can get sicker bodies dont like having their anchor points messed around with or exchanged to complete the experiment throw your gold balls away and get the other ones back there are many things that man didnt know about beingness or life therefore he made fantastic mistakes dont make these mistakes recognize mans limitations relative to this recognize also that they are not your limitations but that they are mans therefore you need an understanding of states of beingness cavedin thetan is on reverse he is totally the unknowing effect of his own cause anything he can do is being done but he is not doing it he has lost some of his ability to have even that happen he is totally gone so estimate how far down he can go he can go down to being the effect of the effect of the effect etc of himself but this is way beyond his reality so dont expect him to got any reality on how he is doing it when you get body animated by thetan as opposed to having body that is merely endowed you go into fringe that is well below being oneself or being conscious one is sort of automatically awake automatically existing with responsibility for being alive awake or existing just below that you get unconsciousness below where he has clue that he is conscious you are getting down to the lower dregs of thetanhood and the upper strata of the human race the thetan conceives that he is body endowed life and more he is removed something he is an identity body he can be picked up rapidly from there to the state of grade 0 release quite distance grade 0 release is less the effect of causes but he is not up to causative alertness he is awake or groggy on an effect basis as he improves he gets to be less the effect both of his own cause and of others cause guy who is really low down on cause is the effect of anything that occurs anywhere he worries about train wrecks 8000 miles away he could go downscale from that point so that he doesnt worry anymore because he doesnt exist and isnt worth anything so it doesnt matter what he is the effect of he can go down below that into faith i have an automatic regulator of my destiny so i dont have to be alert or be concerned about anything because something somewhere is taking care of this isnt necessarily connected with religion people will mock this state up for themselves without even knowing that they are doing it at this point the thetan is totally irresponsible going downscale from there he goes into sort of numbness further release from responsibility below 578this he is subject to any number of automaticities which if triggered would produce total certifiable insanity the majority of the human face is about quarter of an inch above that that is why many people dont listen to you their state of beingness isnt up to it you must keep the above in mind when asking wog to look at responsibility an individual asked to look at his mind as cause or an effect can get into such anxiety instead of looking into himself that he goes frenziedly mad say that we were in an arena someone let in tiger and you said to joe jump over the railing and deal with the tiger he would think that you were joking at first but if you tried to force him over the railing you would have fighting screaming person on your hands who would be liable to say most anything so it is with the sp when you get him to look at his mind eg to look at breakfast sps arent trying to disprove scientology there is doubt in their minds that you could make them do things and the thought terrifies them the sp thinks that you are likely to drive him mad sps think that they are public benefactors who are discrediting scientology so that people wont have to look at their minds an sp is below being able to be the effect of anything even an automaticity so when you bring him upscale the first thing he has to confront that he might possibly be the effect of is the mind and he goes sting he goes bit insane sps are below the level of insanity so they have to come up through band of insanity cf rd laings idea that the path to sanity is through insanity they are below the level of being the effect of anything good or bad any effect is bad so they have to be an automatic thing cause that has an automatic effect actually they are and aing with an endowed self your presence however can bring them upscale you can be up to the point where your ability to endow is on automatic and you get guys twitching around you when you get to ot that comes under control there has always been way up and road out but it hasnt been pursued because philosophers are thoughtful types they are noted for being reasonable and getting themselves martyred but few stand up strongly when the firing squad marches down the street voltaire got reasonable breakthrough like this isnt scholarly affair it has to be done with here goes nothing attitude to follow up on scientology person would either have to be very reassured in very quiet environment for considerable period of time if the person was pretty bad off ie normal he would have to be calmed down before he could confront something the percent of people who can confront is the upper one percent of the planet when you have the ability to confront it is possible that you could exert enough influence on the environment possible is horrible understatement to calm it down to point where he could confront and disenturbulate it enough to make gains to handle the insane you go down to what he can confront being still in still environment with one worrying him with one solid stable object you could let him disenturbulate in this environment the psychotic doesnt have engrams that make him insane he is insane because his ability to confront the environment in his immediate vicinity is so low that he could never possibly take his mind off his environment long enough to look at his mind it is too dangerous just as your super sp screams when you tell him to confront his mind the psychotic screams when you tell him to confront the environment hence quiet environment is the only cure for insanity insanity is study of environments its not study of the mind there is reason to audit the insane at all when the environment is very safe and the individual is longer actively insane then on very light gradient you could get him to confront the mind scientologys problem is not the problem of making one ot if clears have trouble communicating with wogs ots have even more trouble you could endow crippled boys leg with life and heal it this would be ok unless you tried to explain what happened possibly he would come upscale to faith but he would be more likely to go into terror than into faith your main line is the improvement of the being who is willing to be improved doing this you will get enough improved beings to handle the problems in society that must be handled to snap the society out of being insane you dont want to lift people up by faith though but by hope the hope that maybe some day they could do something about it first you give him the hope that you can do something for him or about it then that he can do something about himself and it then the small hopes materialize states of beingness that man will recognize do include saints gods miracle men and messiahs all sorts of beings because man is familiar with superman batman etc he tends to attribute these characteristics to anything that is step forward for man in the past they would have attributed the characteristics of saints to scientologists in greek society it would have been the characteristics of gods man is capable of conceiving of such beings as long as they are unreal and exterior they are 579ok if looked at through holy book or something what man can conceive and what man can confront are two different things catholic priest professes belief in supernatural phenomena but what would he do it christs hand suddenly appeared disembodied and started turning the pages of his breviary similarly what being can conceive he can become and what he can confront being there is gap between these two things we need further definition to distinguish clears and ots clear has lost the matter energy space and time connected with thing called the mind he is not an allknowing being he moves up through becoming cause over the matter energy space and time of his mind an ot is being who is knowing and willing cause over life thought matter energy space and time that definition doesnt say mind life includes endowed cells not only or necessarily other thetans the ot may or may not be able to handle another thetan but he can handle this commodity called life so there is big gap between clear and ot clear makes nottooaberrated human being almost fly into pieces this happens to minority of people but it does give an element of fear connected with clears you are making people confront something that is somehow little bit within their ken you will not find them tracing the source of it it isnt bad for them if they sat around long enough they would run out all the pictures clear puts normal people at effect without trying to do thing he just has sufficient zone of beingness that what falls into that zone is liable to be asised or go into some sort of action sometimes people fear clears little and dont quite know why they feel that way they dont necessarily associate the feeling with the clear even grade iv release can be so much calmer and more at cause than the environment that his presence can be therapeutic so as you come downscale to grade iv release they stand out rather remarkably and they are still little bit out of reach as you go downscale from there you get person who is more able to disseminate because he more closely matches the reality level of the rest of the environment as you go down the release stages you get closer and closer to an ability to influence another without causing mess directly immediately understandably and without restimulation the bridge stays in as gradient for dissemination even the book one clear was looked upon with considerable awe bodhi is probably below dianetic release it is stable for from two seconds to two years but buddhisms promise to make bodhi was enough to civilize three fourths of asia having moved out of the reality of wogs the scientologist tends to compare himself with other scientologists he is unaware of his state of beingness until he is surrounded by wogs that makes him somewhat unhappy in the company of wogs as you go up towards clear this is less true if you go out in the wog world as clear they dont spot you as source you tend to produce certain phenomena you give the impression of being in command even when you dont do anything to command people will say i have to concentrate to talk to you or you have such command of the situation when nothing is being commanded you dont bother to use this mainly life becomes easier the pity of these states of beingness is that there is limit to what one being can do for another you can do lot but you cant live anothers life for him what you can do is 1 provide safe environment 2 show way methodology 3 provide for the ethical application or administration of methodology 4 give advice 5 pervade the environment with calmness 6 mock up new leg for crippled boy but that is the limit the rest is up to the other guy unless you lead the person to increase his own beingness he will never arrive this is the point that has been missed in all prior attempts to better man the only miraculous intervention there is or ever will be comes from the person himself he must overcome the terror of becoming the effect he must be led upwards by an unenturbulated environment to destimulate enough so that he can put his own feet on the road out and walk you can help him only with those first steps helping the individual is the only way to help humanity out 5806611c01 shspec81 government and organization good government is in the realm of invention at this point man is so afraid of bad turn in benign monarchy that he cant have one he is afraid of an sp getting into power also benign monarch cant wear all of his hats what makes government bad is that it gets an sp into it one sp breeds others as an sp wants other sps around him generals that advocate wars of attrition are sps they are just trying to knock off as many troops as possible the best military training is to do the most in the least time at the least expense and to keep your own people from being banged up the objective is to win that is the proper conduct of war you also want to inflict the least possible damage to the enemy because you will have to put the enemy back together again if you win this is proper war but the last four wars were wars of attrition all governments consist of body of beings against the individual the better government is the less against the individual and the more for the individual it is total suppression exists where the government is everything and the individual is nothing the opposite extreme can be equally suppressive anarchy where the individual is everything and the government is nothing in an anarchy any bum or suppressive is totally at liberty to knock anyone on the head there is perfect government the individual is as close as you will get to perfect entity why do you need government because any organization can win over individuals we thetans got to where we are today because we didnt organize as body of thetans instead we let the bad guys organize into body to get us this is the only big omission on the track ots didnt handle it on their own feet any group of organized humanoids can defeat any ot however this requires that one know something about the laws of organization without an organization the individual would have to maintain constant vigilance because he only has to lose one battle to lose everything you want an org that is minimally restrictive and maximally effective in benign monarchy the individual doesnt have to have much say because everything is taken care of when you turn over the government to group however confidence in the government is shaken and the individual must have say of course you dont let individuals make all the decisions this would lead to clown government individuals can all know enough to be meaningfully involved in every little thing there never has been democracy the greeks never had democracy just fifty landowners formed senate the senators didnt even represent anyone therefore it was not even republic republicanism is mean between the extremes if you make proper qualifications necessary for the holding of office eg that person not be below grade iv that person and other similar ones forming senate being specialists in the issues at stake could be sufficiently informed and have enough time to think about it to actually govern so if scientology took over you would have republican government after you have chosen the governor he is free to govern without any yak yak unless some weighty issue comes up for referendum eg change in the status quo or in the form of government englands failure to allow the american colonies representation in parliament was an error in tech that caused rift when group feels that it cant be heard it arc breaks this is the sort of arc break that always precedes war hitler said something that wasnt acknowledged and vice versa so thirty million men were killed in emergency situations benign monarch is the best system there is time to consult anyone anyway but in time benign monarch gets tired and overworked and he cant acknowledge everybody who speaks so unless he gets backed up by representative body you get dissolution of the organization the nominal head of the organization should be out of the way except in an emergency while the country is run by representative body corporate such body has great liabilities there is lack of total responsibility to the constituents so individuals in the group dont think fast enough therefore it is best not to have generalized body corporate running the government it must be specific in its representation unlike the pattern of board of directors each member of board of directors nebulously represents the stockholders however here there is crossrepresentation this generality goes into suppression if the people are represented then they could logically only be represented by one person that is why benign monarchy works there is crossrepresentation but as soon as the monarch gets body of advisors that doesnt represent the people more than one representative would have to represent exact segments of the population when too many people are represented by one person the distance becomes too great and the people feel unrepresented but if they can communicate with their 581representative and get action they feel that their governmental hat is well taken care of so they can relax the us has two senators per state this violates the above principle of representation electoral districts however do have direct representation there is further representation in state government which can receive certain orders from the federal government the us government however has representative in colorado it only has covert agencies there the colorado state assembly cannot address the us government there is direct line from the state assembly to the us assembly or the senate before you can have governmental system that is any good you have to have the tech of scientology to detect and improve abilities in people and ethics tech to detect suppressives you also need the communication formula arc triangle arc break tech etc if the people have senator why have representative the outcome is that the individual states and the us government are in violent conflict hence the civil war when these comm lines dont exist an individual goes into apathy you get dictatorship of the people vs the individual or you get situation where every man is the dictator representation can be pretty big because not everyone appeals at once but if everyone does appeal at once then the representative had better do something fast war is caused by incompetent government which causes breakdown in the comm line between constituent group and the society that surrounds it the society that surrounds it may be so incompetently governed that the inner group has to be nearly perfect to work its way forward scientology has this quality we also keep trying to be better at least whenever there is down statistic in scientology there are lots of builtin safeguards in the system so there is immediate need for elective representation in the future elections will be required when scientology gets bigger then exact representation will occur junior governing body may be given orders by any senior governing body in which it is not represented conversely very senior governing bodies should not give orders to junior governing bodies from which they do not have representative that ensures twoway communication situation the advisory council the international advisory council would be made up of representatives of continental parts of the world and executives who represent types of divisions of orgs it would have about fifteen members rule one may initiate motion unless that motion has been formed into an issuable directive if person wants policy letter framed he must write it up rule the chairman is given the power of absolute veto unless three quarters of those present vote to continue discussion or voting this will prevent endless hobbyhorsing proposal could be referred for special study elsewhere to be brought up later this way point of origin of policy letters is stated since that person wrote up the policy letter before it was passed members of the international advisory council represent the continental advisory councils but they also represent all orgs on that continent therefore someone from part of that continental area who feels that he is being done in or something could write to his representative in the international body as the system expands out the individual would find out that he had representative in his local continental body member of the ad council on majority signatures can get an urgent directive out on short notice provided b of i is convened later to determine if it was the right action unless policy change occurs an ad council directive is only in effect for year unless policy letter is issued the purpose of this rule is to prevent arbitrary laws from being arbitrarily introduced needlessly the advisory council has representatives from five continental areas plus one from st hill and divisional organizer for each division he represents every divisional secretary of that division in the whole world his job is to compile all the materials and specifications it is too much work for such person to do this and hold another hat at the same time so if person cant get books for instance he would write the div 2 divisional organizer if the stat of the divisional organizer is down he would get into being an authority he can get militant in the ad council the ad council can then issue what the divisional organizer has already written up in advance it is issued on the flash color of that division and it applies only to that division the divisional organizer is not operating those orgs so he does not act as bypass of the oes of those orgs 582conversely we will have the st hill or ww representative in continental ad councils lrh comm can also serve this purpose he has authority but he can be talked to and he can explain what ww is doing every divisional secretary in orgs becomes member of the ad council for that org the lrh comm is also on that orgs ad council to represent hco thus we get an eightman ad council sooner or later we will need representative of the ad council in each of the divisions of the org with continental org that has three other orgs plus itself you get four ad councils composed of secretaries and exec secs thus you get tenman ad council composed of the seven divisional heads plus the lrh comm plus the oes plus the has each junior org would have to have representative in the senior org we are dealing with basic ethics and organizational tech it really helps to have all beings in the org crosspoliced by stats stats dont ever happen they are always made and you have got to find out what is making them in downstat situation the errors are always gross the greatest source of downstats is personnel on thepost at all if you get stuck flow going on for too long with return flow you get an apathy on the other end cf the so 1 line people want to talk to lrh to find out if he is there it is to get the backflow going the main problem is in the relationship between the individual and the corporate body corporate body that cant act swiftly will cause lot of upset situation where any citizen can clobber the corporate body is equally suppressive because that person will also clobber other individuals the problem is to set up something that resolves the relationship between the corporate body and the individual 1 the individual must be able to get justice from the corporate body 2 he is entitled to bright management 3 the corporate body can expect contribution and compliance from the individual all it takes to make an organization is to avoid violating these when you get the consent of the people and respect for the government the thing will go on and on on other planets empire selection of governors was based on state of case when you put in government put in review of that government this happened to some extent in the us with amendments to the constitution but one reported back to the original body that created the government governed people who do not understand the theories or postulates of the government or the laws can be pretty dismayed and confused they are afraid that the relationship between the government and the individual will not be safeguarded they may even be represented and dont know it 6611c29 shspec82 ot and clear defined majority of scientologys major executives are now clear lrh noticed that the statistics of divisions were in roughly the same range as the case state of their heads we have tried to put together scientology dictionary it requires work from lrh to make sure that the definitions are complete he will take students requests on cards and define the words ot operating thetan operating means manipulating handling you operate car etc also oneself can operate one is operative thetan is from the greek letter theta traditionally used to mean thought the letter n is added to theta to make the noun thetan we mean by thetan life unit being an individual who is alive and who is capable of thinking and being spirit inhabiting the body in greek times theta was the thought in person as opposed to his body the thetan inhabits the clay and moves it around to that degree anyone who can move is operating as thetan but ot means someone who can operate without body being who is cause over 583thought life matter energy space and time someone who is being cause is being source of action or impulse as in causedistanceeffect this state is quite different from the state of clear it is someone who can operate without the encumbrances of the common clay there are degrees of operation wog common everyday gardenvariety humanoid he is body he doesnt know hes there etc he isnt there as spirit at all he is not operating as thetan the term comes from worthy oriental gentleman from the days of the british in egypt humanoid is one who has human characteristics by which we do not mean that he is human in his treatment of things he isnt it is simply that he is body he isnt there as spirit at all he will develop philosophy that says that everything is matter including the self wog is not the bottom end of the scale which would include psychotic neurotic catatonic etc this would be someone who didnt even know that he was mest ot isnt the top end of the scale either at the top you would have harmonic of the wog thetan who didnt have to operate at all in an almost unattainable absolute outside of mest altogether so he would be serene calm and dissociated with the physical universe not in the time stream someone at the bottom of the scale is the effect of everything he has to cause everything and can cause nothing someone at the top would be potentially able to cause everything but wouldnt have to but this is nogame condition and thetans are idiotic enough to like to have game going ptp exists when one has to do something about something when audited thoroughly person is longer affected by the problem similarly in serenity one doesnt have to do anything about it but one of the native characteristics of thetan is messing around he gets bored at tone 40 so just below 400 you get ot at the beginning of the universe the thetan was potentially omniscient and omnipotent but he had experience and knew nothing he was pretty stupid when you put someone back to the state of ot you are putting somebody back who is different from anyone else on the track he is operating with experience when we say ot we mean clear ot released ot is someone who is exterior and feeling great feeling powerful for just plain ot we can just call it exterior there has hitherto never been anything but released ot there are two parallel lines 1 how much is someone out of his bank and 2 how much less bank does he have using techniques developed in 1952 you can bang nearly anyone out of his head he then exhibits the characteristics of being who is not influenced by body this state can last third of second or it can last three hundred years it will make someone sane who is insane but since one has aberrations as being not just as body exteriorizing doesnt get rid of all his aberrations gautama siddhartha was exteriorizing people in 523 b making state called bodhi we can make bodhi buddha in thirty seconds the lamas in tibet developed practices to assist exteriorization when the lamas couldnt exteriorize people they redefined bodhi to mean someone who was calm refined serene and had benign conduct it is the mental mass that prevents exteriorization this mass is composite of the thetans own pictures and aberrations that pins him to the body some people are harder to exteriorize than others it is the mental mass called the mind with its pictures and masses that prevents some people from exteriorizing thetan exterior is simply outside body this happens inevitably at death it is only the worry about getting body that makes thetan unhappy an operating thetan is thetan exterior who can have but doesnt have to have body in order to control or operate thought life matter energy space and time nirvana was added to buddhistic doctrine at later date the original idea was just to get away from the continual cycle of rebirth there is goal to operate in buddhism however someone who is thetan exterior but not clear or ot may be in very bad shape he may barely be able to get to maternity ward he has power of choice over what body he gets etc and sometimes thetan suddenly regains his ot abilities without knowing how he did it this is quite rare it frightens observers suleiman in the arabian nights produced big scare about thetans lrh describes the embarrassment of the thetan in battle who hasnt noticed that his body has been killed and who just keeps hewing away at the enemy on the battlements until he notices that what he thinks is his sword goes through the enemy without touching them then he looks down in the mud and sees his old body very aberrated ot could exist he might accidentally discover that he can move mest make sound etc he is liable to do most anything because he is operating 584automatically he is not able to control these manifestations eg he may produce poltergeist phenomena this would be released ot those beings can be upset this is higherscale wog amongst thetans it is also possible to be exterior knowingly but unable to move anything or cause things one eventually gets tired of this and wants new body previous released ots had one with whom to associate person who went thetan exterior had hope of anything else he had shut track therefore the game of being body became functional actually an ot could mock up body out of whole cloth how else do you have body an ot like the above with or without the ability to move objects is not clear ot he is released ot since he doesnt understand his state or what he is doing but the scientology definition of ot is clear ot clear ot knows what he has done and what he is doing he is clear who can operate like billyo clear thetan without bank in or out of body the source of the bank the being himself he is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own bank he is causing himself to receive unwillingly and unknowingly the effect of his own bank the person compulsively makes up pictures when he is bad off all hes got is blankedout picture black mass that covers up the picture or pressure that crowds the picture into oblivion the black five below that you get random pictures that flick by on automatic the word bank is taken from electronic computer terminology meaning card system file system the machine pulls out certain data cards and puts them into operation or computation in the machine so that the machine can solve problems the bank bound thetan is peculiarly affected by and operates on banks there is such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of otherwise there would be hope you can ask guy with fixed picture or chronic picture what part of that could you be responsible for this is good process for the guy who doesnt know that he has mind someone can be so notised that he isnt aware that he has mind the level of not believing in mind is below the level of not being able to see the mind or pictures above being able to see the mind is not having one all mental masses do is not furnish you with data as they seem to do but charge the area of the data up so that you cant directly recall it and you get hit by the picture or mass and you think the picture is giving you the data so therefore you mustnt get rid of the picture because if you got rid of the picture then you wouldnt have the data this is silly because if you didnt have the picture then you could recall it all without consequences clear doesnt have mind in that he is not the effect of this picture mechanism but the clear still has the mest universe around and he still uses body that isnt very strong and is made of cells that arent invulnerable so the fact that person is clear doesnt say that he wont get sick because there are such things as bacteria and viruses and the body has finite strength it is idiotic to measure clear by his health when clear exteriorizes he may be clear exterior unable to talk etc like baby having to learn to walk the state is stable since he has bank to snap him in again when person is clear he can more easily become exterior there are 140 clears as of this date according to lrh getting someone from clear to ot is job of proofing him up so that even if he mocked up bank he wouldnt be the effect of it cleared ot is proofedup being who wont hit the banana peel you could probably fix up clear exterior so he would go exterior to the physical universe you could use command like try not to be outside the physical universe this would make him exterior from the universe but that would be unstable until he was longer at effect relatively to the physical universe he would be unstable since he is still the effect of mest life and thought but person who can be at cause over something is not necessarily at total effect of it that doesnt mean however that he has nothing to do with it because you can fix car is reason why you cant enjoy one our adversary is the complexity of the wisdom of the ages suppressed and combined to keep people from doing it it takes lot of blood sweat and tears to face this sort of thing there is nothing mild about the way course supervisors continue to do their job there is probably greater distance between clear and ot than between wog and clear clear ot is walking miracle who comprehends the miracle so knowing and willing cause is part of the definition of ot it is not an accidental or automatic state you get to point where you can turn automaticities on and off doing it on an unknowing basis is far inferior 585if this crosses up your own reality in any way shape or form by all means dont change your own reality just run your auditing question 6612c06 shspec83 scientology definitions part ii for the first time in known history there is ethics you cant lie to do people in and get away with it in scientology people who protest ethics say who determines who is suppressive that is easy suppressives have definite characteristics this universe got formed and is going to pieces on suppression an organized minority is all that has been making this universe mess it could have been good universe but ethics would have had to go in early and because thetans were acting as individuals and suppression was organized all we have to do is reverse it so that thetans without forgoing independence can organize the other side just little bit we are eventually going to become an organized majority we already have numerical superiority also they cant think straight we have overt intentions towards suppressives we are just trying to go about our business but you yourself should not go out of your way to obtain amusement by the torturing of sps simply because their valence is there to slip into the mocking up of suns is far more fun but when you do it do good job analytical mind this could be anything that thetan set up which collected data and used it to resolve problems the basic purpose of the mind is the resolution of problems relating to survival now if thetan does this you could say he is mind an analytical mind cannot exist independent of thetan man has been so caved in on the subject of the reactive mind which he knew not wot of of which he was not aware that he now discredits the whole idea of mind he says ill just do it all myself reactive mind reactive mind is an unwanted unknowing series of computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it contains things like the computation all horses sleep in beds it is an obsessive stratum of unknown unseen uninspected data that is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the person it is subawareness activity an analytical mind could be of use to an operating thetan it could exist if it was knowing and willing mechanism for instance much of dianetics and scientology was resolved by the construction of philosophical machines something you would draw up which would give some data that you could then combine with some other data and get some answer but you are setting down and lining up the data you are just doing think which is recorded so that you can knowingly observe relationship of data and get an answer so an analytical mind is knowing and willing resolution of problems related to survival this can get you in trouble when it is of lasting duration when it is set up to run forever without inspection and observation an analytical mind cannot exist without inspection and observation an astronomical computer being operated by competent scientist could be likened to the analytical mind but without inspection and observation an analytical mind would become reactive the reactive mind is like the opposite of the analytical mind it is like computer that uninspected picks up the data to resolve problems that had not been suspected and turns out answers that uninspected then by law become total effect upon population ie to avoid reactivity you must retain the option of total monitoring total circuit like an automatic elevator may still be analytical if it can be inspected the human body falls into the class of machines that operate without understanding such machine where thetan does not know how or why it operates is reactive the fellow who is there doesnt know when it is going to get sick or quit the body line is running uninspected and it is aberrative it has reactions and effects upon the thetan that he cannot predict it is an aberrative machine because it is running uninspected it has instruction book this is major omission beware of buying bodies without directions in them so willingness and inspection is what makes the difference between the analytical and the reactive minds the difference between dianetics and scientology is that one scientology increases the awareness of the thetan and the other dianetics just erases the bank the trouble you run into in disseminating comes from peoples lack of awareness of the reactive mind you have to show it to them if you handle persons reactive mind directly you get the situation where the person was not aware that he had lumbosis and is not now aware that it is gone the way you handle reactive mind is to increase the thetans awareness of it so he can control it it ceases to be reactive when you are talking about the analytical and the reactive mind you are talking about the awareness level of the individual 586only the reactive mind is opposed to the thetan the analytical mind is mind that is temporarily set up willingly and knowingly to assist in the resolution of problems problems inevitably relate to survival and anything hes set up to do this of which he was aware and which was inspected would be included under the rubric of analytical mind committee set up to get data and to coordinate the activities of another area or body of factory or something like that would be the mind of that factory even though they are thetans doing it in fact they would have to be thetans doing it for it to be analytical one of the reasons why you should know policy is that otherwise the solutions and combinations unknown to you make it have an effect on you because it is somewhat reactive if policy isnt inspected and reformed to meet the condition of operation it too would become reactive mind as with us government law from the point of view of the society scientology is somewhat reactive mind to the degree that they are not aware of our existence or our effect if scientology had evil intentions it would be very easy to operate on subrosa level however it would be bad for the planet on the whole it is hard anyway for society at its low awareness level to be aware of scientology it is likewise hard for them to be aware of thetan thetan should probably go by the rule never explain dont feel that you need to explain your motives to others when you dont intend to hide them their level of awareness of you is already so low that explaining wont help at all after all they cant tell your motives be as obvious plain and straightforward as you like but if the ordinary evidences which lie around them dont justify your actions then theres sense in explaining it to the person whos challenging them he wouldnt be able to understand them anyway any analytical mind can become reactive mind so setting up an analytical mind is always dangerous to some degree power the amount of force that can be applied in unit of time actually the physical definition states that power is the amount of work that can be accomplished in unit of time power has the connotation of being potential unlike force which is actual power doesnt necessarily mean the use of force power is not exerted whereas force tends to be therefore person is powerful when he is able to use force not when he is or isnt using force but if he is forceful he is using force right now the smarter person gets the less he employs force to get others to change their opinions etc implant unwilling unknowing receipt of think an implant is an intentional wreck of somebodys ability to make pictures perceive and remember its intentional an intentional installation of fixed ideas contrasurvival to the thetan in an implant someone is intentionally giving the thetan perceptions and ideas all hypnotism is is restimulation of past implants engram those perceptions unknowingly contained in the force duress pain and unconsciousness of an incident this is not the same as an implant because it is not necessarily intentional for one thing intent is the difference the person makes mental image picture by his reaction to an experience he goes out stop it in the process of doing this hes made sort of stuck wave because he didnt prevent it and just as you would make an embossed impression of something he embosses the environment if you were to press your hand against brick for split second you would have picture of the brick and moment or so later you would have the indentations of the brick because you pushed something at the brick similarly if you pull on rope you make an impression this would be analogous to secondary the thetan pushes back against what is pushing him or he pulls in against what is leaving him it is at the point where he resisted the motion most that he gets stuck thetan can make and exert energy when he tries to fend something off or hold something in he pushes or pulls back against something he gets picture of the moment when his resistance was great that could be an engram secondary lock or implant problem intention counterintention goal countergoal or purpose counterpurpose goals problem mass 587the gpm is so named because when there are two intentions counteropposed one has problem and the opposed forces or goals tend to produce mass the russians statement of this is dialectic materialism that all ideas are born out of the meeting of two forces that is backwards when two ideas oppose each other they create force that shows you where they are on the tone scale if you hit guy hard enough hell think gpms consist of pairs of opposing ideas two opposing ideas produce mass the thetan cannot asis either side hence the mass remains the mass of gpm is mental energy mass but it can be in the physical universe too pandeterminism and selfdeterminism pandeterminism is the ability to see or asis both sides of conflict or problem if one is totally pandetermined he has mental mass because hes seen both sides of everything he can see two ideas at once even though they are opposed selfdeterminism is laudable because it is rare but it is not as good as pandeterminism if guy justifies what he does you know immediately that he is selfdetermined not pandetermined this is the quickest test there is wholly reactive person will oppose any idea put to him conservative or reactionary tends to be against everything you propose so if you give him his own ideas you give him problem because his first impulse is to be against them cf symptom prescription and the interpersonalists this is such horrible thing to do that it is normally looked upon as fightin words like you think youre pretty good dont you you have made the guy resist his own ideas the above type of person is on lowerscale mockery of pandeterminism he can carry out raging argument with second person that doesnt say word the whole time like well youre going to say and you think but there is ability of thetan that doesnt have lowerscale mockery or exaggeration emotion response by wavelength affecting as individual or another which produces sensation and state of mind intention something which one wishes or intends to do it is an impulse towards something it is an idea that one is going to accomplish something he means to do it affinity affinity has nothing to do with emotion its the ability to occupy the space of or be like or similar to or to express willingness to be something i like you means i would just as soon be you i would just as soon occupy your space when two individuals dont like each other they wont occupy each others space or viewpoint they dont want to be like the other person etc dissimilarity must exist when this becomes sufficiently strong person enforcedly becomes like the other fellow which is an overwhelm home universe the universe thetan made for himself here we find the rock which we audited for and assessed out meaning shape of something on which we could then run process we had in the past theory that it was the first object on the track that the fellow had made we would run fiveway help on it and make fast stable release of very high order religion religion means basically the search for truth deddedex deduced something or other it means that the overtmotivator sequence went backwards ded dedex is the overtmotivator sequence wrongway to so that you hit joe and then he hits you thats deddedex the original connotation was that although it went this way you had it figured out that he must have hit you first so you invented something that he did to you to motivate your 588hitting him its phony overtmotivator sequence it is what guy does to justify an unmotivated overt it means the overt act explained the fact of having hit someone without provocation plus means of explaining having hit him is the deddedex after you commit the first action you invent something to explain it deddedex deeddeed explained somatic mind this idea was added to the first book by donald h rogers john w campbell and the publisher i found it in the glossary so there it is its the mind that runs the body independent of the body and the reactive mind it is physical coordination switchboard system in view of the fact that we dont know how it runs we really have business declaring the existence of mind that we dont really know about the early introduction to dmsmh with the part about the wheel and the arch describes the book its first line was written by walter winchell and the rest was written by the publisher anchor point something the thetan put out to make space buttered all over the universe very badly disoriented and dispersed when someone in this case condition is asked to spot spots where he is an improper process the proper process is to have him spot spots where he is not he will point all over the universe this is the reaction of this very dispersed case to this question from which this term is taken he will think that he is everywhere it is an im over there case perhaps this condition comes from leaving anchor points all over the place and appearing in one or another of these points tiger drill one of the drills that has been adequately discussed in bulletins it uses tiger as non reactive word computation to figure out 2 x 2 4 computing psychosis one who from his psychosis figurefigures hes inconstant in his conduct hes computive hes got crazy explanation hes obsessively solving problem that doesnt exist dramatizing psychotic one patterned action which is insane and which the person runs over and over when he is not doing that particular action the dramatizing psychotic is remarkably sane he is consistent in his conduct arbitrary something introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation arbitrary means stand alone someone says x must be done or x is true if that is introduced without observation without any refutation of what was there previously into formula situation admin action of line it will cause ripple this ripple then needs to be solved so someone else will introduce an arbitrary solution to the introduced arbitrary it leads to further arbitraries being introduced to handle resultant outnesses this is the stuck five held down five phenomenon an urgent action may be an arbitrary as in the tech of handling an urgent directive this must be replaced by something based on observed fact it is only in force until data can be gotten an example of an arbitrary would be an education that boy never understood like an education without purpose harmonics 589any wavelength action or scale has reverberations up and down by doubles or halves in the field of art it means agreement with in scientology upper harmonics refers to welloff cases in scientology it means similarity or repetition of something at higher or lower point on scale lower harmonic is lower similarity which is nutty related to higher harmonic this is based on the tendency of wavelength to repeat itself the lower you go in terms of awareness the more weird the repetition is in music it means coaction or similar action like resonating strings for instance lower harmonic of figuring out math table is doodling it is similar action but less aware therefore harmonics apply to the awareness scale the term lowerscale mockery expresses the idea of harmonics more usefully for our purposes ridicule is based on this you can feel that your ideas are crazy even if they are not if you hear them expressed or mocked by nut or true believer like caricature i was trying to figure out what to do with the org i was trying to figure out what england would do by trying to figure out what she should do to straighten things out politically i was trying to figure out which way this was going to go to figure out if i should expand the organization or whether to enter dollars into the country or hold them out and i ran into guy outside the door who said that he was disraeli and was going to help england 6612c13 shspec84 scientology definitions part iii scientology is an extension of the work of gautama siddhartha 2500 years ago gautama sought to end the cycle of death and rebirth by showing an individual that he was spirit not dependent on bodies we accomplished his goal of exteriorizing people more successfully in 1952 but the wisdom of buddhism was enough to civilize threefourths of asia it is the oldest and biggest religion on this planet it predates christianity by 500 years probably the shreds of buddhism came into the middle east with the silk and spice merchants who following alexanders ventures to india in about 333 b discovered that there was europe and made trade contact with europe this sparked religious revival buddha predicted that in 2500 years the entire job would be finished in the west thats in the pali canons well we finished it buddha never pretended to be other than just man and his movement the first international religious movement was open to anyone buddhism has moved in its technology not one inch further than it was pushed in tibet until 1952 when we started exteriorizing people the essence of religion is the fact that man is spiritual being all religions hold this in common but only in buddhism was this ever proven any forward push like buddhism runs into sps who are afraid that if you got better you might knock them off or at least stop their games the basic goal of psychiatry today is to wipe out religion they say anyone who is religious is psychotic if they succeed in knocking out our church they will go after bigger ones this is really all that its all about as long as religion brings solace to man as long as churches stand in any way for the spiritual freedom of man psychiatry will not really be able to progress therefore psychiatry should not be allowed to wipe out small church and then go on to bigger church and bigger church and so take it all over the government has right to comment upon religious beliefs or practice they are telling us that we must not do something we are not doing we are not treating the sick and the insane there is law against increasing peoples ability or intelligence and that is all that we are doing psychiatry is demanding its right to kill or maim any human being after it states that hes crazy if they can do that they can control the planet politically but they will fail because they cant complete cycle of action or choose right target there is law against making people better or more intelligent also when someone tries to cut pure theta line it tends to blow up against him our victory was the victory of the individual over fate and the universe if we win everybody wins crushing the opposition on the way up is hardly worth doing inversion it should go one way and it goes the other way it inverts it collapses in on itself downward when person is introverted he would look in on himself its reverse scale as one factor progresses the other factor degresses it goes backwards exteriorization an action which i have just described as the history of buddhism thetan walks out of or exists out of body exteriorization is the action of moving out of body psychiatrists boobytrap this by 590claiming that insane people can exteriorize in fact if they do exteriorize they are sane while they are exterior interiorization people who are interiorized interiorization is not the reverse of this it means going into it too fixedly and becoming part of it not just going into your head you could interiorize into work or into most anything exteriorization means the spirit moving out of the body restimulation the reactivation of an existing incident some approximation of the original incident causes it to go into play there is point where it was restimulated the restimulation is usually unknown to the person if it were known he would immediately recover unknown it tends to have an effect upon the person by picking up restimulations you can knock out of action sn engram without running it it is as though the engram sat over in locker undisturbed and not troubling the person then one day he passes truck and the engram drops out of locker and the person doesnt know what it is so he becomes the effect of it if you picked up the moment of its restimulation it would drop back into locker and cease to trouble the person it is upon this fact that the whole subject of releasing depends the erasure that occurs is the erasure of these points of restimulation destimulation destimulate means to take away the restimulation it does not mean the erasure of the original incident it is the knocking out of the point of restimulation genetic entity cytology the study of cells conceives of an endless stream of protoplasm passing through time with branch tracks that are bodies your current body is supposed to have originated from sea of ammonia by the process of reproduction it is supposed to have dome down to pt if that were the case then somewhere along the line blueprint for body would have had to enter the line in the days of dianetics good way to account for past lives was to say that they were incidents on the ge line cf history of man the darwinian theory is an explanation of this unending stream of protoplasm we find that this theory doesnt actually hold good man is spiritual being you should be able to find the blueprint in the body we used to think that it showed up on the emeter actually it doesnt only you do first overt this would be the first on chain of overts if guy has an impulse to commit given overt you could trace back down the chain to the first one and theoretically he would blow the impulse cf expanded dianetics but you should not try to process specific type of aberration its quite fatal because in the first place its an eval for the case also it is condemnatory negativetype process it doesnt validate the person at all you dont validate the person by finding his nasty habits and trying to process them the percentiles of successes when specific aberrations are addressed is too low this procedure is not successful because you are not validating whats right with the person you dont have to find out whats wrong with person to make him right you just get the guy to be able to communicate then you get him to look at his problems and you find out that he has been resolving them by committing overts you get him over doing this then you find that he is very arc broken with life and you get him over that then he gets to where he discovers that he has great solution to everything and every time he has bad break he goes and lies down and is horse or something but we are not interested in his solutions and were not treating him for that reason all of these things are simply increasing the abilities of spirit not healing whats wrong with it entrance point to this universe classified information many times on the time track one has been told that he just entered this universe it is big swindle 591ot activities those programs conducted by ots to assist scientology anchor points gold balls body is constructed in space framework you can see these things at least some people can when person has dark hollows under his eyes it is all the little gold balls grouped together under the eyes that have caved in and gone black if you could shift the gold ball framework of the body you could probably bend joints backwards etc every once in awhile somebodys face is out of shape or something and you get him to pick up the gold ball and put it back where it belongs or something or you get him to put bunch of balls out there to remedy his havingness of that particular ball this is anchor point processing from way back when all of sudden instead of lying against his face the gold ball goes back where it belongs and the pc reasserts his sense of balance his face will actually change shape this has to do with the structure of bodies and what the space is in which the body is formed it is apparently one of the ways in which bodies are mocked up i wouldnt look for them if i were you its rather fraught with disaster in some cases gold balls are used in mocking up the body in space first and second postulate if you find the first postulate that was made relating to certain situation you can ignore the second postulate about 1952 lrh tried to make an endall of this he looked for the first postulate that one ever made on the track we now find that its not necessary to have that energy potential of motion or power the modern physics definition is that energy is small waves flowing it is force or flow or potential force or flow from something to something or ability to accomplish work or to accomplish movement rather doubtful idea that we are taught to believe is that if something moves from point to point b 1 you need energy 2 you develop energy if you really know about the system of energy you wont need huge amounts of energy to move particles if person really understands something he can do remarkable things with it modern physics hasnt done that well with rocketry it is not very efficient so energy is potential or actual motion or force flow progress of particles impulses or waves from point to point b or in any direction there is direction to it which rather outlaws the idea of dispersal dispersal is not flow flow has the connotation of being somewhat directional if something flowing off mountain is getting wider and wider it can cease to be flow and become flood energy is flow of particles waves etc in some direction flow is limited and directional progress of particles through space thought not to be confused with life and the spirit thought is spaceless positionless product of thetan containing meaning the greeks confused it with life the original mistake is in the word theta for the greeks theta meant life or thought thought is not life and it is not spirit lambda life in the dianetic axioms dianetic axiom 11 it is an unused symbol today nothing this implies that the thing is but is being noted you couldnt notis something that wasnt in the first place its an assertion against fact 592counteremotion the emotion which greets the emotion it is point exerting an emotion against point b emotion is normally something that has flow wavelength and meaning mixed up with it any emotion could counter any emotion so counteremotion means any emotion that is countering an existing emotion when you take apart the emotion in bank you can pick out the emotion and counteremotion counteremotion is the emotion that is used to meet situation and which does meet it counter emotion is an interesting study it is related to politics and control of humans for instance the counteremotion to hitlers rage in germany was enthusiasm the advertising field is also very interested in counteremotion the advertising exec comes up against it because he tries to counter want with an emotion but want isnt an emotion so there is counteremotion so you have to know what emotion could create desire for the product and counter that memory and recall there is difference between these two terms thats significant to the auditor recall however implies that you bring it up to present and look at it it has that connotation whereas memory has the connotation that you simply knew it had happened so the two terms have two different connotations but they are very easily interchanged because person doesnt have to bring things up to pt when he is clear he doesnt do this any longer there are lot of things that he doesnt bring up to pt to recall them he can recall them in detail and tell you exactly where they are without having them brought up into the present to review to that extent the modern clear is far in advance of the book one definition of clear the reason one cant recall is totally contained in the fact that his memory is totally surrounded by mass which prevents him from recalling if you got rid of all the mass of the mind you wouldnt have anything to recall correct actually it doesnt work that way at all when you get the mass off recall is easy it is undue duress in the incident that prevents recall so the individual gets picture of the incident to read it because he cant enter the incident where it is the mental energy you used in bailing out of lions cage would prevent you from remembering that you had been in the lions cage therefore amnesia is the situation where person is protecting himself from so many dangers on the track that the mass prevents penetration because the part of the track for which he has amnesia is so heavily charged confidence an expression of trust degree of trust inflation is an expression of confidence in the government money is symbolized idea that goes bad when confidence in the issuer drops that is why they put pictures of kings and presidents etc on money they try to associate money and its issuer trust and distrust is composed of past experience total trust is looked on as total idiocy but it is the only condition under which you can exist we didnt arrive through suspicion certainty the degree of willingness to accept the awareness of an isness it is very conditional thing since in the first place it is questionable whether any mass has mass scientologist does not start out from where did the wall come from but just from is the wall there and if it is there the scientologist can have certainty on it it is possible to generate uncertainty by asking what is brainwashing is the trick of mixing up certainties to unconfuse someone it is only necessary to have him regain some certainties person arc breaks if his certainties get shifted an education can be made hypnotic by qualifying everything so that it becomes sort of generality and definitely an uncertainty generality any unspecific statement tends towards generality its the substitution of plural for singular or greater for lesser this may or may not be intentional dispersed people talk in generalities classifying anything comes under this heading for instance it is not really boys it is boy boy boy etc cf korzybskis general semantics classifying is necessary but it is very dangerous classifications occur in the bank they is always one person you will always find out exactly who they is on meter the generality is the primary tool of the sp it is used to prevent reach as in everything is all covered with germs johnny suppress 593to squash to sit on to make smaller to refuse to let reach to make uncertain about his reaching to render liquefy by heating or lessen in any way possible by any means possible to the harm of the person and the fancied protection of the suppressor the sp often expresses generalities to the suppressed person thus surrounding him with generalities the invention of germs was bit suppressive the suppressive uses tricks and mechanisms to prevent reach postulate to generate or think concept concept is think thought to postulate implies requirement that something goes stops turns white goes blue or remains blue or that it is something or that it isnt something or that some action is going to take place etc postulate implies conditions and actions rather than just plain thinks postulate is associated more with intention than it is with thought it has dynamic connotation havingness the feeling that one owns or possesses it is possible to wear coat without having coat mere possession does not make havingness confronting ability to front up to confronting is derived from withfronting so there is dim connotation that if you confront the door the door is confronting you coaction is implied but this does not actually exist in our meaning of the word confront is the ability of the individual to face up to look at stand up to stand in front of be near see visualize or otherwise perceive something by extension if you cant confront something you cant handle it thetans have been steamrolled by confronting total confronting is not the total answer there are times to stand up and glare and there are times not to when person can selectively confront or not confront anything then of course he has total power these do go together when thetan doesnt want to confront something he tends to mask it to turn away from it and it tends to make him an effect if he cant make an effect on it it can make an effect on him however in fact to stand in front of an automobile going 60 mph and to let it run over you just to demonstrate that you are not afraid of confronting it is assininity if you ask person whether he can confront an automobile going 60 mph and he comm lags you know that he is down into an obsessive confront and feels that there is some sense in your asking him to do it he has the idea that there is something wrong with him if he wont go and do this willful and knowing confronting or willingness to conceive the idea of or to confront or not to confront these concepts are all contained in the single idea of confronting if you felt that you had to be able to stand up to anything that would be to confess that you couldnt stop anything from occurring im willing to confront putting my arm out to an automobile traveling 60 mph and having it stop to that extent i am willing to confront this is not conditional confronting what are the conditions under which you would be willing to confront this is not fair question one wants to lead life of ruin though some have made it into virtue eg the stoics it is philosophical booby trap they persuade people that they should be willing to live life as dopeaddicts bums and in total ruin in order to demonstrate that they can confront this kind of life that is suppression it has precious little to do with sanity but it is terrific process in that the individual will come up to finding out what he is obsessively confronting as well as what he is willing to confront and what he doesnt have to confront one thing he might find out is that he doesnt have to go on confronting forever in fact he is quite tired of standing there so desire to have challenge concerning existence only relates to being willing to engage in larger game as the power to confront or not arises selectively an individuals selfdeterminism arises accordingly very often thetan who never likes to be moving explains the fact that he got run over by x by saying that he was perfectly willing to confront it he is happy that he got run over by x because now he has had such an experience he says well it was good experience but i never want to do it again when person can control things he can selectively confront when he loses that ability he says well at least i can confront it the thought that you cant do anything about anything is very humanoid and deadly there is suppression at work if person gets the idea that because he has the ability to confront anything he must therefore confront everything this is an invalidation of his ability to control and change undesirable aspects of the environment this is sp talk it is very 594different from being willing to confront anything it is only when you lose the ability to handle situation that you justify your inability by the thought that you can confront the disaster that thereby ensues weve run out of time i leave you confronting your sins thank you end of shsbc tape notes 595596
