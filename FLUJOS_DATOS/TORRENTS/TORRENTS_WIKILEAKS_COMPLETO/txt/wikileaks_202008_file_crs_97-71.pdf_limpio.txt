the federal courts historically have been reluctant to review and resolve political questions involving information disputes between congress and the executive branch although there is considerable interbranc h cooperation such c onflicts probably will continue to occur on occasion history and background throughout the first 150 years of the fe deral government access to government information does not appear to have been major issue among the three branches or for the citizenry there were few instances during this period when the president for reasons of maintaining the constitutional independence nd equality of his branch vigorously resisted attempts by congress and the courts to obtain executive records furthermore during this same era an active federal public printing program was established and eff ectively developedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9771crs2 following world war ii however information came to be of limited availability from federal department s and agencies conditioned by information restrictions prompted by recent global hostilities fearful of cold war spies intimidated by zealous loyalty investigators within and outside of govern ment and anxious about various efforts at reducing the executive workforce during the postwar reconversion the federal bureaucracy generally was not eager to have its activities and operations disclosed to the public the press or other governmental entities prevailing law tolerated this state of affairs offering citizens clear avenue of access to agency information the public availability of records held by the executive branch was limited by artful interpretation of the housekeeping statute of 1789 5 usc 301 authorizing the heads of departments to prescribe regulations regarding the cust ody use and preservation of the records papers and property of their entity moreover provision of the administrative procedure act of 1946 5 usc 551 indicated that matters of official record should be available to the public but added that an agency could restrict access to its documents for good cause found or in the public inte rest these discre tionary authorities were relied upon to restrict the accessibility of unpublished agency records and documents such conditions also contributed to th increasing difficulties of congressional committees and subcommittees in gaining access to both records and officials of federal departments and agencies dur ing the 1950 s in response some congressional panels began examining these information access issues and seeking responsive legislative solutions among the well known inquiries in this period was the work of the special subcommittee on government information of the house committee on government operations the subcommittee established in 1955 was chaired by representative john moss and produced many volum of hearings and reports public access laws apart from interbranch information access dilemmas congress in 1966 undertook fashioning various statutory arrangements for realizing public access to executive branch information this focus resulted because legislators felt that congress adequately made its deliber ations and proceedings subject to public observation largely published its records nd otherwise was constitutionally authorized to engage in information restriction in certain circumstances for example the constitution explicitly permitted each house of congress discretion to keep portions of its journal of proceedings secret and disallo wed the questioning of members of congress in any other place regarding official speech or debate legislators also were satisfied with the openness of federal c ourt files and hearing rooms thus the departments and agencies were the principal object of government information access reform laws executive branch officials however were not supportive of these measures and initially did not always promote or pur sue their faithful administrati on the current major federal laws facilitating public access to government information are br iefly described below the full text of each statute may be consulted by using the appropriate united states code reference provided freedom of information act 5 usc 552 initially enacted in 1966 and subsequently amended the freedom of information foi act establishes for any person corporate or individual regardless of nationality presumptive access to existing unpublished agency records on any topic the law specifies nine categories of information that may be permissibly exempted from the rule of disclosure agencies within the federal intelligence community are prohibited fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9771crs3 making any record available to foreign gove rnment or representa tive of same pursuant to foi act request disputes over the acce ssibility of requested records may be settled according to the provisions of the act in federal court fees for search review or copying of materials may be imposed also for some types of requesters f ees may be reduced or waived the foi act was amended in 1996 to provide for public access to information in an electronic form or format these amendments are often referred to as efoia 5 usc 552 note in the 110th congress legislation has been introduced hr 1309 hr 1326 s 849 that would among other th ings impose tighter deadlines on agencies to respond to foia requests federal advisory committee act 5 usc app 1972 statute the federal advisory committ ee act faca in part presumptively requires that the meetings of all federal advisory committees serving executive branch entities be open to public obs ervation the statute speci fies nine categories of information similar to those of the foi act that may be pe rmissively relied upon to close advisory committee deliberations when such matters are under di scussion disputes over the proper public notice for committee meeting or the closing of session may be pursued in federal court privacy act 5 usc 552a legislated in 1974 the privacy act in part establishes for individuals who are united states citizens or permanent resident aliens presumptive access to personally identifiable files on themselves held by most federal agencies generally however not law enforcement and intelligence tities the statute specifies seven types of information that may permissively be exempted from the rule of access where file subject contends that record contains inaccurate informati on about that individual the act allows correction through emendation disputes over the accessibility of personally identifiable files may be pursued in federal court government in the sunshine act 5 usc 552b enacted in 1976 the sunshine act presumptively opens the policymaking deliberations of collegially headed federal agencies ch as boards commissions or councils to public scrutiny unless closed in accordance with any of nine exemptions to the rule of openness disputes over pr oper public notice of such meetings or the propriety of closing deliberation may be pursued in federal court interbranch access statutory arrangements have been created to facilitate access by one branch of the federal governme nt to records and information holdings of the other two branches both congress and the judiciary have subpoena powers which can be exercised to compel the production of materials by another branch but even these demands have sometimes been re sisted occasionally but rare ly the courts have ruled on these disputes in 1974 for example special prosecutor sought certain tape recordings that president richard nixon on claim of constituti onal privilege initially refused to provide the supreme court in united states v nixon 418 us 683 disallowed the presidents claim of privilege finding it too general and overbroad and the needs of the special prosecutor to pursue criminal prosecutions more compelling these tape recordings would become known as the watergate tapeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9771crs4 1 see http wwwvagovfoi areportfy2006initialrequestshtml 2 see httpwwwssagovfoiahtml200620ssa20annual20foia20report2020 finalpdfin general interbranch disputes over acce ss to information are political conflicts of the highest order the federa l courts historically have b een reluctant to review and resolve such political questions resolution is often r eached through negotiation reduction of the quantity of records initially sought substitution of other information alternative delivery mechanisms or limitation of the number of individuals who will examine materials provided by another branch sometimes appeals to public opinion will pressure an information access deadlock to settlement congress can use its power of the purse to leverage its information access demands federa l courts rely upon spirit of justice and fair play to sustain their orders for the production of information by another branch in view of the american sepa ration of powers model of government such conflicts are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive furthermore they probably will continue to occur using the information access laws statistics on usage how frequently
