works of authorship patent inventions of processes machines manufactures and compositions of matter that are useful new and nonobvious and trademark commercial symbols the source of federal copyright nd patent law originates with the copyright and patent clause of the us constitution which authorizes congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries2 by contrast the constitutional basis for federal trademark law is the commerce clause3 the copyright act patent act and lanham act provide gal protection for intellectual property against unauthorized use theft and other violations of the rights granted by those statutes to the ip owne r the copyright act
