dilemma classified by ambassador john r beyrle reason 14 b d 1 c summary moscow mayor yuriy luzhkov remains loyal member of united russia with reputation for ensuring that the city has the resources it needs to function smoothly questions increasingly arise regarding luzhkovs connections to the criminal world and the impact of these ties on governance luzhkov remains in solid position due to his value as consistent deliverer of votes for the ruling party unfortunately the shadowy world of corrupt business practices under luzhkov continues in moscow with corrupt officials requiring bribes from businesses attempting to operate in the city end summary overview the kremlins luzhkov dilemma 2 c moscow mayor yuriy luzhkov is the embodiment of political dilemma for the kremlin loyal founding member of united russia and trusted deliverer of votes and influence for the ruling party and its leader prime minister putin luzhkovs connections to moscows business community the big and legitimate as well as the marginal and corrupt has enabled him to call for support when he needs it to deliver votes for united russia or to ensure that the city has the resources it needs to function smoothly luzhkovs national reputation as the man who governs the ungovernable who cleans the streets keeps the metro running and maintains order in europes largest metropolis of almost 11 million people earns him certain amount of slack from government and party leaders he oversaw what even united russia insiders acknowledge was dirty compromised election for the moscow city duma in october and yet received only slap on the wrist from president medvedev 3 c muscovites are increasingly questioning the standard operating procedures of their chief executive man who as of 2007 they longer directly elect luzhkovs connections to the criminal world and the impact that these ties have had on governance and development in moscow are increasingly matter of public discussion although luzhkov was successful in winning courtordered damages from opposition leader boris nemtsov for his recent publication luzhkov an accounting nemtsov and his solidaritymovement allies were heartened by the fact that the judge did not award damages on the basis of the corruption accusations themselves but rather on libel technicality 4 c few believe that luzhkov will voluntarily relinquish his post prior to 2012 when the moscow city duma must submit list of mayoral candidates to medvedev for his selection united russia will probably call on luzhkovs political machine and his genuine public support to deliver votes for them in the 2011 state duma elections as well as the 2012 presidential contest with apparent successor in line and with ambitions beyond remaining mayor luzhkov is in solid position the evidence of his involvement or at least association with corruption remains significant this cable presents that side of luzhkov one that bears not only on luzhkov and his handling of local politics but on putin and medvedev as they move toward the 2012 elections background on moscows criminal world 5 c the moscow city governments direct links to criminality have led some to call it dysfunctional and to assert that the government operates more as kleptocracy than government criminal elements enjoy krysha term from the criminalmafia world literally meaning roof or protection that runs through the police the federal security service fsb ministry of internal affairs mvd and the prosecutors office as well as throughout the moscow city government bureaucracy analysts identify threetiered structure in moscows criminal world luzhkov is at the top the fsb mvd and militia are at the second level finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level this is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill void in some areas because the city is not providing some services 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that moscows ethnic criminal groups do business and give paybacks it is the federal headquarters of the parties not the criminal groups who decide who will participate in politics xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that the political parties are the ones with the political clout therefore they have some power over these criminal groups moscow 00000317 002 of 003 crime groups work with municipal bureaucrats but at low level for example the armenians and georgians were formerly heavily involved in the gambling business before city officials closed the gambling facilities these ethnic groups needed protection from law enforcement crackdowns so they sought cooperation with the municipal bureaucrats in such scenarios crime groups paid the moscow police for protection luzhkovs links to criminal figures 7 s xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that luzhkovs wife yelena baturina definitely has links to the criminal world and particularly to the solntsevo criminal group widely regarded by russian law enforcement as one of the most powerful organized crime groups in russia according to the internet article on the moscow group vladimir yevtushenko the head of the company sistema is married to natalya yevtushenko baturinas sister sistema was created with moscow city governmentowned shares and sistema initially focused on privatizing the capitals real estate and gas sistemas president yevgeny novitsky controlled the solntsevo criminal gang today sistema has spun off into various companies which implement projects that typically include 50 percent funding from the moscow city government 8 s according to xxxxxxxxxxxx luzhkov used criminal money to support his rise to power and has been involved with bribes and deals regarding lucrative construction contracts throughout moscow xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that luzhkovs friends and associates including recently deceased crime boss vyacheslav ivankov and reputedly corrupt duma deputy joseph kobzon are bandits he told us that he knew this because he formerly had contacts in these criminal groups but many of his contacts have since been killed xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the moscow government has links to many different criminal groups and it regularly takes cash bribes from businesses the people under luzhkov maintain these criminal connections recently ultranationalist ldpr opposition party leader vladimir zhirinovskiy strongly criticized luzhkov and called for him to step down claiming that luzhkovs government was the most criminal in russian history this remarkable denunciation carried on state tv flagship channel one was widely seen as an indirect kremlin rebuke of luzhkov 9 s xxxxxxxxxxxx told us everyone knows that russias laws do not work the moscow system is based on officials making money the government bureaucrats fsb mvd police and prosecutors offices all accept bribes xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that everything depends on the kremlin and he thought that luzhkov as well as many mayors and governors pay off key insiders in the kremlin xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that the vertical works because people are paying bribes all the way to the top he told us that people often witness officials going into the kremlin with large suitcases and bodyguards and he speculated that the suitcases are full of money the governors collect money based on bribes almost resembling tax system throughout their regions xxxxxxxxxxxx described how there are parallel structures in the regions in which people are able to pay their leaders for instance the fsb mvd and militia all have distinct money collection systems further xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that deputies generally have to buy their seats in the government they need money to get to the top but once they are there their positions become quite lucrative money making opportunities bureaucrats in moscow are notorious for doing all kinds of illegal business to get extra money 10 s according to xxxxxxxxxxxx luzhkov is following orders from the kremlin to not go after moscows criminal groups for example xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that it was only public relations stunt from putin to close gambling in contrast to xxxxxxxxxxxx said he did not see the sense in suitcases of money going into the kremlin since it would be easier to open secret account in cyprus he speculated that the moscow police heads have secret war chest of money xxxxxxxxxxxx said that this money is likely used to solve problems that the kremlin decides such as rigging elections it can be accessed as resource for when orders come from above for example for bribes or to pay off people when necessary xxxxxxxxxxxx postulated that the kremlin might say to governor that he can rule certain territory but in exchange he must do what the kremlin says 11 c notwithstanding luzhkovs solid position some of our contacts believe that cracks have appeared in his armor due moscow 00000317 003 of 003 to his corrupt activities xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that luzhkov has many enemies because his wife has the most lucrative business deals in moscow and many people think luzhkov has received too much money the of the head of the interior police vladimir kolokotsev told xxxxxxxxxxxx that kolokotsevs number one job is to get luzhkov out within year kolokotsev was credited with removing longstanding governor yegor stroyev from orel xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that luzhkov is on his way out although he acknowledged that the kremlin has not identified suitable replacement yet issues such as corruption and traffic congestion have to certain degree eroded luzhkovs popularity putin xxxxxxxxxxxx said will likely pick the quietest and least expected person to replace luzhkov in moscow everyone needs krysha 12 c according to many observers the lawless criminal climate in russia makes it difficult for businesses to survive without being defended by some type of protection xxxxxxxxxxxx explained how bribes work in moscow cafe owner pays the local police chief via cash through courier he needs to pay certain negotiated amount over certain profit the high prices of goods in moscow cover these hidden costs sometimes people receive bad protection in the sense that the krysha extorts an excessive amount of money as result they cannot make enough of profit to maintain their businesses if people attempt to forego protection they will instantly be shut down for example officials from the fire or sanitation service will appear at the business and invent violation according to xxxxxxxxxxxx everyone has bought into the idea of protection in moscow so it has become norm in general muscovites have little freedom to speak out against corrupt activities and are afraid of their leaders 13 c xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the mvd and fsb rather than organized crime groups since they not only have more guns resources and power than criminal groups but they are also protected by the law for this reason protection from criminal gangs is longer so high in demand police and mvd collect money from small businesses while the fsb collects from big businesses according to xxxxxxxxxxxx the fsb krysha is allegedly the best protection he told us that while the mvd and fsb both have close links to solntsevo the fsb is the real krysha for solntsevo this system is not an incentive for smaller businesses and nobody is immune even rich people who think they are protected get arrested according to transparency internationals 2009 survey bribery costs russia usd 300 billion year or about 18 percent of its gross domestic product xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that the krysha system has led to an erosion of police internal discipline for instance young police officers spend their money buying luxury vehicles that normal worker could never afford comment 14 s despite medvedevs stated anticorruption campaign the extent of corruption in moscow remains pervasive with mayor luzhkov at the top of the pyramid luzhkov oversees system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behavior putin and medvedevs dilemma is deciding when luzhkov becomes bigger liability than asset while public sentiment against luzhkov has grown since the tainted elections in october 2009 united russias leadership knows that he has been loyal supporter who can deliver voter support ousting luzhkov before he is ready to go could create major difficulties because he could link others in the government to the corruption while reforming luzhkovs questionable activities might seem like the right thing to do for now keeping him in place efficiently running the city is united russias best option ultimately the tandem will put luzhkov out to pasture like it has done with fellow longterm regional leaders like sverdlovsk oblast governor edward rossel and tatarstan president mintimir shaymiyev beyrle
