199 thereby bringing action on the fy2004 regular appropriations acts to close introduction during the first session of the 108th congress the house and senate considered many different budgetary

this report describes house and senate action on major budgetary legislation within the framework of the congressional budget process and other procedural requirements the house and senate began 2003 with unfinished budgetary matters left over from the 107th congress at the start of the 108th congress only two of the 13 regular appropriations acts for fy2003 had been enacted1 the federal agencies

see crs report rl31795 congressional budget actions in 2002 by bill heniff jr crs2 fy2003 regular appropriations acts to close2 in addition during 2003 congress adopted and president bush signed into law two supplemental appropriations measures for fy2003 discussed further below as the fy2004 budget cycle began congress faced an unfavorable budget outlook exacerbated by an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment according to the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo current budget projections under existing law without any legislative changes showed annual deficits in the unified budget ie including federal funds and trust funds in several of the ensuing fiscal years3 when various proposed spending increases and tax cuts were taken into account the projections indicated annual deficits for the foreseeable future for example omb projected that if president bushs fy2004 budget policy proposals were enacted annual unified budget deficits ranging from 178 billion to 307 billion would continue through fy2008 in addition the soft economy continued to put damper on federal revenues also the spending for the war on terrorism and homeland security for military operations in iraq and for other legislative initiatives increased the scarcity of current and future federal government resources such factors potentially could worsen the already unfavorable budget outlook4 overview of the congressional budget process the congressional budget process consists of the consideration and adoption of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation within the framework of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget congress begins its budget process once the president submits his budget the president is required by law to submit comprehensive federal budget later than the first monday in february the presidents budget includes estimates of direct spending and revenues under existing laws as well as requests for discretionary spending ie funds controlled through the appropriations process for the upcoming fiscal year in addition the president frequently proposes new initiatives in his budget submission to congress although congress is not bound by the presidents budget congressional action on spending and revenue legislation often is influenced by his recommendations as well as subsequent budgetary activities by the president 2 for guide to the contents of hjres 2 see crs report rs21433 fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution reference guide by robert keith 3 see omb budget of the us government fiscal year

through fy2008 reflecting changed economic conditions and assumptions and congressional actions5 the congressional budget act cba of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 established the congressional budget process including timetable for congressional action on budget legislation see table 1 the process is centered around the adoption of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at least five fiscal years because the budget resolution is concurrent resolution it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead it is an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing framework for subsequent legislative action on the budget during each congressional session table 1 the congressional budget process timetable date action to be completed first monday in february president submits budget to congress february 15 congressional budget office submits economic and budget outlook report to budget committees six weeks after president committees submit views and estimates to

enactment of revenue and debtlimit legislation appropriations and other spending measures and if required by the budget resolution one or more reconciliation bills see table 2 congress enforces budget resolution policies through points of order on the floor of each chamber and the reconciliation process for example any legislation that would cause the aggregate levels to be violated is prohibited from being considered further the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution are allocated among the house and senate committees having jurisdiction over specific spending legislation any legislation or amendment that would cause these committee allocations to be exceeded is prohibited finally the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their allocations among their respective 13 subcommittees point of order may be raised against any appropriations act or amendment that would cause one of these subdivisions to be exceeded6 the budget resolution also contains spending levels by functional categories eg national defense but these are not enforceable congress also may use reconciliation legislation discussed further below to enforce direct spending revenue and debt limit provisions of budget resolution for fy1991 through fy2002 congress and the president also were constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation7 unlike the enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution which are employed while legislation is considered on the floor of each chamber the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process generally after legislative action for session of congress ended these budget enforcement mechanisms however expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 6 for more detailed information on these points of order and their application see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 7 these constraints were first established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990

spending and revenues within six weeks after the presidents budget submission each house and senate committee is required to submit views and estimates of budget matters under its jurisdiction to its respective budget committee these views and estimates frequently submitted in the form of letter to the chair and ranking minority member of the budget committee typically include comments on the presidents budget proposals and estimates of the budgetary impact of any legislation likely to be considered during the current session of congress the budget committees are not bound by these

budget committee has compiled the views and estimates of house committees as separate committee print serial cp1 the budget resolution was designed to provide framework to make budget decisions leaving specific program determinations to house and senate appropriations committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction in many instances however particular program changes are considered when the budget resolution is formulated program assumptions sometimes are referred to in the reports of the house and senate budget committees and usually are discussed during floor action although these program changes are not binding committees may be strongly influenced by the recommendations when formulating appropriations bills reconciliation measures or other budgetary legislation the house budget committee marked up and voted to report the house version of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 hrept 10837 by vote of 2419 on march 12 during markup the committee

15 as target date for final adoption of the budget resolution15 the cba prohibits the consideration of spending revenue or debtlimit legislation for the upcoming year until the budget resolution has been adopted unless the rule is waived or set aside the house and senate consider the budget resolution under procedures generally intended to expedite final action in the house the budget resolution usually is considered under special rule limiting the time of debate and allowing only few amendments as substitutes to the entire resolution on march 20 the house considered hconres 95 under structured rule hres 151 hrept 10844 reported by the house rules committee the special rule provided that managers amendment in the nature of substitute be considered as adopted and made in order only the four amendments in the nature of substitute printed in the house rules committee report the house passed hres 151 by voice vote during consideration of the fy2004 budget resolution the house rejected the four amendments made in order by the special rule the house subsequently agreed to hconres 95 by 215212 vote on march 2116 15 in years congress is late in adopting or does not adopt budget resolution the house and senate independently may adopt deeming resolution for the purpose of enforcing certain budget levels deeming resolution typically in the form of simple resolution specifies certain budget levels normally contained in the budget resolution including aggregate spending and revenue levels spending allocations to house and senate committees spending allocations to the appropriations committees only or combination of these in some cases an entire budget resolution earlier adopted by one chamber may be deemed to have been passed under deeming resolution the enforcement procedures related to the congressional budget act as discussed below have the force and effect as if congress had adopted budget resolution in 2002 for example in the absence of an agreement on an fy2003 budget resolution with the senate the house adopted resolution deeming the houseadopted fy2003 budget resolution hconres 353 107th congress to have been agreed to by congress the senate did not take any similar action at the beginning of the 108th congress the house agreed to deem the fy2003 budget resolution adopted by the house during the 107th congress hconres 353 to have been adopted by the 108th congress under this deeming resolution the enforcement procedures of the congressional budget act will have the force and effect on budget legislation pertaining to fy2003 and beyond in the house as if the budget resolution had been adopted by congress until congress adopts an fy2004 budget resolution see sec 3a4 of hres 5 adopted on jan 7 2003 also the provision required the house budget committee chair to submit for printing in the congressional record the committee allocations associated with the spending levels contained in hconres 353 and other related budget information in the absence of official committee chair assignments sec 2 of hres 14 adopted by the house on jan 8 2003 provided that rep jim nussle the prospective house budget committee chair

measure hconres 95 as an amendment and agreed to it by unanimous consent17 after resolving the differences between their respective versions the house and senate agreed to the conference report to

considered under special procedures these procedures serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certain amendments and to encourage its completion in timely fashion in the house as with the budget resolution reconciliation legislation usually is considered under special rule establishing the time allotted for debate and what amendments will be in order in the senate the cba provides that debate on budget reconciliation bill and on all amendments debatable motions and appeals is limited to not more than 20 hours after the 20 hours of debate has been reached consideration of amendments motions and appeals may continue but without debate in both chambers the cba requires that amendments to reconciliation legislation be deficit neutral and germane also the cba prohibits the consideration of reconciliation legislation or any amendment to reconciliation bill recommending changes to the social security program finally in the senate section 313 of the cba commonly referred to as the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation bill20 both the house and senate versions of the fy2004 budget resolution provided for reconciliation legislation covering the period fy2003fy2013 the house version agreed to on march 21 2003 provided for two separate reconciliation measures one for tax cuts equal to about 730 billion and the other for mandatory spending cuts equal to about 2645 billion21 the senate version agreed to on march 26 provided for one reconciliation measure for tax cuts equal to 350 billion22 the conference report to hconres 95 agreed to by the house and senate on april 11 provides for one reconciliation measure to be reported by the appropriate committees later than may 823 the reconciliation directives require the house ways and means committee to report legislation reducing revenues by 535 billion and increasing spending by 15 billion for the period fy2003fy2013 and require the senate finance committee to report legislation reducing revenues by 522524 billion and increasing spending by 27476 billion for the period fy2003fy2013 although both directives call for reconciliation legislation equal to 550 billion

economic and technical assumptions and provides an analysis of the potential macroeconomic effects of the presidents budgetary proposals39 these revenue estimates usually differ from the presidents

money the federal government is allowed to borrow generally is subject to statutory limit 31 usc 3101 from time to time congress and the president have enacted legislation to raise this limit42 federal debt consists of debt held by the public plus debt held by government accounts the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover the federal governments budget deficits by contrast the debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special nonnegotiable federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt the combination of both types of debt is subject to the statutory public debt limit therefore budget deficits or trust fund surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit the most recent increase in the publicdebt limit was enacted as an independent measure pl 107199 116 stat 734 in june 2002 the debtlimit measure 40 see httpwwwhousegovjct 41 total level of revenue reductions based on section 1011b

increased the statutory limit by 450 billion to 6400 billion as early as december 2002 the administration indicated that the debt subject to the limit might reach the statutory ceiling in the first half of 200343 most recently treasury secretary snow informed congress that the treasury would reach the debt ceiling on or about may 28 2003 stating the treasury has now taken all prudent and legal steps to avoid reaching the statutory debt limit including reducing the size of our regular bill auctions and drawing down available cash an immediate permanent increase in the debt limit is crucial to preserve the confidence in the us government and to prevent uncertainty that would adversely affect our economic recovery44 pursuant to house rule xxvii upon the adoption of the fy2004 budget resolution the house clerk engrossed and transmitted to the senate joint resolution hjres 51 increasing the public debt limit by 984 billion to 7384 billion house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its author representative richard gephardt provides that upon the adoption of the budget resolution by congress joint resolution specifying the amount of the public debt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is engrossed and deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote on the debtlimit legislation45 hjres 51 was deemed to have been adopted by the house on april 11 by vote of 216211 ie the vote upon which the house agreed to the fy2004 budget resolution the senate has

considers restoring or modifying these budget enforcement mechanisms during 2003 an overview of how they operated is provided below since 1990 the statutory limits had applied to different categories of discretionary spending during some periods discretionary spending was combined into single category at other times it was divided into two or more broad categories such as defense and nondefense spending currently adjustable discretionary spending limits still exist for highway and mass transit spending for fy2003 and conservation spending divided into six subcategories through fy2006 but the sequestration process to enforce them expired on september 30 2002 under the paygo requirement the net effect of new direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year could not cause positive balance reflecting an increase in the onbudget deficit or reduction in the onbudget surplus on multiyear paygo scorecard for each fiscal year this scorecard maintained the balances of the accumulated budgetary effects of laws enacted during the current session and prior years the paygo requirement applied to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covered the effects of such legislation through fy2006 the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced primarily by sequestration which involved automatic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs sequestration was triggered if the omb director estimated in the final sequestration report at the end of session that one or more of the discretionary spending limits would be exceeded or the paygo requirement would be violated withinsession sequestration was possible if supplemental appropriations bill caused the spending levels of the current fiscal year to exceed the statutory limit for particular category the discretionary spending limits as well as paygo requirement similar to the expired statutory one also could have been enforced through points of order while legislation was being considered on the senate floor the house did not provide for similar points of order the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 extended the senate paygo point of order through september 30 2008 under the senate paygo rule point of order may be raised against any direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for the first fiscal year the period of the first five fiscal years or the following five fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution motion to waive this point of order requires vote of threefifths of senators ie 60 senators if there are vacancies table 5 provides the timetable for sequestration actions as indicated omb and cbo were required to publish preview and update sequestration reports to provide congress and the president with advance notice regarding the possibility of sequester if one or both types of sequester were anticipated these reports could have afforded congress and the president enough warning so that they could enact legislation to forestall them only an omb withinsession or final sequestration report could have triggered sequester the cbo sequestration reports were advisory only
