over the last decade or so concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to re examination of longestablished tenet of us citizenship codified in the fourteenth amendment of the us constitution and 301a of the immigration and nationality act ina 8 usc 1401a that person who is born in the united states subject to its jurisdiction is citizen of the united states regardless of the race ethnicity or alienage of the parents the war on terror and the case of yaser esam hamdi ussaudi dual national captured in afghanistan fighting with taliban forces further heightened attention and interest in restricting automatic birthright citizenship after the revelation that hamdi was us citizen by birth in louisiana to parents who were saudi nationals in the united states on nonimmigrant work visas and arguably entitled to rights not available to foreign enemy combatants this report traces the history of this principle under us law and discusses some of the legislation in recent congresses intended to alter it the traditional english commonlaw followed the doctrine of jus soli under which persons born within the dominions of and with allegiance to the english sovereign were subjects of the sovereign regardless of the alienage status of their parents the exceptions to this rule are persons born to diplomats who are born subjects of the sovereign whom the parents represent abroad and persons born to citizens of hostile occupying force who are born subjects of the invading sovereign although the states and courts in the united states apparently adopted the jus soli doctrine there still was confusion about whether persons born in the united states to alien parents were us citizens this arose because citizenship by birth in the united states was not defined in the constitution nor in the federal statutes legal scholars and law makers were torn between consensualist doctrine of citizenship by which person and government consent to be mutually obligated and an ascriptive doctrine by which person is ascribed citizenship by virtue of circumstances beyond his control such as birth within particular territory or birth to parents with particular citizenship additionally africanamericans were not considered citizens of the united states even if they were free native americans also were not considered us citizens because they were members of dependent sovereign indian nations the civil rights act of 1866 and the fourteenth amendment ratified in 1868 extended birthright citizenship to africanamericans but the united states supreme court made clear that although usborn children of aliens were us citizens regardless of the alienage and national origin of their parents native americans still were not us citizens der the terms of those laws native americans were made us citizens by statute in the 110 th congress hr 133 and in the 109th congress hjres 41 hjres 46 hr 698 201 of hr 3700 701 of hr 3938 322 of hr 4313 and title v of s 2117 are among

are two basic doctrines for determining birthright citizenship jus soli is the principle that person acquires citizenship in nation by virtue of his birth in that nation or its territorial possessions 2 jus sanguinis is the principle that person acquires the citizenship of his parents citizenship of the blood3 the english common law tradition prior to the declaration of independence which was the basis of the common law in the original thirteen colonies and which was adopted by most of the states as the precedent for state common law4 followed the jus soli doctrine5 persons born within the dominion of the sovereign and under the protection and ligeance of the sovereign were subjects of the sovereign and citizens of england this included persons born to aliens in amity who owed temporary

occupying force or to diplomats representing another sovereign7 the reason was that the children of hostile occupying force did not owe allegiance to nor were born under the protection of the proper sovereign of the occupied territory the children of diplomats although enjoying the temporary protection of the sovereign while in hisher dominions actually owed allegiance to and had claim to the protection of the sovereign whom their parents represented at the court of the sovereign in whose dominions they were born all civilized nations recognize and assent to the immunity of foreign diplomats from their jurisd iction without which foreign ambassador might not be able to effectively represent the sending sovereign but it would be inconvenient and dangerous to society if private individual aliens did not owe temporary and local allegiance and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country 8 the original framers of the us constitution did not define citizenship of the united states although the constitution required that person have been citizen of the united states for seven years to be representative and for nine years to be senator9 and that person be natural born citizen or citizen at the time of the adoption of the constitution in order to be eligible to be president and therefore vicepresident10 the naturalization act of 1790 and subsequent acts until the civil rights act of 1866 and the ratification of the fourteenth amendment did not define citizenship by birth within the united states11 these naturalization acts specified that only free white persons could be naturalized as result of the absence of any definition in the constitution or federal statutes of us citizenship by birth in the united states citizenship by birth in the united states generally was construed in the context of the english common law12 this provided the frame of reference and definition of citizen ship that the framers of the constitution would have understood and also provided the preindependence precedent for state common laws the acquisition of citizenship by birth and by naturalization in the united states depended on state laws both statutory and common law until the enactment of the naturalization law in 1790 13 the 6 united states v wong kim ark 169 us 649 655668 1898 lynch v clarke 1 sandford ch at 670 calvins case 7 cokes reports 1 821

should note that the determination of us citizenship by naturalization also depended on state laws prior to the enactment of the first federal naturalization act the elec tion of albert gallatin to the us senate in 1793 was successfully challenged on the grounds that he had not been us citizen for nine years as required by the constitution 4 nnals of congress 3rd cong 4755 5762 gales seaton 1849there may be some difference in the pagination between different printings of the same congressional debates covering period of february 2028 1794 he claimed that he had become citizen of either virginia or massachusetts at least nine years before his election but majority of the senate upon an examination of the virginia and massachusetts citizenship laws decided that gallatin had not satisfied the residency of either state prior to moving to pennsylvania where he ultimately settled and was elected to congress he had not been resident in pennsylvania for nine years prior to election this example also illustrates the preconstitution position that us citizenship could not exist without state citizenship which some legal scholars continued to espouse until the civil war alt hough gallatin had resided in the united states for thirteen years he had not satisfied all the requirements for citizenship in the states where he had resided nine years before election gallatin tried to argue inter alia that us citizenship was not dependent on state citizenship laws which had existed before independence because us citizenship depended on allegiance to the new nation and even persons who had been naturalborn citizens of the states were not considered citizens of the united states if they had not shown continued

under the constitution14 clearly established the definition of citizenship by naturalization but congresss silence on the issue of citizenship by birth in the united states caused some confusion and disagreement as to what the appropriate definition was for example some persons rejected the idea that english common law provided the proper rule for citizenship by birth in the united states15 and until the civil war some eminent jurists and legal scholars believed that there was real citizenship of the united states separate from citizenship in state that is person was citizen of state which was part of the union therefore person was citizen of the united states by virtue of his citizenship in state 16 although the english common law at the time of the adoption of the constitution considered person born in the english dominions to alien parents to be an english citizen unless those alien parents fit into the exceptions described above and although american law apparently generally accepted this position there nevertheless appeared to be some uncertainty as to whether persons born in the united states to alien parents were in fact citizens of the united states some scholars ascribe this uncertainty to the desire of americans to embrace both consensualist doctrine of citizenship 17 by which person and government consent to be mutually obligated and an ascriptive doctrine by which person is ascribed citizenship by virtue of circumstances beyond his control such as birth within particular territory or birth to parents with particular citizenship 18 continued

development encyclopedia of the american constitution 258 1986 17 cases arose in the united states through the early nineteenth century concerning the issue of citizenship of natural born state citizens whose allegiance to the united states was in question generally such citizens had left the united states for england or english dominions before or during the revolutionary war and act by them or their home state had affirmed their allegiance to the independent state or the united states factors relevant to this consensual citizenship included whether the person was born before or after july 4 1776 whether the person left for england before or after july 4 1776 whether the person was minor at the time of departure for england whether the person elected to affirm us allegiance upon attaining majority and whether the person was born or residing in territory during its occupation by the british on or after july 4 1776 for example if person was born british subject ie before july 4 1776 and as an adult did not adhere to the independent states after july 4 1776 he remained british subject generally if he was born after july 4 1776 he was us citizen unless he was born in britishoccupied territory left for england as minor and did not elect to affirm his us citizenship within reasonable time after attaining his majority see inglis v sailors snug harbor 28 us 3 peters 99 1830 but see mcilvaine v cox 8 us 4 cranch 208 1808 where the court held that person who joined the british army and left for england still had inheritance rights because initially he had remained in new jersey after july 4 1776 and after new jersey had passed legislation declaring itself an independent and sovereign state and its residents to be citizens of the independent state and thus he had become citizen of independent new jersey see also shanks v dupont 28 us 3 peters 242 1830 holding that woman born in south carolina before july 4 1776 and remaining there afterward was citizen of independent south carolina and her subsequent marriage to british soldier during the occupation of her hometown did not change this status however her subsequent removal to england with her husband in 1782 rendered her british subject within the meaning of the treaty of 1794 whic h recognized inheritance rights for british subjects with property in the united states 18 schuck smith supra footnote

decide the issue of whether the usborn child of an alien was us citizen20 it held that the usborn child of an irish resident of the united states who returned to ireland after the childs birth and died without ever declaring even an intent to be naturalized was us citizen it held that the right of citizenship was national right not pertaining to the individual states21 that state laws could longer define us citizenship22 and that national laws instead determined citizenship23 in determining the appropriate national law the court rejected the consensualist doctrine in favor of the traditional english commonlaw doctrine of jus soli 24 it rejected the argument that the application of the commonlaw doctrine was based on feudal principles inappropriate to the united states which had been founded on the principles of consent between the government and the people to be governed and found instead that the silence of the constitution and the federal statutes indicated that congress approved the adoption of the traditional commonlaw position 25 the court also believed that even if federal laws did not indicate acquiescence in commonlaw doctrine the commonlaw rule provided welldefined unambiguous reliable rule without confusing recourse to the status of the parents26 it held that the national law defined any person born within the dominions and allegiance of the united states as citizen regardless of the status of the parents27 notwithstanding the general acceptance of jus soli in the minds of many persons the issue of automatic citizenship upon birth in the united states to alien parents was still not to be decided definitively for many years particularly where the parents were of minority race or ethnicity until the civil rights act of 1866 and the fourteenth amendment africanamericans were not considered citizens of the united states in the case of dred scott v sandford 28 the united states supreme court held that africanamericans could not be citizens of the united states even if they were free because they were descended from persons brought to the united states as slaves the terms of the constitution demonstrated that slaves were not

although the primary aim was to secure citizensh ip for africanamericans the debates on the citizenship provisions of the civil rights act of 1866 and the fourteenth amendment indicate that they were intended to extend us citizenship to all persons born in the united states and subject to its jurisdiction regardless of race ethnicity or alienage of the parents the civil rights act of 1866 declared that all persons born in the united states and not subject to any foreign power excluding indians not taxed are hereby declared to be citizens of the united states 31 the fourteenth amendment declared that all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside32 the civil rights act of 1866 differs from the fourteenth amendment by using the terms not subject to any foreign power and excluding indians not taxed during the debates on the act senator trumbull of illinois chairman of the committee that reported the civil rights bill moved to amend the bill so that the first sentence read all persons born in the united states and not subject to any foreign power are hereby declared to be citizens of the united states without distinction of color33 senator cowan of pennsylvania who opposed both the civil rights act of 1866 and the fourteenth amendment asked whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of chinese and gypsies born in this country senator trumbull replied undoubtedly the two disagreed as to whether under the law in existence prior to the enactment of the civil rights act of 1866 chineseamericans were citizens of the united states cowan raised the specter of unfettered chinese immigration to california resulting effectively in something tantamount to takeover of california by the chinese empire if the proposed language were adopted trumbull asked cowan whether the children born in pennsylvania to german parents were not us citizens to which cowan replied that germans were not chinese australians or hottentots or the like trumbull replied that the law made distinction between the children of germans and asiatics and the child of an asiatic is just as much citizen as the child of european later in the debates senator johnson of maryland urged senator trumbull to delete the phrase without distinction of color because it was unnecessary since even without the phrase he understood that trumbulls proposed amendment comprehends all persons without any reference to race or color who may be so born trumbull felt that it was better to retain the phrase to eliminate any doubt or dispute as to the meaning of his amendment 34 there was also debate over whether indians should be included or excluded from the citizenship provision35 trumbull believed that if the indians were separated from their tribes and incorporated into the mainstream community then they already were us citizens under the law senator lane of kansas disagreed and felt that more explicit bill was needed to extend citizenship to indians which he favored other senators wished to exclude indians not taxed which apparently was intended to exclude unassimilated indians who were deemed to be mostly living in an uncivilized condition in their tribes36 when the exclusion was adopted senator 31 c 31 1 14 stat 27 32 ratified july 9 1868 33

did not depend on whether or not they were taxed and that it was unfair to make such distinction for indians particularly since the issue of taxation was irrelevant to the issue of assimilation37 during the debates on the fourteenth amendment senator howard of michigan moved to amend it by adding the first sentence in its present form minus the phrase or naturalized38 senator cowan again objected to language that he felt would include races such as the chinese and prevent california from dealing with the massive chinese immigrant population as it saw fit 39 he again invoked the fear that california would be overrun by chinese pennsylvania by gypsies he believed that the people of different races and cultures could not mingle senator conness of california replied that he had supported the civil rights act of 1866 and had problem with constitutionally guaranteeing the usborn children of mongolian parents civil rights and equal protection his support apparently influenced by his belief that the population of noneuropean immigrants and their descendants would not increase significantly 40 there was also debate as to whether indians should be excluded from the scope of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment and whether they were excluded by the phrase subject to the jurisdiction thereof41 apparently most of the senators supported the idea of excluding indians but disagreed as to whether the phrase excluding indians not taxed should be inserted as it had been in the civil rights act of 1866 several senators argued that subject to the jurisdiction meant the full and complete jurisdiction of the united states and the indians had always been considered subject to the jurisdiction of their tribes which were quasi foreign nations 42 some also felt that the taxation requirement was problematic some senators argued that excluding indians not taxed was good enough for the civil rights act so it was appropriate for the fourteenth amendment they also argued that indians were subject to us jurisdiction for variety of purposes so the subject to the jurisdiction language was insufficiently clear 43 ultimately the senate rejected the insertion of excluding indians not taxed although at least one senator said he voted against this insertion because he favored extending citizenship to indians and not because he believed that the subject to the jurisdiction language excluded indians already44 g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561g159g495g561g25g152g151g144g561g13g146g150g561g3g155g148 g561g138g151g141g561

indicate an underlying problem appears to have been the attitude that certain alien races and native americans like the african americans in dred scott could not be members of the american political community because they had not been members of the community that yielded the declaration of independence and the constitution the united states supreme court discussed the congressional debates described above noting that although they were not admissi ble as evidence to control the meaning of the fourteenth amendment they were important as an indication of the contemporaneous legal opinion of jurists and legislators and showed that congress had explicitly considered the application of the fourteenth amendment to the chinese and other usborn children of aliens46 the court traced the history of the statutory and common law regarding jus soli in england and america47 and distinguished another case in which an alleged chineseamerican had been found not to be us citizen noting that the issue had been the insufficiency of proof that the claimant had been born in the united states48 but where birth in the united states was clear child of chinese parents was in the courts opinion definitely citizen under the fourteenth amendment even though chinese aliens were ineligible to naturalize under thenexisting law49 the court rejected the argument that the child was born subject to the jurisdiction of the chinese emperor and outside the jurisdiction of the united states because his allegiance and citizenship derived from his parents remaining subjects to the chinese emperor under treaties between the united states and china and the naturalization laws 50 it noted and rejected the slaughterhouse courts inaccurate statement that the exceptions to jus soli included the children of consuls and other aliens generally in addition to the children of ambassadoriallevel diplomats and the children of hostile occupying forces51 the decision alludes to contemporaneous new jersey case that held that usborn child of scottish parents domiciled but not naturalized in the united states was born subject to the jurisdiction of the united states within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment and not subject to the jurisdiction of foreign country within the meaning of the civil rights act of 186652 the court held that the fourteenth amendment affirmed the traditional jus soli rule including the exceptions of children born to foreign diplomats to hostile occupying forces or on foreign public ships and added new exception of children of indians owing direct allegiance to their tribes53 it further held that the fourteenth amendment has conferred authority upon congress to restrict the effect of birth declared by the constitution to constitute sufficient and complete right to citizenship54 and that it is throughout affirmative 45 169 us 649 1898 46 169 us at 697699 47 169 us at 655675 48 169 us at 696697 49 169 us at 705 50 169 us at 694705 51 169 us

had arisen and not to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship55 even after the civil rights act of 1866 the fourteenth amendment and the wong kim ark decision secured automatic birthright citizenship for all persons born in the us and subject to its jurisdiction native americans were not considered to be fourteenth amendment citizens because the us supreme court determined that they were not born subject to the jurisdiction of the united states following earlier cases that had held that indian tribes and their members were not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and language in the constitution and the civil rights act of 1866 that included only indians not taxed the court in elk v wilkins56 held that indians were not citizens of the united states unless they had been naturalized by treaty or by federal collective naturalization statute or taxed or recognized as citizen by the united states or state at the time of the decision native americans were not eligible to be naturalized on an individual basis according to the usual naturalization procedures and were only naturalized by treaty or statute 57 the court found that native americans who had not been taxed or naturalized still owed immediate allegiance to the tribe and were members of an independent political community and thus were not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and were not citizens of the united states58 the argument echoes those in the debates about the fourteenth amendment john elk had separated from his tribe and lived under the jurisdiction of nebraska and had assimilated into mainstream society despite these facts the court held that he was not us citizen nor could he become one in the absence of treaty or federal statutory action regarding his tribe native americans are still not fourteenth amendment citizens 59 they are citizens by virtue of one of the various statutes and treaties naturalizing specific tribes the citizenship act of 1924 which was ambiguous regarding those born after the act60 the nationality act of 1940 which finally and unambiguously declared all native americans born in the united states to be us citizens61 or the

illegally or to enter legally on nonimmigrant visa then illegally stay beyond the visa period63 these proposals take the form of amendments to the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment or to the immigration and nationality act provisions on birthright citizenship and comprise different approaches64 although such proposals have been introduced in the 109th congress see discussion and footnotes below none of them have progre ssed beyond introduction and none of the major immigration reform bills such as hr 4437 s 2454 or s 2611s 2612 include such provisions65 the proposals for

citizenship under the constitution to persons born to parents both of whom are either citizens or lawful permanent residents doesnt expressly repeal the current citizenship clause67 63 aliens are seen as willing to enter the united states illega lly in order to have child here because they realize that when the uscitizen child reaches hisher majority heshe may bring immediate relatives over to the united states even if the immigration and naturalization service decides to deport the parents or they choose to leave in the interim so the automatic birthright gives illegal aliens foot in th door

united states which is how the ina defines nationals therefore for the sake of clarity proposed language that includes an explicit enumeration of the applicable categories of parentscitizens nationals lawful permanent residents nonimmigrants if any may be preferable to language that only explicitly refers to parents who are legal residents or to citizens without mentioning nationals some proposals focus on the mother as the conduit for birthright citizenship excluding father who is us citizen or legal resident from being the conduit for such citizenship all of these proposals would only apply prospectively to those born after the date of the ratification of an amendment by the legislatures of threefourths of the states within seven years of its submission for ratification and all provide that congress shall have the power to enforce the article by appropriate legislation some of the above proposals to amend the constitution have parallel proposals to amend the ina to conform to the

states as including persons born in the united states to mother or father who is national of the united states this would include citizens and noncitizen nationals or lawful permanent resident who maintains his or her residence in the united states 81 the first two of these proposals would avoid the problem of rendering person stateless by permitting persons born to illegal alien or nonimmigrant mothers to be citizens at birth if they have viable claim to citizenship in another country 82 these two proposals could result in scenario in which person may be born in the united states to mother who is nonimmigrant or illegal alien and father who is us citizen national or lawful permanent resident in or out of wedlock and not be born us citizen because that person has claim to citizenship in the mothers country the third proposal does not permit person born out of wedlock to father who is us citizen national or lawful permanent resident to be considered born subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and does not provide for the acquisition of us citizenship by such person through us citizen father without conforming amendments to 309 of the ina this proposal would mean that persons born abroad out of wedlock to us citizen father and an alien mother would have process by which they could be deemed us citizens at birth and paradoxically persons born in the us of similar parentage would not these proposals are all therefore arguably unconstitutional on due processequal protection grounds as well as citizenship clause grounds 83 the fourth proposal avoids

constitutional issues because it makes distinctions based on the gender of the parent one proposal in the 109th congress without statutorily defining born subject to the jurisdiction of the united

least one of the parents is at the time of birth citizen or national of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 84 final legislative proposal is sui generis it does not purport to be congressional interpretation of the citizenship clause but is limitation on hvisa holders and would be unconstitutional under the citizenship clause under this proposal children born to parent who is an nonimmigrant employee under 101a15h of th ina would not be us citizens by birth in the united states unless the other parent is us citizen or lawful permanent resident85 the legislation discussed above is intended to discourage unlawful entry and presence of aliens in the united states and the anomaly of automatically granting citizenship to persons who despite birth in the united states are not raised and do not act in accordance with allegiance to the united states it may accomplish this but may also throw into question the ultimate status of many born here that is persons whose parents are in the united states initially on temporary visas but ultimately obtain lawful permanent status also the additional recordkeeping necessary to document who becomes citizen automatically upon birth in the united states may present bureaucratic challenges particularly since birth records are matter for state laws

accompanying constitutional amendment because under 5 of the fourteenth amendment congress has the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article in still evolving area of law the united states supreme court has held that congress has some power to define the substance of the rights that are protected under the amendment and may even under some circumstances legislate contrary to judicial decisions by going beyond judicial decisions defining such rights in order to enforce the amendment in katzenbach v morgan 86 the court found that congress could define the substantive scope of equal protection for the purpose of determining whether state laws violate equal protection the court rejected the dissents concern that congress could legislate to dilute the equal protection and due process decisions of the court saying that congress may dopt measures only to enforce fourteenth amendment rights not to restrict abrogate or dilute them87 however congress

expansion of the right against self incrimination and the righttocounsel and expressly relied on katzenbach v morgan although the court contemporaneously with the legislation changed course to adopt view in alignment with that of congress88 congressional abortion opponents have tried to initiate legislation restricting the right that the court has derived from the constitution89 other recent cases show that the court will not always defer to congresss determination as to what legislation is appropriate to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment 90 thus there may be an issue as to whether congress could define subject to the jurisdiction thereof in manner that would curtail longassumed right of persons born to aliens in the united states to be us citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents one could argue that congress has power to define s ubject to the jurisdiction and the terms of citizenship in manner contrary to the courts understanding of the fourteenth amendment as expressed in wong kim ark and elk particularly since that understanding includes holding that the fourteenth amendment did not confer on congress right to restrict the effect of birth on citizenship as declared by the constitution in other words there may be distinction between the existence of right under the fourteenth amendment eg citizenship which depends on the text and judicial interpretation and the implications or scope of the right which is subject to some degree of congressional regulation however since congress has broad power to pass necessary and proper legislation to regulate immigration and naturalization under the constitution art i 8 cls 4 18 91 arguably congress has the power to define subject to the jurisdiction thereof for the purpose of regulating immigration the federal courts arguably support an interpretation of the constitution that would foil those who attempt to gain an immigration advantage by breaking us laws although wong kim ark made distinction between lawfully and unlawfully present alien parents nor between legal resident and nonimmigrant aliens however the wong kim ark court did not have to make such distinctions because wongs parents were legal resident aliens federal appellate courts have upheld the refusal by the immigration and naturalization service ins to stay the deportation of illegal aliens merely on the grounds that they have uscitizen minor children because to do so would be unfairly to grant an advantage to aliens who successfully flouted us immigration laws long enough to have child born in the united states over those aliens who followed the law and would turn the immigration statute on its head 92 although the mere fact of the existence of uscitizen minor children would not be sufficient to prevent the deportation of illegal alien parents extreme hardship to the children caused by the deportation of the parents is factor to be considered in the discretionary suspension of deportation 93 the united states supreme court has 88 constitution annotated supra footnote 86 at 20423 n 1990 89 id at 2044 n 1999 90 id at 20447 91 fiallo v bell 430 us 787 792 1976 mathew v diaz

define extreme hardship under proceedings for the suspension of deportation94 and to deny suspension of deportation and refuse to reopen proceedings for the suspension of deportation even if prima facie case for suspension is demonstrated95 the court held that court could not substitute liberal definition of extreme hardship for narrow one preferred by the attorney general and the ins noting that otherwise any foreign visitor who has fertility money and the ability to stay out of trouble with the police for seven years can change his status from that of tourist or student to that of permanent resident without the inconvenience of immigration quotas this strategy is not fair to those waiting for quota 96 uscitizen child must be twentyone years old to bring alien parents into the united states as immigrants97 federal courts have found that this requirement is meant to prevent wholesale circumvention of the immigration laws by persons who enter the country illegally and promptly have children to avoid deportation 98 and does not violate equal protection by distinguishing between uscitizen children who are minors and those who have attained majority99 the courts apparently have never ruled on the specific issues of whether the nativeborn child of illegal aliens as opposed to the child of lawfully present aliens may be us citizen or whether the nativeborn child of nonimmigrant aliens as opposed to legal resident aliens may be us citizen100 however wong kim ark specifically held that under the fourteenth amendment child born in the united states to parents who at the time of his birth were subjects of the chinese emperor but had permanent domicil sic and residence in the united states101 and were not diplomats of the emperor was born us citizen the holding does not make distinction between illegal and legal presence in the united states but one could argue that the holding is limited to construing the fourteenth amendment in the context of parents who are legal permanent residents however the courts own discussion of the common law doctrine of jus soli and the fourteenth amendment as an affirmation of it indicates that the holding at the least would not be limited to permanent legal residents as opposed to nonimmigrant transient legal aliens 102 and currently accepted law would also weigh against this argument103 also the continued required sevenyear continuous presence in the united states however later cases while acknowledging extreme hardship as statutory factor limited review of the ins discretion to grant suspension of deportation and did not seem to consider sevenyears continuous presence to be significant reduction of any loophole based on uscitizen children see infra notes 9495 and accompanying text

for granted that their usborn children are us citizens in considering whether the existence of or extreme hardship to us citizen minor children should stay the deportation of the parents104 this is true regardless of whether the children were born during the period of any lawful stay by the parents during the period of any unlawful stay or after an ins finding of deportability of the parents however some scholars argue that the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment should not apply to the children of illegal aliens because the problem of illegal aliens did not exist at the time the fourteenth amendment was considered in congress and ratified by the states 105 although the elk decision construed the phrase subject to the jurisdiction thereof the situation of native americans is unique so any interpretation that the usborn children of illegal aliens are not born subject to the jurisdiction of the united states arguably could not rely on the elk decision because of the supreme court interpretations of us citizenship laws and constitutional provisions one could argue that constitutional amendment is necessary to clarify the meaning of subject to the jurisdiction of the united states on the other hand amicus curiae friend of the court briefs submitted by several interested organizations to the us supreme court for consideration during the case of hamdi v rumsfeld106 argued among other things that the supreme court interpretations never contemplated or intended to include the granting of automatic citizenship by birth in the united states to persons whose parents were aliens who entered or stayed in the united states unlawfully or who were transiently present most other jus soli countries have limited citizenship by birth in their territories
