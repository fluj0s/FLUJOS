division november 25 2008 abstract wetland legislative activity in the 110th congress centered broadly on two issues one was on wetlands conservation provisions in the 2008 farm bill which was enacted in june 2008 food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110 246 the new law reauthorizes and increases the acreage enrollment cap in the wetlands reserve program with goal of enrolling 250000 acres annually and extends provisions to enroll up to million acres of wetlands and buﬀers in the conservation reserve program other agricultural conservation programs while lacking explicit wetlands protection provisions are still likely to be beneﬁcial to wetlands the second major area of legislative interest centered on proposals to reverse supreme court rulings that addressed and narrowed the scope of geographic jurisdiction of wetlands regulations under the clean water act this interest arises because federal courts have played key role in interpreting and clarifying the limits of federal jurisdiction to regulate activities that aﬀect wetlands especially since 2001 supreme court ruling in the socalled swancc decision and 2006 ruling in rapanos v united states house and senate

an overview of issues summary the 110th congress like earlier ones consid ered numerous policy topics that involve wetlands few of the topics were new to this congress such as wetlands provisions in the 2008 farm bill pl 110 246 while most were examined but not resolved in earlier congresses such as pplying federal regula tions on private lands wetland loss rates and restorati on and creation accomplishments the 110th congress also considered wetla nd topics at the program level responding to legal decisions and administr ative actions affectin g the jurisdictional boundary limits of the federa l wetland permit pr ogram in the clean water act cwa perhaps the issue receiving the greatest attention was determining which wetlands should be included and excl uded from permit requi rements under the cwas regulatory program as result of supreme court rulings in 2001 in the swancc case that narrowed federal regulatory jurisdiction over certain isolated wetlands and in june 2006 in the rapanoscarabell decision that left the jurisdictional reach of the permit program to be determined on casebycase basis in the 110th congress house and senate committ ees held hearings on legislation intended to reverse the court s rulings hr 2421 s 1870 wetland protection efforts continue to gender intense controversy over issues of science and policy controversial topi cs include the rate and pattern of loss whether all wetlands should be protected in single fashion the effectiveness of the current suite of laws in protecting them and the fact that 75 of remaining us wetlands are located on private lands one reason for these controversies is that wetlands occur in wide variety of physical forms and the numerous values they provide such as wildlife habitat also vary widely in addition th total wetland acreage in the lower 48 states is estimated to have declined from more than 220 million acres three centuries ago to 1077 million acres in 2004 the national polic goal of net loss endorsed by administrations for the past two decades s been reached according to the fish and wildlife service as the rate of loss has been more than offset by net gains through expanded restoration efforts authorized in multiple laws many protection advocates say that net gains do not necessarily acc ount for the changes in quality of the remaining wetlands and many also view federal protecti on efforts as inadequate or uncoordinated others who advocate the righ ts of property owne rs and development interests characterize them as too intrusive numerous state and local wetland programs add to the complex ity of the protection efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483contents introduction 1 w t l n d s s c i n c n d i n f r m t i n 2 w h t i s w t l n d 3 w h t f u n c t i n l v l u s r p r v i

physical ch aracteristics are found throughout the country they are known in different regi ons as swamps marshes fens potholes playa lakes or bogs although these places can differ greatly they all have distinctive plant and animal assemblages b ecause of the wetness of the soil some wetland areas may be continuous ly inundated by water wh ile other areas may not be flooded at all in coastal areas flooding ma occur daily as tides rise and fall prior to the mid1980s federal laws and policies to pr otect wetlands were generally limited to providing habitat for migratory waterfowl especially ducks and geese some laws encouraged destru ction of wetland areas including selected provisions in the federal ta x code public works legisla tion and farm programs since the mid1980s the values of wetlands have been recognized in different ways in numerous national policies and federal laws either encourage wetland protection or prohibit or do not support th eir destruction these laws however do not add up to fully consistent or comp rehensive national approach the central federal regulatory program found in sec tion 404 of the clean water act requires permits for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into many but not all wetland areas however other activities that may adversely affect wetlands do not require permits and some places that scientists define as wetlands are exempt from this permit program because of physical characteris tics or the type of activity that takes place one agricultural program swam pbuster is disincentive program that indirectly protects wetlands by making farmers who drai n wetlands ineligible for federal farm program benefits those who do not receive these benefits 56 of all farmers received federal farm payments of any kind in 2006 have reason to observe the requirements of this program numerous other acquisition protection and restoration programs comple the current federal effort although numerous wetland protection b ills have been introduced in r ecent congresses the most significant new wetlands legislation to be enacted has been in farm bills in 1996 2002 and 2008 during th is period congress also reauthorized several wetlands programs mostly setting higher appr opriations ceilings without making significant shifts in policy the bush administr ation endorsed wetland protection in legislation such as the farm bill and the north american wetlands conservation act reauthoriza tion and at events such as earth day presentations the bush administration also issued guidance on mitigation policies and regulatory program jurisdiction the latter has been controversial see discussion below congress has provided forum in numerous hearings where conflicting interests in wetland issues have been debated these debates encompass disparate scientifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs2 and programmatic questions nd conflicting views of the ro of government where private property is involved broadly sp eaking the conflicts are between environmental interests and wetla nd protection advocates who have been pressing for greater wetlands protection as multiple values have been more widely recognized by improving coordination and consistency among agencies and levels of governments and strengthened programs and others including landowners farm ers and small businessmen who counter that protection efforts have gone too far by aggressively protecting privately owned wet areas that provide few wetland values they have been especially critical of the us army corps of engineers corps and the us environmental protection agency epa asserting that they admin ister the section 404 program in an overzealous and inflexible manner wetland legislative activity in the 110th congress centered broadly on two issues one was on wetlands conservation provisions in the 2008 farm bill which was enacted in june 2008 food conserva tion and energy act of 2008 pl 110 246 the new law reauthorizes and incr eases the acreage enrollment cap in the wetlands reserve program with goal of enrolling 250000 acres annually and extends provisions to enroll up to million acres of wetlands and buffers in the conservation reserve program other agricultural conservation programs while lacking explicit wetlands protection provisions are still likely to be beneficial to wetlands the second major area of legislative in terest centered on proposals to reverse supreme court rulings that addressed and narrowed the scope of geographic jurisdiction of wetlands regula tions under the clean water act this interest arises because federal courts have played key role in interpreting and clarifying the limits of federal jurisdiction to regulate activities that affect wetlands especially since 2001 supreme

wetlands how to cat alogue the rate and pattern of wetland declines and losses as well as restorations and increases and how to assess the importance of wetland changes to broader ecosystems wetlands science has made considerable st rides in developing fu ller and more sophisticated knowledge about many aspects of wetlands in the more than two decades sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs3 1 two places to view some of the changes in scientific knowledge and understanding are through the products of the society of stat wetlands managers h ttpwwwaswm org and the society of wetland scientists httpwwwswsorgprotecting wetlands became general policy goal in federal law and program administration1 two topics where scientific information and wetland protection policies remain inconsistent continue to be should all regulate d wetlands be treat ed equally and if all scientificallydefined wetlands are not covered by the federal regulatory program what subset should be covered and how should such decisions be made while discussion of either question has majo r science elements both are primarily addressed in the section below about the clean wate r act section 404 program what is wetland scientists generally agree that the presence of wetland can be determined by combination of soils plants and hydrol ogy the only definition of wetlands in law in the swampbuster provisions of fa rm legislation pl 99198 and in the emergency wetlands resources act of 1986 pl 99645 lists those three components this definition does not include more specific criteria such as exactly what conditions must be present and for how long thus leaving interpretation to scientists and regulators on casebycase basis controversies are exacerbated when many sites that have those three com ponents and are identified as wetlands by experts either may have wetland characteristics only some portion of the time or may not look like what many people visualize as wetlands also many of these sites have been directly or indirectly modified by human activities that diminish their appearance and their ability to perform wetland functions wetlands currently subject to federal regulation are large subset of all places that members of the scientific commun ity would call wetland these regulated wetlands under the section 404 program disc ussed below are currently identified using technical criteria in wetland delin eation manual issued by the corps in 1987 this manual was prepared jointly and is used by all federal agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this prog ram the

second and slig htly different manual agreed to by the corps and the natural resources conservation service nrcs is used for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands while the agencies try to improve the objectivity and consistency of wetland identification and delineation j udgment continues to play role and can lead to sitespecific controve rsies cases discu ssed below see section 404

recent of several reports by the invent ory over the past 25 years which document wetlands trends at both national and regional scale what functional values are provided by wetlands functional values both ecological nd economic at each wetland depend on its location size and relationship to adj acent land and water areas many of these values have been recognized only recently historically many federal programs encouraged wetlands to be dr ained or altered because they were seen as having little value as wetlands for example flood pr otection programs of the corps and department of agriculture have modified or eliminat ed many flood plain wetlands through alterations of the hydraulichydrologic regime wetland values can include habitat for aquatic bi rds and other animals and plants including numerous threatened and endangered species production of fish and shellfish water storage including mitigating the effects of floods anddroughts water purification recreation timber production food production education and research and open space and aesthetic values usually wetlands provide some combination of these values single wetlands rarely provide all of these values the composite value typically declines when wetlands are altered in ddition the effects of altera tion often extend well beyond the immediate area because wetlands are usually part of larger water system for example conversion of wetlands to urba n uses has increased flood damages this value has received considerable attention as the costs of natural disaster costs mounted since the 1990s how fast are wetlands disappearing and how many acres are left number of reports document recent changes in wetland acres the us fish and wildlife service periodically surveys national net trends in wetland acreage using the national wetlands inventory nwi it has estimated that when european settlers first arrived wetland acreage in the area that would become the 48 states was more than 220 million acres or about 5 of the total land area according to its most recent report issued in 2006 by 2004 to tal wetland acreage was estimated to be 1077 million acres according to data it presented in its most recent survey2 data compiled by the nrcs and the fws in separate surveys and using different methodologies have identified similar trends both show that the annual net loss rate dropped from almost

acr while nrcs using its natural resources inventory of privatelyowned lands estimated that there was an average annual gain of 26000 acres between 1997 and 20023 nrcs cautioned against making precise claims of net increases because of statistical uncertainties some environmentalists caution that the increases identified in the latest fws data are tied to proliferation of sm all shallow ponds rather than natural wetlands in 2002 the bush administration endor sed the concept of nonetloss of wetlands goal declared by presiden t george h w bush in 1988 and also embraced by president clinton to balance wetlands losses and gains in the short term and achieve net gains in the long rm on earth day 2004 president bush announced new national goal moving bey ond nonetloss of ach ieving an overall increase of wetlands4 the goal was to create improve and protect at least three million wetland acres over the next five years in order to increase overall wetland acres and quality by comparison the clinton administration in 1998 announced policies intended to achieve overall wetland increases of 200000 acres per year by 2005 the presidents strategy also ca lled for better trackin g of wetland programs and enhanced local and pr ivate sector collaboration in april 2008 the administration issued report saying that more than 36 million acres of wetlands had been restored protected or improved as part of the presidents program to create improve and protect wetlands since april 2004 and that the number will climb to 45 million acr by the original date set by that program earth day 20095 the report documents gains but not offsetting loses it summarizes accomplishments for each federal wetland conservation program environmental groups criticized the report as presenting an incomplete picture because it fails to mention wetlands lost to agriculture and development numerous shifts in federal polic ies since 1985 and changes in economic conditions as well strongly influence wetla nd loss patterns but the composite effects remain unmeasured beyond these raw numbers there usually is large time lag from the announcement and implementation of changes in policy to collection and release of data that measure how these changes affect loss rates also it is often very difficult to distinguish the role that policy changes play from other factors such as agricultural markets development pressures and land markets further these data only measure acres this may have b een appropriate two decades ago when scientists knew less bout how to measure the specific functions and values found in wetlands by providi ng data limited to number of acres these data provide few insights into changes in their quality as measured by the values they provide which is ofte n determined by factors such as where wetland is located inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs6 watershed and what are the surrounding nd uses nevertheless in his earth day 2004 wetlands announcement discussed above president bush said that as the nation is nearing the goal of nonetloss it is appropriate to move towards policies that will result in net increase of wetland acres and quality selected federal wetlands programs federal program issues include the ad ministration of programs to protect restore or mitigate wetland resources especially the clean water act section 404 program relationships betw een agricultural and regulatory programs whether all wetlands should be treated the same in fe deral programs and which wetlands should be subject to regulation and whether prot ecting wetlands by acres is an effective proxy for protecting wetlands based on the functions they perform and the values they provide in addition private prope rty questions are raised because almost threequarters of the remaining wetlands ar located on private lands some property owners believe that they should be co mpensated when fede ral programs limit how they can use their land and for decisions th at arguably diminish the value of the land the clean water act section 404 program the principal federal program that pr ovides regulatory pr otection for wetlands is found in section 404 of the clean water act cwa its intent is to protect water and adjacent wetland areas from adverse envi ronmental effects due to discharges of dredged or fill material enacted in 1972 section 404 requires landowners or developers to obtain permits from the corps of engineers to carry out activities involving disposal of dredged or fill mate rials into waters of the united states including wetlands the corps has long had regulatory jurisdiction over dredging and filling starting with the river and harbor act of 1899 the corps and epa share responsibility for administering the section 404 program other federal agencies including nrcs fws and nmfs also have roles in this pr ocess in the 1970s legal decisions in key cases led the corps to revise this program to incorporate broad jurisdictional definitions in terms of bot h regulated waters and adj acent wetlands section 404 was last amended in 1977 this judicialregulatoryadministrative evolution of the section 404 program has generally pleased those who view it as critical tool in wetland protection but dismayed others who would prefer more limited corps jurisdiction or who see the expanded regulatory program as intruding on private landuse decisions and treating wetlands of widely varying value similarly underlying this debate is the more general question of whether section 404 is the best approach to federal wetland protection some wetland protection advo cates have proposed that it be replaced or greatly altered first they point out that it go verns only the discharge of dredged or fill material while not regulating other acts that drain flood or otherwise reduce functional values second because of ex emptions provided in 1977 amendments tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs7 6 us army corps of engineers regul atory statistics all permit decisions fy2003 see httpwwwusacearmymilcwcecworeg2003webchartspdfsection 404 major categories of activities are not required to obtain permits these include normal ongoing farming ranching and silvicultural forestry activities further permits generally are not required for activities which drain wetlands only for those that fill wetlands which excludes large number of actions with potential to alter wetlands third in the view of protection advocates the multiple values that wetlands can provide eg fish and wildlife habitat flood c ontrol are not effectively recognized through statutory approach based principally on water quality despite the broad objectives of the clean water act the permitting process the corps regulatory process involves both general permits for actions by private landowners that ar similar in nature and will likely have minor effect on wetlands and individual permits for more significant actions according to the corps it evaluates more than 85000 permit requests annually of those more than 90 are authorized under general permit which can apply regionally or nationwide and is essentially permit by rule meaning the proposed activity is presumed to have minor impact individually and cumulatively most general permits do not require prenotification or prior approval by the corps about 9 of all permits are required to go through the more detailed evaluation for standard individual per mit which may involve comp lex proposals or sensitive environmental issues and can take 180 days or longer for decision less than 03 of permits are deni ed most other individual permits are modified or c onditioned before issuance about 5 of applicati ons are withdrawn prior to permit decision in fy2003 the most recent year for which data are available corpsissued permits authorized activities having total of 21330 acres of wetland impact while those permits required that 43379 acres of wetlands be restore d created or enhanced as mitigation for the authorized losses6 regulatory procedures on individual permits allow for interagency review and comment coordination process that can ge nerate delays and an uncertain outcome especially for environmentally controversial projects ep is the only federal agency having veto power over proposed corps permit epa has used its veto authority fewer than dozen times in the 30plus years since the program began however critics have charged that implied threats of delay by the fws and others practically amount to the same thing reforms during the reagan earlier bush and clinton administrations streamlined certain of thes procedures with the intent of speeding up and clarifying the corps full regulatory program but concerns continue over both process and program goals controversy also surrounded revised regulations issued by epa and the corps in may 2002 which redefine two key terms in the 404 pr ogram fill material and discharge of fill material the agencies said that the revisions were intended to clarify certain confusion in their joint ad ministration of the pr ogram due to previous differences in how the two agencies define d those terms

burden of its regulatory program nationwide permit is form of general permit which authorizes category of activities throughout the nation and is valid only if the conditions applicable to the permit are met these general permits authorize activities that are similar in nature and are judged to cause only minimal adverse effect on the environment individually and cumu latively general permits minimize the burden of the corps regulatory program by authorizing landowners to proceed without having to obtain individual permits in advance the current program has few strong supporters for differing reasons developers say that it is too complex and burdened with arbitrary restrictions environmentalists say that it does not adequa tely protect aquatic resources at issue is whether the program has become so co mplex and expansive that it cannot either protect aquatic resources or provide for fair regulatory system which are its dual objectives nationwide permits are issued for periods of longer than five years and thereafter must be reissued by the corp s on march 12 2007 the corps issued package of nationwide permits replacing t hose that had been in effect since 2002 the 2007 permits establish six new nationwid permits for total of 49 and also revise number of existing permits and ge neral terms and cond itions that apply to all nationwide permits8 citizen groups have filed wsuits seeking to halt the corps use of one of its nationwide permits nwp 21 to authorize type of coal mining practice called mountaintop mining these critics contend that the adverse environmental impacts of activities authorized by nwp 21 are far greater than the minimal adverse effects limits prescribed by the clean water ac t for all nationwide permits in 2004 federal district court in west virginia ruled that nwp 21 violates the cwa by authorizing activities that have more than minimal adverse environmental effects the district courts ruling was overturned on appeal anot

of numerous lawsuits most of which have sought to narrow the geographic sc ope of the regulatory program swancc an issue of longstanding cont roversy is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of sec tion 404 isolated wate rs those that lack permanent surface outlet to downstream waters which are not physically adjacent to navigable surface waters often appear to provide few of the values for which wetlands are protected even if they meet the technical definition of wetland in january 2001 the supreme court ruled on the question of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolated waters and wetlands the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 held that the denial of section 404 permit for disposal on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the cwa the full extent of retraction of the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even more than seven years after the ruling environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry nd landowner groups welcomed the ruling10 policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied and since the 2001 court decision other federal courts have issued number of rulings that have reached varying conclusions some fede ral courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly attorneys for industry and developers say that the courts will remain the primary battleground for cwa jurisdiction questions so long as neither the administration nor congress takes steps to define jurisdiction the governments view on the key ques tion of the scope of cwa jurisdiction in light of swancc and other court rulings came in legal memorandum issued jointly by epa and the corps in january 200311 it provides legal interpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts deci sion thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to tinue in cases where factors other than the presence of migratory birds may exist t hus allowing for ssertion of federal jurisdiction but it calls for more review by higher levels

according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying that th law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of the swancc ruling in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the administration would not pursue rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue nonetheless interest groups on all sides have been cr itical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitutes the main t ool for interpreting the reach of the swancc

swancc decision in february 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to deve lopment of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped

decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases as did f our other dissenting justices14 legal observers suggested that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more casebycase determin ations and continuing litigation there also could be renewed pressu re on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking the senate environment and public works committee held hearing on issues raised by the courts ruling on august 1 2006 members and number of witn esses urged epa and the corps to issue new guidance to clarify the scope of the ruling on june 5 2007 nearly one year after the rapanos ruling epa and the corps did issue guidance to enable their field staffs to make cwa jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision15 according to the guidance the agencies will assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters such as traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands jurisdiction over ot hers such as nonnavigable tributaries that do not typically flow yearround and we tlands adjacent to such tributaries will be determined on casebycase basis to termine if the waters in question have significant nexus with traditional navigable water the guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whet her there is significant nexus the guidance is not intended to increase or decrease cwa ju risdiction and it does not supersede or nullify the january 2003 guidance discu ssed above which addr essed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of swancc in accompanying documents the agencies said that the administration was considering rulemaking in response to the rapanos decision but they noted that developing new rules would take more time than issuing the guidance they also noted that while the guidance provides more clarity for how jurisdictional determinations will be made concerning nonnavigable tributaries and their adjacent wetlands legal challenges to the scope of cwa jurisdiction are likely to continue the guidance was effective immediately but the agencies also solicited public comments for sixmonth period further ch anges could follow after reviewing the public comments the agencies said but changes have been made so far while the issue of how regulatory protection of wetlands is affected by the swancc

and 2006 rulings and by the recent corpsepa guidance bill sponsors argue that the legislation would reaffirm what congress intended when the cwa was enacted in 1972 and what epa and the co rps have subsequen tly been practicing until recently in terms of cwa jurisdiction but critics assert that the legislation would expand federal authority and thus would have unintended but foreseeable consequences that are likel to increase confusion rath er than settle it critics question the constitutionality of the bill ar guing that by including all nonnavigable waters in the jurisdiction of the cwa it exceeds the limits of congresss authority under the commerce clause supporters cont end that the legislation is properly grounded in congresss commerce power in light of the widely differing vi ews of proponents and opponents future prospects for this legislation are uncertai n the bush administration did not take position on any legislation to clarify the scope of waters of the united states protected under the cwa17 one difficulty of legislating changes to the cwa in order to protect wetlands results from the fact that the complex scientific questions about such areas see discussion above w etlands information and science are not easily amenable to precise resolution in law the debate over revising the act highlights the challenges of using the law to do so should all wetlands be treated equally under the section 404 program there is perception that all jurisdictional wetlands are treated equallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs13 regardless of size functions or values in reality this is not the case because the corps general permits do provide acceler ated regulatory decisions for many activities that affect wetlands however this perception has led critics to focus on situations where wetland s little apparent value but the landowners proposal is not approved or the landowner is penalized for altering wetland without federal permit critics believe that one possible solution may be to have tiered approach for regulating wetlands legislation in troduced in past congresses proposed to establish multiple tiers typi cally three from highly va luable wetlands that should receive the greatest protection to the least valuable wetlands where alterations might usually be allowed some states new yor k for example use such an approach for stateregulated wetlands the corps and epa issued guidance to field staff emphasizing the flexibility that currently ex ists in the section 404 program to apply less vigorous permit review to small pr ojects with minor environmental impacts three questions arise 1 what are the implications of implementing classification program 2 how clearly can line separating each wetland category be defined 3 are there regions wher wetlands should be treated differently regarding classification even most we tland protection advocates acknowledge that there are some situations where wetland designation with total protection is not appropriate but they fear that classifica tion for different degrees of protection could be first step toward major erosion in overall wetland protection also these advocates would probably like to see almost all wetlands presumed to be in the highest protection category unless experts can prove an area should receive lesser level of protection while cr itics who view protection effo rts as excessive would seek the reverse locating the boundary line of wetland can be controversial when the line encompasses areas that do not meet the ima ge held by many controversy would likely grow if tiered approach required that lines segment wetland areas on the other hand consistent app lication of an agreedon definition may lead to fewer disputes and result in more timely decisions some states have far more wetlands than others different treatment has been proposed for alaska because bout onethird of the state is designated as wetlands yet very small portion has been converte d legislative proposals have been made to exempt that state from the section 404 program until 1 of its wetlands have been lost some types of wetlands are already treated differently for example playas and prairie potholes have some what different definitions under swampbuster discussed below and the effect is to increase the number of acres that are considered as wetlands this differentia l treatment contributes to questions about federal regulatory consistency on private property agriculture and wetlands national surveys more than two decades ago indicated that agricultural activities had been responsible for about 80 of wetland loss in the preceding decades making this topic focus for policymakers seeking to protect the remaining wetlands congress responded by creatin g programs in farm legi slation starting in 1985 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33483crs14 18 see httpwwwnrcsusdagovtec hnicalnri2003nri 03wetlandshtmlconservation programs in the farm bill use both disincentives and incentives to encourage landowners to protect and restore wetlands swampbuster and the wetlands reserve program are the two largest efforts but others such as the conservation reserve progra ms wetland and buffer acres pilot program and the conservation reserve enhancement progra m are also being used to protect wetlands the 110th congress enacted legislation to reauthorize farm programs through 2012 food conservation and ener gy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill authorized new programs that could further assist wetlands conservation the most recent wetla nd loss

agency warns that statistical uncertainties preclude concluding with certainty that gain is actually occurring wetlands were major topic of discussion in debate on the 2008 farm bill members of the farm community have expressed wide range of views about wetland protection from strong oppos ition to strong support these views are frequently framed in the context of two general concerns bout wetland protection efforts first as philosophical matter some object to federal regulation of private lands regardless of the societal values those lands might provide second many farmers want certainty and predictability about the nd they farm to limit their financial risk therefore if wetlands are located on property that they farm they want assurances that the boundary line delineating wetlands will remain where located for as long as possible swampbuster swampbuster enacted in 1985 us disincentives rather than regulations to protect wetlands on agricultural lands it removes farmers eligibility from all government price and income support programs for activities such as draining dredging filling leveling or otherwise altering wetland swampbuster has been controversial with farmers c oncerned about redefi ning an appropriate federal role in wetland prot ection on agricultural lands and with wetland protection advocates concerned about inadequate forcement since 1995 the nrcs has made wetland determinations only in response to requests because of uncertainty over whether changes in regulation or law would modify boundaries that have already been delineated nrcs has timated that more than 26 million wetland determinations have been made and that more than 4 million may eventually be required swampbuster amendments in 1996 pl 104127 granted producers greater flexibility by making changes such as exempting swampbuster penalties when wetlands are voluntarily restor ed providing that prior c onverted wetlands are not to be considered abandoned if they remain in agricultural use and granting goodfaith exemptions they also encourage mitiga tion established mitigation banking pilot program and repealed required consulta tion with the fws amendments enacted

easements have been perfected on 137 million of those acres majority of the easements are in three states louisiana mississippi and arkansas most of the land is enrolled under permanent easements wh ile only about 10 is enrolled under 10 year restoration agreements according to data supplied by n rcs in support of its fy2007 budget request prior to the 2002 fa rm bill farmer interest had exceeded available funding which may help to ex plain why congress raised the enrollment ceiling in that legislation the 2008 farm bill increased the wrp maximum enrollment cap from 2275 million acres to 3014 million acres and expande d eligible lands to include certain types of private and tribal wetlands croplands and grassl ands as well as lands that meet the habitat needs of wildlife species the bill made certain program changes including specifying criteria for ranking program applications and requiring usda to submit report to congress on long term conservation easements under the program the legislation authorized new wetlands reserve enhancement program which will allow usda to enter into agreements with states in order to leverage federal funds for wetlands protection and enhancement the 2002 farm bill expanded the 500000acr wetland and buffer acreage pilot program within the conservation rese rve program crp to 1millionacre program available nationwide crp allows producers to enter into 10 to 15year contracts to install certain conservation practices th 2008 farm bill amended the pilot program to increase the amount of acreage that states can enroll up to 100000 acres or national maximum of one million acres participants must agree to restore wetland hydrology establish appropriate vegetation and refrain from commercial use of the land the wetland and buffer program may become more important to overall protection efforts in the wake of the swancc decision discussed above whic h limited the reach of the sec tion 404 permit program to many small wetlands that are isolated from na vigable waterways through september 2006 more than 166000 acres had been enrolled in this program through more than 10000 contracts with about 70000 of those acres in iowa in august

including the environmental quality incentives program eqip the farmland protection program and the wildlife habitat incentive program in ways that may have incidental pr otection benefits for wetlands because of higher funding levels or because of program changes for example eqip supports the installation or implementation of structural and ma nagement practices and the 2008 farm bill expanded the program to include practi ces that enhance wetlands finally some programs could less direc tly help protect wetlands including the conservation security program renamed the conservation stewardshi p program which provides payments to install and maintain practices on agricultural lands the new agricultural water enhancement program replacing the previous ground and surface water conservation program it is f unded through eqip which is designed to address water quality and quantity concerns on agricultural land and several other programs to better manage water resources19 agricultural wetlands and the section 404 program the cwa section 404 program applies to qualified wetlands in all locations including agricultural lands but the corps and epa exempt prior converted lands wetlands modified for agricultural purposes before 1985 from section 404 permit requirements under memorandum of ag reement moa and since 1977 the clean water act has exempted normal farming activities the supreme courts swancc decision apparently exempts certa in isolated wetlands from corps jurisdiction nrcs estimate d that about 8 million acres in agricultural locations might be exempted by this decision while these exemptions and the moa displease some protection advocates they have probably dampened some of the criticism from farming interests over federal regulation of private lands on the other hand the prospect that congress might enact legislation to reverse th courts 2001 and 2006 rulings discussed above has particularly armed farm groups who fear that changes in law or regulations could negatively affect their activities the corps and nrcs have been unsuccessful in revising the moa si nce 1996 despite decade of negotiation although they signed very general part nership agreement on july 7 2005 some of the wetlands that fall outside section 404 requirements as result of judicial decisions can now be protected if landowners decide to enroll them into the revised farmable wetlands program or under other new initiatives private property rights and landowner compensation an estimated 74 of all re maining wetlands in the coterminous states are on private

topic the bush administration did not state an official position on these types of proposals21 wetland restoration and mitigation federal wetland policies during the past decade have increasingly emphasized restoration of wetland areas much of this restoration occurs as part of efforts to mitigate the loss of wetlands at other sites the mitigation concept has broad appeal but implementation has left conflicting record examination of this record presented in june 2001 report from the national research c ouncil found it to be wanting the nrc report said that mitigation projects called for in permits affecting wetlands were not meeting the federal gove rnments net loss policy goal for wetlands function22 likewise 2001 gao report criticized the ability of the corps to track the impact of projects under its cu rrent mitigation program that allows in lieufee mitigation projects in exchange for issuing permits allowing wetlands development23 both scientists and policymakers debate

responsibilities epa and the corps outlines sequence of three steps leading to mitigation first activities in wetlands should be avoided when possible second when they can not be avoide d impacts should be minimized and third where minimum impacts are still unacceptable mitigation is appropria it directs that mitigated wetland acreage be repl aced on oneforone functional basis therefore mitigation may be required as condition of section 404 permit some wetland protection advocates are critical of mitigation which they view as justifying destruction of wetlands they believe that the
