brazil declines guantanamo migrants ref 04 state 305348 b 04 state 139422 c 04 brasilia 633 d state 86436 classified by poloff bisola ojikutu for reasons 14 b and d 1 u on may 20 poloff delivered reftel and talking points to brazils ministry of external relations mre international organizations division doi and the human rights divisions ddh poloff also delivered reftel talking points to unhcr representative in brasilia luis varese poloffs requests for meeting with the brazilian national committee for refugees conare were refused because conares position has not changed since reftels through d 2 c officials from ddh doi and unhcr confirmed that the gobs position regarding this issue has not changed since 2003 and will likely not change in the foreseeable future the gob still contends that it cannot accept guantanamo migrants because it is illegal to designate someone not on brazilian soil refugee despite multiple requests poloff did not receive response regarding the usgs offer to pay for transportation for gob resettlement officials to travel to guantanamo comment based upon brazilian legislation and conares strong stance against the usgs proposal poloff does not believe that the gob will accept this arrangement end comment 3 c ddh office director marcia ramos told poloff that the gobs close relationship with the cuban government would make it impossible for the gob to accept cuban refugees when poloff asked if the gob would consider accepting haitian migrants only ramos said that due to brazilian legislation the gob could not accept any migrants from guantanamo bay 4 c unhcr representative luis varese was more forthcoming in providing concrete answers to explain the gobs position note varese is conare member and has one vote on the board end note varese told poloff that refugee status in brazil is usually granted after the refugee has been recognized by the host country in this case the us according to varese the gob and conare believe that the migrants at guantanamo bay do not fit into this category because the usg has not formally recognized them as refugees if they were formally recognized conare believes the usg would allow them to resettle in the us so resettlement would not be an issue varese told poloff that the formal recognition issue caused the gob to reject the usgs proposal in 2003 he also told poloff that conares position would probably not change in the future comment 5 c all attempts to discuss this issue with gob and conare officials were flatly refused or accepted begrudgingly in addition this issue has been raised on numerous occasions and at variety of levels including us grossman since 2003 given brazilian legislation and vareses comments it does not appear that conare or the gob will change their position on this issue danilovich
