have focused on preservation of global nonproliferation regimes and related efforts prevention of an arms race in south asia and movement toward reconciliation between india and pakistan especially on their mutual differences over the area of kashmir the benchmarks which provide framework for us policy in this area encompass key aspects of nonproliferation efforts progress toward stated goals has been limited neither india nor pakistan is signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation or comprehensive test ban treaties and there are indications that both are continuing to produce fissile materials and perhaps even deploy nuclear weapons the 1999 kargil conflict had the effect of suspending the socalled lahore process of reconciliation begun in february of that year the october 1999 military coup in pakistan and the november 1999 political victory of the hindu nationalist party in india brought renewed fears of further conflict in the region but the governments of both countries have thus far maintained fairly moderate external policies there remain confirmed reports of the actual deployment of nuclear weapons by india or pakistan but both governments have indicated that their militaries are prepared to make use of such weapons in august 1999 quasigovernmental indian body released draft nuclear doctrine for india this document calls for minimum credible deterrent mcd based upon triad of delivery systems and pledges that india will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in conflict it has been neither accepted nor rejected by new delhi islamabad has made comparable public declaration but it also seeks to maintain an mcd while rejecting nofirstuse pledge some observers consider the current situation of territorial contiguity and weak command and control structures in south asia to be inherently unstable others believe that in the absence of increased regional tensions strategic stability will continue to be present given chinas strategic complacency in relation to india and pakistans largely reactive posture new delhis nuclear deployment decisions are perhaps key to regional stability at present strategic economic and technological factors indicate that the growth of south asian nuclear and missile forces likely will continue to be limited in the foreseeable future in pursuit of its stated policy goals the us government may employ four broad approaches to proliferation in south asia each with its own potential strengths and weaknesses these are increased pressure to compel greater cooperation continuation of the approach currentl in

their attentions on the evolving relationship between the united states and the peoples republic of china prc less frequently addressed are the security orientati ons of south asias nuclear powers issues of nuclear proliferation on the indian subcontinent have major implications for both us and global security the region is by most accounts the worlds most dangerous nuclear flashpoint and the use or even largescale deployment of nuclear weapons there would drastically alter global attitudes toward proliferation and could result in tragedy of immense proportions ten years after the cold wars end us relations with india and pakistan are in state of flux as the power of both china and india increases the strategic orientations of these two vast nations and the triangular relationship with nuclear armed pakistan are likewise still being formed the new configurations that arise will be central to asian stability or the lack thereof and the means by which the united states wields its currently preponderant power could strongly influence both the tone and substance of asias security dialogue in the new century this report reviews recent developments relevant to south asian nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation and then summarizes opensource reports on the nuclear capabilities of india and pakistan following section discusses possible deterrence models for south asia finally four broad avenues for us policy are introduced and briefly evaluated the united states government has maintained policy of nonproliferation in south asia policy which seeks to cap or even roll back the regions nuclear forces and their delivery systems possible policy options for the united states congress include those which either increase pressure in seeking to compel greater cooperation on nonproliferation continue the approach currently in place increase incentives to encourage greater cooperation andor provide technological assistance to one or both countries with the goal of allowing for better managed and therefore safer nuclear arsenals and more stable security dynamics in the regionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30623crs2 1 for review of the ctbt and its current

the united states security focus in south asia has sought to minimize damage to the nonproliferation regime prevent escalation of an arms andor missile race and promote indopakistani bilateral dialogue especially on the sovereignty dispute over kashmir and adjacent areas in light of these goals the clinton administration has set forward five key benchmarks for india and pakistan based on the contents of security council res 1172 june 1998 which condemned the two countries nuclear tests these are signing and ratifying the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt1 halting all further production of fissile material and participating in fissile material cutoff treaty fmct negotiations2 limiting development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction wmd delivery vehicles implementing strict export controls on sensitive wmd materials and technologies establishing bilateral dialogue between india and pakistan to discuss their mutual differences progress in each of these areas has been limited neither india nor pakistan has signed the ctbt and both appear to be continuing their production of weapons grade fissile materials the status of weaponization and deployment is unclear but there are indications that this is occurring at more or less steady pace positive area is that of export controls fears that these countries especially pakistan might seek to export nuclear materials andor technologies have proven unfounded thus far3 while there has been repeat of the intense military clashes of summer 1999 tensions in kashmir remain high and bilateral dialogue

held regular meetings with indias minister of external affairs and these talks have involved similar prodding on issues of nonproliferation president clinton traveled to the south asia in march 2000 visiting numerous sites in india over period of six days and spending six hours in pakistan the trip included an address to the indian parliament and nationally televised address to the people of pakistan though economic issues topped the list of priorities nuclear proliferation and regional stability were also covered with the president urging both countries to adhere to the nonproliferation benchmarks and exercise mutual restraint the visit produced joint statement by president clinton and indian prime minister vajpayee reaffirming their commitment to voluntary nuclear testing moratoria and pledging indias continued work toward stricter export controls and negotiation on the fmct10 other than this concrete progress on the nonproliferation benchmarks was made during the trip the

of kashmir14 in response to the fighting the house international relations committee considered condemning pakistan for its support of an armed incursion across the line of control meeting of pakistans thenprime minister nawaz sharif and president clinton produced the socalled washington declaration to end hostilities and within two weeks the two countries forces had disengaged15 perhaps the most important effect of the 1999 kargil conflict was to severely undermine key assumption of classical deterrence theorists that nucleararmed countries do not go to war with one another president clintons senior arms control advisor opined that pakistan concluded or may have concluded that its nuclear capacity made it less vulnerable in convention context and therefore enabled conventional conflict in kargil16 the crisis also suspended the socalled lahore process of reconciliation between india and pakistan begun in february 1999 when the indian prime minister traveled by bus across the international border and into pakistan too there is reason to believe that perceived shortcomings with indian military hardware at kargil were behind the large boost in indias defense budget earlier

pakistani relations with terrorist groups also reemerged the overthrow of democrati cally elected government led to widespread international condemnation of pakistan as well as its suspension from the british commonwealth the pakistani supreme court has ruled that democracy must be restored within three years gen musharraf has promised to abide by the ruling and has met with leaders of the major

within its territory but the areas of cooperation are real and we are still in the game to make more progress25 islamabad maintains diplomatic relations with afghanistans taliban regime and it is

of an indian airlines passenger jet carrying 189 people from katmandu to new delhi and demanded the release of some militants involved in the kashmiri insurgency who were imprisoned in india after peaceful end to the drama one passenger was killed during the standoff the indian government claimed to have irrefutable evidence that pakistani intelligence services were involved in the hijacking and it demanded that pakistan be labeled terrorist state islamabad denied the charges the united states has reportedly determined that terrorist group that has received pakistani government backing was responsible for the hijacking but stopped short of blaming pakistan itself in the wake of the hijacking and the 1999 kargil conflict indo pakistani relations plummeted to their lowest level in recent times33 debate over regional nuclear andor missile race the unofficial status of both india and pakistan as nuclear weapons states coupled with the countries animosity makes discussion of their relative capabilities in this arena an inherently delicate undertaking the us state department suggests that speculation on the size and capabilities of south asian nuclear arsenals can in itself be potentially destabilizing34 other observers argue that coherent if approximate understanding of the status of south asian nuclear arsenals and of the intentions of their owners is essential for effective united states security planning in the first decade of the new century both indian and pakistani government officials express desire to avoid engaging in costly and potentially disastrous arms race yet director of central intelligence george tenet has stated that both india and pakistan are developing more advanced nuclear weapons and moving towards deployment of significant nuclear arsenals similarly the assistant secretary of state for south asia recently expressed concern that we are seeing the dawn of dangerous and expensive arms race in the region the leadership of both

means only to maintain deterrent capability and will not seek to match india in missile production37 in either case overt nuclear weaponization by either side most especially of their shortrange ballistic missiles srbms could be highly destabilizing especially if significant nuclear missile forces are deployed in the absence of secure command and control c2 structures if these forces are perceived as being vulnerable to attack then one or both sides might adopt launchonwarning status38 according to 1997 pentagon report pakistani and indian pursuit of ballistic missiles is largely driven by the perception that these missiles are necessary to counter their rivals capabilities indias development of mediumrange ballistic missiles mrbms also is motivated by its desire to be recognized as great power and strategic competitor with china39 one of the more dangerous scenarios is that in which india actively seeks to gain nuclear parity with china by building larger nuclear arsenal and longrange delivery force moreover some observers suggest that united states deployment of theater missile defense tmd systems in asia or national system covering us territory nmd could

face internal security problems that may in some ways be more threatening to regional stability than are bilateral animosities such regional instability could itself increase the chances of nuclear war moreover some analysts assert that an externallyoriented explanation of nuclear weapons proliferation overlooks more fundamental political and nationalist motivators that make attaining such weapons seem short cut to great status for otherwise struggling states45 as such arsenal size and doctrinal intent are shaped by internal as well as external considerations both india and pakistan

triad of aircraft mobile landbased missiles and seabased assets india will not be the first to initiate nuclear strike while india is committed to maintain the deployment of deterrent which is both minimum and credible it will not accept any restraints on building its rd capability71 the dnd has been neither approved nor rejected by the indian government the document may be politicallymotivated end in itself some analysts even view it as wish list of the more hardline factions of indias political elite72 in some ways the indian government seems to have dissociated itself from the document73 yet its existence as public declaration has caused much debate particularly on its firstuse pledge the claim that india will build nuclear triad and the envisaging of retaliatory capability of potentially massive proportions moreover the dnd has done much to erode hopes that south asian deterrence might remain in non weaponized form74 political rather than military motivators appear to be

ability to tube launch nucleararmed missiles from submarines suggests plans to deploy survivable retaliatory force80 this pursuit combined with new delhis bluewater naval ambitions indicates that

existence and planners are not fully confident that despite pakistans impressive forces fullscale conventional war could be survived109 thus whereas indias nuclear program has been driven largely by scientific and political factors pakistans progress has been spurred most centrally by militarysecurity concerns especially after its conventional capabilities declined in the wake of 1990 us sanctions110 in october 1990 us aid and arms sales to pakistan were suspended when president bush could not certify to congress as required under section 620ee of the foreign assistance act the socalled pressler amendment that pakistan does not possess nuclear explosive device pakistans civilian political leaders have traditionally played only marginal role in the countrys nuclear decision making111 the pakistani leadership both civilian and military has emphatically rejected nofirstuse pledge and suggest that pakistan would consider using nuclear weapons first if attacked by conventional forces112 this is not unexpected from the party seen to be at numerical disadvantage in conventional forces usnato nuclear policy similarly avoids such pledge because pakistan has fears about losing air superiority quickly in war ballistic missiles potentially nucleararmed may have greater appeal in islamabad than in new delhi and so considerable resources have been devoted to the creation of robust missile force deterrence models debate over the proliferation of nuclear weapons is generally divided into two camps optimists and pessimists113 proliferation optimists operate under the logic of deterrence wherein the possession of nuclear weapons by both sides of an adversarial interstate relationship can be expected to produce stability put simply mutual deterrence

introduction of more nuclear weapons will significantly increase the likelihood that these weapons will be used115 as regards south asia these analysts point to geographic proximity pakistans lack of strategic depth short warning times poor command and control structures and historic animosity as reasons to vigorously oppose nuclear weapons and missile proliferation it appears that indias strategic decision making is key factor is shaping stability in south asia china seems content with its existing deterrent against india and pakistans limited resources would seem to constrain its ability to initiate an indo pakistani arms race116 thus one of the most important variables in the future evolution of south asian nuclear proliferation is indias strategic intention in relation to china indias defeat in 1962 border war and chinas first nuclear test two years later were central motivators for the accelerated development of indias own nuclear capability117 today the key question is whether india will seek to more closely match prc capabilities or short of that to develop the ability to target nuclear weapons on chinas eastern population centers as way of ensuring that any chinese conventional incursion would hold the threat of being painful for beijing the deployment of agni missiles aimed at china may spur beijing to retarget its nuclear forces to the south and likewise move islamabad to seek some form of parity in this arena thus setting in motion fullblown arms race on the asian subcontinent118 strategic rivalry between india and china may well be the primary focus of asian security analysts in the new century119httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30623crs25 119 continued see also us department of defense asia 2025 1999 summer study final report aug 4 1999

review jan 2000 124 gregory giles and james doyle indian and pakistani views on nuclear deterrence continuedmany analysts believe that effective nuclear deterrence or crisis stability requires the existence of credible retaliatory capability the ability to withstand full scale conventional or nuclear attack and respond with massive force120 the most dangerous situation is that in which one side believes it can attack and destroy the others nuclear forces thus so long as india and pakistan appear to be engaged in countervalue rather than counterforce targeting nuclear dynamics may remain relatively stable if either side fears that its nuclear forces could be lost in preemptive attack crisis instability may increase drastically strategic stability condition in which daytoday expectations of war are low cannot be said to exist between india and pakistan although it does between india and china some analysts doubt that the indopakistani relationship will attain crisis stability in the nearterm121 other observers claim that limited form of deterrence such as that currently practiced by china can be effective even without completely reliable and prompt retaliatory capability122 this view rests on the assumption that bolt from the blue counterforce strikes are extremely unlikely and that even limited nuclear forces can create sufficient uncertainty to deter wouldbe aggressor123 most indian planners have conceived of minimum credible deterrence mcd as significantly scaleddown form of the massive urbanindustr ial retaliation envisaged under the us nuclear

constructed with only modest arsenal of 150 weapons highend estimate claims that even in low risk situation such as currently exists an indian deterrent will require 400500 warheads125 at the time of pakistans nuclear tests that countrys leading scientists were reported to believe that credible nuclear deterrent capability against india could be achieved with 6070 warheads others claim that viable pakistani nuclear posture could employ as few as 20 warheads126 pakistans military leaders are likely aware that the country lacks the economic and technological resources required for fullscale nuclear weaponization and deployment especially if in direct competition with india127 given that pakistani nuclear strategy is made solely in relation to india continued reliance on aircraft as delivery systems can serve the purpose of deterrence while all of pakistans major cities are within range of indian shortrange missiles the pakistani srbm force cannot target most of indias population centers128 however one pakistani military analyst asserts that because nuclear weapons are absolute weapons pakistan need not match india bomb for bomb and missile for missile but rather can take posture based on the assumption of onerungescalation ladder129 pakistans perceived conventional disadvantage causes its strategists to both reject nofirstuse pledge and to consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons to repulse hypothetical indian armored thrust perhaps even by detonating such weapons over pakistani territory130 some analysts believe it unlikely that india and pakistan will settle for postures of minimum deterrence as currently conceived131 if the two countries do choose to deploy more sophisticated forms of deterrence than they currently possess they will have to consider

require that india and pakistan both develop nuclear triad but such forces are quite expensive to deploy and neither country is likely to have the resources to do so for the foreseeable future moreover advanced western nuclear doctrines based on warfighting or mutually assured destruction are widely discredited in south asia and especially in india133 thus many analysts believe in the near and middleterm both countries are likely to settle for minimum credible deterrent nuclear forces despite indias numerical advantage of two or threetoone in conventional land air and sea forces pakistans operational strengths may provide sufficient advantages to produce nearparity in conventional forces overall134 in this context recent indian military procurement including inflight refueling and advanced fighter aircraft may be viewed in islamabad as attempts by new delhi to gain qualitative as well as quantitative edge in conventional capabilities135 moreover the indian government aspires to regional if not global major power status with the national security advisor to indias prime minister claiming that india must ensure stability in region extending from saudi arabia to the philippines136 increased muscle flexing on the part of new delhi might combine with perceived erosion of pakistans conventional deterrent to encourage both beijing and islamabad to enlarge their nuclear arsenals india is currently in pursuit of eye in the sky intelligence that could allow new delhi to keep closer tabs on pakistans nuclear facilities and even the movement of its strategic forces137 such capabilities if unmatched by pakistan could engender use it or lose it mentality in islamabad during crisis perhaps even more destabilizing are indias ongoing efforts to

complement an indian abm system138 viable indian theater missile defense would almost certainly cause the pakistanis to doubt the credibility of its nuclear deterrent and perhaps respond with major effort to bolster its missile forces while it is commonly assumed that the nuclear doctrines of the united states soviet union and other nuclear weapons states were conceived in advance of procurement decisions this was not always the case more often doctrine derived from rather than determined capabilities and it is claimed that although both india and pakistan seek to give different impression they still give the appearance of countries stumbling into futures that they do not know and may be unable to control139 this view suggests that the future evolution of nuclear forces and doctrines in south asia will continue to be driven in large part by political concerns rather than by militarysecurity assessments of need when economic and technological constraints are factored in it is unlikely that south asian nuclear forces will grow at anything more than limited pace in the foreseeable future thus despite apparent efforts to develop nuclear weapons both countries seem to be seeking only moderate nuclear forces policy options as noted above us security interests in south asia focus on preserving the nuclear nonproliferation regime maintaining regional stability and improving relations between india and pakistan as indications of possible nuclear deployments arise hopes that south asian proliferation might be capped or even rolled back correspondingly fade each of the key

broadly conceived avenues 1 increased pressure on the indian and pakistani governments mainly in the form of economic sanctions 2 continuation of the current approach based on the five benchmarks 3 increased incentives for india and pakistan or 4 the provision of various forms of technological assistance in the area of nuclear safety andor strategy in exchange for increased stability and perhaps greater cooperation in nonproliferation efforts us policy also could combine the aspects of two or more of these approaches increased pressure senior state department official stated in june 2000 that there has been little progress on nonproliferation since the may 1998 tests noting that current efforts to have pakistan sign the ctbt are stalled and that movement on other benchmark issues has been limited this seems to bear out predictions that the postkargil political and security environment would preclude the establishment of any sort of strategic restraint regime for south asia141 given this lack of progres s toward stated us goals there are those who recommend restoring or even strengthening economic sanctions aimed at india and pakistan in an effort to compel the cooperation of their governments142 indias self sufficient economy is less vulnerable to economic sanctions than that of pakistan but the indian economy was measurably and adversely affected by us sanctions in the wake of the 1998 tests more significant were the effects on pakistan where the economy is heavily dependent on the international monetary fund and other international financial institutions the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of us economic sanctions is closely related to the expectation that they will be enforced in this respect reimposition and strict enforcement of some or all of those sanctions applied in 1998 would raise the cost to india and pakistan of further proliferation activities some believe targeted sanctions policy could be especially effective143 weighing against such

2000sanctions in general rarely produce the desired results and may even be counterproductive the congress has been hesitant to maintain sanctions as means of either punishing or coercing india and pakistan or even as way to send more general message about proliferation there are also fears that punitive approach toward pakistan may push that country toward islamic radicalism development which could have calamitous consequences during the period that sanctions were in place there was little evidence that they altered the proliferation behavior of either country and few analysts make the claim that washingtons nuclearrelated sanctions have worked144 one opinion offers that amount of us pressure is likely to alter the pakistani governments present course145 moreover and in india especially us efforts perceived as punishment of india and pakistan and seeking to discourage the establishment of south asian nuclear deterrence forces are often attributed to racism146 regardless under current us law any further nuclear tests by either india or pakistan will require that the president impose new sanctions unless congress passes joint resolution allowing him to selectively withdraw from such action continuity the united states remains categorically opposed to nuclear status for india or pakistan and will allow provisions in the npt for new nuclear weapons states on recent trip to south asia senior us diplomat stated that the commitments of both india and pakistan to refrain from testing should remain in place and he encouraged both countries to sign the ctbt147 many analysts believe that continuation of current us policy based on steady diplomatic pressure for adherence to the five benchmarks is the most pragmatic means of forwarding us interests and that india and pakistan will respond incrementally over time148 while us policy may not have prevented the introduction of nuclear weapons on the subcontinent it is seen by some to have significantly

indications that one or both may accede to the ctbt in the near future with the indian prime minister predicting national consensus by the end of the year and the pakistani foreign minister pledging that pakistan will not test in the absence of further indian action150 such accession especially by both south asian parties would be widely regarded as validation of current us policy by the same token resumption of testing andor continued fissile material production or missile proliferation would erode confidence in the present us course others see reason to be pessimistic regarding indian and pakistani accession to the ctbt any time soon pentagon official predicts that both india and pakistan are likely to conduct one more round of nuclear tests each before signing the treaty the senates 1999 rejection of the ctbt has led many in new delhi to label it dead issue and indias opposition congress party may withhold support for that countrys accession in islamabad government officials indicate that pakistan will not sign the ctbt unilaterally and that the treaty is not an urgent issue151 with regard to nonproliferation in its broader conception many western and south asian analysts identify inconsistencies in us policy including maintenance of large nuclear arsenal and development of nmd as key obstacles to progress in this realm in the words of former indian foreign secretary it is impossible to prevent proliferation in any discriminatory way without eliminating the weapons of all nuclear powers152 so long as the united states is perceived as relying on

deputy secretary of state strobe talbott has remarked that durable peace in south asia will require the emergence of inclusive regional mechanisms to promote economic integration and political reconciliati on and conversely the emergence of such mechanisms will require more willingness by the parties to engage constructively than exists today us ambassador to india richard celeste told reporters that the united states will do everything it can to encourage pakistan to help create an environment in which dialogue could take place with india and joint statement of leaders at july 2000 g8 summit urged renewed dialogue in the spirit of the lahore declaration many analysts see the concept of deterrence itself as including combination of reassurance and accommodation and so should perhaps not focus exclusively on nuclear capabilities154 these ideas suggest that us focus on encouraging improvements in south asian political and economic conditions could indirectly but substantially serve the goals of nonproliferation first among these might be efforts to ameliorate the territorial dispute in kashmir either by gaining indian acquiescence for direct us diplomatic intervention or by supporting track two less formal nongovernmental efforts at reconciliation155 deals involving economic benefits might also be considered such as pledges of economic aid to both india and pakistan in return for those two countries reviving the lahore reconciliation process and making concrete progress on nonproliferation formal incentives to india and pakistan may encourage those countries to increase their commitment to nuclear arms control regimes and norms in this vein there have variously been calls for the united states to lift all remaining sanctions against india and pakistan except those relating to the transfer of wmd and ballistic missiles rebuild political and military ties with both countries and take action to strengthen democracy in the region156

new delhis security concerns one possible step that has been suggested for the united states would be to support creation of permanent seat for india on the security council although some analysts maintain that such move would almost certainly require corresponding gesture toward pakistan158 as with previously discussed options there are doubts that indian and pakistani proliferation behavior is substantively affected by external considerations other than those deriving from their bilateral relations the two countries have proven resistant to the desires of outsiders when it comes to issues of national security moreover so long as the united states and other nuclear weapons states deploy large nuclear arsenals of their own india and pakistan are likely to discount calls to curtail their own efforts in this regard there have been calls for concrete movement toward global nuclear disarmament with many believing that the nuclear weapons states must halt modernization programs and reduce their arsenals as means of demonstrating sincerity on nonproliferation159 recently 18 senior retired us military officers including former cia director and the commander of operation desert storms air operations gathered to call for worldwide nuclear disarmament and the most recent npt conference ended with pledge by the nuclear weapons states to follow this course160 yet such development is considered highly unlikely to occur in the present internatio nal environment and so any us policy based on incentives may continue to be perceived as hypocritical in new delhi and islamabad technological assistance there have been recommendations that the united states might increase nuclear stability in south asia by recognizing india and pakistan as legitimate nuclear states and providing them with technical means for management of their arsenals this is seen as especially important for pakistan where civilian control of the military is weak or nonexistent161 such efforts could include the provision of command and control expertise permissive action link pal technology earlywarning assistance or systems and perhaps even theater missile defense capabilities proponents of such policies also claim that us influence in the region would be enhanced by these actions it has been reported that pakistan has already asked for us assistance in creating limited command

nonproliferation review 4 3 springsummer 1997 as noted above secure retaliatory capabilities are viewed as an essential aspect of any credible nuclear deterrent the provision of command and control expertise to both india and pakistan could enhance the credibility of each sides deterrent likewise if the united states were to share earlywarning data with both india and pakistan this might also serve to reassure the two countries in times of crisis too the united states has had legitimate concerns about the possibility of an accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch in south asia if employed by the regions armed forces some analysts say pal technology could go far in reducing the likelihood of such an occurrence furthermore because crisis instability is exacerbated if one side believes it can launch successful first strike against the others nuclear forces there are those who have suggested that the united states deploy or share tmd systems in the region if and when these become technologically feasible with india reportedly pursuing such capabilities on its own this might entail that the united states provide pakistan in particular with such technology some believe it would be sufficient for the united states to deploy rather than provide such capabilities with former assistant secretary of state suggesting that us naval boostphase tmd capabilities if deployed in the arabian sea could be highly stabilizing factor in any future south asian crisis163 criticism of this tack falls into three general categories the first made in response to any provision of nuclearrelated expertise to india and pakistan is that signal of acceptance of south asias nuclear status implicit or otherwise would be seen to undercut three decades of us nonproliferation policy and so do irreparable damage to those international regimes designed to halt proliferation with this view the potential benefits of providing india and pakistan with technical assistance would not outweigh the probable costs of such damage the second criticism contends that such policy would only serve to strengthen indian and pakistani nuclear capabilities and perhaps even encourage these countries to deploy larger nuclear forces finally some analysts respond more specifically to the idea of deploying missile defenses in the region viewing such step as likely to spark an asian ballistic missile race as countries seek to ensure the viability of their nuclear deterrents164 it may be possible to combine aspects of two or more of these general approaches for instance carrots and sticks policy might include promises of future aid andor technical assistance along with the imposition of new sanctions in the absence of cooperation on nonproliferation issues an important decision facing united states policy makers at this time would seem to be whether to maintain the more or less strict nonproliferation policies now in place or alternatively to
