domestic social policy division paulette c morgan analyst in social legislation domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702medicarechoice summary medicare has longstanding history of offe ring its beneficiaries an alternative to the traditional feeforservice program health maintenance organizations and other types of managed care plans have b een allowed to participate in the medicare program beginning with private health pl ans contracts in the 1970s and the medicare risk contract program in the 1980s the n in 1997 congress passed the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 replacing the risk contract program with the medicarechoice mc program the mc program established new rules for beneficiary and plan participation along with new payment methodology in addition to controlling costs the mc program was also designed to expand private health plans to markets where acces s to managed care p lans was limited or nonexistent and to offer new types of private health plans the 106thcongress enacted legislation to address some issues arising from the bba changes the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 changed the mc program in an effort make it easier for medicare beneficiaries and plans to participate in the program further refinements to the mc program were included in the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 the 107thcongress made only minor changes to the mc program and was not able to reach consensus on comprehensive modifications the 108thcongress is considering major changes to the program in 2003 medicarechoice plans were available to about 59 of the over 40 million medicare beneficiaries and in march 2003 about 12 of them chose to enroll in one of the 146 including two pri vatefeefor service plans available medicarechoice plans the rapid growth rate of medicare managed care enrollment in the 1990s leveled off with th implementation of the mc program and in fact there has been continuous decline in enrollment since 1999 when 17 of beneficiaries were enrolled in mc plans in order to increase enrollment in medicare managed care and to allow beneficiaries to better meet their health care needs the mc program offers diverse assortment of managed care plans how ever achieving the goals of the mc program has been difficult in part because the goal to control medicare spending which led to slowdown in the rate of increase in payments to plans may have dampened interest by managed care entities in developing new markets adding plan options and maintaining their current markets the congressional budget office cbo estimates that in 2003 medicare will spend 359 billion for all medicare group pl ans including mc and other private medicare arrangements such as demonstr ations by 2013 the projected spending for medicare group plans will increase to 469 billion this report focuses on the recent trends in medicare managed care along with an overview of the mc program it w ill be updated as necessary to reflect significant changes made to the mc program for more detailed analysis of mc payments see crs report rl30587 medicarechoice

in the 1970s private health plans were allowe d to contract with medicare on cost reimbursement basis in 1982 medicare s risk contract program was created allowing private entities mostly health maintenance organizations hmos to contract with medicare in exchange for preset monthly per capita payment from medicare private health plans agreed to furnish all medicarecovered items and services to each enrollee by 1997 15 years after the start of the risk contract program medicare managed care cove red more than 5 million people or about 14 of beneficiaries then in 1997 congress passed the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 replacing the risk contract pr ogram with the medicarechoice mc program the mc program establishe d new rules for beneficiary and plan participation along with

since take n downward turn in march 2003 about 12 of the medicare population 4 7 million enrollees remained in the mc program compared to the 14 of the medicare population who were enrolled in medicare managed care prior to the enactment of bba the 106thcongress enacted legislation in order to address some issues arising from the bba changes the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra

easier for medicare beneficiaries and plans to participate in the program the 107thcongress passed the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107188 which included few temporary changes to deadlines in the medicarechoice program additionally the 107th congress considered but was not able to reach agreement on major legislativechanges to the medicarechoice program the house passed hr 4954 on june 28 2002 bill that would have increased mc payments in 2003 and 2004 and then in 2005 would have created new medicarechoice competition program and demonstration program two bills were introduced in the senate that would have also made major changes to the mc prog ram s 3018 introduced by the senators baucus and grassley et contained s imilar provisions to hr 4954 to increase mc payments 2003 and 2004 s 2729 introduced by senator grassley et thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702crs2 tripartisan bill would have based payments in mc on competitive bids by plans neither bill was passe d by the senate the 108thcongress is considering similar options to revise the mc program this paper describes the current stat us of the mc program as amended along with the rules and standards under which the program operates data for 1998 and preceding years covers the medicare risk contract program and beginning in 1999 data covers the mc program overview of the medi carechoice program in order to increase enrollment in medicare managed care and to allow beneficiaries access to similar options av ailable in the nonmedicare market for meeting their health care needs the mc program was created to offer diverse assortment of managed care plans mc options include not only coordinated care plans but also private feeforservice plans and on demonstration basis combination of medical savings account msa plan and contributions to an mc msa coordinated care plans are plans that provide full range of services in exchange for per capita payment the most typical of which is the hmo an hmo is type of managed care plan primarily ow ned and operated by insurers that acts as both the insurer and the provider of hea lth care services to an enrolled population the bba also allows for contracts with pr ovidersponsored organizations psos which are coordinated care plans owne da n do p r t db yp r v i d r s sw l s preferred provider organiz ations ppos which are gr oups of doctors and hospitals that contract with an insurer to offer their services on feeforservice basis at negotiated rates that are lower than thos charged to nonenrollees unlike other managed care plans ppos do not traditionally have primarycare gatekeepers who oversee health care services alternatively beneficiarymayselect private feeforservice pffs plan that covers enrollees through private indemnity health insurance policy for which the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms makes per capita payments to the insurer for each enrollee the insurer then reimburses hospitals doctors and other providers at rate determined by th plan on feeforservice basis without placing the providers at any additional finan cial risk it also does not vary rates based on utilization enrollees may see any medicareapproved provider who agrees to furnish services under the plans terms and conditions of payment finally the demonstration msa plans reimburse enrollees for their expenses for medicarecovered services after specified high deductible is met the difference between the premium for the highdeductible plan and the applicable mc per capita payment would be placed into an account for t he beneficiary to use to meet medical expenses below the deductible however to date medicare beneficia ry has enrolled in an msa three ppos serve 2241 beneficiaries

more detailed analysis of pffs plans see crs report rl31122 medicarechoice private feeforservice plans by paulette morgan and madeleine smith2003 there were 20761 enrollees in the two pffs plans throughout the country1 additionally there are another 1748 enro llees in pffs demonstration program in addition to expanding options for medicare managed care coverage the bba also substantially restructured the system for setting medicare payment rates to private plans under the mc program the per capita rate for payment area is set at the highest of three amounts the new pa yment structure is designed to reduce the variation in payments across the count ry by increasing payments in areas with traditionally low payments and slowing the rate of growth in areas with higher payments although variations in payments have been somewhat reduced substantial payment differentials remain nationwide initially mc payments were also adjusted for demographic risk factors such as age gender and coverage by medicaid to account for variations in health care costs the bba required the secretary of health and human services hhs to develop method for risk adjusting payments to include health status in order to account for larger share of the variation i n costs the interim method established by the secretary adjusted for health status based on diagnoses for prior year inpatient hospitalizations although phasein of the healthbased risk adjusters began in january 2000 the bbra slowed down the secr etarys planned phasein schedule further refinements included in bipa extended the current riskadjustment methodology through 2003 and then beginning in 2004 new methodology based on disease grouping will be phasedin ba sed on data from inpatient hospitals and ambulatory settings this system will be fully phased in beginning in 2007 the bbra and bipa made several other re visions to the mc program raising mc payments to plans and providing bonus payments for certain plans that enter areas where other plan is in operation to encourage participation in rural areas the bbra moved the deadline for plans to submit their adjusted community rate acr proposals from may 1 to july 1 of each year and allowed plans to segment their service areas along county lines in rder to better match revenues to costs additional changes in bipa permit mc plans to offer reduced medicare part b premiums beginning in 2003 and revised payments for end stage renal disease esrd mc enrollees current status of the med icarechoi ce program achieving the goals of the mc program has been difficult in part because the goal to control medicare spending may have dampened interest by managed care entities in developing new markets adding plan options and maintaining their current markets this cautious behavior may partially be reaction to slowdown in the rate of increase for medicare managed care payment the initial slowdown in spending for medicare traditional feefors ervice payments following the passage of the bba and the uncertainty about the fut ure of the payments or organization of the mc programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702crs4 further beneficiaries in rural ar eas still have limited acces s to managed care plans and enrollment growth has slowed or declined across all geographic areas beneficiaries have also been offered less generous benefit packages and fewer options for zero or low monthly mc premiums obstacles relating to data collection and quality improvement requirements may make it more difficult for some plans to meet these requirements therefore further discouraging participation in the medicare program mc plans have increasingly noted that in addition to concerns about payment amounts the regul atory requirements are burdensome and make it difficult for them to participate in the program as plans withdraw from the mc program some enrolled beneficiaries are forced to choose new mc plans while others are left without any access to medicare managed care they are forced to return to medicares feeforservice program even among those who still have an option to choose another plan some beneficiaries have selected medicares feeforservice program because they are concerned that additional plan withdrawal s could be disruptive to their health care coverage in 2003 mc plans are available to bout 59 of the more than 40 million medicare beneficiaries and in march 2003 about 12 of all beneficiaries chose to enroll in one of the 146 includes two pffs plan available mc plans the rapid growth rate of medicare managed care nrollment in the 1990s leveled off and although enrollment initially increased mode rately with the imp lementation of the mc program by march 2003 enrollment was two percentage points below prebba enrollment the congressional budget office cbo projects that mc enrollment will decline moderately through 2008 wh it will reach about 9 of the medicare population and then slowly decline to about 8 by 2013 cbo estimates that in 2003 medicare will spend 359 billion for all medicare group plans including mc and other private medicare arrangem ents such as demonstrations by 2013 the projected spending for medicare g roup plans will increase to 469 billion enrollment is widely segmented across t he country however with the majority of enrollees in just four states california new york florida and pennsylvania not surprisingly medicare beneficiaries in urban areas have greater access to plans while 92 of beneficiaries in center cities have access to at least one plan only 6 have access in the most rural areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702crs5 2although most of the components of the mc program were effective in 1999 the mc payment structure was implemented in 1998 3the bba changed the designation of plans beginning in 1999 the old definition of plans is now referred to as contracts and each contract may include several different plans in mar 2003 there were about 442 plans available through 146 mc contracts for example the mc organization may offer one plan providing only the basic medicare covered benefits and other plans that also include optional supplemental benefitstrends in mc availability and enrollment availability of medicare managed care the mc program began operation on january 1 19992as authorized by the bba by march 2003 there were 146 mc contracts with cms under the mc program3over time the number of mc contracts has fluctuated from 1987 to the early 1990s many risk plans terminated ex isting contracts decreasing the number of available plans from 161 in 1987 to 93 in 1991 then the trend shifted as the number of medicare risk plans began increasing in 1992 more than tripling from 110 in 1993 to 346 in 1998 with the implementation of the mc program in 1999 the downward cycle of availability began once again as several mc organizations withdrew from the medicare program or reduced the size of their service area as shown in figure 1 these reductions have resulted i n fewer providers of medicare managed care under the mc program than previously existed dropping from high of 346 plans in 1998 to 267 contracts in 2000 and then to 146 as of march 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702 crs6 050100150200250300350400 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 yearnumber of plans note medicare managed care plans

access to mc plans about half of the beneficiaries who had access to other mc plans chose new plan while the other half chose medicare feeforservice in total 372 counties were affected by the withdrawals or service area reductions and 72 counties lost access to medicare managed care then in january 2000 additional contr act terminations and service area reductions affected 327000 5 of mc enrollees in 329 c ounties some of whom had also been affected the previous year this cycle of contract changes left 79000 13 of all managed care enrollees in 105 counties without access to any other

of these enrollees with access to medicare managed care after the passage of bipa mc organizations were given an opportunity to reconsider their earlier decision and as result four mc organizations decided to return to the pr ogram in total these organizations had provided serviced to appr oximately 13000 beneficiar ies in 2000 covering 11 counties in five counties there were n other mc plans offered despite the changes made to contract terminations after bipa this series of contract terminations affected more beneficiaries than the combined total for the previous 2 years nationwide just two managedcare c ompanies aetna and cigna accounted for about half of the total number of benefic iaries affected by these withdrawals for contract renewals effective on j anuary 1 2002 36 plans reduced their service area and 22 did not renew their c ontract this round of withdrawals affected more than 536000 mc enrollees leaving about 38000 without access to any mc plan for an additional

feeforservice costs toward nationa l average rate blending was designed to reduce payments in counties where the adj usted average per capita costs aapccs historically were higher than the national average rate and to increase payments in counties where aapccs were lower the blended rate is defined as the weighted sum of percentage of the annual areaspecific mc per capita rate for the year for the payment area and percentage of the inputprice adjusted annual national mc percapita rate for the year the component of the blend determined by the areaspecific local rate is based on the 1997 aapcc for the payment area with two adjustments first the areaspecific rate is reduced to remove an amount corresponding to graduate medical education gme 9payments second rates are updated each year by national growth percentage described below the component of the blend determined by the national rate is the weighted average of all local areasp ecific rates this component of the blend is adjusted to reflect differences in certain input prices s uch as labor costs by formula stated in the law the bba allows the secretary to change the method for making inputprice adjustments in the future under current law the percentage in the blend assigned to the areaspecific rate was reduced in increments over 6 years from 90 in 1998 to 50 in 2003 while the corresponding percentage for the

covered benefits would result in significant increase in cost to mc plans the secretary is required to adjust appropriately the mc payments to reflect this greater cost in 2004 an adjustment of 02

uses ambulatory inpatient and demographic data beginning in 2004 the former medicare risk contract program adjusted the aapccs for demographic risk factors and when the mc program was implemented it

qualified for dicare on the basis of disability and institutional nursing home status each aged medicare beneficiary can be categorized according to these demographic factors as shown in table 7 separate demographic adjustments are made for part and part b of the medicare program part adjustments apply to about 56 of the payment and part b adjustments apply to the remaining 44 the payment to the mc plan for an individual i s adjusted by the relevant factors for example the part share of the payment to an mc plan for male beneficiary aged 7579 who was not working not in an institution and not on medicaid would be increased by 5 multiplied by 105 as shown in the table the part b share of the payment for that same beneficiary would be multiplied by factor of 110 for an individual of the same age who was institutionalized the payment would be multiplied by 225 for the part share and 195 for the part b share these demographic risk adjusters account for only very limited portion of the variation in health care costs and as result the bba required the secretary of hhs to develop new risk adjustment mechanis m that would also consider variations in health status beginning in january 2000 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented this new risk adjustment mechanism built on 15 principal inpatient diagnostic cost groups pip dcgs in order to predict incremental

1 the demographicallybased risk adjustment system in place prior to 2000 and 2 the actual system in place for 2003 which uses combination of 10 of the current healthstatusbased sys tem and 90 of the old demographicbased system comparing these two scenarios p rovides an evaluation of the impact of the different risk adjustment methodologies on mc payments three beneficiaries are considered each is male aged 75 the illustration assumes that none of these beneficiaries is disabled institutionalized covered by medicaid or working because the system is prospective hospitalization in the prior year 2002 would determine the healthstatus adjustment factor used in 2003 the first beneficiary was not hospitalized in 2002 the second was hospitalized in 2002 with diagnosis of kidney infection pipdcg code 10 while the third was hospitalized with diagnosis of lung cancer pipdcg code 16 as shown in the scenarios below monthl payments to plans for beneficiaries with prior year hospitalization will be lower using the current risk adjustment methodology compared with payments using the old demographicallybased methodology through 2003 only 10 of the payments will be based on the new methodology with the bulk of the payment 90 based on the old demographiconly adjusters payments for beneficiaries with prior year hospitalization will decline even more as larger percentage of the payment is based on the more comprehensive risk adjusters alternatively for any enrollee with prior year hospitalization payments under the new system will be higher than payments under the old demographiconly based system in 2004 the new risk adjustment methodology will begin to be phased in taking into account data from both inpatient and ambulatory settingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30702crs32 scenario 1 demographicallybased risk adjustment old system under the old risk adjustment system in place prior to 2000 plans payment was adjusted to reflect the gender and age of the enrollee the same adjustments were assigned to all male beneficiaries ages 75 to 79 who were not disabled institutionalized covered by medicaid or working regardless of health status as shown in table 7 separate demographic adjustme nts are made for part and part b of the medicare program as follows part coverage increased by 5 ie 105 of the payment and part b coverage increased by 10 ie 110 of the payment the adjustment for part applies to about 56 of the payment and the adjustment for part b applies to the remaining 44 resulting in weighted adjustment of about 1072 to each county payment regardless of

were revised to reduce administrative burden and data collection began in july 2002 data collected between july 1 2002 and june 30 2003 will be used to calculate risk adjustment factors for cy2004 mc payments 22separate adjustment factors are listed for certain combinations of conditions such as diabetes and congestive heart failure because the cost of treating beneficiary with the combination is greater than could be accounted for by the sum of the two separate risk adjustment factors 23if beneficiarys illness progresses with in disease process such as diabetes with increasing severity only the most costly diagnosis made for the beneficiary will be applied to the payment ratenew risk adjustment methodology beginning in 2004 as required by bipa beginning in 2004 new risk adjustment method will be used to account for more of the variatio n in health care expenditures than are accounted for using prior methods the new m odel the cms hierarchical condition category risk adjustment model cmshcc incorporates data from both inpatient hospital and ambulatory settings as well as demographic factors21the cmshcc model categorizes approximately3300 inte rnational classification of disease icd 9 codes into approximately 800 disease clust ers and further aggregates those into 64 disease categories the cmshcc also includes several conditioninteractions22 and demographic factors such as age sex medicaid eligibilityand original disability status table 10 displays list of disease groups interactions and demographic factors included in the cmshcc model the payment for an aged beneficiary under the cmshcc model is calculated by summing all of the relevant condition adjustment factors for the prior year with the demographic adjustment factors and multiplying that sum bythe average payment rate for the beneficiarys county of residence any event which occurs during the year would be incorporated into the risk adjusted payment for the following year unlike the pipdcg method which allows only one inpatient diagnosis to modify the payment rate in general the cm shcc model takes into account multiple diagnoses23for example if in the previous year beneficiary has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure hip fracture and cancer all of these conditions would be factored into the risk adjustment for t he beneficiarys 2004 payment the new risk adjustment will be phased in at rate of 30 in 2004 50 in 2005 75 in 2006 and 100 beginning in 2007 the portion of the payment not weighted by the cms hcc will be weighted by the demographiconly
