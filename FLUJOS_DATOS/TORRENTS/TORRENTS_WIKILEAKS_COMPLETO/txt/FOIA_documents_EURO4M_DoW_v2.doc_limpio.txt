time series and monitoring services covering all of europe these will describe the evolution of the earth system components by seamlessly combining two different but complementary approaches regional observation datasets of essential climate variables ecvs on the one hand and model based regional reanalysis on the other the project will extend in cost effective manner european capacity to systematically monitor climate variability and change including extremes on range of space and time scales euro4m will reach out with innovative and integrated data products and climate change services to policymakers researchers planners and citizens at european national and local levels this will directly address the needs of for instance the european environment agency for their environmental assessment reports and even provide online reporting during emerging extreme events as the primary source of timely targeted and reliable information about the state of the climate in europe the suggested collaborative project is an important building block for gmes the project will integrate and extend core services activities on ecvs specifically developing the capacity required for stateoftheart useroriented products for monitoring of climate change euro4m has the potential to evolve into future gmes service on climate change monitoring that is fully complimentary and supporting the existing operational services b1 concept and objectives progress beyond the stateoftheart st methodology and work plan b11 concept and objectives concept as the primary source of timely targeted and reliable information about the state of the climate in europe the suggested collaborative project is an important building block for the global monitoring for environment and security gmes initiative other coordinated contribution for this area exists or is currently planned within gmes the current gmes services which have already entered into their preoperational phase are not designed to provide climate change monitoring information nor reports about high impact weather and climate extremes placed in an historical context for example the atmosphere service is mainly directed towards air quality and focuses on the shorter time scales also the in situ component of gmes at present does not fully address meteorological observations the coordination action for in situ data indicated in the work programme p30 alone will not result in comprehensive paneuropean climate datasets at useful level of aggregation and processing pic figure b11a observed global and european

appendix for list of acronyms that lacks and urgently needs an integrated and coordinated approach with focus in particular on climate information for the multidecadal time scales that are most relevant for adaptation the other societal benefit areas water natural and humaninduced disasters environment and health energy ecosystem services agriculture and desertification biodiversity are already reasonably well covered in the existing data information systems such as the european environment information and observation network eionet and the shared environmental information system seis integrated longterm and highquality datasets of climate change information in particular extremes in terms of atmospheric essential climate variables ecvs are typically missing see dataserviceeeaeuropaeu this situation is limiting the response strategies to adapt to climate variability and change at the regional subregional and national scales in particular information on changes in weather and climate extremes is crucial especially as the driving force for the impact work in all gmes services and geo areas if the relevant climate change information is not made available then these services and areas will not be able to be successful due to lack of coherent information on weather and climate extremes many gmes services and geo areas base their work on changes in mean climate only however it is generally accepted that the impacts of climate change are caused primarily by changes in variability and extremes rather than changes in the mean climate for adaptation strategies the longer multidecadal time scales are particularly relevant because nearly all infrastructure design relies on assessment of probabilities of extremes with return periods of 50 years these assessments should take into account that the climate is non stationary because of climate change it is the longer time scale that is needed for governments to implement their climate change action plans the members of this projects consortium are currently the main source of climate change time series and monitoring information for governments policymakers and the general public across europe they are frequently approached by the european environment agency eea joint research centre jrc world meteorological organization wmo and world health organization who to contribute this information to environmental assessment reports the euro4m beneficiaries mo and uea collectively provide information on european temperature change over the past decades based on their global datasets figure b11a which are also prime inputs to the reports of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and to the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc knmi contributes uptodate information about trends in extremes figure b11b by linking the historical data archives of more than 40 meteorological services and universities in europe through the european climate assessment dataset project ecad forthcoming wmo regional climate centre dwd operates the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc which provides global analysis of precipitation on the earths land surface based on in situ rain gauge data all these activities have an ad hoc character and limited spatial horizontal and vertical resolution for the longer time scales also the potential of data assimilation and reanalysis for climate change monitoring are not yet fully exploited mo smhi and mf are at the forefront of data assimilation developments in europe but regional reanalysis for europe is currently available that improves on the existing global reanalyses particularly era40 at the european centre for mediumrange weather forecasts ecmwf urv nmaro and ms have contributed significantly to improved observational datasets for subregions but these activities have not yet been integrated within the european context dwd coordinates the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cmsaf of eumetsat which aims at the provision of satellitederived geophysical parameter datasets suitable for climate monitoring these datasets need integration too in summary for gmes to become success the situation of fragmentation and scarcity of longterm climate change monitoring information in europe needs to change there is the vast task of integrating national observing systems existing global and european observation datasets satellite derived datasets and reanalyses into gmes see butler 2007 this is needed to fill the gap for surface climatological data and information which at present is clearly visible in all environmental assessments in the words of our third party participant eea see section b23 everybody is expecting that weather and climate data is simply available according to their experience having weather forecasts for every location on every day but for historical data on climate extremes this is clearly not the case pic figure b11b changes in the contribution of heavy rainfall to total precipitation 19612006 eeajrcwho 2008 map 59 the figure indicates that the proportion of rainfall from heavy falls increases

capacity for and deliver the best possible and most complete gridded climate change time series and monitoring services covering all of europe these will enable adequate descriptions of the status and evolution of the earth system components specifically the objectives of euro4m are to 1 generate time series of observation datasets and reanalyses of past observational data build on and integrate

integrates the widest possible range of in situ and satellite data demonstrate the capability of regional reanalysis and multistaged downscaling with increased levels of accuracy deliver demonstration regional reanalysis for parts of the past 20 years reduce gaps and deficiencies in european monitoring capacity through better exploitation of existing atmospheric observations and data exchange build on the strong synergy the beneficiaries have with other major climate monitoring centres worldwide in particular with centres involved in global reanalysis 2 produce innovative and integrated highquality data products for research and applications sector users produce multipurpose products and information to assist climate change research to incorporate the monitored ecvs provide reliable uptodate scientific input especially through the ipcc for the implementation of european and international policies and strategies on the environment and society including the eu climate adaptation strategy provide online reporting during emerging extreme events 3 reach out with data products and climate change services to the user community stakeholders policymakers and general public demonstrate the climate change services to policymakers researchers planners and citizens at european national and local levels hold frequent dialogues and interactions with wide range of end users to achieve better understanding of information needs and formats make the data and information readily accessible to users with full consideration of the appropriate level of aggregation and standardization 4 evolve into future gmes service on climate change monitoring that is fully complimentary and supporting the existing core services integrate and extend core gmes services activities on ecvs specifically developing the capacity required for useroriented multipurpose products for monitoring of climate change link to existing gmes services and especially those on marine land and atmosphere monitoring which include or will include in the near future global component by design stimulate the gmes downstream sector demonstrate and strengthen the european leadership in longterm monitoring of climate change these objectives will be achieved over 4 yr period in 4 major work packages wps detailed in section b13 together they comprehensively address the scientific technical and wider societal and policy objectives of the subactivity spa20091102 monitoring of climate change issues extending core service activities scope variables euro4m will focus on atmospheric surface

reanalyses datasets as an illustration of the typical area that the regional datasets of euro4m will cover figure b11c presents the reanalysis domain of the north atlantic european model nae this includes the whole mediterranean sea in line with the gmes goals euro4m will not stop when the raw observation and reanalysis data have been made available the project will also engage in developing the multipurpose products and services at the appropriate level of aggregation and processing to respond to wide range of users and downstream services this is implemented through issuing the socalled climate indicator bulletins and establishing the climate liaison team see below figure b11c domain of the met office operational north atlantic european nae model which has gridlength of 12km and 38 vertical levels with top at 39km in autumn 2009 it will move to 70 levels with top at 80km key scientific question the key scientific question euro4m addresses is how can we improve monitoring to help us better understand and predict climate change extremes and weather related hazards so that society can respond in the best possible way in order to place recent changes fluctuations and extremes in their long term perspective optimal usage of all conventional in situ and satellite sources will be required euro4m will achieve this by seamless integration of data from the satellite era back to the 1970s with early instrumental observations back to the mid19th century vital approach to integrating these quantities is for euro4m to explore the use of new regional reanalysis as well as existing global reanalyses especially era 40 uppala et 2005 the focus on extremes and weather related hazards requires more detail than is strictly necessary for gcos global climate monitoring because as potential future gmes service on climate change monitoring we need to fully satisfy the information needs for subregional and local adaptation measures it is at those scales where climate and weather impacts are most strongly experienced high impact extreme events range from those of short duration such as heavy rain and associated flooding and windstorms to those which extend over several days heat waves atmospheric pollution several months or perhaps even years drought they also range from continentaltolocal spatial scales the science included in euro4m in particular in wps 1 and 2 see section b13 ensures that the overall goal of developing the capacity for and delivering the best possible and most complete gridded climate change time series and monitoring services for europe will be achieved at high scientific level we combine two different but complementary approaches regional observation datasets of ecvs on the one hand and model based regional reanalysis on the other choosing direct observations alone would have left the potential of data assimilation unexplored choosing reanalysis only would have run the risk of missing some important aspects in the observations and might have compromised the quality of the final monitoring products and services we are convinced that integrated climate change monitoring products of stateoftheart quality are needed because most of the work in downstream gmes services and geo areas will be based on this information role of reanalysis reanalysis of the past atmospheric state can be obtained by combining observational datasets with comprehensive numerical weather prediction nwp model using modern data assimilation methods complete estimate of the atmospheric state is computed that is both dynamically consistent and optimally close to the observations the great benefit of reanalysis is that it provides complete picture of the atmosphere covering the whole of the threedimensional domain also for the ecvs and parameters which are not routinely monitored by observations in reanalysis or rather reassimilation also the consistency in time is ensured through the forecast model used in the data assimilation cycles it carries the information from cycle to cycle with dynamical changes in order to give best background before the observations are analysed this 4dimensional dynamical consistency is strong both in 3d and 4d assimilation algorithms in 4d variational assimilation 4dvar the consistency is even stronger within each time window the dynamical model trajectory is fitted as closely as possible as given by model and observation statistics to all the observations within the time window of 4dvar 612 hours it means that also atmospheric tendencies are well assimilated and the resulting analysis fields provide better estimates of moist variables like precipitation rates and cloud cover compared with what 3d methods give the availability of forecast model fields in the assimilation cycles provides whole range of diagnostic quantities like radiative fluxes and accumulated precipitation where there are observations the accuracy of these is of course limited by the quality of the forecast model but by basing reanalysis systems on stateoftheart operational nwp models we benefit from past careful validation and model development in the operational centres experience from global reanalyses has shown that there is potential in the use of such modelderived quantities the benefit of complete multidecadal sets of ecv products motivates eea to investigate the use of reanalysis for future assessment studies and explore possibilities for regional analysis in europe the eurra project however current reanalysis products are not yet reliable enough to satisfy user needs entirely because the basic raw observations and measurements are not consistently of climate quality problems arise partly because the assimilating numerical model is inevitably biased to some degree in its representation of the climate system if observations are abundant and unbiased they can correct the biases in background forecasts when assimilated simmons et 2004 in reality however observational coverage varies over time observations are themselves prone to bias either instrumental or through not being representative of their wider surroundings and these observational biases can change over time this introduces trends and lowfrequency variations in analyses that are mixed with the true climatic signals see figure b11d picpic picpicmmyr figure b11d changes in summer jja rainfall since 1961 estimated from different sources the eobs dataset based on station observations see figure 11b b ukcip08 jenkins et 2007 c era40 reanalysis ecmwf the difference in trends over the uk illustrates the biases in existing global reanalysis products moreover the limited spatial resolution of current models that are affordable for global reanalysis inhibits the applicability of products for the study of local climate change and extremes progress in the provision of reanalyses suitable for climate monitoring requires improvements in data assimilation systems both in assimilating models and the analysis methods used to incorporate observational information and improved recovery quality control and bias correction or homogenization of past observations assessment of existing products through comparison either with high quality regional datasets or alternative global ecv products is further important activity needed both to guide potential users as to the applicability of the products they are using and to guide where the emphasis needs to be placed for the improvement of the production systems euro4m will enhance the quality of regional reanalysis methods and deliver different levels of advanced regional reanalysis datasets for europe some of these datasets will cover most of the last 20 years whereas other more advanced systems will be demonstrated for few years there will be improvement of data assimilation systems in resolution and in the use of precipitation and surface data selected products will be evaluated in detail comparing also with existing products from global reanalyses in order to further enhance the horizontal resolution and detailed structures of the regional reanalyses euro4m will also perform 2 dimensional downscaling at considerably higher resolution than is possible with the 3d or 4d methods the 2d analysis methods still combine observations with background fields from the 3d regional system but the analysis methods are relaxed from fulfilling all the 3dimensional balance constraints that are required for nwp in the 2d analyses one employs lot of regional variation given by observational statistics and by physiographic factors landsea and orography mainly in this way it is possible to analyse fine scale structures given by observations and closer to the observations than the full 3d systems can do we will also prepare biasadjusted observed data inputs to climate quality reanalyses in close cooperation with ecmwf we will contribute to the improved capability for reanalysis needed to ensure that the next generation of longerterm global and regional reanalysis is as well prepared as possible to meet the needs of climate monitoring our third party participant ecmwf see section b23 strongly supports this activity and will collaborate by providing the current erainterim reanalysis the raw observations and by exchanging ideas on the formats of observation files monitoring techniques and any other possible commonalities between the regional reanalysis in euro4m and the global reanalysis role of satellite data and derived products satellitederived products will supplement the reanalysis data and ground measurements over the oceans and sparsely populated areas satellite data are often the only data source the quality of cloud information the surface radiation budget water vapour and precipitation can be significantly increased by use of satellite data within the integrated data products the top of the atmosphere radiation budget can be only observed by satellites satellite products eg water vapour cloud properties sea ice and shortwave radiation together with groundbased measurements will also be used to verify the reanalysis data biases in the radiances of satellite sensors eg due to missing intercalibration lead to biases or breaks of homogeneity in reanalysis data as the models themselves cannot absolutely correct biases in grossly inhomogeneous input data satellite radiances are already assimilated into reanalysis datasets in order to improve the homogeneity of reanalysis data euro4m will support satellite inter calibration activities the sensitivity of reanalysis ecvs for inhomogeneities and biases in satellite radiances will be evaluated satellite data will be used together with reanalysis data to provide long term record of the surface radiation budget climate indices derived from satellitebased products are of value for monitoring of specific climate impacts eg droughts in wang and qu 2007 additionally the commercial solar energy market demonstrates the suitability of satellite data for climate applications eg satellitebased solar irradiance data are used for the efficient planning and monitoring of solar energy systems hammer et 2003 drews et 2008 the product palette of the cmsaf has been evaluated to be suitable for monitoring of climate change schultz et 2008 however the overall capacity of satellitederived data for climate monitoring has by means been explored satisfactorily euro4m will integrate the eumetsatsaf products and methods for climate monitoring in this respect reprocessing of existing satellite products in order to derive homogeneous longterm datasets is an important effort at the same time there is scope for merging these products with shorterterm but possibly more advanced datasets climate indicator bulletins and climate liaison team twhereas the raw data from euro4m will be distributed mainly through existing systems which can be accessed from dedicated euro4m webbased data portal and t the scientific results will be distributed through peer reviewed scientific and technical journals in addition the euro4m multi purpose products will be disseminated through regularly issued climate indicator bulletins cibs these will focus on user groups such as disaster prevention health energy water resources ecosystems forestry agriculture transport tourism and biodiversity at european national and local levelsand downstream services in general these user groups that do not have the required expertise and knowledge to access and process the terabytes of raw observation data or reanalysis data cibs will provide simple effective and timely knowledge abstractions from euro4m data and activities the cibs will be flexible and optimal products that will be responsive to current environmental and climatic events extremes and also user needs the exact specifications for the cibs will be developed as part of the project with proof of concept undertaken for selected extreme events from the past such as the heat wave of 2003 apart from multipurpose information on changes and significant anomalies for ecvs useroriented derived indices will also be included such as heating degree days number of high intensity precipitation events etc the cibs will be based on the output datasets available at the time of cib writing this implies that the cibs do not rely on the datasets that will be delivered late in the project the cibs will be published both as bulletins electronic documentsnewsletters as well as being provided through webportal including access to the associated data series gridded datasets and editorial texts the system for producing cibs will be made configurable and flexible and capable of reacting in nearreal time to user needs within euro4m climate liaison team clt will actively solicit user requirements and feedback through their mediation the multipurpose results of euro4m will feedback directly into applications and impact assessments relevant to european societal and community needs the climate liaison team clt will establish communication process which responds to information flow in both directions providers users and users providers and evolves through time so that users can both obtain and influence the nature userdriven data format content and delivery style of the information they need while understanding the strengths and limitations of the monitoring products in doing so the team will establish sustainable links between euro4m and all gmes services and geo societal benefit areas the clt will also train users in the handling of euro4m products and services through workshops elearning modules podcasts and user guides covering different skill levels in this way euro4m will ensure stronger links between european applications studies and the outputs from traditional and advanced climate monitoring systems the existing core gmes services and the downstream gmes services which are currently planned and positioned between the multipurpose core services and the individual user clients will be actively involved in the clt this will ensure that the endusers can and will take full benefit of the wide range of products and services euro4m will develop the clt will build on existing national experience and related eranet activities such as the eranet climate impact research coordination within larger europe circle see section b31 and kabat and vellinga 2005 the lessons learned from the process for establishing user needs that has been used for the selection of fast track and pilot services will be considered too the clt enables that already in an early stage users are involved in the decisionmaking process in structured way this is in line with the user driven objective of gmes ec 2008 b12 progress beyond the stateoftheart innovationrelated activities never before has the paneuropean integration of atmospheric observations from groundbased sources satellite sources and reanalysis been optimized in such comprehensive way for longterm climate monitoring and adaptation policy support remotely sensed data from satellites deliver nearreal time estimates of key parameters worldwide however they must be complemented by in situ data even though these are often much more sparsely and irregularly distributed in time and space the in situ data are indispensable for calibration and validation of satellite data also they give information representative of finer spatial scale often with higher precision which complements satellite information which is coarser but has wider coverage the problems with estimates of lower tropospheric temperatures from satellitebased microwave sounding unit msu radiances since 1978 and their subsequent comparisons with sondebased and surface temperature data indicate that datasets need to be considered together rather than in isolation in contrast to satellite data in situ measurements have often been acquired and handled by wide variety of laboratories and institutions for the purposes of specific research programmes and are not managed in unified way climate quality reanalysis the data assimilation and downscaling activities in euro4m will progress the regional reanalysis science beyond the present stateoftheart the data assimilation systems are making rapid progress as they benefit from research in nwp which has lead to much improved weatherforecast skill also progress is made in the correction of biases and discontinuities of the observing system that obscure the detection of climate trends computing resources are growing with time which will enable future reanalyses to be calculated at finer horizontal and vertical resolutions with immediate effects on product quality and on the relevance of products for new applications an example of what can be achieved is provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr this longterm consistent highresolution climate dataset for the north american domain is major improvement upon the earlier global reanalysis datasets in both resolution and accuracy mesinger et 2006 at 32 km horizontal resolution narr covers the 25yr period 19792003 and is being continued in nearreal time in particular narr has successfully assimilated highquality and detailed precipitation observations into the atmospheric analysis consequently the forcing to the landsurface model component of the system is more accurate than in previous reanalyses so that narr provides muchimproved analysis of land hydrology and landatmosphere interaction the overall atmospheric circulation throughout the troposphere has been substantially improved as well operational agencies responsible for reanalysis need to be kept abreast of advances in data recovery and rehabilitation which will lead to improvements in datasets for assimilation in reanalysis in the long run new climate quality dynamic reanalyses will then be able to provide the necessary ecvs this requires data from network of radiosonde surface based and satellitebased observations that are specifically prevalidated with respect to systematic biases the models themselves cannot absolutely correct biases in grossly inhomogeneous input data incorrect or incomplete data with spatiotemporal inhomogeneities can be misleading in estimating climate change in particular changes in extremes recovery of synoptic surface meteorological data and radiosonde upperair data is needed to fill gaps in the observational records held by reanalysis centres major efforts are needed to bring together more of the available data into coherent form suitable for climate quality reanalyses for instance existing reanalysis products did not use all corrected surfacebased and radiosonde observations for the early years much better exploitation of existing and digitized highresolution observational series can be made euro4m will therefore extend these data back well before 1958 the start date of era 40 to serve future reanalysis prior to this time eg the proposed next generation reanalysis that ecmwf plans to carry out with proof of concept being undertaken by the global reanalysis proposal for fp7 should it be successful see section b23 the project will also link with the acrefacilitated reanalyses to aid the development and testing of 100 year reanalysis using only surface observations the 20th century reanalysis project and thus be positioned to work similarly with even longer historical climate quality reanalyses essential climate variables ecvs stateoftheart the second adequacy report of gcos gcos 2003 developed the concept of essential climate variables ecvs encompassing the atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial domains the concept forms part of the gcos implementation plan gcos 2004 which for these three domains has been endorsed by geo in its geoss work plan geo 2007 the gcos implementation plan has been updated with the help of euro4m partners the new report gcos 2009 provides comprehensive assessment on the status and trends in global observing systems for climate over the past five years as well as on progress in related activities research infrastructure organizational issues gcos named the ecvs in somewhat ad hoc way some are very specific physical quantities eg surface temperature and precipitation while others are more vague and generic eg cloud properties and minor greenhouse gases encompassing number of measurements some can be considered at point locations while others only really have scientific relevance as global fields euro4m will consider selection of ecvs from the atmospheric domain which comprises 6 surface level 5 upper atmosphere ecvs and only one ecv from each of the oceanic and terrestrial domains see table b12a domain essential climate variables ecvs atmosphericsurface air temperature precipitation air pressure over land surface radiation budget wind speed and sea an

fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation leaf area index biomass fire disturbance table b12a gcos ecvs those that will be part of euro4m are shown in bold specific reasons for this selection of ecvs are justified in the assessment below the general motivation is that these ecvs form primary input to all gmes services and geo societal benefit areas and that most services and areas currently make suboptimal use of existing information often the changes in extremes that accompany the average warming are not taken into account also most of the other ocean and terrestrial ecvs are part of other core gmes services with several other projects underway that are fully dedicated to monitoring the atmospheric composition such as carboeurope and nitroeurope these ecvs are not considered within euro4m baseline for each ecv ecv surface temperature the bestknown product for monitoring surface temperature using combination of land station data and in situ sea surface temperature observations has been developed by the climatic research unit of uea and the mo the current version of the monthly dataset which extends back to 1850 is hadcrut3 brohan et 2006 but its spatial and temporal resolutions of 5 by 5 latitudelongitude and monthly timescale are rather coarse higher resolution version back to 1901 at 05 by 05 spatial resolution is available for land areas only mitchell and jones 2005 but the temporal resolution is still monthly sea surface temperature data is well studied as it is vital input to reanalyses and datasets such as hadisst and hadsst2 rayner et 2006 are readily available national meteorological and hydrological services nmhss have collected most of the historical station temperature data but only few have digitized their entire daily to subdaily holdings fewer still have homogenized their long series some additionally charge for accessing this type of data recent eu projects emulate european and north atlantic daily to multidecadal climate variability ensembles ensemblebased predictions of climate changes and their impacts stardex statistical and regional dynamical downscaling of extremes for european regions improve improved understanding of past climatic variability from early daily european instrumental sources circe climate change and impact research the mediterranean environment and ecad have assembled daily series of maximum and minimum temperature all of which will be available to euro4m ensembles and stardex have emphasised high spatial density observations but over relatively short periods from the 1950s emulate circe and ecad concentrated on records that extended back to the 19th century but their databases were limited to about 200 records and spatial gaps continue to affect europe ensembles has produced daily gridded dataset at resolution of 25 by 25 km for statistical comparisons with regional climate model output haylock et 2008 higherresolution 3 hourly data are also digitally available from the integrated surface hourly ish dataset these are discussed under the surface humidity ecv but integrated surface hourly ish temperatures will also be investigated in euro4m in summary temperature is the ecv for which most digitized data are readily available and it is also the most widely analyzed variable some spatial limitations affect europe in the daily series and there are concerns about the longterm homogeneity of the records wijngaard et 2003 ecv precipitation gridded precipitation datasets are available at 05 1 and 25 resolution from the wmo global precipitation climatology centre gpcc operated by dwd these are at the monthly timescale extend back to 1951 have global coverage landsurface and use between 10000 and 40000 individual station series rudolf and schneider 2005 beck et 2005 since the late 1970s it has been possible to incorporate satellite precipitation estimates although these raise myriad of issues regarding the types of satellite sensors used and the algorithms which convert sensor measurements into surface precipitation rates accordingly global datasets of precipitation have been constructed by the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and noaas climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation both being available at 25 resolution blending of the groundbased gpcc precipitation dataset with the satellite based hoaps dataset hamburgs ocean atmosphere parameters from satellite grassl et 2000 bauer and schluessel 1993 lead to global precipitation dataset covering both land surface and ocean figure b12a pic figure b12a annual average precipitation amount derived by blending gpcc with hoaps3 dwd will generate blend of hoaps4 and gpcc which will comprise 20y of global precipitation over land gpcc and ocean hoaps slightly more digitized daily records are available for precipitation than temperature across europe but given the much greater spatial variability of precipitation much greater density is essential this is particularly the case for mountain regions frei and schär 1998 ensembles has produced daily gridded dataset at resolution of 25 by 25 km for statistical comparisons with regional climate model output haylock et 2008 in specific regions and projects eg the alps the baltic sea experiment baltex the european land data assimilation system to predict floods and droughts eldas and for many individual countries much denser networks have been used in regional and national studies gridded versions of these data will be used to assess the accuracy of interpolation in ensembles extending the initial work reported by hofstra et 2008 as for temperature circe aims at collecting updating and homogenising daily precipitation station series from the larger mediterranean area covering the last decades to 100 years the wmo medare initiative aims at pushing this limit even further back in time and recover additional series from this region in summary precipitation data need to be more spatially extensive than temperature to achieve given level of accuracy in regionalscale estimations there are again limitations with the availability of digitized data across europe and although there are fewer concerns about homogeneity this may be because the density of networks is inadequate to address this issue auer et 2005 euro4m will have access to daily station series as well as gridded products from gpcc emulate ensembles circe and medare see section b13 ecv atmospheric air pressure most analyses of atmospheric circulation in the scientific literature during the last few years make use of reanalyses era40 or ncepncar however efforts to examine circulation patterns over longer time scales have focused on observational datasets of atmospheric pressure foremost amongst these using both global terrestrial ispd and marine icoads data at monthly timescales back to 1850 and at 5 by 5 spatial resolution is the hadley centre mean sea level pressure dataset version 2 hadslp2 compiled by mo allan and ansell 2006 the same institution led the emulate project in its development of daily 24 hour mean mean sea level pressure mslp product from 1850 also including both terrestrial and marine icoads data at the same resolution emslp but only for the north atlanticeuropean region 2570n by 70w50e ansell et 2006 emulate made extensive use of earlier eufunded projects that digitized long daily pressure series such as wasa waves and storms in the north atlantic and improve the basic terrestrial and island station pressure data in the ispd and the marine measurements from icoads that are the basis of the above gridded datasets are being expanded and improved through the atmospheric circulation reconstructions over the earth acre initiative led by mo and will be available for euro4m the importance of atmospheric air pressure for climate change monitoring is illustrated by figure b12b from ipccwgiar4 here smhi have used station data to indicate evidence for changes in extratropical cyclone activity storminess efforts are underway at mo via the acre initiative and its links to the 20th century reanalysis project of its us collaborators to develop the combined ispd and icoads global subdaily mslp databases for climate quality surfaceobservationsonly reanalyses extending back to 1891 additional acrefacilitated historical reanalyses using only surface observations are planned to extend these reconstructions back over the last 150 years globally and for the north atlanticeuropean region to the mid 18th century the development of the combined ispd and icoads subdaily mslp dataset needed for such activities will be closely linked to euro4m activities in wp1 all of these new mslp data activities are structurally but not financially supported by gcos through the aopcoopc surface pressure working group station pressure data are rarely analyzed in isolation except for the wasa work with pressure triangles and most studies derive mslp fields for europe these fields are generally adequate but will be improved and extended back in time over both the land and oceans by the acre project improvements are required for subdaily fields and in marine data in some parts of the world and new surfaceobservationsonly reanalyses should begin to address these deficiencies pic figure b12b storm index for the british isles north sea and norwegian sea 1881 to 2004 blue circles are 95th percentiles and red crosses 99th percentiles of standardised geostrophic winds averaged over 10 sets of triangles of stations the smoothed curves are decadal filter updated by smhi from alexandersson et 2000 see figure 341 in ipccwgiar4 ecv surface and earth radiation the surface radiation budget is fundamental component of the surface energy budget that is crucial to nearly all aspects of climate the baseline surface radiation network bsrn of the world climate research programme wcrp has established the relevant measurement techniques and is now recognized as the gcos baseline network for surface radiation the bsrn provides highquality but spatially limited measurements of radiation at the surface the gcos action to expand the bsrn network increasing the number of land stations and using research ships and buoys over the ocean is an important step however additional data are needed to obtain sufficient spatial coverage for climate monitoring as with most gcos actions and plans the initiatives and financial resources must come from the scientific community principally through the member states and their nmhss satellite data can be used to monitor clouds and surface solar radiation quite well hence bsrn stations in combination with satellites are powerful option for an appropriate monitoring of the surface radiation with high accuracy and spatial coverage the international satellite cloud climatology project isccp the earth radiation budget experiment erbe as well as the cmsaf climate data records will be used within euro4m the potential of merging in situ data with satellitederived data will be investigated in wp1 in addition reanalysis data has the potential to contribute to the appropriate monitoring of radiation ecvs trentmann et 2008 has recently evaluated the thermal flux densities at the surface of the era interim dataset and concludes that this has high accuracy and can therefore be used in conjunction with satellitebased shortwave surface radiation fluxes in order to provide the surface radiation budget and its components in climate accuracy of course monitoring the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere cannot be based on surface data but needs satellite data wp24 will address the accuracy of reanalysis data by comparison with the radiation budget derived with gerbceres geostationary earth radiation budgetclouds and the earths radiant energy system and erbe data one of the radiation budget components the surface solar radiation is necessary for an efficient planning and monitoring of solar energy systems hammer et 2003 drews et 2008 surface solar radiation is also important for the satellitebased estimation of drought and evaporation wang and liang 2008 wang and qu 2007 ecv wind speed and direction this ecv is measured at many stations across europe but because of local effects studies of longerterm changes in high wind speeds during storms generally make use of daily and subdaily mslp fields from reanalyses or from the emulate and wasa projects as these are generally more consistent through time figure b12c illustrates the use of reanalysis data for the reconstruction of past extreme wind storm events the violent storms that swept western and central europe from 25 to 28 december 1999 left more than 60 dead pic figure b12c reconstruction of the 1999 christmas storms using era40 reanalysis data this example shows the wind field of 27 december 1999 at 00 utc colours indicate wind speed in beaufort scale f source ecmwf ecv surface humidity hadcruh is new dataset of monthly mean surface humidity anomalies at 55 resolution covering the period 19732003 with respect to the 19742003 climatology available at wwwhadobsorg see willett et 2007 2008 it is nearly global in coverage combining land data from observing stations and marine data from ships buoys and observing platforms the land data are sourced from version 2 of the integrated surface hourly ish dataset supplied by the national climatic data center the marine data are sourced from release 21 of icoads international comprehensive oceanatmosphere dataset for 19731997 and from ncep gts data global telecommunications system data made available through noaas national centers for environmental prediction for 19982003 hadcruh is available in specific humidity and relative humidity forms this dataset uses all available humidity observations vapour pressure relative humidity and dew point temperature euro4m will analyse the dataset for changes over the last 30 years the gts dataset will also be investigated for some of the other surface ecvs eg temperature and pressure as it will likely provide subdaily resolution for the european domain ecvs upper air temperatureupper air humiditywind speed and direction upperair temperatures humidities and wind speedsdirections from radiosondes are cornerstone of the data input to most reanalyses however improvements in the response times and radiative shielding of instruments on the sondes mean that all upperair temperatures and humidities are subject to major heterogeneities throughout the 50 yr record significant change to ascent times took place in 1957 partly explaining why era40 begins in 1958 changes to the times of the sonde ascents can affect the longterm homogeneity of the derived series through changes in the effect of radiation on the sensors as well as through the true though small diurnal cycle of atmospheric temperature some important advances in radiosonde homogeneity have been made in recent years eg thorne et 2005a b and the mo gridded radiosonde temperature dataset hadat at the national climatic data center ncdc us many of the original sonde ascents were collected or digitized in the integrated global radiosonde archive igra durre et 2006 wp2 will benefit significantly from previous work using data from both hadat homogeneity adjustments see titchner et 2008 and igra additional pre1979 ascents data homogenization by near neighbour comparisons and by reference to reanalysis feedback files eg by haimberger et 2008 will be incorporated into improved analyses for the europeannorth atlantic region ecv cloud properties cloud feedback is considered to be the single most uncertain aspect of future climate projections and is responsible for much of the wide range of estimates of climate sensitivity in climate models therefore it is vital to maintain longterm records of cloud properties satellite data for example constructed by isccp provide an appropriate basis for monitoring of cloud parameters euro4m will deliver number of new cloud property datasets produced within the framework of the cmsaf including 20 yr cloud albedo dataset monitoring of developments within isccp and liaison with aopc will ensure that the most uptodate information is used metric for evaluation of reanalysis cloud data will be developed using isccp cmsaf and cloud products derived in wp21 ecv snow cover this ecv is classed by gcos as being in the terrestrial domain but it has traditionally been measured by nmhss thus across northern and high elevation areas of europe there are long daily records of stationobserved snow cover many of which are digitally available in addition to the in situ observations satellites have measured snow cover since about 1966 fields of snow cover have been quite deficient in previous reanalyses and experiments with improved fields will be investigated within wp2 data for this ecv will also be available through interactions between euro4m and the eurocryoclim project for high latitude europe and the arctic the baseline datasets which serve as an input for euro4m their

the scientific and technical approach of euro4m has been designed to achieve the project goal and objectives as stated in section b11 in realistic measurable and specific manner within 4 years euro4m will combine an integrated european climate monitoring capacity supply with user needs demand improved data coordination and analyses will help fill gaps in the atmospheric observation system and contribute to advanced data assimilation and reanalyses high quality integrated ecv datasets and aggregated climate change products and services cibs form the major outputs of the project graphical presentation of the components as illustrated in figure b13c the activities in the 4 wps of euro4m strongly interact in order to enable euro4m to accomplish its goal of developing the capacity for and delivering the best possible and most complete gridded climate change time series and monitoring services for europe total of 4 wps is required wp1 2 and 3 form the face of the project and fit together tightly wp4 is overarching the project ensuring adequate project management see section b21 in summary wp1 and wp2 produce the data that will feed into wp3 many of the wp1 observations will also feed into the reanalysis activities in wp2 wp3 will produce the euro4m multipurpose products and services for these to be stateoftheart we need improved regional observation datasets wp1 as well as advanced regional data assimilation and reanalyses wp2 wp3 also has prime responsibility for project outreach in detail wp11 will provide highquality gridded ground truth observations feeding the cibs wp31 and serving as input for the evaluation of the regional reanalyses wp24 moreover these datasets constitute an indispensable basis for the calibration and application of 2d mesoscale downscaling in wp23 and satellite retrieval algorithms in wp12 the satellitebased datasets of wp12 also feed into the cibs and will be used for reanalysis evaluation too the data coordination activities in wp13 make additional in situ datasets accessible to wp11 and interact with the in situ component of gmes wp21 guarantees that the possibilities of regional reanalysis as an optimal integration tool for ecvs are fully exploited and links to global reanalysis outside the project the downscaling activities in this wp and in wp22 and 23 are jointly evaluated in wp24 this evaluation is partly based on the datasets developed in wp11 and wp12 it enables rigorous quantification of the capabilities of regional reanalysis and an assessment of the various methodological options in downscaling techniques developed and implemented in wp21 wp22 and wp23 the results provide elementary guidance for the appropriate derivation and interpretation of the derived products in the climate indicator bulletins wp31 wp25 will provide additional capability for the work in wp21 and wp22 through improved input data for regional and global reanalysis the dataset production and evaluation activities in wp1 and wp2 complement each other they are brought together in wp31 where the best possible multipurpose products and services will be developed wp31 makes the high quality spatial ecv data accessible at the required level of aggregation in particular the optimum results need to be based on different underlying ecv datasets the added value given to the raw data by this wp should not be underestimated the euro4m integrated climate change products and services will be produced in the form of cibs data products and services in the cibs will evolve in response to feedback from the various users through user interaction in wp32 the climate liaison team of wp32 will link user needs to the cibs the capabilities for meeting specific user requirements will ultimately depend on the quality of the raw data and hence vivid exchange of information between wp1 wp2 and the clt of wp32 is decisive in doing this wp32 will demonstrate that bridging the gap between the climate community and the user community is feasible pic figure b13c interactions between the 4 wps of euro4m plus links to the outside world see section b23 data exchange many nmhss have been made to or found it necessary to charge for the acquisition of such data especially daily to subdaily weather records this has put some nmhss data outside of the budgetary realms of research institutes organisations and agencies it may also be one of the reasons that integrated datasets of climate change information in particular extremes are typically missing in the existing data information systems such as eionet and seis see dataserviceeeaeuropaeu uniform data policy for climatological data exists in europe the network of european meteorological services eumetnet has struggled with this topic for many years now without reaching solution large differences continue to exist between individual countries and there is single european counter or portal for climatological data in euro4m we will respect the data policies of nmhss and other data providing institutions at the same time we will also respect and try to work in the spirit of gmes and wmo gmes services according to the commission ec 2008 should be fully and openly accessible as long as eu and member states security interests do not suggest otherwise this will help to promote the widest possible use and sharing of earth observation data and information in line with the proposed seis and in accordance with existing legislation such as the infrastructure for spatial information in europe inspire directive taking into account the global

components the euro4m work plan is organised as 4 interacting wps see b133 each of which are broken down into subwps tasks the rationale for this structure is described in the section graphical presentation of the components which immediately follows the descriptions of the individual wps the project structure reflects that we will combine two different but complementary approaches regional observation datasets of ecvs on the one hand wp1 and model based regional reanalysis on the other wp2 in this way we retain the best of both worlds delivering the best possible and most complete climate change monitoring services for europe wp3 gantt charts for the wps and deliverablesmilestones are shown in figure b13ab note that the names for the sub wps and deliverablesmilestones in the charts are only brief summaries of the full descriptions provided in the tables b13ad these charts provide general picture of the timing of the project more detailed interdependencies between the various tasks will be described in the section following the wp descriptions of work important to note here is that an advanced system for multidecadal regional reanalysis which will use future era boundaries will be developed in parallel to the production of multidecadal regional reanalysis dataset this will guarantee that adequate regional reanalysis data can already be used within the project

information it is important to develop some products from one or the other type of information provided trends and spatial patterns of change agree the scientific certainty gained from totally independent measurements is immense this wp will further develop stationbased gridded datasets for europe in its entirety and selected subregions these will be used in wp2 for downscaling and wp3 for integrated products and services ms will develop gridded dataset of daily precipitation for the entire alpine region for the period 1971 to 2007 or more recent use will be made of all accessible raingauge observations including the highresolution climatological and hydrological networks of alpine countries network density is critical factor for accurate quantification of precipitation in complex terrain this worktask will be based on the extension of an existing panalpine precipitation dataset frei and schär 1998 which was collated in previous activities the combination of highdensity observations with stateoftheart spatial analysis and modern data quality procedures aims at an accurate representation of mesoscale patterns particular consideration will be given to avoid spurious longterm trends due to variable station density this knowledge is also important for the other gridded datasets in this wp within euro4m the gridded precipitation dataset will provide basis for the 2dmesoscale downscaling wp23 it allows for the evaluation of regional reanalyses wp24 and it will be exploited for the identification of significant climate anomalies in recent decades including the occurrence of heavy precipitation events wp3 dwd will make the european window of the gpcc dataset available for the euro4m products and services the gpcc provides global analysis of precipitation on the earths land surface based on in situ rain gauge data this is particularly relevant in order to place the european results in the global context knmi will extent and update the ensembles gridded daily dataset for europe eobs at resolution of 25 by 25 km haylock et 2008 this dataset is developed with participation from the eumetnetecsn community see section b23 it is primarily based on the station data from the ecad project and the ensembles dataset is now maintained by knmi the eobs dataset is recognized as europes baseline dataset to serve official wmo ravi regional climate centre functionality for high resolution observational data efforts will be made to improve the spatial coverage of the daily dataset and include more variables in particular variables required for downscaling in wp2 such as snow cover plus better metadata partly using google earth and gis methods for homogenizing daily time series will be tested and applied building upon the flagging technique which is currently in use in ecad this activity is linked to the costaction home advances in homogenization methods of climate series an integrated approach which is led by mf see wwwhomogenisationorg the gridded eobs dataset which covers all of europe will be updated at 6monthly time intervals during the course of the project but nearreal time in case of emerging extreme event mf will provide some of its own regional datasets in support to the project and apply its own quality control procedures to the collected data notably mf will extend the different controls such as thresholds inter parameter consistency time evolution and spatial consistency to the collected data additionally mf will try to improve such controls by using first over france and then when possible over other regions of interest additional data such as radars models and satellites in order to qualify in the best way ground measurements used by the project notably for wp2 uea will use the latest version of the cru monthly highresolution 05 by 05 latitudelongitude datasets cru ts 3 an update of cru ts 21 mitchell and jones 2005 to assess the quality and accuracy of many of the gridded dataset products including those based on era40 available for europe in the course of development of the cru highresolution datasets which include the following variables maximum and minimum temperature precipitation rainday counts vapour pressure and cloudiness uea has gained considerable experience in the best practice of gridding and interpolation of station data for example it is rarely optimum to use the data expressed in the original measured units additionally many users take cru products to derive other fields but the approaches employed are generally suboptimal with these aspects in mind uea will develop two additional fields from cru data products potential evapotranspiration pet and palmer drought severity index pdsi fields both of which will be useful for regional climate model validation but more importantly for the online monitoring of drought across europe wp3 mo will make link between this wp and the data work mo is already doing as part of ongoing projects including the planned global reanalyses and as part of the international acre initiative in particular this work will include improvements to hadisst forcing fields and subdaily synop data in collaboration with ncdc wp12 developing gridded datasets based on longterm remote sensing data dwd the use of satellitederived data for monitoring the climate system is relatively new application the saf on climate monitoring cmsaf which is under the guidance of dwd is fully dedicated to the highquality longterm monitoring of the climate systems state and variability however the overall capacity of satellitederived data for climate monitoring has not been evaluated and used satisfactorily euro4m will enable the use of satellite data for climate monitoring by constraining their uncertainty with ground truth in situ observations euro4m therefore adds value to already existing products of eumetsatsafs in order to build consistent and continuous monitoring capability for ecvs dwd will evaluate the capacity of the saf products and methods for climate monitoring and will add satellitebased gridded datasets to the regional observation system dwd will provide 20 yr of water vapour data cloud albedo surface solar radiation and surface albedo these datasets will be used for the evaluation of the regional reanalysis in wp2 but also for multipurpose products and services in wp3 surface solar radiation surface and cloud albedo will be based on the well established heliosat method using mviri images beyer et 1996 hammer et 2003 drews et 2008 from 2005 onwards the heliosat based surface solar radiation will be merged with the ms and knmi dataset in order to take benefit of the improved capabilities in monitoring of clouds from the seviri satellite instrument onboard of msg the ms dataset is based on an optimized heliosat method applied to seviri for the alpine region characterised by an improved cloud and snow discrimination and consideration of topography effects dürr and zelenka 2008 dürr et 2008 thermal radiation fluxes at the earth surface from reanalysis will be used to supplement the satellitebased shortwave radiation fluxes in order to generate long time series of surface radiation budget the gpcc precipitation dataset rudolf and schneider 2005 beck et 2005 is well established global dataset of precipitation based on ground measurements however it lacks information over the ocean this drawback can be overcome by data fusion of the gpcc dataset with the hoaps precipitation retrieved from satellites over the ocean the hamburgs ocean atmosphere parameters from satellite hoaps has been developed at the mpi hamburg grassl et 2000 the algorithm to retrieve precipitation is presented in bauer and schluessel 1993 it will be investigated if the spatial extrapolation of in situ precipitation measurements gpcc can be improved by the use of the knmi satellite derived precipitation dataset provided in wp12 especially in regions with relative low density of ground measurements method for appropriate data fusion of these datasets will be developed and applied in order to provide the user community optimal global precipitation dataset which covers at least 20 years finally dwd will provide 45 dataset of water vapour based on the international atovs processing package iapp li et 2000 and 20 yr water vapour dataset over the oceans based on hoaps knmi will deliver highresolution datasets of cloud properties precipitation and surface solar irradiance ssi cloud properties optical thickness particle effective radius and water path are retrieved routinely within the cmsaf from msgseviri observations using the cloud physical properties cpp algorithm roebeling et 2006 ssi and precipitation constitute the most important effects of clouds at the surface their observation from space complements the surface measurement records because of the high spatial resolution and better coverage of satellites precipitation occurrence and intensity are derived from retrieved cloud properties showing good agreement with weather radar observations over the netherlands roebeling and holleman 2008 ssi is determined by combining the cloud property retrievals with other variables most importantly total precipitable water the ssi product has been validated with pyranometer measurements in the netherlands deneke et 2008 data will be delivered for the msg time frame 2005 to present which may be extended backwards in time in later stage additional validation activities for ssi and precipitation will be performed to assess the quality of the products outside the netherlands applications of the datasets include verification of reanalysis data wp2 downscaling wp2 and guidance for spatial interpolation of insitu measurements wp1 mo will generate maximum and minimum surface air temperature products from satellite data available in the landsaf these will be made available along side the gridded air temperature datasets based on surface observations see ecv surface temperature in section b12 these efforts will result in blended satellitein situ dataset which will aid heat wave analysis etc in addition sunshine hours will be estimated over the uk and extended to the european region where possible the results will be used in wp3 wp13 data coordination and access to national archives urv although past and ongoing european and national funded projects together with international and national bodies initiatives have increased the availability of historical climate data over europe mainly for air pressure temperature and precipitation data the current availability of historical surface climate data is still highly inadequate this is particularly true over key but scarcely documented regions such as southern and eastern mediterranean as well as for other ecvs than temperature or precipitation therefore it is still urgently needed to fill the gap for surface climatological data and enhance the availability of longtermhighquality surface climate data at the finer temporal and spatial scales while some of the existing components of the atmospheric observation system are truly operational several of the groundbased in situ and remote sensing networks are funded and operated by agencies in support of research programmes so their continuing operation is by means assured similarly many of the data analysis and assimilation systems are developed and funded on research budgets often the data from these systems are not made available and included in integrated datasets they remain stand alone the assessments of their potential contribution to the european atmospheric observation system will be pursued in this wp including institutional and international aspects urv will work together with gmesisowg gcos ecsn acre medare which urv lead etc in order to identify deficiencies of the european longterm climate data availability and accessibility coordinate new actions for targeted data rescue over europe and ensure an enhanced accessibility to climate data produced by past and ongoing european and international projects and national archives urv will carry out costbenefit analysis of undertaking data rescue dare activities and assess availabilityaccessibility of historical climate datasets for relevant ecvs specifically it will work together with the medare community to improve accessibility to historical climate data over the greater mediterranean region gmr in general and over eastern and southern mediterranean arid and semiarid areas in particular finally urv will subject the new recovereddigitized ecvs records to quality control and homogenization assessment using the techniques recommended by the costaction home in order to ensure they are of highquality the data which are made available will be included in the gridded datasets of wp11 mo will contribute to this effort and use as its underpinning framework existing linkages to the international acre initiative plus specific projects covering parts of the european region eurocryoclim in the arctic eumetnetecsn for europe and medare medclivar and the fp7 circe project for the mediterranean it will also link to other regional to subregional projects such as baltex including the baltic assessment of climate change nordic climate cooperation nordklim and the international association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists from the new independent states of the former soviet union intas especially the project snow cover changes over northern eurasia during the last century sccone mo will work closely with international data rescue and recovery initiatives such as wmo dare and similar activities within clivar and gcos eg the gcos regional action plan for the mediterranean basin nmaro will liaise with nmhss in eastern europe to obtain better access to the national climatological archives in this subregion earlier experience has shown that assigning national database experts only simple data provider role is counterproductive the national experts know the regional characteristics and limitations of their archived data and this knowledge can add value when integrating these data into european datasets the correct treatment of access to the national archives will form an example of good practice in the sensitive domain of data exchange demonstrating winwin situation for all stakeholders also for capacity building more active involvement of national climatologists is crucial nmaro will facilitate integration of additional data in european datasets deliverables gridded

improvement of input data for reanalyses uea description of work wp21 building capability for advanced regional data assimilation mo although multidecade regional reanalysis with stateoftheart assimilation system will be made as part of the project see 22 this work package will make significant further improvement towards setting very advanced regional reanalysis system in place and demonstrate its capabilities mo will develop regional atmospheric data assimilation reanalysis system and demonstrate its effectiveness thanks to the unified model system the model used will be stateoftheart for both climate and nwp applications the system will be based on the met office hadley centres regional climate model and the regional assimilation used for its operational north atlantic and europe nae nwp configuration the september 2008 operational nae assimilation uses 4dvar with 12km36km resolution plus latent heat nudging of precipitation data rd is underway for an upgrade in 2009 which will replace the latent heat nudging by 4dvar assimilation of the same surface precipitation estimates the observational database used will be that gathered at ecmwf for era enhanced by other packages in this proposal in particular 2dimensional accumulated precipitation estimates boundary conditions will be from erainterim or later reanalysis if available sst will be that used in erainterim ie ostia since there is significant development effort in this activity the results will not be in time for feeding into further downscaling in wp23 wp22 dynamical downscaling of era smhi current stateofthe art dynamical downscaling for an extended multiyear period will be made as part of euro4m with comparatively cheaper system computingwise than developed in wp21 in this way the first results of regional reanalysis can already be used within euro4m for the products and services delivered in wp3 smhi will complement the dynamical reanalysis by mo using the hirlam system smhi will perform hirlam 25 km dynamical reanalysis hirlama programme it will employ the hirlam 3d variational analysis and the hirlam grid point model for the assimilation gustafsson et 2000 and lindskog et 2001 conventional observations synop airep and amdar buoys temp will be used as well as meteosat wind observations the observed data will be analysed in 6 h windows and analyses will be produced every 6 h the lateral boundary conditions will come from the global era40 19601988 or erainterim 19892010 reanalysis large scale forcing may be applied every 12 or 24 h from those datasets mainly in order to benefit from the use of satellite radiances in the era reanalyses which involved lot of quality control and bias corrections those data are important for defining the large scale features present also inside the limited area chosen this large scale forcing can be replaced by large scale constraint jk that is being developed in hirlam the hirlam reanalysis provides downscaling from global resolution 125 km for era40 and 80 km for erainterim to 25 km in the limited area the increased resolution provides more detail and realism due to both the 3dvar analysis of observations but also to great deal from the 25 km grid point model used in the forecast steps of the assimilation wp23 2dmesoscale downscaling mf the 2dmesoscale downscaling techniques used in this wp provide added value for surface and nearsurface fields because they are able to include additional observations and work in higher resolution than the regional reanalysis smhi will develop 2ddownscaling system where features from the present smhi system mesan are utilized together with an improved description of predictors in combination with developments within the safran system at mf in pilot project in 2007 smhi applied the present mesan system to 2ddownscaling for europe eramesan using era40 as background first guess fields in this wp the results from wp22 will be used as background fields for the 2ddownscaling possible spatial resolution for the resulting dataset would be of the order of 312 km depending on variable an improved mesan also used in eramesan jansson et 2007 mesoscale analysis system will use many more observations than those used in the 3dvar the advantage of the mesan is that it is 2dimensional only and geared specifically for faithful gridded analysis of surface and near surface fields for nowcasting and climate analysis the present structure functions which have been developed with basic parameterizations for topography and water cover will be further elaborated through scaling for predictors like topography distance to sea etc the necessary first guess fields will be obtained from the dataset that results from wp22 observations to be used are data from ecmwf plus other quality controlled data which will be made available in usable format by wp1 products will comprise not only the modelassisted analyses of ecvs produced by data assimilation but also metadata providing information on the quality control and biascorrection of the assimilated satellite and in situ data these will be used in wp3 for uncertainty information mf will downscale the 3d reanalysis from wp22 using lowlevel datasets 2d analysis techniques and land surface modelling this will provide added value through additional observations and over orography mf will also improve the 2d downscaling software in particular the data qc and interface with the 3d reanalysis as the next step depending on the results of evaluations in wp24 mf in collaboration with smhi will incorporate either some developments the hourly distribution of precipitation or specific ideas for mountain areas from the safran software in the mesan system some developments already used in some nwp systems such as new structure functions to improve the coastal and the topography effects navascuès 1997 rodriguez et 2003 snow analysis using the classical observations and satellite pictures will be investigated the new system mesansafran will be able to also use the long time series of observations that are not used in nwp including minimum and maximum temperature etc the datasets for this activity will come from wp1 finally the new system will be coupled with surface and hydrological scheme in order to improved surface variables and in particular the climatology of snow cover wp24 evaluation ms the activities in this wp aim at evaluation of the different reanalysisdownscaled datasets it brings together the evaluation activities of most of the partners involved in the production of the gridded datasets the stationbased and satellitebased datasets developed in wp1 will be used together with existing other datasets and reanalysis products the goal is to improve the reanalysis downscaling systems and to provide uncertainty information for the datasets that are used in wp3 one issue that will receive attention when synthesising the results of this wp is the fact that some of the downscaling systems have been calibrated and tested for one particular region or country how do they perform elsewhere in europe ms will evaluate the regional reanalysis with respect to the representation of daily to decadal precipitation variations in the alpine region as reference the highresolution gridded precipitation dataset developed in wp11 will be used the high station density underlying this dataset will permit for an accurate upscaling to the resolution of the regional reanalysis which is essential when evaluating characteristics of heavy precipitation special consideration will also be given to the uncertainties of the gridding spatialisation procedure when assessing the reanalysis mo will demonstrate the value of the system developed in wp21 by comparing year or two of results from erainterim the met office regional climate model nested in erainterim assimilation of erainterim observations into the same regional model assimilation of erainterim observations and processed precipitation observations downscaling of erainterim and assimilation of some observations in different model in wp22 smhi will compare the naebased reanalysis system under development at the mo wp21 against the stateoftheart hirlambased system used for the multidecade reanalysis at smhi from wp22 this comparison will be important to assess the possible benefit from more advanced system for future regional reanalysis the comparison is possible towards the end of the project this leaves open the future possibility of multimodel reanalysis as means of assessing uncertainty mf will build on earlier evaluation of eramesan jansson et 2007 by smhi which focussed on the territory of sweden where most observational data were available mf will concentrate on another area and compare eramesan with sim safranisbamodcou habets et 2008 qunitanasegui et 2008 analysis over france for the timeperiod 19802004 more local comparison in mountainous area will be done with the safrannivo analysis which is considered as reference over the alps durand et 2008 this will provide inside of the gain of more observational data and higher resolution system more importantly the newly developed mesansafran system will be evaluated the snow albedo computed by the snow scheme will be compared with landsaf data wp2 comparison of the surface fluxes latent and sensible heat with insitu measurement available in europe cabauw sodankyla lindenberg will demonstrate the physical realism of the system dwd will verify the reanalysis data for cloud parameters surface solar radiation surface albedo water vapour precipitation and top of atmosphere radiation flux densities by comparing to existing cmsaf products and to products generated within wp12 an example of verification of reanalysis data is published in babst et 2008 dwd will support satellite intercalibration activities in order to support the generation of homogenized and intercalibrated radiances for specific satellite sensors dwd will investigate the effect of satellite calibration uncertainties and inhomogeneities on cloud radiation temperature and humidity reanalysis products including precipitation the results will be analysed and suggestions for improvements will be drawn and reported to the reanalysis centres wp25 improvement of input data for reanalyses uea era40 and ncepncar use as input files historic satellite and in situ radiosonde and surface data these files are essentially archives of all the operational input to weather forecasts over many decades and have been put together by ncepncar changes have been made to these operational inputs since the data were collected operational analyses reject obvious outliers in real time but over the last 50 years there have been considerable advances in the homogeneity testing of climate data see eg thorne et 2005ab and haimberger et 2008 the purpose of this wp is to determine exactly what is in this operational archive it has only ever been used as reanalysis input data and b to replace and upgrade where this is possible these data with improved datasets available nationally and internationally if we expect subsequent generations of reanalyses to be improvements on earlier versions it seems essential that we make the effort to improve the basic input these expensive reprocessing operations require as climate models underlying each reanalysis improve with time then so should the basic input data uea together with mo and in cooperation with the institutes performing the reanalysis will analyse the improvement of capability for reanalyses through better basic input data major example of this is the important radiosonde input number of papers op cit have made significant advances in adjusting radiosonde data for biases resulting from changes to sensors instruments etc adjustments which can be in the range 15c for temperature and larger in relative magnitude for humidity greater at higher elevations there is also dramatic increase over time in the amount of data available for assimilation in reanalysis especially after the introduction of operational satellite observing systems in the 1970s the data assimilated in era40 will be reviewed and their importance deficiencies and any remedial action already undertaken since era40 will be tabulated for different epochs improvements in historic satellite datasets are expected to result from data reassessments eg against 20th century reanalysis project results and reprocessing by eumetsat and other satellite agencies see also wp12 emphasis in this wp will accordingly be placed on in situ data in particular for the presatellite period the sets of surface and radiosonde data assimilated in era40 will be assessed with regard to the amounts of data they contain the spatial coverage and the periods of time covered this will guide which of the many other archives of synoptic surface and radiosonde data should be evaluated and if necessary reformatted or digitized to improve the quantity and quality of conventional data for assimilation in future reanalyses the principal surface archive is ish see earlier under the ecv surface humidity and we will assess the degree of commonality between this and the surface component of the reanalysis archive it is also expected that the hadat radiosonde archive thorne et 2005ab will prove useful for homogeneity assessment to minimise timedependent biases with sondes together with additional information from reanalysis feedback files haimberger 2005 homogeneity will initially consider temperature measures but will extend to the humidity sensors as progress in other projects permits the igra archive of individual ascents will be accessed to determine how many extra ascents can be added provided several quality criteria are met emphasis in these homogeneity assessments and additional data will be on europe for the period prior to 1979 but will extend to other land regions of the world where sonde coverage is poor in particular the entire british antarctic survey sonde archive for the antarctic will be added in determining which additional data need to be digitized there will be active consultation with wp1 bias adjustment of much of the basic satellite input data has also made advances since its initial operational use the msu series of instruments is good example here many similar adjustments will also have been made to daily surface temperature and pressure data and improved datasets can be incorporated considerable additional data have also been digitised from the 1950s1980s that were not internationally exchanged at the time and these will also be added to the data bank deliverables new stateoftheart naebased

bulletins cibs are examples of sound useroriented multipurpose products for future gmes services using the output from wp1 wp2 these cibs will provide scientific input for policy implementation and nearreal time reporting for emerging extreme events in consultation with key user groups via wp32 this wp will develop integrated data products and services based on ecvs for the region of europe and where appropriate the northern hemisphere and globally among the products are climate indicators at the appropriate level of aggregation and processing for the main user applications clearly these cibs must be scientific but importantly they must also be easy to understand in relation to questiondecisionactivity after the end date of the project these can all become part of the gmes implementation services on climate change knmi together with nmaro and mo will produce the cibs and identify and summarise in nontechnical manner significant climate anomalies and features including uncertainty estimates dramatic examples which will be used to illustrate potential cib impact are the summer of 2002 with widespread flooding in central and eastern europe the european heat wave of 2003 the european summer of 2005 with wet and dry extremes the winter of 20052006 with cold and warm extremes the winter of 20062007 as the very likely warmest for more that half millennium and the summer of 2007 with widespread drought and fires in large parts of the central and eastern mediterranean this wp will revisit these events and describe how the use of monitoring information will significantly improve with this project in place experience shows that after an extreme event winter storm flooding in nearreal time there is usually only information available from individual countries the larger scale picture is missing and cannot simply be derived from raw data thus an advantage of the baseline cibs would be to provide in nearreal time larger scale continental picture of weatherclimate extremes that complements the national information provided by nmhss the same is true for longer lasting extremes such as heat waves or drought periods with euro4m we aim to be able to quickly and efficiently compile and present broader higher detailed picture of european climate anomalies and their impacts than was previously possible cibs will be published both as bulletins electronic documentsnewsletters as well as being provided through webportal including access to the associated data series gridded datasets and editorial texts the information will be based directly on the climate change time series of ecvs made available in wp1 and wp2 note that the optimum information will rarely come consistently from single source the system for producing cibs will be made

individual countries large river basins and europe as whole wp32 climate liaison team dwd as potential future gmes service on climate change monitoring euro4m must interface directly with the full range of intermediate and enduser requirements including disaster prevention health energy water resources ecosystems forestry agriculture transport tourism and biodiversity the climate liaison team clt developed in this wp will establish communication process which responds to information flow in both directions and evolves through time so that users can both obtain and influence the nature user driven data format content and delivery style of the information they need while understanding the strengths and limitations of the monitoring products in doing so the team will establish sustainable links between euro4m and all gmes services and geo societal benefit areas dwd will coordinate the clt as crosscutting activity of the project through their mediation the useroriented results of euro4m research will feedback directly into applications and impact assessments relevant to european societal and community needs the stakeholders impact community and decision makers needs in terms of climate data and products cover large range of raw or derived variables indicators spatial and temporal scales uncertainty assessment at various levels of complexity the stakeholder community is however diverse and not well organized this will make it difficult to obtain uniform feedback for the multipurpose products therefore dwd will review existing reports and information about user needs and will generate meta userrequirement document specifically addressing the intersection of user needs across the range of user communities dwd will also generate data storage and dissemination document describing the user driven and inspirecompliant infrastructure used for these tasks in wp1 and wp2 see section b24 this will provide necessary links to the wmo information system wis which

drawing up the 18 month implementation plan on rolling basis review the progress in each wp and decide on success criteria to proceed with or stop an activity the mb is also responsible for the coordination of crosscutting themes it will be very important to ensure that these crosscutting activities are actively coordinated across the wps in order to avoid duplication and to integrate the results of the project in these areas the crosscutting nature of these activities means that they are highly interdisciplinary involving work in all wps this will involve the development of common clearly defined unambiguous terminology and definitions of for example extreme events and standardization of uncertainty estimates managing these cross cutting activities most effectively will be carried out primarily through small working meetings focussed on these issues and on more regular basis through email discussion groups larger workshops on the cross cutting activities will be organised together with dissemination activities part of the euro4m website will for example be dedicated to crosscutting issues the membership of the mb will be made up of all the wpleaders plus representatives from the ec currently the wpleaders are wp1 regional observation datasets phil jones uea wp2 regional reanalysis dale barker mo wp3 useroriented information and climate change products roxana bojariu nmaro wp4 project management coordination and sustainability albert klein tank knmi ec representative virginia puzzolo rea coordinator the euro4m coordinator leads wp4 project management and is responsible for overall coordination of the project he reports to the european commission and chairs the mb project office the project office will be responsible for the routine administration of the project and the scientific direction it consists of the coordinator and support staff at the coordinators office the project office will monitor progress and facilitate communication between the different groups organise the scheduled meetings of the project as well as small working sessions between groups when necessary the project office will also liaise with partners on the financial administration of the project and the provision of necessary documentation to the commission wpleaders the wpleaders are responsible for coordinating the various wps they also contribute to the top level management of the project through participation in the management board advisory board the advisory board will add value to euro4m through commenting on the overall science plans and directions and on the progress in achieving the plans it will consist of key representatives from the third party participants linked to the project see section b23 the advisory board will meet once year and at the start of the project to suggest collaborations key task for them is to ensure that the project remains directly relevant to the gmes and geo process in consultation with the commission the positions in this board will be filled in with the following persons andré jol eea tbc stephan bojinski gcos tbc and pm national or regional environment agency from italy or greece tbc note that the strategic role of the advisory board will be revised if an official expert group will be established by the commission to support the definition of the gmes climate change service during the life time of euro4m risk assessment and related communication strategy for the successful implementation of the euro4m aims we rely partly on the cooperation and responsiveness of data holding institutions which are not participating overall we are confident that we can achieve our objectives as the interest in this project from the community of national responsible institutions and their organisations is very high the links to third party participants already established in particular eea ecmwf and eumetnet see section b23 will help to solve any potential risk one of these risks is access to weather and climate data which is often restricted due to intellectual property rights see data exchange this also affects the results of earlier eu research projects as result major costs may arise from access to meteorological data the fact that the consortium as whole represents key climate change data holding institutions in europe and the fact that the consortium members have been active in most of the related eu research projects in the past places us in the best possible position to overcome this problem in case data policy restrictions hamper the work the coordinator will bring the issue to the responsible parties including the eumetnet council in the case that internal disputes will occur during the course of the project we will begin at the source of the dispute and expand outwards until an equitable solution has been reached the participant tries to settle the dispute with its respective wpleader if not successful the management board mb see section b21 will develop strategy and intervene to settle the dispute with the possibility of sanctions in case of disagreement within the mb the coordinator will take the final decision and he will be responsible for its execution the coordinator will report the case and its solution or consequences to the ec appointed project officer b22 beneficiaries

indicated that they strongly endorse the project see the support letters in appendix b and with whom special arrangements will be set up through letters of agreement or memorandums of understanding include eea ecmwf eumetnet and gcos eea is expected to play an important coordination role in the in situ component of gmes ec 2008 which euro4m will take into account eea have strong interest in the availability of multidecadal and high resolution climate monitoring information and data beyond current state oftheart they will act as one of the principal customers for cibs which feed into their environmental assessment reports for europe see figure b11ab ecmwf is suggested within gmes as technical centre that coordinates the atmosphere network and ensures the provision of operational atmosphere services ec 2008 therefore clear link between ecmwf and euro4m will exist ecmwf will also provide necessary boundaries and observations for the regional reanalysis in euro4m whereas euro4m will deliver valuable input for future ecmwf global reanalysis eumetnet in their european climate support network ecsn aims at providing sustainable high quality and climate reference services tailored to the users needs euro4m will work together with eumetnetecsn on the production of gridded climate data sets based on dense networks of station observations particularly in the eurogrid proposal which is in preparation by ecsn members for the eumetnet council as followup to s eurogrid gcos requirements for global climate monitoring are largely met with euro4m in place euro4m is positioned to form the implementation component of the atmospheric sections of gcos the focus on extremes and weather related hazards in euro4m even provides more detail than is strictly necessary for global climate monitoring the ambitious scope of the project means euro4m must be implemented as collaborative project to span this entire range demands multi disciplinary critical mass with support from operational national meteorological agencies professional data centres international and european project teams universities and climate analysis centres euro4m needs consortium linking eu member accession and candidate state institutions and links to international initiatives which have scientific expertise and ongoing responsibilities for atmospheric data networks databases and operational monitoring only then will the project ensure that scientists decision makers and application communities have the best data products indicator abstractions and support for their particular needs good illustration of the need for integrated efforts is the summer of 2005 with wet extremes floods in romania and the alpine areas and dry extremes forest fires in portugal and spain high quality integrated monitoring products for these events were hard to obtain online in particular products that use all available data sources to place these events in the context of longterm climate variability and change the euro4m consortium contains europes leading expertise on the monitoring of climate change four beneficiaries have been heavily involved in the production of the ipccwgiar4 as lead author 3 or coordinating lead author 1 therefore the group has considerable experience in what it takes from scientific point of view to gather the information needed to prepare high quality policy relevant assessments many of the beneficiaries have already successfully cooperated in number of eu projects and have welldeveloped capacity to collaborate effectively and reach important scientific goals together however this project forms unique opportunity to integrate the entire community for the first time in order to achieve major advances in the key science issues in harmonizing the monitoring of climate change and extremes in summary the consortium possesses the scientific and technical experience to administer and implement project of the size and complexity of the proposed project number of euro4m core beneficiaries have experience in the coordination of eu projects in which wpleaders have played major roles leading wps this will directly benefit the current consortium euro4m consortium beneficiaries are also strategically placed to liaise with wide range of international and national bodies which will strongly leverage the euro4m resources in particular all european nmhss are linked to euro4m via its close association with ecmwf eumetnet eumetsat and their joint european meteorological infrastructure emi these linkages and the overall expertise and experience of the beneficiaries will ensure the success of euro4m as well as providing mechanism for feeding the project results into the international domain b24 resources to be committed the substantial resources requested overall for euro4m reflect the ambitious scope of the project even with budget of this magnitude partner institutions will need to contribute significant additional resources more importantly euro4m needs to use to the largest extent possible existing capacities the expertise and experience of the beneficiaries in each wp together with the degree of european and international cooperation make the work feasible within the level of resources available the total grant requested from the eu is 4 million euros m broken down as shown in table b24a wp name k 1 regional observation datasets 1470 2 regional reanalysis 1710 3 useroriented information and climate change products 540 4 project management coordination and sustainability 280 table b24a breakdown of total grant requested amongst euro4m wps most of the budget is used to hire personnel small fraction is for computing and travel from the total budget of 4 m roughly 80 will be spent on science to make available high quality ecv datasets in wp1 and wp2 the other 20 will be spent on integrated products at the required level of aggregation and processing and management we believe this breakdown is justified because european climate change monitoring requires firm scientific basis focusing on existing datasets and systems only would result in products and services that are far from the forefront of scientific developments about 7 of the overall budget is dedicated to management this small amount implies that large part of the support needed will come from either the coordinators home institute eg for hosting the euro4m website and from the home institutes of the wpleaders data storage and dissemination huge amount of observational and reanalysis data will be produced in wp1 and wp2 these data will be analysed within the project and used for the multipurpose products developed in wp3 wp3 will make an inventory of raw data needs by users outside the project as part of the clt activities we anticipate the need for euro4m data after the end of the project therefore the main datasets will be secured for at least 5 yr after the project ends this is possible with the allocated resources only by virtue of exploiting existing infrastructure to the full and capitalising on the benefits associated with an adherence to standards and interoperability data sharing within euro4m will follow serviceoriented approach adopting common standards on metadata data models and network services as described by inspire and the geoss architecture and data committee mo leads the special group within eumetnet called inspimet which looks after the implementation rules of inspire for meteorological and climatological data and services following these rules will ensure global connectivity and interoperability also providing appropriate links to the wmo information system wis the inspirecompliant infrastructure will enable considerable datasharing efficiencies to be realised between euro4m and the various gmes services requiring access to climaterelated data wp3 will describe the infrastructure that is used for the datasets produced in euro4m justification of resources by wp wp1 regional observation datasets the range of activities to be undertaken in wp1 has close linkages and co operation with ongoing european and international initiatives and infrastructures we rely on large number of facilities instruments and services owned and operated at national regional and international levels inside and outside the eu the work in this wp is designed in way that recognizes that the in situ infrastructure is developed and maintained by member states and should remain their responsibility ec 2008 the funding is used for paneuropean integration which contributes to globally coordinated data collection and exchange the range of expertise in wp1 embraces both long experience in climate monitoring and dataset development of specific ecvs and ongoing involvements on european and international scientific bodies that have developed the current best practises and protocols for such activities this allows for maximum optimal utilisation of the resources available the data products will be stored and disseminated using existing data infrastructures including the knmi climate explorer climexpknminl and cmsaf web user service wp2 regional reanalysis this wp gains cost effectiveness by building on developments already funded leverage in particular the work packages wp213 build on the nwp data assimilation system which are operational at mo smhi and mf similar use of welltried operational systems has been characteristic of most successful reanalysis projects the infrastructure that needs to be exploited to the full in wp2 is partly from ecmwf ecmwf is the leading nwp centre in the world resulting from 30 yr investment of its 25 european member and cooperating states its capability to undertake global reanalysis derives both from this core investment and from the external investments that have been made in past reanalysis projects by the european union and supporting institutions outside europe wp2 will use boundary conditions and the observational database infrastructure and expertise on observational bias and quality from the global era reanalysis in particular the intermediate reanalyses in wp22 can be undertaken by the project only because they exploit the era40 and the new erainterim reanalysis being undertaken by ecmwf and the extensive infrastructure and experience built up as result of ecmwfs operational and earlier reanalysis activities reanalysis is the tool that is generally seen as the ultimate tool for integration of all climate change ecv data as indicated in section b11 it will take some time before this ideal situation is reached but the euro4m investment will strongly contribute to making this happen wp3 useroriented information and climate change products this wp will introduce develop and implement new cibs that provide integrated climate change information to different user groups the cibs form the main outcome of euro4m and may develop into future operational gmes service on climate change monitoring that directly addresses the user needs the share of the budget dedicated to this wp is therefore fully justified it can even be considered low but wp3 will fully profit and build upon the work in the other wps and the extensive national and international competence amongst the euro4m beneficiaries the user interaction aspects in this wp will be supplemented by work already performed within the cmsaf and the user liaison work already in place at national level all of the beneficiaries in wp3 have means of asking user feedback in place at national level these networks will form the basis for the european clt together with other international networks such as the eranet circle the work in wp32 also includes other activities such as the preparation and implementation of two training workshops the fact that this wp receives the lowest share of the budget reflects that the cib and clt work is less labour intensive compared with the scientific work in wp1 and wp2 wp4 project management coordination and sustainability the provision of separate wp for project management coordination and sustainability reflects the recognition that project of this scale and ambition must be very efficiently managed if the project is to fully deliver its extensive plans knmi will coordinate the euro4m project this will involve organising kickoff meeting for the project and organising euro4m general assembly and management board meetings see wp4 description developing euro4m portal website project brochures and logo also the project coordinator will maintain regular communication with the ec monitor the progress of the project and submit management progress reports and scientific and technical progress reports to the ec substantial management effort will also go into the plan for sustaining and maintaining the euro4m cibs as gmes climate change monitoring service and into organising the final euro4m conference showing the major project results and the way ahead the small management budget for wpleaders is needed for travelling to the management board meetings communication and information exchange between partners keeping track of progress in particular for the deliverables that are due in year 3 and 4 of the project and settling disputes within the work packages if applicableto this will guarantee that the work flow and reporting from each individual wp evolves according to plan justification of other direct costs by beneficiary for each beneficiary the table below specifies the other direct

management 0 b3 potential impact b31 strategic impact euro4m will contribute to establishing data archive of systematic observational data related to the climate system the climate change time series will be based on the optimal combination of regional observation datasets of essential climate variables ecvs and model based regional reanalysis continuous record of ecvs will be developed coherent with unfccc requirements euro4m will contribute to the consistency of such dataset as well as to sustainable and transparent access to such data for global climate scientific and operational communities this paves the way for sustainable provision compliant with the requirements of climate analysis communities the high costs and joint responsibilities of climate monitoring have always favoured international cooperation which helps to avoid duplication and promotes sharing of information the world weather watch www of the wmo is very positive example of successful international cooperation unfortunately many national climate monitoring systems still operate independently exchanging little or data or information significant temporal and spatial gaps exist and therefore european integration is necessary by providing complete and accurate picture of the history of our atmosphere throughout the period of quantitative human observation the regional reanalysis activity eventually provides basic input material for large variety of activities in the domains of science policy and applications in addition many potential users see little of the data produced and are not offered data information products and services tailored to their needs for instance decision makers and policymakers need information summaries in the form of indicators and indices which are presently neither readily available nor based on sound scientific understanding and indisputable evidence as illustrated in figure b31a aggregated solar energy maps are needed rather than the underlying raw satellite data without these summaries it will be difficult to move into the sustainable path where according to the eu sustainable development strategy environmental protection goes hand in hand with economic prosperity and social cohesion through the development of internationally recognised datasets feedback and user interaction protocols euro4m will work to develop new high quality data products and services for the evaluation of severe climatic events that will aid both intermediate and endusers whether institutional civil society organisations eg the red crossred crescent or from the private sector eg reinsurance euro4m will initiate and facilitate dialogues between scientists and endusers leading to better understanding among scientists on the information needs of end users and better understanding of the endusers on how the available data products can be understood the euro4m system has the potential to evolve into future gmes service on climate change monitoring that is fully complimentary and supporting the existing operational services the results and outputs of euro4m will also provide new way to support climatepolicyrelated research at the national and local scale national decision makers and local authorities will be able to utilise the stateoftheart euro4m data products and services for their country or region as input to climate change assessments and the formulation of adaptation and mitigation strategies it is the longer multidecadal time scale addressed in euro4m that is needed for governments to minimize and adapt to the societal and environmental impacts of climate variability and change european countries can directly use the results of the proposed project for their national communications on climate change policies which are written requirement for the conference of the parties of the unfccc and include national gcos implementation activities pic figure b31a map of calculated solar energy in typical year source cmsaf lead by dwd new research initiatives high quality highresolution data products from euro4m will provide the information basis for new generations of research initiatives eg initialization and evaluation of earth system models climate change detection and attribution studies and wider societal industrial and environmental user applications eg climate risk impact assessment study of socioeconomic effects of extreme climate events reducing loss of life and property from disasters managing the consequences of climate change development of integrated management strategies euro4m will provide vital stimulus for the next generation of reanalyses including those extending further back in time analyses of observations used in existing reanalysis products and those that could have been used will highlight what can be achieved if all available observations are improved and used where possible these new research initiatives fully comply with the recommendations for future eu integrated climate research resulting from the ipccar4 which have been discussed at the international symposium future climate impacts and responses organised by the european commission research directorate general in brussels 1920 november 2007 b32 plan for the use and dissemination of foreground dissemination andor exploitation plans euro4m provides an exciting and unique opportunity to bring together existing meteorological services universities research institutions and programs in order to provide seamless integration of climate change data and information flows and feedbacks the proposed climate indicator bulletins cibs see wp31 and climate liaison team clt see wp32 will provide framework for new generation of flexible products that foster better dialogue between data providers and data users and integration of enduser requirements for environmental and societal applications the effective dissemination strategy includes the identification of the target audience at regional and global levels by the clt an analysis of relevant interested stakeholders will be carried out and list of all other relevant stakeholders will be produced then the most suitable communications programs and products meetings conferences seminars workshops publications brochures and leaflets will be identified and timeframe will be defined for their delivery as specified in wp3 in particular the cibs will be used to demonstrate the project outcomes to all participating and interested stakeholders all project activities related documents and results published materials including training materials and reports and events announcements will be regularly posted on the project website the knowledge and expertise developed in the project will be passed on to the young scientists and engineers in training through university professors involved who teach at their institutions and supervise phd and graduate students chances will be provided for young scientists to be integrated into and gain experience in high level european research and international collaboration national workshops will facilitate dialogue between the scientific institutes involved and representatives of operational sectors specific communication activities targeted at the general public schools and the press will be developed in order to stimulate interest in youth audiences to attract future scientists in the broad fields of geo sciences and to increase public awareness about climate change and the risks of extreme weather events leading to better integration of these risks in the policies and programs of operational sectors in addition communication activities will also address educational outreach to the public with respect to basic knowledge about climate change data storage and dissemination huge amount of observational and reanalysis data will be produced in wp1 and wp2 the raw data from euro4m will be distributed mainly through existing systems which can be accessed from dedicated euro4m webbased data portal these data will be analysed within the project and used for the multipurpose products developed in wp3 wp3 will make an inventory of raw data needs by users outside the project as part of the clt activities we anticipate the need for euro4m data after the end of the project therefore the main datasets and the webbased data portal will be secured for at least 5 yr after the project ends this is possible with the allocated resources only by virtue of exploiting existing infrastructure to the full and capitalising on the benefits associated with an adherence to standards and interoperability educational links and capacity building euro4m will foster better integration of research laboratories and operational meteorological agencies in education programs the project will catalyse program of visiting scientists and postdoctoral positions through existing institutions emphasis will focus on fostering interactions between existing new accession and candidate eu states and neighbouring countries in order to promote common approaches and develop consensus best practice for climate data series of workshops will be organised and specialised collaborations will be sponsored on specific topics of relevance to the project the cmsaf at dwd has already established training group which is operating in an international network in cooperation with eumetsat the involvement of universities in the consortium means that the euro4m approach and data products will be incorporated in existing earth system education programs euro4m funding will support masters phd and post doctoral fellowships at some of the participant institutions the consortium will also engender access to developing countries which will be amongst the largest potential beneficiaries of international co operation in earth observation the latter will be done through liaising with the series of worldwide workshops peterson and manton 2008 see also klein tank et 2006 organised by the joint expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi of the ccl clivar and jcomm peterson et 2001 the euro4m coordinator is currently also cochair of this expert team this will complement the gmes activities in the field of capacity building as discussed at the lisbon meeting in december 2007 and contributes to the nairobi work programme on impacts vulnerability and adaptation to climate change of the unfccc in addition outreach activities on data rescue preservation digitization and homogenization techniques and procedures programmed jointly with the wmo medare initiative will also contribute to capacity building on these subjects in developing countries and least developed countries contribution to standards the formation of the euro4m consortium responds directly to the commissions recommendations to mobilise all european resources through coordinating and networking efforts in research and technical development areas related to climate change and environmental monitoring euro4m will link eu and international system outputs capitalising on the benefits associated with an adherence to standards eg open gis consortium developments iso19100 series geographical markup language interoperability eg within inspire and the wmo information system wis and consolidation see section b24 data sharing within euro4m will follow serviceoriented approach adopting common standards on metadata data models and network services as described by inspire and the geoss architecture and data committee mo leads the special group within eumetnet called inspimet which looks after the implementation rules of inspire for meteorological and climatological data and services following these rules will ensure global connectivity and interoperability also providing appropriate links to the wmo information system wis the inspirecompliant infrastructure will enable considerable datasharing efficiencies to be realised between euro4m and the various gmes services requiring access to climaterelated data wp3 will describe the infrastructure that is used for the datasets produced in euro4m contribution to policy development longterm and reliable climate data are vital for detecting understanding predicting and responding to climate change and variability the development of increasingly sophisticated climate models has reinforced the need for basic observations however as the demand for objective information grows geo and gcos have indicated that our capacity to monitor climate and environmental changes and fluctuations is still largely inadequate monitoring climate change and extremes at the multidecadal and century time scale is currently not among the core gmes services ongoing activities in the geo work plan also do not cover longterm climate observations and monitoring even though geo is strong advocate for sustained and coordinated climate observing systems euro4m is positioned to form the implementation component of the atmospheric sections of gcos and geoss by taking on the climate section of the plan euro4m will coordinate monitoring framework essential for the success of geoss euro4m is crucial for establishing the climate change component of gmes and thus for the european contribution to the development and integration of the geoss key system for climate change observations and information will be provided for the benefit of each of the nine societal benefit areas of geo the system integrates european climate change monitoring activities into the global picture in this way the project will contribute to forward european and international efforts in strategic policy areas such as climate change and energy involvement of international partnerships will ensure proper knowhow is taken into account as well as avoiding duplication of efforts this will enable europe to play pivotal role in the systematic monitoring of climate mandated by the unfccc euro4m will form core component of the european implementation of the atmospheric climate component of gcos in support of the unfccc the implementation plan for gcos addresses the requirements identified in the second report on the adequacy of the gcos gcos 2003 in particular the ecvs and associated climate products defined in the report in summer 2009 parties to the unfccc endorsed the main findings of the recently issued progress report on the implementation of the global observing system for climate in support of the unfccc 20042008 gcos 2009 in their conclusions at sbsta 30 as well as in draft decision for consideration at cop 15 in copenhagen in december 2009 this encourages parties to strengthen their efforts to address the priorities identified finally within the context of the kyoto protocol euro4m will directly focus on the following articles 91 provide the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts 10c promote education and training and increase public awareness of climate change 10d participate and cooperate in international scientific research programmes to reduce uncertainties related to the climate system and the adverse impacts of climate change addedvalue in carrying out the work at european level euro4m will only work when carried out at the european level building on existing national monitoring capacity and atmospheric observation programs to form truly european integrated system capable of providing cibs on extreme events that threaten europe and its citizens and interests worldwide the development of such system requires an unprecedented level of collaboration and coordination of multidisciplinary research enhancement of operational activities within the climate research and monitoring community although elements of such system presently exist the state of their development in the different european countries is uneven more critically access to data information and products by users is in many cases inadequate and difficult europeanwide coordination will avoid unnecessary duplication and hence enable resources to be focussed more effectively this will also result in more uniform high quality and standardised products which will be available to all european countries reducing the geographical disparity between countries and regions for information and services available to intermediate and endusers it will encourage the development of scientific research and analysis at the national level as well as at the eu level allowing countries to make the most of the collaboration both in terms of data resources and rd expertise as sideeffect improved access to products and services will encourage smaller nations to make greater contribution to existing observation networks the enlargement of the european union in 2004 gives the opportunity to enlarge the scientific cooperation in fact cooperation with east and southeast european countries is essential to tackle topics in environmental research with wider regional dimension such as climatic change and variability the european scale ensures that sufficient resources are mobilised to address the goal and objectives of the work program and maintain preeminence within the international community account taken of other national or international research activities euro4m is designed to build on existing capacity as described in section b11 the project fully benefits from ongoing national and international work on observational datasets and data assimilation euro4m will link very strongly to the wider international community gmes cannot be successfully implemented without exchanging equivalent observational data through cooperation schemes thereby sharing the cost of observation infrastructure with noneu partners ec 2008 euro4m beneficiaries include members of the geo committees gcos steering committee its atmospheric observation panel for climate aopc and oceanic observation panel for climate oopc specialist groups wmo open programme area groups opags and expert teams some of them also lead by euro4m beneficiaries international research programme on climate variability and predictability clivar expert teams the wcrp observations and assimilation panel and the wcrp wg on observational data sets for reanalyses euro4m beneficiaries are also intimately involved in ipcc activities euro4m will work with its international partners to collate and report on ecvs including integrating existing data products and providing uncertainty estimates for each ecv euro4m will link with wmo programmes and improve the reporting of observations to international data centres euro4m fits perfectly in the wcrp strategy for coordinated observation and prediction of the earth system copes wmo 2005 links to ongoing fp projects euro4m links to ongoing fp6 and fp7 projects including those developing prototype and preoperational gmes services such as geoland2 myocean macc and other related fp projects such as ensembles eurolimpacs cecilia circe etc euro4m will complement geoland2 which joins range of previous gmes projects to deliver range of geoinformation services for the terrestrial sphere and myocean which will define and set up concerted and integrated paneuropean capacity for ocean monitoring and forecasting euro4m partners involved in geoland2 and myocean will link the project results to these services they both require the longterm climate change monitoring information that euro4m will deliver in particular on extremes as an input strong ties also exist with the macc consortium lead by ecmwf macc monitoring atmospheric composition and climate combines the earlier projects promote and gems which provide prototype atmospheric services for gmes promote protocol monitoring for the gmes service element atmosphere focuses on stratospheric ozone depletion surface uv exposure air quality whereas gems global and regional earthsystem atmosphere monitoring using satellite and in situ data focuses on global distributions of atmospheric constituents important for climate although responsible for the preoperational atmospheric services from 2009 onwards macc does not include the longer multidecadal time scales and many of the ecvs required for climate change monitoring that euro4m will address euro4m will build on the highresolution gridded observational datasets for europe developed in ensembles and work towards getting these datasets into an operational status our useroriented work will benefit from collaboration with the eurolimpacs integrated project to evaluate impacts of global change on european freshwater ecosystems team designed to assess the effects of future global change on europes freshwater ecosystems as well as from circe and cecilia for collection and homogenisation of long daily temperature and precipitation data for all the mediterranean countries and eastern europe the work on extremes in wp3 will be performed through strong connections with the eu projects ensembles circe and clarislpb europesouth america network for climate change assessment and impact studies the work on extremes will also build on the results of earlier eu fp5 projects like stardex mice modelling the impact of climate extremes emulate and alpimp multicentennial climate variability in the alps based on instrumental data model simulations and proxy data plus recent global initiatives from ipcc which many euro4m beneficiaries have been actively involved with clear link also exists with the global reanalyses proposal to eu fp7 env which is in preparation by consortium led by ecmwf euro4m is designed to be complementary to global reanalysis efforts by concentrating on aspects where it can add value such as higher horizontal resolution the global reanalysis proposal will likely suggest 40km resolution the assimilation of surface precipitation data and delivering integrated products at the required level of aggregation and processing to respond to wide range of users and downstream services links to other activities in an effort to further harmonize european climate change information euro4m will connect to the european cooperation in the field of scientific and technical research cost action es0601 home on comparisons of methods for homogenisation of long instrumental climate records new quality control and homogeneity testing of early instrumental observations particularly from eu accession and candidate states and neighbouring countries will build on the data products generated by eufunded and other projects such as ecad nordklim nordic cooperation within climate activities euroclim european climate change monitoring and prediction system medclivar mediterranean clivar and cliwoc climate of the worlds oceans integrating these data with the holdings of suite of international databases euro4m will work with international comprehensive oceanatmosphere dataset icoads initiatives to aid the digitisation of many millions of historical marine data in european archives being funded separately under projects such as acre euro4m will link via acre to the 20th century reanalysis project and other longer historical reanalyses with these reanalysis products there are also the full linkages and endtoend infrastructure which acre integrates in working with climate applications users euro4m has already linked with the eumetsatsafs in particular to assess user community needs and to contribute to the development of integrated products the coordinator at dwd of the cmsaf is participating in euro4m euro4m also links to medare activities on data rescue and surface climate reconstruction for the gmr under the umbrella of wmo see brunet and kuglitsch 2008 eumetnetecsn for the remainder of europe and eurocryoclim for the arctic we will liaise with other recent initiatives for particular subregions such as the alps and the baltic sea region examples are the project monitoring climate variability and change for an improved environmental and risk management in the alpine space mocca and the baltic sea experiment baltex the latter will seek to exploit and analyze the results of euro4m to quantify the water and energy budgets over the baltic sea basin and evaluate and improve regional climate models the good results in the spatialization tools for complex terrain achieved in the eumetnetecsn hrtgar project constructing high resolution temperature climatology for the greater alpine region will also be taken into account these kinds of products are useful to fill the existing gap between the present day observation datasets for europe and what end users really need in terms of spatial resolution to support impact evaluation risk assessment and related communication strategy for the successful implementation of the euro4m aims we rely partly on the cooperation and responsiveness of data holding institutions which are not participating overall we are confident that we can achieve our objectives as the interest in this project from the community of national responsible institutions and their organisations is very high the links to third party participants already established in particular eea ecmwf and eumetnet see section b23 will help to solve any potential risk one of these risks is access to weather and climate data which is often restricted due to intellectual property rights see data exchange this also affects the results of earlier eu research projects as result major costs may arise from access to meteorological data the fact that the consortium as whole represents key climate change data holding institutions in europe and the fact that the consortium members have been active in most of the related eu research projects in the past places us in the best possible position to overcome this problem in case data policy restrictions hamper the work the coordinator will bring the issue to the responsible parties including the eumetnet council in the case that internal disputes will occur during the course of the project we will begin at the source of the dispute and expand outwards until an equitable solution has been reached the participant tries to settle the dispute with its respective wpleader if not successful the management board mb see section b21 will develop strategy and intervene to settle the dispute with the possibility of sanctions in case of disagreement within the mb the coordinator will take the final decision and he will be responsible for its execution the coordinator will report the case and its solution or consequences to the ec appointed project officer b4 ethical issues the beneficiaries in this project declare that there are ethical issues relevant to this proposal nevertheless the coordinator and mb will continue to keep this aspect under review and should any such issues arise in the future they will be addressed and taken into account in due time b5 consideration of gender aspects gender action plan many of the beneficiaries in euro4m have gender action plans at the institutional level as part of their commitment to gender equality these include programmes to raise awareness of the issues involved in gender equality commitments to family friendly work practices and career breaks and provision of childcare facilities organisational initiatives to encourage gender equality enjoy high level backing within many partner institutes for example knmi is participant in the dutch gaianetwork and as such actively involved in the eu equalii priority for participation project mo have an ongoing equality training programme coordinated at boardroom level which is mandatory for all staff for beneficiaries based at institutions with less detailed plans the gender action plan in euro4m will provide an important impulse one of the four wpleaders of euro4m is woman as are 2 of the lead scientists at the 9 participating institutes project gender committee the gender committee will actively promote the role of women at all levels within the project it will be responsible for ensuring that the gender action plan is applied across the spectrum of wps in the project both in terms of internal communication of developments and progress via the project website and communicating progress externally via the annual gender action report the committee will also be responsible for ensuring that the training and dissemination aspects of the project are femalefriendly the committee will consist of 3 members elected by all project beneficiaries on an annual basis with the possibility of re election annual gender action report the report will document the extent to which actions promoting gender equality have been performed at the project level and will chart the rates of female participation at all levels of the project recruitment of female researchers recruitment of young talented female researchers will be encouraged in euro4m job advertisements will state the projects commitment to equality and to familyfriendly working environment and will explicitly encourage women to apply the gender committee will liaise with national programmes in the production of suitable information material for schools consortium agreement the consortium agreement governing the operation of the project will enforce the following minimum requirements on the participating institutions 1 encouragement of applications by female researchers in job advertisement 2 formal action to ensure that employees are properly informed about their parental rights and responsibilities 3 encouragement of female coaching and mentoring schemes and project management 4 production of an annual report on the nature and utilitysuccess of gender actions undertaken management board the management board has been chosen to ensure that women are adequately represented at the highest organisational levels of the project and consists of seven people from the four appointed one is woman 25 whilst not approaching equality this percentage is higher than that of women in senior positions in climate science
