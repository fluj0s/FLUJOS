pp h69h85 crs2 deficitneutral reconciliation directives section 402 of hres 6 amended rule xxi by adding new clause 7 to prohibit the consideration of budget resolution that contains reconciliation

2 the current fiscal year and the 10 fiscal years thereafter table 1 changes to house standing rules affecting the congressional budget process in the 110th congress section of new clause description hres 6 to rule xxi 402 clause 7 prohibits the consideration of budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions having net effect of reducing the surplus or increasing the deficit 403 clause 8 provides that points of order under title iii of the budget act as amended apply to any text made in order by special rule regardless of whether or not the measure was reported by committee 404 clause

effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus in either of two time periods 1 the current fiscal year and the following five fiscal years or 2 the current fiscal year and the following 10 fiscal years note budget act refers to the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 et seq budget reconciliation provided by section 310 of the budget act is an optional twostep process congress may use to bring direct spending revenue and debtlimit levels into compliance with those set forth in budget resolutions3 to accomplish this congress first includes reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution if more than one committee is directed the legislative language recommended by all of the committees is packaged without any 3 for more detailed discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs3 substantive revision into one or more reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate committees on the budget in some instances such as when single committee is directed committee may be required to report its legislative recommendations directly to its chamber once the budget committees or individual committees if so directed report reconciliation legislation to their respective chambers consideration is governed by special procedures4 these special rules serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certain amendments and to encourage its completion in timely fashion section 310 of the budget act places requirements on reconciliation directives contained in budget resolution regarding their impact on the deficit or surplus it simply provides for the directives to instruct committees to recommend changes to existing law to accomplish change in spending revenues the statutory limit on the public debt or combination of these matters in fact the last eight budget resolutions containing reconciliation directives agreed to by congress contemplated at least one reconciliation measure that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus5 the new clause 7 of rule xxi places substantive restriction on the reconciliation directives regarding their impact on the deficit or surplus the new rule effectively requires that the reconciliation process be used for the net effect of deficit reduction moreover if the proposed budget resolution contemplates multiple reconciliation bills under the new rule each of the bills must not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus in the two time periods specified application of budget act points of order to text considered section 403 of hres 6 amended rule xxi by adding new clause 8 to provide that points of order under titles iii of the budget act as amended apply to any text made in order by special rule regardless of whether or not the measure was reported by committee previously points of order under titles iii of the budget act did not apply to unreported bills and joint resolutions6 such points of order under the budget act therefore could be circumvented by considering pursuant to special rule reported by the house committee on rules measure which committee has not reported even if the bill were projected to increase spending above or reduce revenues below 4 for brief summary of these procedures see crs report 98814 budget reconciliation legislation development and consideration by bill heniff jr 5 see crs congressional distribution memorandum reconciliation directives to house committees in budget resolutions for fy1976fy2005 by bill heniff jr available from the author 6 the applicable provisions of the budget act refer to bill or joint resolution as reported and therefore do not contemplate an unreported bill or joint resolution these points of order still apply to an amendment to an unreported bill and conference report to bill not originally reported by committee crs4 the levels associated with the budget resolution for instance it would not be subject to the applicable point of order simply because it was not reported by committee the new clause 8 of rule xxi closes this loophole under the new rule for bills considered pursuant to special order of business eg special rule reported by the house committee on rules points of order under title iii of the budget act apply effectively to the text considered pursuant to the special order 1 the text recommended by the reporting committee 2 the text made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment or 3 the text on which the previous question has been ordered directly to passage as the case may be7 disclosure of congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits section 404 of hres 6 amended rule xxi by adding new clause 9 to prohibit the consideration of legislation unless congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits are disclosed including the name of the requesting member or sponsor of each prior to its consideration8 the new rule effectively requires that any bill joint resolution amendment9 and conference report10 must be accompanied by list of congressional earmarks limited 7 section 315 of the budget act provides that points of order under titles iii and iv apply to the latter two forms of measure considered pursuant to special order of business but for reported bills only 8 in the 109th congress on september 14 2006 the house agreed to freestanding rule hres 1000 that provided similar point of order 9 the rule explicitly prohibits an amendment to bill or joint resolution to be offered at the outset of its consideration for amendment by member of committee of initial referral emphasis added suggesting that substitute offered by committee member would be subject to the rule but an amendment offered after the beginning of consideration of the bill would not be subject to the rule some members however have complied with the requirement even though they did not meet the explicit qualifications set forth in the rule see for example the statements in the following entries in the congressional record daily edition vol 153 march 19 2007 p h2672 april 17 2007 p h3478 and may 22 2007 p h5623 10 subsequently on june 18 2007 the house agreed by unanimous consent to hres 491 which prohibits the consideration of conference report to accompany regular appropriations bill unless the joint explanatory statement includes list of congressional earmarks including the name of the requesting member not committed to the conference committee by either house not in report on such bill and not in report of committee of the senate on companion measure like the new clause 9 of rule xxi the resolution prohibits the consideration of special rule that waives this point of order in addition unlike the new clause 9 of rule xxi hres 491 provides that any point of order under this resolution against conference report shall be disposed of by the question of consideration consequently under this freestanding rule if point of order under this rule is raised against conference report the house will proceed after 20 minutes of debate equally divided between and controlled by proponent and an opponent of the point of order to vote on whether or not to consider the conference report one motion to adjourn also would continued crs5 tax benefits and limited tariff benefits contained in the legislation accompanying committee report or joint explanatory statement with regard to conference report such list must also include the name of the member requesting each item the list may be included in the committee report for reported bill printed in the congressional record for an unreported bill or amendment or included in the joint explanatory statement for conference report if the legislation its accompanying report or joint explanatory statement does not contain any congressional earmarks limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits statement stating as such must be printed in the accompanying report the congressional record or joint explanatory statement11 under subsection c of the new clause 9 of rule xxi the new rule is enforced based only on whether or not the required list or statement was printed in report the congressional record or the joint explanatory statement if point of order is made the chair is required to base his or her ruling only on the existence of list or statement and is not empowered to make ruling based on the contents of the list12 as result point of order under the new rule may be sustained only if the required list or statement was not printed13 the new rule also prohibits the consideration of special rule that waives the new point of order if special rule waives the new rule point of order against the consideration of the special shall be disposed of by the question of consideration that is if point of order is raised against such special rule the house will proceed after 20 minutes of debate equally divided between and controlled by proponent and opponent of the point of order to vote on whether or not to consider the special rule even though it waives the new disclosure rule one motion to adjourn also would be in order 10 continued be in order see congressional record daily edition vol 153 june 18 2007 pp h6622 h6623 11 for an example of such statement see congressional record daily edition vol 153 january 9 2007 p h253 12 for an example of the application of the point of order see congressional record daily edition vol 153 january 31 2007 pp h1088h1090 13 some members have objected that the new rule prevents the chair from sustaining point of order against matter if the list of earmarks is not comprehensive see for example the parliamentary inquiry posed by rep jeff flake and the chairs reply in congressional record daily edition vol 153 may 10 2007 pp h4861h4862 in other words they argue that the rule is insufficient because the committee need only provide partial list of earmarks to protect the measure from point of order on the other hand others could argue that to make ruling based on the content of the list would leave considerable discretion in the hands of the chair to determine what constitutes an earmark such discretion is not typically given to the chair who is expected to enforce the rules and procedures of the house and based on several precedents does not decide on the legislative or legal effect of propositions us congress constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives hdoc 108241 108th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2003 hereafter house rules and manual p 341 crs6 subsections df of the new disclosure rule provide definitions of what constitutes congressional earmark limited tax benefit and limited tariff benefit for purposes of the rule the text of those definitions is provided in table 2 table 2 congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9 of rule xxi item definition congressional earmark provision or report language included primarily at the request of member delegate resident commissioner or senator providing authorizing or recommending specific amount of discretionary budget authority credit authority or other spending authority for contract loan loan guarantee grant loan authority or other expenditure with or to an entity or targeted to specific state locality or congressional district other than through statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process limited tax benefit 1 any revenuelosing provision that provides federal tax deduction credit exclusion or preference to 10 or fewer beneficiaries under the internal revenue code of 1986 and b contains eligibility criteria that are not uniform in application with respect to potential beneficiaries of such provision or 2 any federal tax provision which provides one beneficiary temporary or permanent transition relief from change to the internal revenue code of 1986 limited tariff benefit provision modifying the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states in manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities finally as part of the new disclosure rule section 404b of hres 6 amended rule xxiii by adding clauses 16 and 17 both relating to congressional earmarks limited tax benefits and limited tariff benefits the new clause 16 prohibits member14 from conditioning the inclusion of congressional earmark limited tax benefit or limited tariff benefit in legislation on any vote cast by another member the new clause 17 requires any member requesting congressional earmark limited tax benefit or limited tariff benefit to submit to the chair and ranking minority member written statement containing the following items the name of the member 14 both clauses 16 and 17 apply to delegates and the resident commissioner as well crs7 for congressional earmarks the name and address of the intended recipient or intended location of the activity for limited tax or tariff benefits identification of the individual or entities reasonably anticipated to benefit to the extent known by the member the purpose of the congressional earmark limited tax benefit or limited tariff benefit and certification that the member or spouse do not have any financial interest in the requested item the rule also requires committees to maintain this information and make available for public inspection the written disclosures for congressional earmarks and limited tax or tariff benefits included in any measure reported by the committee or conference report filed by the chair of the committee or any subcommittee15 payasyougo paygo rule section 405 of hres 6 amended rule xxi by adding new clause 10 referred to as the payasyougo paygo point of order to prohibit the consideration of legislation affecting direct spending and revenues that is projected to have the net effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus in either of two time periods 1 the sixyear period consisting of the current fiscal year and the five ensuing fiscal years currently fy2007fy2012 and 2 the 11year period consisting of the current year and the 10 ensuing fiscal years currently fy2007 fy201716 any projected increase in direct spending or reduction in revenues resulting from such legislation must be offset by an equivalent amount of direct spending cuts revenue increases or combination of the two17 direct spending also referred to as mandatory spending generally is provided in laws other than appropriations acts generally continues without any annual legislative action and provides spending authority for programs such as medicare 15 it is worth noting that this public availability requirement does not pertain to requests for such items not granted ie not included in legislation report or joint explanatory statement 16 the rule explicitly defines the two periods as 1 the current fiscal year and the five fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year that ends in the following calendar year and 2 the current fiscal year and the 10 fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year that ends in the following calendar year taken literally between october and december of any given year the requirement would cover the five and 10year periods instead of the six and 11 year periods 17 for more detailed information on the new house paygo rule see crs report rl33850 the houses payasyougo paygo rule in the 110th congress brief overview by robert keith crs8 unemployment compensation and federal retirement programs18 it is distinguished from discretionary spending which is controlled through the annual appropriations process furthermore direct spending is under the jurisdiction of the respective authorizing committees while discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate committees on appropriations revenues which are under the jurisdiction of the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance are the funds collected from the public primarily as result of the federal governments exercise of its sovereign powers19 they consist of receipts from individual income taxes social insurance taxes or payroll taxes such as social security and medicare taxes corporate income taxes excise taxes duties gifts and miscellaneous receipts under the new rule each measure affecting direct spending and revenues must not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus in either of the two time periods specified20 that is to comply with the rule each measure projected to increase direct spending or reduce revenues must also include changes to existing law that would result in reduction in direct spending an increase in revenues or both by equivalent amounts the projected reduction in the deficit or increase in the surplus in measure previously passed by the house or one to be subsequently considered by the house could not be used to offset an increase in the deficit or reduction in the surplus in another measure the rule specifies that determination of the effect of direct spending and revenue legislation on the deficit or surplus is to be based on estimates made by the house committee on the budget relative to the most recent baseline estimates provided by the congressional budget office cbo in producing its baseline estimates cbo projects revenues spending and deficit or surplus levels under existing law ie assuming legislative changes under the rule such baseline estimates are to be consistent with section 257 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 as amended 2 usc 900 et seq21 18 while the new house rule does not explicitly define direct spending the term is defined in section 250 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 as amended 2 usc 900 et seq commonly known as the gramm rudmanhollings act section 250c8 states that direct spending means budget authority provided by law other than appropriations acts b entitlement authority and c the food stamp program 19 other legislative committees may have jurisdiction over legislation affecting small portion of revenues 20 the rule does not provide any allowance for even minimis increase in the deficit or reduction in the surplus the rule presumably applies to appropriations bills containing provisions affecting revenues it is less clear that the rule applies to appropriations acts containing provisions affecting direct spending because spending authority provided in an appropriations act would not be considered direct spending under the definition of direct spending contained in section 250 of the deficit control act see fn 18 above 21 section 257 sets forth rules for calculating the baseline levels of direct spending and revenues as well as discretionary spending until the expiration of this section at the end continued crs9 the establishment of paygo rule in the house follows several years of similar rule in the senate22 first established in 1993 and modified several times since then the senate paygo rule also has generally prohibited the consideration of direct spending and revenue legislation that is projected to increase the deficit or reduce the surplus in the same time periods as the house rule23 separate orders hres 6 also contains five separate orders affecting the congressional budget process see table 3 the term separate orders has come to be used for provisions in the rules package considered at the beginning of congress that have procedural effects for the new congress but are not codified in the standing rules of the house three separate orders address the application of certain points of order under the congressional budget act of 197424 each of these orders had been agreed to in previous congresses the fourth separate order deems the fy2007 budget resolution adopted by the house in the 109th congress to have been agreed to by the 110th congress for budget enforcement purposes finally the fifth separate order provides point of order against motion that the committee of the whole rise and report an appropriations bill to the house if the bill as amended exceeds the applicable section 302b of the budget act references to resolution in section 306 of the budget act section 306 of the budget act prohibits the consideration of any bill resolution amendment motion or conference report dealing with matter under the jurisdiction of the committee on the budget unless that committee has reported it or has been discharged from its further consideration or unless it is an amendment to such measure section 511a1 of hres 6 renews separate order also adopted at the beginning of the previous three congresses25 providing that the term resolution in 21 continued of fy2006 cbo was required to follow the provisions of section 257 in producing its baseline projections at the beginning of 2007 cbo indicated that it will follow these practices until directed otherwise by congress see cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2008 to 2017 p xi fn 1 22 for additional information

payasyougo paygo rule by bill heniff jr 23 most recently as part of the fy2008 budget resolution the senate modified its paygo rule to be generally consistent with the house paygo rule see section 201 of sconres 21 24 titles iix of pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 et seq 25 section 3b1 of hres 5 107th congress section 3a1 of hres 5 108th congress continued crs10 section 306 refers to joint resolution only under this separate order therefore simple or concurrent resolution dealing with matter under the jurisdiction of the budget committee such as deeming resolution reported by the house committee on rules as explained in the enforcement of the fy2007 budget resolution section below presumably would not be subject to section 306 point of order table 3 separate orders affecting the congressional budget process in the 110th congress section of description hres 6 511a1 clarifies that the term resolution in section 306 of the budget act refers to joint resolution and not to simple or concurrent resolution section 306 prohibits the consideration of any bill resolution amendment motion or conference report under the jurisdiction of the committee on the budget unless it is reported by that committee 511a2 clarifies that section 303 of the budget act applies to the text made in order as an original bill or joint resolution for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the previous question is ordered directly to passage section 303 prohibits the consideration of budgetary legislation until congress has agreed to budget resolution 511a3 clarifies that provision in measure that establishes new executive position at specified level of compensation subject to appropriation is not considered new entitlement authority within the meaning of the budget act 511a4 provides that the fy2007 budget resolution adopted by the house during the 109th congress hconres 376 is considered to have been adopted by the 110th congress for budget enforcement purposes until the adoption of the fy2008 budget resolution 511a5 provides point of order against motion that the committee of the whole rise and report an appropriations bill to the house if the bill as amended exceeds the applicable section 302b of the budget act note budget act refers to the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 et seq 25 continued and section 3a1 of hres 5 109th congress crs11 application of point of order under section 303 of the budget act section 303 of the budget act prohibits the consideration of any measure that contains spending revenue or debtlimit provision for fiscal year until congress has agreed to budget resolution for that fiscal year26 in the house general appropriations measures may be considered after may 15 if congress has not agreed to budget resolution by then prior to 1997 section 303 applied to any measure as reported only consequently measure that was amended on the floor to contain budgetary provision for fiscal year in which congress had not agreed to budget resolution would not be subject to this point of order as long as the measure as reported did not itself contain such budgetary provision27 moreover measure that as reported contained such budgetary provision would remain subject to this point of order even though special rule eliminated the violating provision by making in order as the text to be amended an amendment in the nature of substitute that omitted the provision the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 added new section to the budget act that was intended to correct this anomaly28 section 315 provides that the words as reported in titles iii and iv of the budget act refer to the text made in order for the purpose of amendment or the text on which the previous question was ordered directly for passage the bea of 1997 however also eliminated the words as reported from section 303 of the budget act consequently there has been some ambiguity about whether or not section 303 applies to text made in order by special rule as was intended for example during the 105th congress the house continued to waive the point of order against reported measures that violated section 303 even though the violation was corrected by the special rule making in order different text for purposes of amendment29 26 the annual budget resolution which the congressional budget act requires to be completed by april 15 of each year sets forth spending revenue and debt levels for the upcoming fiscal year and at least four fiscal years thereafter 27 in 1995 for example the chair responded to parliamentary inquiry about the application of budget act points of order by noting that section 303 among other sections applied to measure in its reported state and therefore did not apply to an unreported measure congressional record vol 141 march 21 1995 p 8491 for detailed discussion of the effect of the words as reported in the budget act see william g dauster budget

congresses30 to provide that for reported bill or joint resolution considered under special order of business eg special rule reported by the house rules committee31 the section 303 prohibition applies to the text made in order for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the previous question is ordered directly to passage prospective compensation in appropriations measures section 39 of the budget act defines entitlement authority as the authority to make payments including loans and grants the budget authority for which is not provided for in advance by appropriations acts to any person or government if under the provisions of the law containing that authority the united states is obligated to make such payments to persons or governments who meet the requirements established by that law and b the food stamp program section 401b of the budget act prohibits the consideration of measure that provides new entitlement authority that is to become effective in the current fiscal year32 in addition if committee reports measure that violates this prohibition and the amount of such spending exceeds the committees spending allocation also referred to as its section 302a allocation associated with the most recently adopted budget resolution the measure may be referred to the house committee on appropriations for period not to exceed 15 days33 if the appropriations committee does not act within the 15 days the measure is discharged automatically and placed on the appropriate calendar within the 15day period however the appropriations committee may report the measure with an amendment that limits the amount of spending several house precedents have established the meaning of new entitlement authority as defined by the budget act34 among them in 1992 the chair ruled that 30 see sec 2a3 of hres 5 106th congress section 3b2 of hres 5 107th congress section 3a2 of hres 5 108th congress and section 3a2 of hres 5 109th congress 31 section 303b3 of the budget act provides an exception to the section 303a point of order for any unreported bill or joint resolution this exception however would seem to be inconsistent with and might be superseded by the new clause 8 of rule xxi created by section 403 of hres 6 see application of budget act points of order to text considered section above 32 measure that provides new entitlement authority that is to become effective after the current fiscal year is not subject to this point of order 33 in the senate section 401b requires such measure to be referred to the senate committee on appropriations instead of simply providing the authority to do so as in the house 34 see the annotations to section 401 of the budget act in house rules and manual pp continued crs13 an amendment creating new executive position at specified level of compensation subject to appropriation was not new entitlement authority because payment would occur absent an appropriation35 section 511a3 of hres 6 effectively makes this ruling standing order for the 110th congress the house also agreed to this separate order at the beginning of the previous four congresses36 specifically the separate order provides that provision in measure that establishes prospectively for federal office or position specified or minimum level of compensation to be funded by annual discretionary appropriations shall not be considered as providing new entitlement authority under section 401 of the congressional budget act of 1974 therefore during the 110th congress such provision presumably would not be subject to point of order under section 401b of the budget act and it also would not be subject to the 15day referral to the house appropriations committee enforcement of the fy2007 budget resolution each year congress is required to adopt budget resolution setting forth spending revenue and debt levels which are then enforced primarily through points of order during the consideration of budgetary legislation37 after budget resolution has been agreed to by both the house and senate the budget levels contained therein continue to be enforceable until they are revised or superseded by subsequently adopted budget resolution even from one congress to the next in 2006 however congress did not complete action on budget resolution for fy2007 the house and senate each adopted its own version of the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 and sconres 83 respectively but they did not take any further action to resolve the legislative differences between the two versions38 in the absence of an agreement between the house and senate on an fy2007 budget resolution the house adopted socalled deeming resolution39 the house 34 continued 10151018 35 ibid p 1018 also see congressional record vol 138 march 26 1992 pp 72027203 36 the separate order agreed to in the 106th congress sec 2a3 of hres 5 expired upon the adoption of the fy2000 budget resolution whereas the orders agreed to at the beginning of the 107th section 3b2 of hres 5 108th section 3a2 of hres 5 and 109th section 3a3 of hres 5 congresses applied to the entire duration of the congresses 37 for

congress and continue to serve until congress adopts fy2008 budget resolution as the basis for budget enforcement in the house under this deeming resolution as with the 2006 resolution the enforcement procedures of the budget act will have force and effect in the house as if congress had adopted the budget resolution in the 110th congress41 enforcement of section 302b allocations section 511a5 of hres 6 provides point of order first adopted in the 109th congress section 2 of hres 24842 against motion that the committee of the whole rise and report an appropriations bill to the house if the

printed in the congressional record the committee spending allocations the 302as and the accounts identified for advance appropriations associated with hconres 376 as passed the house for those allocations and accounts see congressional record daily edition vol 153 january 5 2007 pp h92h95 42 on april 28 2005 the house agreed to hres 248 the special rule providing for the consideration of the conference report to accompany hconres 95 the fy2006 budget resolution by voice vote after agreeing to order the previous question by 228196 vote the point of order was never raised during the remainder of 109th congress 43 these allocations commonly referred to as 302a allocations after the applicable section continued crs15 provided for discretionary spending in the budget resolution is allocated to the house and senate committees on appropriations which have exclusive jurisdiction over discretionary spending in appropriations acts the house and senate appropriations committees soon after the budget resolution is adopted subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees and formally report these subdivisions to their respective chambers44 these subdivisions referred to as 302b allocations after the applicable section of the budget act represent the spending ceilings on the individual regular appropriations acts point of order may be raised against the consideration of any appropriations measure or amendment that would cause subcommittees allocation to be exceeded in practice the regular appropriations bills usually are reported by the house appropriations committee at the applicable subcommittee allocation level thereby avoiding point of order against the consideration of the measure45 during consideration of an appropriations bill in the committee of the whole46 however action might be taken by amendment or point of order that would cause the bill to exceed its allocation level first the committee of the whole could adopt an amendment providing spending increase that would cause the bill to exceed its allocation47 second on point of order under clause 2 of house rule xxi48 43 continued of the budget act are specified in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report to the budget resolution 44 during the appropriations process the house and senate appropriations committees usually revise these subdivisions several times 45 for an examination of this practice see richard g forgette and jim v saturno 302b or not 302b congressional floor procedures and house appropriators legislative studies quarterly vol 19 3 august 1994 pp 385396 46 clause 3 of house rule xviii requires initial consideration of appropriations bills in the committee of the whole in current practice the regular appropriations bills are considered in the committee of the whole under special rule reported by the house committee on rules in the committee of the whole under the special rule consideration begins with general debate and then the appropriations bill typically is read for amendment by paragraph under the fiveminute rule 47 points of order under the budget act are not selfenforcing member must raise point of order against the consideration of the amendment if point of order is raised the amendment may be considered and subsequently adopted moreover the point of order must be timely that is before debate begins on the amendment once proponent begins debate the point of order is longer in order often member usually the floor manager will reserve point of order against the amendment before debate begins in order to secure the right to make the point of order after debate on the amendment has commenced after proponent makes her remarks the member either withdraws the reservation or insists on the point of order for additional explanation regarding the timeliness and reservation of points of order see william holmes brown and charles w johnson house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house washington gpo 2003 pp 665667 48 clause 2 of house rule xxi prohibits provisions changing existing law in an appropriations measure the special rule providing for the consideration of regular continued crs16 legislative provision that exempts certain spending from being counted toward subcommittees allocation such as an emergency designation49 or offsets spending such as change in mandatory spending could be stricken resulting in the bill exceeding its allocation in each case even though the bill would exceed its allocation as result of the amendment or point of order point of order against the bill under section 302f of the budget act could not be raised because it would not be timely50 the separate order under section 511a5 of hres 6 however would allow member during the 110th congress to raise point of order against the motion to rise and report the bill to the house if the bill exceeded its section 302b allocation if sustained the chair would be required to submit for vote the question of whether or not the committee of the whole should rise and report the bill to the house even though the bill exceeds its allocation the question is to be decided without any intervening action except for 10 minutes of debate equally divided between and controlled by proponent and an opponent if the question is decided in the affirmative the committee of the whole rises and reports to the house the bill with the amendments agreed to in the committee if the question is decided in the negative the committee does not rise and report but instead proceeds to the consideration of one proper amendment presumably proposing to bring the bill into compliance with its section 302b allocation this proper amendment which may not be amended or divided would be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided between and controlled by proponent and an opponent during the consideration of the proper amendment the chair and ranking minority member or their designees may offer pro forma amendments for purposes of debate member may not make the point of order against motion offered under clause 2d of rule xxi which gives precedence to motion to rise and report an appropriations bill if offered by the majority leader or designee after the bill has been read for amendment51 or after the question of consideration provided by the 48 continued appropriations bill typically waives this rule but sometimes exempts certain provisions from this waiver in the latter case during the consideration of the bill member may raise point of order against an unprotected provision and if sustained the provision is stricken from the bill 49 such scenario might have occurred during the 109th congress but was avoided when the floor manager insisted that the point of order initially made against the emergency designation provision be extended to lie against the spending as well as result when the chair sustained the point of order the entire paragraph containing the emergency designation as well as the additional spending was stricken see congressional record daily edition vol 152 may 19 2006 pp h2931h2939 50 as in the case of an amendment in order to be considered timely the point of order under section 302f of the budget act must be raised before debate begins on the bill presumably at the time an amendment has been adopted or point of order is sustained against provision in the bill there has been debate on the bill 51 presumably then if the majority leader or his designee offers the motion to rise and report the bill to the house instead of the floor manager member would not be able to continued crs17 new point of order has already been decided on given bill52 it is worth noting that regardless of the whether or not the new point of order would be in order the motion to rise and report any bill back to the house requires an affirmative vote the motion typically is agreed to by voice vote any member however may request recorded vote if the motion is rejected the consideration of the bill continues in the committee and member may offer an amendment which could propose to bring the bill into compliance with its allocation 51 continued raise the new point of order under section 511a5 of hres 6 even if the appropriations bill exceeds its allocation 52 this exception would seem to prevent the new point of order from being raised more than once during the consideration of any given appropriations bill presumably then if after the new point of order is raised and sustained the question of consideration is decided in the negative and proper amendment is offered but rejected member could not raise the new point of order again in order to have another opportunity to offer different proper amendment to bring the appropriations bill into compliance with its allocation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34149
