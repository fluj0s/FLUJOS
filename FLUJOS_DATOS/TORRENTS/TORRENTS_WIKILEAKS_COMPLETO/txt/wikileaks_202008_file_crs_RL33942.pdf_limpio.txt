generally been interpreted by the tsa and the air cargo industry to include riskbased assessment processes such as the known shi pper program and does not necessarily require physical inspection see 49 usc 44901ain discretionary grants with priority given to small hub and nonhub airports the senate bill would also extend authorization of the discretionary appropriations for airport security improvements for baggage screening through 2009 and increase the authorized funding level from 250 million to 450 million in fy2008 and fy2009 see section 1465 passenger checkpoint screening like the house bill the senate bill contains provision section 1470 that would require the dhs to submit the strategic plan for passenger checkpoint ex plosives detection but would allow 90 days after enactment instead of seven days for the plan to be submitted further the senate bill see section 1479 would require the tsa to conduct pilot program to identify technology solutions capable of reducing the number of tsa employees deployed to monitor airport exit lanes within one year after implementation of the pilot program the tsa is to submit final report to appropriate congressional committees describing the security measures deployed the projected costs savings and the efficacy of the program and its applicability to other airports air cargo security in contrast to the house bill which would mandate 100 physical inspections of cargo placed on passenger airliners by end of fy2009 the senate bill offers an alternative that would require the tsa to establish system to screen4 all cargo transported on passenger airliners within three years see section 1462 the provision would require minimum set of standards for cargo screening technologies equipment and personnel to provide level of security comparable to the level of security in effect for passenger checked baggage like the house bill the senate bill allows for the promulgation of an interim rule which may be issued without compliance with the apa for up to one year the bill also requires that superceding final rule issued in compliance with the apa be promulgated after one year the senate bill also contains language regarding assessment of exemptions to these requirements that is identical to the language in the house bill the senate also includes provision section 1463 with co mparable language in the house bill that would require the tsa to evaluate th results of the ongoing blastresistant container pilot program by january 1 2008 and based on that evaluation begin acquisition of blastresistant containers to meet the needs specified in the tsas cargo security program the tsa would also be required to implement program to make such containers ava ilable to passenger airliners and provide for their storage maintenance and distribution further the senate includes language section 1464 authorizing such sums as may be nece ssary for fy2008 to remain available until expended for technology research and velopment and pilot projects that can disrupt or prevent an explosive device fro m being introduced onto passenger plane or from damaging passenger plane while this sc ope

recei pt of the plan compared to the house language which calls for the plan to be submitted within 90 days the senate bill also contains additional language not included in the house bill that would require gao assessment of the tsas progress in implementing the secure flight program the current appeals process for aggrieved passengers the tsas plan to protect passenger information and its pr ogress in integratin g domestic passenger prescreening with international passenger pr escreening carried out by cbp realistic time frame for system completion and any other relevant observations and recommendations tsa personnel management section 903 of the senate bill contains language similar to the house provisions on tsa personnel management reform like the house provision the senate b ill would eliminate the tsa administrators authority to establish parate personnel ma nagement system for screeners and place all tsa employees under the same pers onnel management system like the house bill the senate bill would require the uniform personnel management system for all tsa employees to conform to either the existing personnel management system for nonscreeners or the dhs pers onnel management system the senate bill includes implementation time frames and reporting requirements for implementation of the uniform personnel management syst em for tsa employees that are identical to those in the house bill section 904 of the senate b ill would grant to screener personnel the right to appeal adverse ac tions would require tsa to provide collaborative employee engagement system including collective bargaining subject to certain limits relating to emergencies and other matters and would extend whistleblower protections to screener personnel the senate bill also contains pr ovision see section 1468 that would eliminate any statutory cap on the numbe r of tsa employees such as the 45000 fte screener cap found in appropriations language after fy2007 the bill would require the tsa to recruit nd hire personnel to provide ppropriate levels of aviation security and achieve average passenger checkpoint wait times of less than 10 minutes the house bill contains comp arable

creating grant program to provide grants to general aviation airpor ts to upgrade security based on risk managed approach the langua ge directs the tsa to establish such grant program if it is deemed feasible and authorizes such sums as may be necessary for this purpose further the provision would require all foreignregistered general aviation aircraft to submit passenger information to cbp prior to entering united states airspace for vetting against appropriate data bases maintained by the tsa see crs report rl33194 securing general aviation by bart elias airline crew and law enforcement

flight and cabin crew members thr ough airport screening checkpoints based on the findings of the report the tsa shall implement such program within one year of transmitting the report to congress also section 1477 of the senate bill would amend current statutes regarding implementation of biometric credential system for law enforcement personnel seekin g access to aircraft and secured areas of airports the provision calls for estab lishing national registered armed law enforcement program for law enforcement officers leos required to be armed while traveling on commercial flights the provision stipulates that the credential program incorporate biometri c and other applicable tec hnologies provide flexibility for leos who must travel armed either on regular or temporary basis be coordinated with other uniform credentialing initiatives and directives be applicable to all federal state local tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies and include process for discreetly verifying the identity of leos traveling using biometric technology in establishing the program the dhs is to ensure that only those leos required to travel armed are issued creden tials that the

and senate bills regarding tsa personnel management are highly controversial and opposed by the administration the white house omb has issued statements of administration policy on both bills indicating that if the b ill presented to the president includes such provisions the presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill the administration argues that elimination of the tsa administrators flexibility in personnel management could hinder the tsas ability to quickly and effectively respond to rapidly changing security thr eats collective bargaining processes in particular they argue could significantly slow the tsas ability to change security posture in response to threats includin g the rapid reassignment of personnel and other actions that may be subject to re view under collective bargaining agreements if the current personnel sy stem were eliminated the administration also opposes the h ouse provisions that would require 100 screening of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft cautioning that such measure would likely result in reduction of shippi ng cargo via passenger aircraft the administration urged the house to adopt an alternative riskbased approach such an approach is reflected in the senate language which the administration and the air cargo industry favor over the house language5 air cargo industry stakeholders however remain concerned bout the ab ility to meet the threeyear time frame for implementation of cargo screening system specified in the senate bill they also caution that requiring such system meet the minimum standard specified in the senate bill requiring the proposed cargo screening system to provide comparable security to existing checked baggage screening fails to adequately consider the differences between cargo and baggage and the unique operational challenges of air cargo handling and supply chain logistics6 also the administration and industry groups do not support the senate provision ca lling for deployment of blastresistant cargo containers for use on passenger air liners arguing that this would impose significant costs on the tsa that many aircraft are not currently configured to support these containers and that utilizing ch containers is c ontradictory to current security measures to keep elevated risk cargo off of passenger aircraft the administration also opposes reaut horization of the aviation security capital fund and the proposed establis hment of separa 250 million checkpoint screening security fund as called for in the house bill while the administration supports the security enhancements anticipat ed by these initiatives its concerns over use of these specific funds cen ter on the lack of fungibility of monies paid into these funds which it claims may strain tsa operating budgets and limit flexibility in the budget process also in the case of the aviation security capital fund the administration has raised concerns over the federal share of airport security construction costs and would like to see greater proportion of this cost shifted to airport operatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33942crs16 title v strengthening the

resources they have at their dis posal to take protective actions against any potential threat with regard to the geographic scope of warnings the measures outlined in the bills appear to be consistent with ongoing efforts between the fbi and dhs to provide such targeted warnings to conserve first responder resources21 comment definition of dhs intelligence component with respect to the definition of wh at constitutes dhs inte lligence element the pr oposed definition codifies activities as intelligence related in manner that appears to go beyond how the department s defined its intelligence enterprise according to the dhs intelligence enterprise strategic plan january 2006 the dhs intelligence enterprise includes all those component organizations within the department that have activities producing raw information intelligence related information andor finished intelligence such an exte nsion beyond production may expand the universe of entities within the department that are considered part of the intelligence enterprise comment integration and sta ndardization of dhs intelligence it would appear that given the current state of homeland security intelligence within the department these measures are intende d to facilitate more corporate approach to intelligence at dhs currently the chief intelligence officer does not have 1 formal budget formulation and executi on authority over the dhs intelligence elements outside of the largely hea dquartersbased office of intelligence and analysis 2 an established and integrated management information system into which all dhscollected intelligence and information is entered and 3 the ultimate authority to recruit and select the leaders of the dhs intelligence components in the absence of these three tools some may argue that developing sense of what the department knows collectiv ely and perhaps more im portantly what it doesnt know could be probl ematic moreover with resp ect to risk assessment and how such assessments flow through the homeland security grant program state and local threat information does not appear to be considered in meaningful and systematic manner22 comment program manager

of the government to respond to threats the provisions discussed below can be thought of as re finement and continua tion of this reporting requirement as well as providing guidan ce and additional requi rements on ongoing department activities the two bills call for actions that appear very similar an assessment of the vulnerabilities andor risks associated with critical infrastructure assets

agencies who then distribute the funds to the transit agen cies in part this is to ensure that the security activities of transit agencies are cons istent with the states security plan the senate bill

training as th single most effective security activity that transit agencies can implement tr aining issues include how many employees are receiving training how useful is the training being provided and the cost of providing training the federal transit administration testifie d in the fall of 2006 that 80000 transit employees had received security training around 20 of the approximately 400000 employees in the industr employee groups note that transit employees are likely to be the first responders in the event of security incident and contend that the training employees have received is not thorough enough to give them confidence that they know what to do in security situations live situational training exercises in coordination with first responder organizations are considered the most effective form of training but are expensive since the transit agencies must continue to provide service while employees are receiving traininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33942crs74 title xvi
