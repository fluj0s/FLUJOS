constitutionality of the creation of an atlarge congressional district4 the house passed hr 1905 in april 2007 by vote of 241 to 177 similar bill s 1257 was considered by the senate in september 2007 but motion to invoke cloture failed by vote of 57 to 42 brief constitutional analysis the us constitution provides the states with primary authority over congressional elections but grants congress the final aut hority over most aspects of such elections this congressional power is at its most broa d in the case of house elections which have historically been decided by system of popular voting5 article i 4 cl 1 provides that the times places and manner of holding ections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of chusing senators6 the supreme court and lower courts have interpreted this language to mean that congress has extensive power to regulate most elements of congressional elections7 including broad authority to protect the integrity of those elections8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22628crs3 8 continued embraces the authority to provide co mplete code for congressional elections not only as to times and places but in relati on to notices registration supervision of voting protection of voters prevention of fraud and corrupt practices counting of votes duties of inspectors and canvassers and making and publication of election returns in short to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved congress has general superv isory power over the whole subject id 9 the term gerrymander originated in 1812 when an odd shaped congressional district which resembled salamander was created by the massachusetts legislature in play on words it was referred to as gerrymander named after elbridge gerry then governor of massachusetts congressional quarterly inc congressional districts in the 1980 s 617 mv gottron ed 1983 10 in 1843 three states elected their delegati ons atlarge at the beginning of the 28th congress the clerk of the house declined to entertai n motion to exclude them and the atlarge representatives were sworn in after the dele gations were seated the house directed the committee of elections to examine and repor t upon the certificates of elections or the credentials of the members returned to serve in this house the committee report found the 1842 law to be not law made in pursuance of the constitution of the united states and valid operative and therefore not binding on the states later the house adopted resolution declaring the representatives of the states duly elected but omitted any mention of the apportionment law see asher c hinds hinds precedents of the house of representatives of the united states washington gpo 1907 at 170173 in 1861 california elected three representatives atlarge and they too were seated see hinds supra at 182 more recently for example during the 89th congress in 1965 maryland elected one representative atlarge in addition to seven representatives from districts texas elected one representative atlarge in addition to 23 representatives from districts nd hawaii elected both of its two representatives atlarge all of whom were seated see biographical directory of th united states congress 17742005 hr doc 108222 at 43135the constitution does not specify how members of the house are to be elected once they are apportioned to state origina lly most states having more than one representative divided their territory into geographic districts permitting only one member of congress to be elected from each district other states however allowed house candidates to run atlarge or from multimember districts or from some combination of the two in those states em ploying singlemember di stricts however the problem of gerrymandering the practice of dr awing district lines in order to maximize political party advantage quickly arose9 accordingly congress began establishing standards for house districts congress first passed federal redistric ting standards in 1842 when it added requirement to the apportionment act of that year that repr esentatives should be elected by districts composed of contiguous territory equal in number to the number of representatives to which each said state shall be entitled one district electing more than one representative 5 stat 49110 the apportionment ac t of 1872 added another requirement to those first set out in 1842 sta ting that districts s hould contain as nearly as practicable an equal numbe r of inhabitants 17 stat 492 further requirement of compact territory was added when the pportionment act of 1901 was adopted stating that districts must be made up of contig uous and compact territory and containing ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22628crs4 11 46 stat 21 12 538 us 254 2003 13 the 1967 law codified at 2 usc 2c requiri ng singlemember districts appears to conflict with the 1941 law codified 2 usc 2ac wh ich provides options for atlarge representation if state fails to create new districts after the reapportionment of seats following census the apparent contradictions may be explained by th somewhat confusing legislative history of pl 90196 1967 2 usc 2c prohibiting at large elections in 1941 and 1967 congress enacted modifications to the appor tionment statute at 2 usc 2ac and 2c respectively the branch court reconciled the inherent tension between the two provisions by holding that the provision requiring atlarge elec tions under 2ac was subject to the requirement under 2c that singlemember districts must be drawn whenever possible id at 26671 for further discussion see crs report rs21585 congressional redistricting is atlarge representation permitted in the house of representatives by david c huckabee and l paige whitaker 14 376 us 1 1964 15 id at 78 therefore the court held that due to such substantial population deviations among the congressional districts the statute grossl discriminated against certain voters by continuednearly as practicable an equal num ber of inhabitants 26 stat 73611 although these standards were never enforced if the states failed to meet them this language was repeated in the 1911 apportionment act and remained in effect until 1929 with the adoption of the permanent apportionment act which did not include any districting standards after 1929 there were congressionally imposed standards governing congressional redistricting in 1941 however congre ss enacted law providing for various contingencies if states failed to redistrict after census including atlarge representation 55 stat 761 in 1967 c ongress reimposed the requirement that representatives must run from singlemember dist ricts rather than running atlarge 81 stat 581 both the 1941 and 1967 laws are still in effect codified at 2 usc 2a and 2c in branch v smith 12 the supreme court considered th operation and i nherent tension between these two provisions13 the question of congre ssional authority was not in dispute in this litigation rather the court noted in passing that the current statutory scheme governing apportionmen t of the house of representatives was enacted in 1929 pursuant to congressional au thority under the times pl aces and manner provision of the constitution consequently it seems likel that congress has broad authority within specified constitutional parameters to establish how members districts will be established including the crea tion of atlarge districts it might be suggested that creating an atlarge congressional district in state could violate the one person one vote standard established by the supreme court in wesberry v sanders14 in wesberry the supreme court first applied the one person one vote standard in the context of evaluating the constitutionality of georgia congressional redistricting statute that created district with two to three times as many residents as the states other nine districts in striking down the statute the court held that article i section 2 clause 1 providing that representativ be chosen by the people of the several states and be pportione d among the several states according to their respective numbers requires that as nearly as is practicable one mans vote in congressional election is to be worth as much as anothers15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22628crs5 15 continued contracting the value of some votes and expanding that of others id at 7 while it may be impossible to draw congressional district lines with precise mathematical equality the court determined that maximum variance of 3026 is unconstitutional under article i section 2 the court announced congressional districts mu st be equal in population as nearly as practicable id at 18 while it is not beyond dispute it does not appear that the creation of an atlarge district under the circ umstances outlined in hr 1905 would be interpreted to create conflict with the one pe rson one vote standard under hr 1905 each utah voter would have the opportunity to vote both fo r candidate to represent his or her congressional district as well as for candidate to represent the state atlarge each persons vote for an atlarge candidate would be of equal worth further each persons vote for an atlarge candidate would not affect the value of his or her vote for candidate representing congressional district accordin gly all utah residents votes would have equal value thereby arguably comportin g with the one person one vote principle based on the authority granted to c ongress under the constitution to regulate congressional elections and relevant supreme court precedent it appears that federal law establishing temporary atlarge cong ressional district would likely be upheld as constitutional
