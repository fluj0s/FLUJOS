ever held funds regularly appropriated for pl 480 can be used to purchase grain to replace supplies released from the reserve but the purchases are limited to 20 million per fiscal year emergency supplemental appropriations have on occasion been devoted to replenishing the beht the authorizing statute however does not require the replenishment of the trust currently the trust holds 915000 metric tons of wheat and 107 million the mcgoverndole international food for education and child nutrition program ffe the mcgoverndole international food for education and child nutrition program ffe authorized by the 2002 farm bill provides us agricultural commodities and financial and technical assistance to establish school feeding and maternal infant and child nutrition programs in foreign countries the mcgovern dole program is considered by many to be model of combining food with nonfood resources to meet its program objectives because of the flexibility with which it can combine food commodities cash and technical assistance in carrying out its programs usda administers the program which is carried out by pvos cooperatives intergovernmental organizations and governments of developing countries food for progress ffp food for progress provides us agricultural commodities to developing countries and emerging democracies that have made commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise in their agricultural economies it is authorized in the 1985 farm bill pl 99198 and administered by usda commodities for the ffp can be purchased with appropriations for pl 480 title i or with funds of the commodity credit corporation ccc if available ccc commodity inventories may be used usda administers ffp section 416b section 416b of the agriculture act of 1949 provides for donations of surplus us agricultural commodities acquired by the ccc through its farm price support operations to developing and friendly countries section 416b is permanently authorized and does not expire with the 2002 farm bill usda administers section 416b which operates much like title ii commodities provided can be used for emergency and nonemergency assistance commodities are provided to the ultimate beneficiaries via pvos cooperatives and the wfp section 416b food aid has been highly variable because it is entirely dependent on the availability of surplus commodities in ccc inventories crs5 food aid issues need for food aid proponents of providing food aid to developing countries point to the large number of chronically hungry people in the world as evidence of the need for food aid the united nations food and agriculture organization fao estimates that there are more than 850 million people in the world who are chronically hungry2 these people lack the food that they would need to lead active and healthy lives fao points out however that the amount of food aid that has been provided an average of about 10 million metric tons per year from all donors would make barely dent in global hunger3 the average annual total volume of food aid is equivalent to about 2 of world grain trade and less than 05 of world grain production if all the food aid in the world were distributed evenly among the 850 million hungry people fao calculates it would provide only about 12 kilograms of grain per person per year clearly fao concludes the amount of food aid that has been provided is not enough to make dent in chronic hunger there is broad agreement that food aid provided for emergency relief is valuable tool for ensuring basic nutritional needs in times of humanitarian crisis earthquakes hurricanes droughts wars etc and is credited with saving millions of lives4 growing share of global food aid is provided as emergency aid which according to fao accounts for onethird to onehalf of total global food aid usaid reports that in fy2006 more than 70 of us food aid title ii was provided as emergency aid in addition fao says the timely delivery of food aid in emergency situations can relieve the pressure on poor people to sell scarce productive assets thus enabling them to resume normal livelihoods when the crisis passes but even in emergency situations other ways to enable people to get the food they need such as providing cash vouchers for the poor to purchase food on local markets may be preferable to inkind food aid from overseas5 while food aid can contribute to reducing chronic food insecurity it alone is not sufficient usaid notes in its food aid strategic plan for 20062010 that distributing food commodities by themselves is of limited use in reducing food insecurity6 realizing benefits from commodity food aid usaid says requires 2 united nations food and agriculture organization fao the state of food insecurity in the

conflict and humanitarian assistance strategic plan for 20062010 may 2005 available at httpwwwusaidgovour_workhumanitarian_ continued crs6 combining food aid with other nonfood cash and inkind resources to ensure that it has an impact beyond just feeding people the united states is the only international food aid donor that makes all of its food aid contributions in the form of commodities other major donors have different food aid policies most food aid provided by the european union the worlds second largest food aid provider is purchased in developing countries the eu has transformed its food aid policy into food security policy with food aid being restricted to humanitarian crises and longer used to support development activities7 canada the worlds third largest provider of food aid since 2005 allows up to 50 of its food aid to be purchased locally or regionally most other food aid donors make their contributions for food aid in the form of cash donations for the purchase of commodities by the world food program which the wfp then distributes primarily as emergency food aid timeliness and cost of emergency food aid time delays in shipping commodities from the united states can prevent rapid response to emergencies and create problems later when commodities arrive estimates are that it can take from three to five months for commodities shipped from us ports to reach emergency destinations such delays make it difficult to get food to people especially when there is rapid onset of food need as in the 2004 asian tsunami or more recently in response to food emergencies in east africa when commodities arrive late they may longer be needed or if distributed may disrupt local markets in an effort to expedite arrivals usaid has been pre positioning commodities in ports nearer to where the emergencies are occurring pl 480 legislation permits prepositioning of commodities but the current legislation limits the amount of funds that can be spent on prepositioning8 the costefficiency of delivering food commodities is affected by transportation costs and by the requirement that some portion of us food aid be shipped on us flag vessels cargo preference transportation costs are high according to usaid and usda budget data in fy2006 55 of the funds allocated to pl 480 title ii 930 million out of 17 billion went to cover transportation costs including both ocean freight and internal shipping handling and transportation ocean freight rates vary from year to year but paying such costs is one reason why the administration in its farm bill proposals and in recent budget submissions has called for allocating some portion of funds available to pl 480 title ii to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are needed this proposal is discussed below 6 continued assistanceffpffp_strategy2006_2010pdf 7 see european programme for food aid and food security at httpeceuropaeu europeaidprojectsfoodsecinterventions_enhtm 8 section 407c4 provides for prepositioning of commodities both in the united states and in foreign countries but limits funding for prepositioning to 2 million per year crs7 the cargo preference act pl 83644 august 26 1954 as amended contains legislation concerning the transportation of waterborne cargoes in usflag vessels the act requires that 75 of the volume of us agricultural commodities financed under pl 480 and other concessional financing arrangements be shipped on privately owned usregistered vessels maritime interests generally support cargo preference but opponents argue that it increases the costs of shipping us commodities to poor countries and potentially reduces the volume of food aid provided government accountability office gao report found that shipments of food aid on usflag vessels did little to meet the cargo preference laws objective of helping to maintain us merchant marine and that cargo preference requirements adversely affect operations of the food aid programs chiefly by raising the cost of ocean transportation and reducing the volume of commodities that can be shipped9 the us department of transportation dot which reimburses food aid agencies for the costs of cargo preference maintains however that its reimbursements appropriately and expeditiously compensate for the costs of using us vessels dot maintains that cargo preference has minimal if any impact on the amount of food aid available10 monetization and additional cash resources pl 480 provision section 203 first included in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 allows pvos and cooperatives to sell percentage of donated pl 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region the currency generated by these sales can then be used to finance internal transportation storage or distribution of commodities to implement development projects or to invest and with the interest earned to finance distribution costs or projects under section 203 pvos or cooperatives are permitted to monetize ie sell for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not less than 15 of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in country many of the organizations that rely on sales of us food aid commodities to finance development projects support monetization as their major source of development finance estimates are that almost 70 of pl 480 title ii development food aid commodities provided to pvos and cooperatives is monetized11 that such large proportion of us food aid commodities is monetized is cited as evidence of great need for cash to carry out development projects implemented by the pvos and cooperatives 9 see government accountability office cargo preference requirements objectives not met when applied to food aid programs september 29 1994 available at httparchivegaogovt2pbat2152624pdf 10 dots views on the impact of cargo preference on us food aid shipments are expressed in letter included in the recent gao report 07560 foreign assistance various challenges impede the efficiency and effectiveness of us food aid april 2007 p 76 gao also found in its latest report on the subject that cargo preference laws add to food aid costs and suggested that reimbursements might not be adequate to cover them 11 barrett and maxwell op cit p133 the authors estimate also that 40 of food for progress and section 416b commodities are monetized very little monetization occurs with title ii emergency food aid crs8 pvos and cooperatives receive some cash under current law to support their development projects section 202e of the pl 480 statute provides that of the funds made available in fiscal year to title ii not less than 5 nor more than 10 shall be made available to eligible organizations in establishing new programs or meeting specific administrative management personnel and internal transportation and distribution costs such funds may not be used for such expenses as technical assistance training or projectrelated materials however some pvos have begun to question the use of monetization as source of funds care which has been supporter of monetization in the past has decided to transition out of monetization over the next two years according to care monetization is managementintensive costly fraught with legal and financial risks and economically inefficient as care notes in its food aid policy paper purchasing food in the us shipping it overseas and then selling it to generate funds for food security programs is far less costeffective than the logical alternative simply providing cash to fund food security programs12 echoing criticisms of commodity food aid heard in wto doha round negotiations discussed below care notes that when monetization involves openmarket sale of commodities to generate cash which is almost always the case it inevitably causes commercial displacement as such it can be harmful to traders and local farmers and undermine the development of local markets and be detrimental to longerterm food security objectives catholic relief services crs has taken similar position with respect to monetization but has not announced phaseout of monetization13 monetization has its supporters among the pvos and cooperatives that implement development projects that use food aid supporters maintain that monetization can have multiple benefits particularly in lowincome countries that depend on imports to meet food needs in such circumstances monetization supporters say can compensate for limited liquidity or limited access to credit for international purchases of food other benefits of monetization cited include its use to increase smallscale traders participation in local markets and financial systems and its use to control urban price spikes furthermore supporters say monetized commodities can be integrated into agricultural processing operations helping to establish feed mills fortified foods or other locally important products in all such cases proponents maintain monetization programs should be subject to market analysis required in pl 480 legislation to ensure that commodities monetized will not interfere with local production or marketing and that there is adequate storage for the commodities provided wto food aid issues food aid has become one of several unresolved issues in the current world trade organization wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations that has 12 careusa white paper on food aid policy june 6 2006 available at

november 200114 food aid has been considered under the rubric of export competition with some us trading partners alleging that the united states has used food aid to circumvent its export subsidy reduction commitments and that food aid displaces commercial sales the united states has for the most part argued for continuation of commodity food aid while the european union has proposed that food aid be subject to rules that apply to other forms of export subsidies the eu has offered to eliminate its agricultural export subsidies longstanding aim of us agricultural trade policy worth about 3 billion if the united states will make parallel reductions in food aid and export credit guarantees us pvos who monetize inkind food aid commodities to finance projects in developing countries are concerned that new wto disciplines aimed at preventing commercial displacement could severely limit their ability to do development work other us pvos that have made extensive use of monetization however have indicated that they will begin to phase out monetization as source of funding for their development projects some agreement was reached on how to curb the export subsidy aspects of food aid at doha round negotiating session in hong kong in december 200515 negotiators agreed to establish safe box for emergency food aid to ensure there would be impediment to dealing with emergency situations without deciding on details negotiators agreed in principle that disciplines would be established for inkind food aid and monetization so as to eliminate any displacement of commercial sales by food aid most recently the chairperson of the agriculture negotiations in the doha round circulated draft of possible modalities for agriculture16 in the context of negotiations on food aid modalities would include understandings and rules or guidelines for how food aid programs would be carried out by wto member countries the wto stresses that the draft modalities are not proposals but rather are the negotiations chairpersons judgement of what wto members might be able to agree based on what they have proposed and debated in the seven years of negotiations17 the draft modalities for food aid include several general propositions these are that food aid should be provided on needsdriven basis and in fully grant form not tying food aid transactions to commercial agricultural or other exports nor linking food aid to market development objectives of donor wto members and prohibiting the commercial reexportation of food aid commodities 14 for background on the wto agriculture

17 see wto commentary on the draft modalities for agriculture at httpwwwwtoorg englishtratop_eagric_echair_texts07_ehtm crs10 according to the draft modalities report safe box would be established for emergency food aid food aid provided as emergency aid whether cash or inkind would not be subject to challenge if there has been declaration of emergency by the recipient country or the secretarygeneral of the united nations or if there has been an appeal for emergency aid from country or from relevant agency such as the world food program and if needs assessment has been undertaken by relevant agency for nonemergency food aid the draft modalities provide that such aid would be based on an assessment of need by an identified multilateral third party organization targeted to wellidentified vulnerable population group and provided to address specific developmental objectives or nutritional requirements the draft modalities report says that monetization shall either be prohibited except or permissible where it is necessary to fund activities that are directly related to the delivery of food aid to the recipient or for the procurement of agricultural inputs further such monetization would be carried out under the auspices of relevant agency and the recipient government food aid legislative proposals the administration and two groups of pvos and cooperatives that carry out food aid programs have made recommendations for legislative changes in farm bill authorized food aid programs in addition two identical legislative proposals for increased funding of the mcgoverndole international school feeding and child nutrition program were introduced in the 110th congress hr 1616 mcgovern and s 946 durbin hr 1616 attracted more than 100 cosponsors the administrations proposal for local or regional purchase for emergency food aid high transportation costs and lengthy delays before us commodities arrive at their destinations in emergency situations prompted the administration to propose that the administrator of usaid be given the authority to use up to 25 of the funds available for pl 480 title ii to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are needed18 the rationale for this proposed new authority is that it would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the us response to food aid emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by ocean carriers according to the administrations proposal savings achieved in transportation and distribution costs would be available for additional commodity purchases thus increasing the overall level of the us response to emergencies local or regional purchases would also shorten the time it takes to get food supplies to where they are needed 18 the administration farm bill food aid proposals are available at httpwwwusdagov documents07finalfbppdf legislative language for title iii food aid programs proposed by the administration is at httpwwwusdagovdocumentsfbtrade_071pdf crs11 this farm bill food aid recommendation is not the first time that the administration has proposed allocating funds for local or regional purchase the presidents fy2006 budget request contained proposal to shift 300 million from pl 480 title ii to usaids international disaster and famine assistance account which is administered separately from title ii the funds would have been used to purchase food for emergency relief in markets closer to their final destinations rather than in the united states as required under pl 480 the proposal however proved controversial with farm groups agribusinesses and the maritime industry that supply and ship commodities for title ii and with many pvos pvos that rely on food aid to carry out development projects in poor countries many pvos expressed concern that the allocation of up to 25 of the pl 480 title ii funds could reduce the volume of commodities available for development projects the conference report hrept 109255 accompanying the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act pl 10997 addressed the issue of converting portion of pl 480 commodity food aid into cash by stating the conferees admonish the executive branch to refrain from proposals which place at risk carefully balanced coalition of interests which have served the interests of international food assistance programs well for more than fifty years the presidents fy2007 and fy2008 budget requests also contained proposed appropriations language to allow the administrator of usaid to use up to 25 of pl 480 title ii funds for local or regional purchases of commodities in food crises the senate report srept 109266 accompanying the fy2007 agriculture appropriations bill explicitly rejected this proposal stating that the committee does not agree with the administrations proposal to shift up to 25 of the public law 480 title ii program level to usaid to be used for direct cash purchases of commodities and other purposes proponents of local or regional purchase argue that it would mean quicker and lowercost delivery of food and be less likely to disrupt receiving country markets19 proponents admit that there would be some risks if local markets are unable to absorb large increases in food demand that local purchases could represent the quality of local food products and ability to transport food locally are also potential problems one study of the world food programs experience with local and regional purchases found that such risks are manageable however and could be avoided20 another study of global food aid transactions found that local food aid procurement was 66 19 see for example us international food assistance programs issues and options for the 2007 farm bill by christopher b

donor countries21 an estimated 60 of all food aid from all donors is locally or regionally procured22 proposals of the alliance for food aid the alliance for food aid an organization that represents 15 pvos and cooperatives that operate food aid projects in developing and transition countries has made number of proposals for legislative changes in us food aid programs23 alliance member organizations use us food aid commodities which they often monetize or sell primarily to carry out such nonemergency or development projects as motherchild health clinics agricultural development projects food for work projects eg food as payment for work on community infrastructure projects and projects that target hivaids affected communities key recommendation of the alliance is the establishment of safe box for nonemergency food aid which would ensure that 12 million metric tons of non emergency food aid commodities would be available to pvoscoops each year this volume of commodities would not be subject to waiver by the administrator of usaid as is provided under current law mandates such as this one especially without the possibility of waiver have generally been resisted by usaid the title iiadministering agency usaids argument is that such mandates deny the agency flexibility especially in responding to emergency food needs the administrations fy2007 budget request for pl 480 food aid included proposal to eliminate the requirement in current law that 75 of title ii commodities be allocated to non emergency food aid programs the existing nonemergency commodity mandate has not been met in recent years figure 2 this has been source of concern for pvoscooperatives who depend on food aid commodities to carry out nonemergency or development projects the alliance for food aid also recommends that cash now made available under section 202e of pl 107171 be raised to 10 and that pvoscooperatives be allowed to use such funds not only for operational and administrative purposes provided in current law but also for the costs of development projects current law provides that between 5 and 10 of title ii funds can be used for administrative and operational expense in connection with food aid programs also the alliance proposes that such funds be used by eligible organizations to improve needs assessments and monitoring and reporting on the effects of monetization and other aspects of food aid programs increasing the cash available and broadening the purposes for which it can be used would the alliance maintains enable food aid 21 edward

order to make it more reliable contingency for food aid emergencies one rationale for making changes in the trust is to enable it to respond in more timely manner to emergencies in addition the alliance wants to make emerson trust commodities more available so that nonemergency food aid would not be shifted to emergency relief to accomplish these aims the alliance suggests increasing the amount of pl 480 title ii funds that can be used for beht reimbursements from 20 million per year as provided in current law to 60 million per year this funding would be made available annually until the trust reached its maximum level of 4 million metric tons or the dollar equivalent the alliance contends that the trust should be replenished with funds rather than commodities so that the most appropriate commodities can be procured when needed currently the trust holds only wheat which is not always the most needed commodity in emergency situations the alliance does not endorse the administrations proposal for local or regional purchase of commodities for emergency food relief it does however call for pilot local purchase project to assure that accepted practices of food aid program are followed and to identify future methodologies and best practices for future programs neither does the alliance endorse legislation introduced in the 110th congress to substantially increase funding for the mcgoverndole program instead it calls for making available an appropriation of not less that 100 million annually so that funds would be available for multiyear programs crs14 proposals of catholic relief services care mercy corps and save the children group of four pvos joined together for the purpose of making common set of recommendations for legislative change in us food aid programs24 these four organizations were formerly members along with current alliance members of group that called itself the coalition for food aid the four pvos differed with other coalition members over the role of monetization in nonemergency development food aid projects the group of four pvos has decided generally to phase out the use of monetization in their food aid projects while alliance members argue for the continued utility of monetization both as source of finance for projects and as tool to help build local food marketing capacity as an alternative to monetization the four pvos propose increasing the amount of cash that would be available to pl 480 title ii programs the group of four pvos makes three main recommendations for legislative changes in us food aid programs first the group calls for changes in the emerson trust that would make it in its view more effective mechanism for responding to emergency food needs to accomplish this these pvos call for automatic first use of the beht when title ii emergency resources have been exhausted in given year the group also proposes that the resources available for emergency food aid be increased to 50 of title ii one rationale for using the emerson trust in this way is to protect resources for non emergency development programs the group of four pvos proposes the following changes in the beht 1 liquidate the current stocks in the trust so that it will hold only cash 2 allow the commodity credit corporation ccc to invest the cash in the trust in conservative shortterm instruments for an appropriate return 3 require the administration to use the emerson trust once title ii emergency funding allocations have been made to avoid the need to use development food aid to fund emergency responses and 4 provide authority to the ccc to automatically replenish the trust in fiscal year second the group of four pvos calls for establishing bridging mechanism to ensure that there are funding breaks in the food aid pipeline the bridging mechanism would consist of authority for the administrator of usaid to draw on ccc funds to contract for commodities and freight to meet programming needs in the next fiscal year prior to the actual enactment of an appropriation the ccc would be reimbursed promptly from the title ii appropriation when it becomes available the group argues that such bridging mechanism would avoid small scale commodity purchases and shipments that occur early in the year which push up both commodity and freight costs and generally force pvos to scale back or stretch out 24 testimony of catholic relief services on behalf of itself care mercy corps and save the children before the house agriculture subcommittee on specialty crops rural development and foreign agriculture may 10 2007 at httpwwwcrsorgnewsroomspeechestestimonyentrycfmid838 crs15 program resources to try to minimize harm to participants enrolled in planned or approved programs the main issue raised by proposals such as these is cost using ccc funds to finance the operations of the beht or to establish bridging mechanism as described by the group of four pvos would be subject to payasyougo budget rules which means that any increase in mandatory spending that resulted from reforms of the beht would have to be offset by reduced mandatory spending elsewhere or with increased revenues the third proposal from the group of four pvos is to make more cash available to pvos through title ii this group argues that cash would provide greater flexibility in carrying out programs to fight world hunger it maintains that the real causes of food insecurity and hunger cannot be solved over the long term by the provision of food aid alone and that additional resources in the form of cash are essential to address the hunger problem like the alliance the group of four focuses on section 202e cash but unlike the alliance it calls for substantially increasing the funds available from 202e for both program operations and program costs to not less than 25 of funds available to title ii the group of four also calls for using authorizing language patterned after that in the mcgoverndole food for education and child nutrition program the legislative authorization for mcgoverndole the group notes allows for mix of commodities cash and technical assistance to carry out its programs strength of such authorizing language according to the four pvos is that it discourages implementing organizations from monetizing commodities because it is much easier and more cost effective to use cash congressional action title iii of the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill reauthorizes and amends us international food aid programs title iii in both bills extends these programs through 2012 the bills selectively incorporate recommendations of the pvoscooperatives for food aid program changes the house bill disregards the one food aid recommendation from the administration to allocate up to quarter of pl 480 title ii funds to local or regional purchase of emergency however the senate bill includes authority to use pl 480 title ii funds for pilot program for local or regional purchase of emergency food aid commodities pl 480 the house bill extends the pl 480 food aid programs through 2012 and authorizes discretionary appropriations for pl 480 title ii humanitarian donations of 25 billion annually if appropriated that amount would represent very substantial increase over the 12 billion appropriated annually in recent years an increase in appropriations for pl 480 title ii of this magnitude was initially provision in hr 2488 the house foreign affairs committeereported version of the farm bills trade title hr 2419 also extends the minimum tonnage requirements of title ii through 2012 the housepassed bill also increases the amount of cash that could be allocated to pvos to pay for projectrelated expenses hr 2419 crs16 increases section 202e cash support to not less than 7 nor more than 12 of funds available to title ii this amount is more than proposed by the alliance for food aid but considerably less than proposed by the group of four pvos that sought substantially increased cash resources for food aid development projects the senate version of title iii also reauthorizes pl 480 food aid programs and extends the minimum tonnage requirements for title ii through 2012 in contrast to hr 2419 the senate bill does not increase the appropriation for title ii the senate bill increases the share of title ii funds that can be used to cover projectrelated expenses of pvos to not less than 75 nonemergency development food aid the housepassed bill stipulates that of the funds made available for title ii not less than 450 million annually be made available for nonemergency development food aid this minimum level of nonemergency assistance could not be waived unless requested by the administrator of usaid followed by enactment of law approving the administrators request the senate bill establishes minimum of 600 million for development food aid that also would not be subject to waivers following passage of the housepassed bill the office of management and budget in its statement of administrative policy said that it strongly opposed this provision because it would deprive the administration of the ability to quickly waive it in an emergency omb estimated that this house bill provision would result in 100 million decrease in emergency food aid local or regional purchase for emergency food aid the house passed farm bill disregarded the administrations sole farm bill food aid proposal for legislative authority to allocate up to 25 of title ii funds to local or regional purchase of commodities for emergency relief hr 2419 did however stipulate that 40 million of the funds appropriated for usaids international disaster and famine assistance idfa program be allocated to famine prevention and relief idfa funds can be used to purchase commodities locally or regionally in contrast the senate farm bill establishes pilot program authorized at 25 million annually to explore how local or regional procurement of food in emergency situations might be used other pl 480 provisions both bills extend provision for the food aid consultative group facg which reviews the effectiveness of rules for the title ii program the group is composed of representatives of usaid usda pvos recipient countries and us agricultural producers the senate bill adds representative of the maritime transport sector to the facg both bills extend the authorization for usaid grants for stockpiling and distributing shelfstable foods the house bill increases the amount that can be appropriated from 3 million to 7 million the senate bill increases the amount to 8 million in addition the bills extend authorization for the use of pl 480 funds for prepositioning of agricultural commodities overseas the house bill increases from not more than 2 million to not more than 8 million the amount that can be spent to store commodities overseas the senate bill increases the amount that can be spent on overseas storage to not more than 4 million crs17 both bills reauthorize the ogonowski farmertofarmer program the house bill provides floor level of annual funding for the farmertofarmer program of 10 million or not less than 05 whichever is greater and authorizes appropriations of 10 million for subsaharan african and caribbean basin countries and 5 million for all other countries the senate bill reauthorizes the program without change other food aid programs food for progress the house bill reauthorizes without change the food for progress program through fy2012 the senate bill also reauthorizes food for progress and increases the amount that can be spent on transporting commodities from 40 million annually to 48 million for fy2008fy2010 mcgoverndole food for education in reauthorizing the mcgovern dole program the housepassed bill changes its funding basis from discretionary to mandatory and increases spending from 140 million in fy2009 to 300 million in fy2012 funding for mcgoverndole under the 2002 farm bill has averaged around 97 million annually these provisions for the mcgoverndole program substantially increasing funding and making it mandatory are virtually identical to those included in hr 1616 mcgovern and s 946 durbin introduced earlier in the 110th congress mandatory mcgoverndole spending would be offset by changes in the federal crop insurance program the senate bill reauthorizes the food for education program but calls for 300 million in discretionary appropriations to fund the program the bill emerson humanitarian trust the senate bill reauthorizes the trust through 2012 and makes number of changes in the statute governing the emerson trust the bill specifies that the trust can be held as combination of commodities and cash not to exceed the equivalent of 4 million tons of commodities commodities held in the trust can be exchanged for funds available under pl 480 title ii the mcgoverndole program or the market if the secretary of agriculture determines that such sales will not disrupt the domestic market the bill allows the funds held in the trust to be invested in lowrisk shortterm securities or instruments the housepassed farm bill extended authority for the emerson trust through fy2012 without other modifications for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34145
