these are all the possible treatments for day spa but we dont have to use all of them note that udvartana involves longe r clean up than the other treatments also please note that it is better if there is common locker room area for men and one for ladies rather than individual bathrooms attached to each massage room this allows us to move the guests out of the massage room more quickly thus getting more people through room each day people can spend long time in the shower therefore with private bathrooms we must allow additional time at least 20 minutes for showering with public showers we only need to allow 5 to 10 minutes rest after the treatments 1 vedic rejuvenation massage abhya nga 60 minutes 170 our signature massage performed by two therapists this luxurious herbal oil
