from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to trenbertucaredu subject re draft paper on chinese temperature trends date tue jan 15 142818 2008 cc davidparkermetofficegovuk thomascpetersonnoaagov reinhard boehm reinhardboehmzamgacat susan solomon susansolomonnoaagov adrian simmons adriansimmonsecmwfint kevin homogeneity only done on mean t lots of sites just measure this lot will measure max and min but i havent got the data i also didnt want to get into maxmin as what is relevant to urbanrelated warming in the global land series or china is the effects on mean t i cant then look at max or min against rural series i would expect max to have changed less than min but i cant really look at that also i dont want to confuse readers by saying there is an urbanrelated temp influence but it is to lower dtr i guess i could refer to vose et our fig 311 which does show decrease in dtr for 7904 over china mostly blues ill work on the text cheers phil at 0450 15012008 kevin trenberth wrote phil i looked at the paper in more detail it obviously needs bit of polishing throughout i have couple of fairly major comments the first is that you only deal with the mean temperature and nothing on the max and min temperatures are those available it would be much more powerful if those could be included the second is the special situation in china associated with urbanization and that is air pollution you do not mention aerosols and their effects we have some on that in ar4 that may be of value refer to our chapter in china there has been so much increase in coal fired power and pollution 11 out of the top worst ten polluted cities in the world are in china or something like that so you do not see the sun for long periods of time presumably that greatly cuts down on the max temp but may also increase the min through sort of greenhouse effect effects of urban runoff tend to warm and space heating also warms but should mainly affect the min pollution may not be in the inner city but concentrated more near the sites of industry and power stations but also may not be that local owing to winds pollution may also change fog or smog conditions and may also change drizzle and precip looking at other variables could help with whether the changes are local or linked to atmospheric circulation the unique aspect of urbanization related to air pollution should make china different but may not be easily untangled without max and min temps and dtr anyway given these aspects you may want to at least assemble the expectations somewhere altogether and discuss max day vs night min effects hope this helps kevin dear all i have mentioned to you all that ive been working on paper on chinese temperature trends this partly started because of allegations about jones et 1990 this shows as expected that these claims were groundless anyway id appreciate if you could have look at this draft i have spelt things out in some detail at times but im expecting if it is published that it will get widely read and all the words dissected i know youre all very busy and i could have been doing something more useful but it hasnt taken too long the european examples are just simple way to illustrate the difference between uhis and urbanrelated warming trends and an excuse to reference luke howard cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk ___________________ kevin trenberth climate analysis section ncar po box 3000 boulder co 80307 ph 303 497 1318 1httpwwwcgducareducastrenberthtml prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpwwwcgducareducastrenberthtml
