congresses october 2 2006 richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress lame duck sessions of congress 19352004 74th108th congresses summary lame duck session of congress occurs whenever one congress meets after its successor is elected but before the successors term begins the expression is now used not only for special session called after sine die adjournment but also for any portion of regular session that falls after an election in current practice any meeting of congress after election day but before the following january 3 is lame duck session prior to 1933 when the 20th amendment changed the dates of the congressional term the last regular session of congress was always lame duck session lame duck session can occur in several ways 1 in practice congress has usually provided for its existing session to resume after recess spanning the election in 1954 only the senate returned in this way while the house adjourned sine die 2 in 1940 1942 and 2002 congress continued meeting sometimes in pro forma sessions every third day until well after the election 3 congress can reconvene after an election pursuant to contingent authority granted to the leadership in recess or adjournment resolution in 1998 the house alone followed this course two other possibilities have not been realized 4 congress could set statutory date for new session to convene after the election then adjourn its existing session sine die 5 while congress is in recess or sine die adjournment the president could call it into extraordinary session at date after the election congress held total of 15 lame duck sessions from 1940 through 2004 recesses preceding lame duck sessions have usually begun by midoctober and typically lasted between one and two months congress typically reconvened in mid november and adjourned before christmas so that the lame duck session lasted about month some recesses however have begun as early as august 7 or as late as november 3 and ended as early as november 8 or as late as december 31 lame duck sessions have ended as early as november 22 and as late as january 3 and have extended over as few as one and as many as 145 calendar days some lame duck sessions have been held largely for pro forma reasons eg 1948 on standby basis eg 1940 1942 or to deal with single specific matter eg 1954 1998 1994 some sessions as well have deferred major matters to the succeeding congress eg 1944 1982 2004 especially when stronger majority for the same party was in prospect most however could be regarded as at least moderately productive when the president has presented an extensive agenda to lame duck session controlled by his own party it has often approved many of his recommendations eg 1950 2002 2004 but when he has done so under conditions of divided government he has had less success and has often vetoed measures eg 1970 1974 1982 additionally major task of most lame duck sessions in recent years has been to complete action on appropriations and the budget in 1974 1980 1982 2000 and 2004 this effort was at least somewhat successful but in 1970 and 2002 final resolution was largely left to the following congress this report will be updated after any additional lame duck session occurs contents what makes lame duck session 1 meaning of lame

session lame duck session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held but before the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term under contemporary conditions any meeting of congress that occurs between congressional election in november and the following january 3 is lame duck session the significant characteristic of lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting members of the existing congress not those who will be entitled to sit in the new congress1 meaning of lame duck the expression lame duck was originally applied in 18th century britain to bankrupt businessmen who were considered as lame in the sense that the impairment of their powers rendered them vulnerable like game bird injured by shot by the 1830s the usage had been extended to officeholders whose service already had known termination date in current american usage for instance president is considered lame duck not only if he has been defeated for reelection or after his successor has been elected but also whenever he cannot be or is known not to be candidate for reelection members of congress in similar circumstances are also considered lame ducks the expression may accordingly be applied to members who are known not to be seeking reelection as well as to those who have been defeated in particular however after an election of congress all the members who did not gain reelection can be described as lame ducks until the term of the new congress starts when the previously sitting congress which includes these members meets in postelection session this session is called lame duck session as well2 1 earlier versions of this report were prepared by the present author in collaboration with richard c sachs formerly specialist in american national government in crs in particular mr sachs was responsible for much of the text describing individual lame duck sessions 2 see raymond w smock lame duck session in donald c bacon roger h davidson and morton keller eds the encyclopedia of the united states congress new york simon schuster c 1995 vol 3 pp 12441245 crs2 lame duck sessions in the modern congress the possibility of lame duck session of congress in the modern sense began in 1935 when the 20th amendment to the constitution took effect under this amendment ratified in 1933 congress meets in regular session on january 3 of each year unless in the previous session it passes law changing the date also the terms of members begin and end on january 3 of oddnumbered years under these arrangements any meeting of congress after election day in november of even numbered years but before the following january 3 is lame duck session from 1935 through 2004 there were 15 lame duck sessions the most recent one occurred at the end of the 108th congress in 2004 this report examines only the specific lame duck sessions that have occurred since 1935 not those that occurred routinely before this date as explained in the following section lame duck sessions before the 20th amendment the constitution originally provided that the regular sessions of congress begin annually on the first monday in december in the process of initiating the government under the constitution it was established that the term of congress would begin and end of march 4 of oddnumbered years3 as today however congressional elections were generally held in november of evennumbered years the result was that after being elected in an evennumbered november new congress did not begin its term until the following oddnumbered march and was not required to convene until the following december 13 months after it was first elected4 this first december session of congress typically continued until sometime in the summer of the following evennumbered year the congress would then adjourn until the time for the next regular session prescribed by the constitution the following evennumbered december when congress reconvened at that time however the next congress would already have been elected in the intervening evennumbered november the term of that newly elected congress on the other hand would not begin until the following march the congress that convened in an evennumbered december accordingly could not be the newly elected one but could only be the one already sitting under these arrangements as result the last session of every congress was 3 see johnny h killian george costello and kenneth r thomas eds the constitution of the united states of america analysis and interpretation prepared by the congressional research service library of congress washington gpo 2004 p 2089 commentary on the 20th amendment 4 in practice new congress was sometimes first convened in an extra session that began closer to the start of its constitutional term as described in following sections this extra session could occur pursuant to either presidential call or law passed by the previous congress crs3 always lame duck session5 one purpose of the 20th amendment was to change these arrangements that routinely required every congress to hold its last session as lame duck session6 how lame duck sessions may occur under the 20th amendment lame duck sessions can still occur but only as result of specific actions undertaken either by the congress already sitting or by the president the specific actions through which sitting congress might reconvene after an election but during the last portion of its own term of office are of several kinds the following sections describe these possible means of reconvening although some have been used rarely and others not at all each method helps to illuminate the constitutional arrangements that make lame duck sessions possible and the conditions in which they may operate the courses of action through which congress might reconvene for lame duck session include doing so 1 pursuant to previously enacted law prescribing an additional session of congress 2 following recess within session but spanning the election 3 under authority granted to the leadership at the time of contingent adjournment or recess of the session 4 by continuing to meet perhaps in pro forma sessions throughout the period spanning the election and 5 in response to presidential proclamation calling an extraordinary session sine die adjournment and its effects although the lame duck sessions that have occurred before and after 1935 are both lame duck in the same sense they are not sessions in the same sense formally session of congress ends when congress adjourns sine die7 the latin phrase literally translated as without day is used to mean that congress has adjourned without setting day for its next meeting an adjournment sine die therefore means that congress is not scheduled to meet again until the day set by the constitution or by law for its next session to convene when congress adjourns sine die in an election year it is not scheduled to meet again until after the term of the new congress begins that meeting will therefore begin the first session of the new congress 5 this session beginning in the evennumbered december could last only last until the term of the sitting congress expired early in the following march when the new congress came into office for this reason it was colloquially known as the short session 6 see p orman ray lameduck amendment in stanley i kutler ed dictionary of american history 3d ed new york scribner 2003 vol 5 p 24 for more information on the adoption of the 20th amendment see alan p grimes democracy and the amendments to the constitution lexington mass lexington books dc heath c 1978 pp 104108 7 in congressional usage the phrase is generally pronounced sign dye crs4 before 1935 congress would normally adjourn its previous session sine die before the november elections when it returned for its prescribed meeting in december accordingly new session began under these conditions the lame duck session of each congress was actually session in its own right numerically distinct from the previous session or sessions of the same congress accordingly each of the lame duck sessions that occurred routinely before 1935 was convened as separate session of the congress already sitting congress today could achieve an equivalent result by adjourning its session sine die before an election after first providing by law for an additional session of the old congress to convene on date after the election this additional postelection session probably the third session of the old congress would be lame duck session in same sense as those that occurred routinely before 1935 it would be new separately numbered session of the old congress subsequent to the implementation of the 20th amendment in 1935 however congress has never made use of this first means of bringing about lame duck session recess of the session instead when congress has decided to continue meeting after an election its usual practice has been not to adjourn sine die but simply to recess its existing session for period spanning the election and then to reconvene at date still within the constitutional term of the sitting congress since 1935 this second means of bringing about lame duck session has been used on 11 occasions as detailed in table 1 and the section on means of calling sessions congress authorizes session recess in the same way it authorizes sine die adjournment by adopting concurrent resolution this form of authorization is necessary because the constitution provides that neither house during the session of congress shall without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days8 concurrent resolution requires adoption by both houses and accordingly can be used for each house to consent to the adjournment of the other this constitutional requirement applies both to sine die adjournments and to session recesses which are technically adjournments within session unlike sine die adjournment however recess does not terminate an existing session of congress when congress reconvenes at the conclusion of recess accordingly new session begins but the previously existing session resumes under these conditions the postelection meeting of congress is not separate new session of the old congress but continuation of its existing session probably its second session nevertheless the phrase lame duck session has persisted as way of referring to any postelection meeting of the old congress even though it now normally does not designate separate session of congress but rather refers simply to the postelection portion of an ongoing existing session 8 constitution article i sec 5 crs5 contingent authority to reconvene the two sequences of events just discussed recess of an existing session and adjourning sine die after providing for new session are not the only ones that can lead to lame duck session third such course of events becomes possible if when congress recesses before an election it grants contingent authority to its leadership to reconvene it or either house if the public interest shall require in the period since ratification of the 20th amendment the practice has grown up that congress often includes this contingent authority in some form in concurrent resolutions providing for session recess or sine die adjournment if congress included this contingent authority in resolution providing for recess spanning an election the leadership might use the authority to reconvene congress before the scheduled expiration of the recess it might do so either before or after the election itself but in either case any portion of the reconvened session occurring after the election would be considered lame duck session during the time since the 20th amendment took effect however this course of action has not been taken if congress adjourns sine die with contingent reconvening authority on the other hand the sine die character of the adjournment becomes final only if the leadership does not exercise this authority by the time the next session of congress is slated to convene pursuant to either the constitution or law if the authority is exercised the existing session of the old congress resumes and the previous adjournment turns out not to have been sine die any postelection portion of this continuation of the previous session of congress would be considered lame duck session the speaker of the house used authority of this kind in 1998 to reconvene the chamber in postelection continuation of session that had previously been terminated by conditional sine die adjournment9 intermittent and pro forma sessions fourth way in which lame duck session can occur arises if congress chooses not to authorize recess spanning an election in this case the lame duck session occurs if congress simply continues to meet throughout the preelection period and afterwards any portion of the continuing session of congress that takes place after the election would be considered lame duck session as table 1 and the accompanying discussion shows congress has taken this course of action on three occasions since 1935 on some occasions under these conditions each house has chosen to meet only on every third day during the period spanning the election and sometimes throughout the postelection period as well until sine die adjournment in addition it is not necessary that either house transact any business during these intermittent meetings if during given days session business is transacted it becomes pro forma 9 notification of reassembling of congress proceedings in the house congressional record vol 144 dec 17 1998 p 27770 see hconres 353 105th cong 112 stat 3699 at 3700 crs6 session meaning one held only for the sake of formality in this case the formality being satisfied is the constitutional requirement that neither house recess for more than three days if the other has not consented to recess10 sessions called by the president final means by which lame duck session could occur arises from the constitutional authorization for the president to convene congress on extraordinary occasions by calling special session11 if congress convenes pursuant to this call after sine die adjournment and before the next session is scheduled to begin new session of the existing congress begins this course of events has not occurred since 193512 on the other hand if the president calls congress back during recess of an existing session the existing session resumes this course of events occurred in 1948 when president harry truman called congress back for an extraordinary session in the middle of recess for the national political conventions the extraordinary session called by president truman did not constitute lame duck session because it both convened and recessed before the election by the same means however president might call an extraordinary session to convene at date after the election and before the term of the sitting congress ends he could do so whether congress had only recessed its previous session or had adjourned it sine die in either case the postelection meeting of congress would be considered lame duck session13 lame duck session since 1935 has occurred through this means characteristics of lame duck sessions since 1935 since the 20th amendment became effective in 1935 there have been 15 lame duck sessions for each of them table 1 provides information on when the preelection portion of the session ended whether congress stayed in session recessed to specified date or adjourned sine die when the postelection or lame duck portion of the session began and when congress adjourned the

76th congress b reconvened pursuant to contingent authority granted to leadership in the adjournment resolution crs8 occurrence of sessions lame duck sessions were frequent in the years surrounding world war ii occurring in six of eight congresses 76th through 83rd between 1940 and 1954 none occurred from 1956 through and 1968 there were two in each of the next three decades another gap occurred from 1984 through 1992 since then lame duck sessions have occurred in five of the six congresses 103rd through 108th including the last four congresses in row on one occasion in 1954 only the senate returned and only to consider the censure of senator joseph mccarthy and once in 1998 only the house returned principally to consider the impeachment of president william j clinton means of calling sessions twelve lame duck sessions have been preceded by recess spanning the election the remaining three congresses continued to meet intermittently often in pro forma session during the election period the latter schedule was used for the first two lame duck sessions after adoption of the 20th amendment which occurred shortly before or during world war ii in 1940 and 1942 it was again used only in 2002 congress suspended its session during the election period preceding 12 lame duck sessions since 1935 on seven of these 12 occasions 1944 1948 1974 1994 1998 2000 and 2004 the resolution providing for the break afforded contingent authority to the leadership to call congress back before the scheduled resumption of the session for the remaining five lame duck sessions 1950 1954 1970 1980 and 1982 congress did not afford the leadership this authority ten of these 12 election breaks represented recesses of the ongoing session of congress the remaining two cases were those mentioned above in which only one house returned after the election in 1954 the house adjourned sine die and the senate recessed with contingent reconvening authority permitting the senate to deal with the censure of senator mccarthy in lame duck session in 1998 both houses adjourned sine die with contingent reconvening authority the house leadership then used the reconvening authority to call the chamber back to address the question of impeachment this last instance is the only occasion on which lame duck session has convened pursuant to contingent authority of the leadership timing of sessions since 1970 when congress has recessed before lame duck session the beginning of the recess has most often occurred in early to midoctober the latest that congress has ever continued to meet before recessing for an election was in 2000 106th congress when the senate left on november 2 and the house on november 3 prior to 1970 by contrast each of the four election recesses preceding lame duck session began in september or august the earliest start of an election recess was august 7 1948 80th congress in this case congress had recessed its regular crs9 session on june 20 scheduling itself to reconvene on december 31 but president truman had called congress back into extraordinary session on july 26 most commonly lame duck sessions have convened in the latter half of november the latest date of reconvening after an election was that of the 80th congress on december 31 1948 except for years when congress took election recess the earliest reconvening of both houses occurred in 1980 when the 97th congress returned on november 12 but in 1954 83rd congress the senate alone returned on november 8 congress also reconvened on relatively early dates in 2000 106th congress when the house returned on november 13 and the senate on november 14 and in 1944 78th congress when both houses returned on november 14 lame duck sessions have most often adjourned sine die in about middecember or at least before christmas the 76th congress however did not close until january 3 1941 when the 77th congress was to convene this termination represents the latest sine die adjournment among the 15 lame duck sessions other late terminations occurred in the 81st and 91st congresses both of which adjourned sine die on january 2 1951 and 1971 respectively the earliest end of lame duck session occurred in 2002 107th congress when the house adjourned sine die on november 22 the senate having done so two days earlier length of sessions lame duck sessions since 1935 have typically lasted about month the average that is mean length from commencement to closing has been 28 calendar days the median 33 that is half the lame duck sessions were longer than 33 days and half shorter eight of the 15 lame duck sessions have lasted between 25 and 37 calendar days only three have exceeded this range the longest was the first 76th congress which lasted 58 days meeting usually every third day between november 7 1940 the day after election day and january 3 1941 the 77th congress 1942 followed similar pattern but adjourned sine die after 48 calendar days the lame duck session of the 91st congress reached 45 calendar days by remaining in session until january 2 1971 the shortest lame duck session occurred in the 80th congress when both houses returned solely to close the session on december 31 1948 other unusually short the lame duck sessions included those of 1994 103rd congress and 1998 105th congress house only each of which lasted only three calendar days the length of the recess preceding lame duck session has also varied on the 12 occasions since 1935 when congress recessed for the election the recess typically lasted between one month and two nine of the 12 election recesses fell between 30 and 64 days in length the mean length of all 12 has been 54 days and the median 51 the only election recess shorter than 30 days occurred in 2000 when the 106th congress recessed for only nine days around the election the longest election recess occurred in 1948 80th congress when 145 days elapsed between the end of the special session called by president truman and the largely pro forma reconvening and adjournment on december 31 the only other election recess longer than 64 days occurred in 1954 83rd congress and lasted 79 days crs10 lame duck sessions since 1935 following are summaries of the 15 lame duck sessions held since 1935 primary sources including the congressional record and congressional directory and secondary sources including the congressional quarterly weekly report cq almanac and for the earlier years the new york times constituted the basis for these descriptions internetbased sources were also utilized 76th congress 3rd session 19401941 after the first session of the 76th congress adjourned in august 1939 president franklin d roosevelt called congress into extraordinary session in september to deal with the threat of war in europe and this session lasted into november thus the annual session that began on january 3 1940 was the third session of the 76th congress it too was dominated by the international situation the president requested the largest peacetime defense program to that point in american history and by the end of the summer congress had enacted 13 billion in defense authorizations and appropriations military draft income tax revisions an excess profits tax and related measures in june july and again in september 1940 the president offered the view that congress need not remain in session any longer some congressional leaders however held that congress should stand by in session in case of emergency congress met regularly through midoctober then limited itself to two or three meetings per week until january 3 1941 there was extended recess for the november 1940 elections the session thus became the longest in history to that point during the lame duck period following the election little was undertaken the congressional record from november 4 1940 through january 3 1941 covers fewer than 500 pages and quorums were often hard to raise the administration declined to send major new proposals such as defense production board aid to britain new taxes and an increase in the debt limit to capitol hill until the 77th congress would convene in january work also was impeded because both the house and senate had to meet in substitute quarters while their chambers in the capitol underwent repairs among the more notable actions of this lame duck period were the decision to sustain the veto of measure to limit regulatory agency powers and the publication of committee report on sabotage of the defense effort 77th congress 2nd session 1942 in the wartime year of 1942 congress again remained in session continuously through the election adjourning sine die on december 16 congress generally followed regular schedule of daily meetings throughout the period except near the election when it met every third day activities in the lame duck portion of the 77th congress were affected by the knowledge that the 78th congress to begin in january would contain much narrowed democratic majority congress declined to take final action to approve the crs11 third war powers bill14 or bill to expand the reconstruction finance corporation including an agricultural parity rider attached to the latter other questions left to the next congress included comprehensive national service legislation placing ceiling on net personal income through the tax code curbing the powers of regulatory agencies and planning for censorship of communications with us territories bill to abolish poll taxes passed the house but fell to filibuster in the senate congress did pass legislation to adjust overtime pay for government workers and to provide for the military draft of 18 and 19yearold men although congress deferred deciding whether to require full years training before sending them into combat by middecember quorums became difficult to obtain and leaders of both parties agreed that nothing further could be brought up before the start of the 78th congress in january 1943 78th congress 2nd session 1944 two years later with world war ii still in progress congress recessed for the national party conventions and recessed again for the elections the latter recess began on september 21 1944 congress returned on november 14 and remained in session until december 19 accordingly 1944 marks the first instance after ratification of the 20th amendment of separate and distinct meeting of congress during its lame duck period among the issues facing the postelection session were questions of peacetime universal military training extension of the war powers act15 and the reciprocal trade system scheduled increase in social security taxes and rivers and harbors appropriations bill congress also debated congressional reform issues including restructuring the committee system and increasing congressional pay postwar reconstruction and renewal of domestic programs were also mentioned as possible subjects for action ultimately congress deferred several issues until the start of the 79th congress including universal military training the bretton woods monetary agreements the reciprocal trade act and changes to the social security system several other measures could not be completed including rivers and harbors bill senatepassed bill making major changes in congressional procedures and pay increase for postal workers bill delaying the social security tax increase was enacted however as were renewal of the war powers act and bill increasing the congressional clerk hire allowance in addition the senate confirmed the nomination of edward r stettinius as secretary of state 14 this legislation related to the conduct of world war ii and has connection with the war powers resolution pl 93148 87 stat 555 50 usc 15411548 enacted in 1973 to regulate commitments of us armed forces abroad 15 like the measure referred to in the previous note this legislation related to the conduct of world war ii and has connection with the contemporary war powers resolution crs12 80th congress 2nd session 1948 congress recessed in august 1948 before the national party conventions with the intention of returning only on december 31 to bring the 80th congress to formal conclusion unless earlier called back by congressional leaders during the convention recess however president harry s truman called congress back in extraordinary session to deal with series of legislative priorities he considered urgent this occurrence represents the only time since the adoption of the 20th amendment that the president has convened congress in an extraordinary session congress met pursuant to this call from july 27 to august 7 but then recessed again under the same terms as before the leadership did not exercise its option to reconvene congress during this new recess and congress met again only on december 31 this session the shortest lame duck session under the 20th amendment met for just under an hour and half then adjourned sine die during the brief session both chambers approved measure extending for 60 days the life of the commission on organization of the executive branch of government hoover commission the senate also extended for 30 days the life of the special small business committee and both houses swore in new members elected or appointed to full unexpired terms 81st congress 2nd session 19501951 with the korean war at critical juncture in the fall of 1950 congressional leaders announced in late september that after the election congress would reconvene in late november until november congress would be available to meet should the president call an emergency session congress recessed on september 23 and convened for the lame duck session on november 27 as the lame duck session met chinese troops crossed into korea and general douglas macarthur warned congress that the united nations faced an entirely new war in the region the korean war and the possible use of atomic weapons dominated congressional attention through the session nevertheless president truman presented congressional leaders with list of 13 proposals including five he described as of greatest urgency the five included several measures favored by congressional leaders aid to yugoslavia and supplemental appropriations for defense and atomic energy the president also asked congress to act on an excess

2nd session 1980 in 1980 some observers contended that postponing final congressional action on lengthy agenda of major issues until postelection session would accomplish two goals first it would delay potentially difficult preelection votes on budget matters and second it would allow incumbents extra time to campaign the large republican gains on election day were thought to complicate the prospects for productive lame duck program however especially with such important issues as budget reconciliation several major appropriations bills and landmark environmental legislation still left for consideration in fact during the lame duck session from november 12 to december 16 1980 congress completed action on many of the issues that had been left unfinished in the regular session

the democratic house on the other congressional leaders indicated they would finish nine of 10 outstanding money bills but by the end of december congress had completed only four and needed to enact large continuing resolution to fund remaining government operations for fy1983 concerned about recession and rising unemployment house democrats added 54 billion jobs program to the continuing resolution but agreed to remove it when the president threatened veto the lame duck session was acrimonious in both chambers but especially in the senate where frequent filibusters caused some all

days before christmas in addition to completing work on some appropriations bills and the continuing resolution the house approved controversial 15 pay raise for itself an immigration reform bill

finish work on 11 appropriations bills and consider creation of department of homeland security dhs measure at the top of president george w bushs legislative agenda bill to create the dhs had passed the house in late july 2002 but the senate did not act until after the election the senate passed similar version of the measure on november 19 and the house agreed to the senate amendment on november 22 president bush signed the bill into law on november 25 congress however was unable to resolve its appropriations differences the house passed the fifth in series of continuing resolutions on november 13 and the senate agreed to the measure on november 19 this measure funded the government at fy2002 levels through january 11 2003 the defense appropriations bill and military construction appropriations bill were the only appropriations measures completed by congress in 2002 in addition to the dhs congress completed action on and the president signed into law several other significant measures including the defense authorization act the intelligence authorization act and measures regulating terrorism insurance and seaport security the senate adjourned sine die on november 20 and the house on november 22 2002 108th congress 2nd session 2004 lame duck session was considered necessary in 2004 because many appropriation bills had not yet even received senate action and congress had not cleared an increase in the debt limit conferees also had reached agreement over legislation to consolidate intelligence activities under new national director as recommended by the september 11 commission the postelection environment was viewed as favorable to action on an omnibus appropriations measure by facilitating adherence to caps on domestic discretionary spending on which the administration insisted as well as the elimination of many authorizing provisions congress initially cleared the measure on november 20 but because it subsequently had to direct corrections in the enrollment of the bill president bush was able to sign it only on december 8 the day of the sine die adjournment similarly although congress could reach final agreement on crs18 congressional budget resolution which would have advanced action to increase the debt limit postelection conditions enabled the increase to be enacted as freestanding measure during the lame duck period the administration intensified efforts to persuade house conferees on the intelligence bill to accept modifications in provisions to maintain military control over its own intelligence keep intelligence funding confidential and control immigration the conference report cleared congress on december 8 and was signed into law on december 17 postelection conditions also permitted the resolution of conference deadlocks over several other reauthorizations including the individuals with disabilities education act moratorium on internet taxation and authority for satellite television systems to carry network programming the last of these was enacted as one of the few legislative riders to be included in the omnibus appropriation bill failure to resolve policy disagreements however doomed several other reauthorizations including the 1996 welfare reform and highway bill although the latter had also been delayed by demands in the senate for assurances about the role to be played by minority conferees finally ban on assault weapons expired when the house declined to act on measure renewing it for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33677
