httpwwwunocalcominvestorindexhtmlsupplies and partly because of this threat to national secu rity as well some members of congress have requested review of the bid as provided for by statute3 because some are concerne d about possible effects on us energy and national security of successful bid by cnooc to acqui re unocal they may be interested in the quantitative significance and geographical pattern of unocals oil and gas operations of possible particular interest are the proporti ons of unocals oil and gas operations and holdings in geographic regions that one might consider to be easily accessible to us energy needs however because oil is fungible commodity in world market it can be argued that it matters little where oil supplies originate whether cnooc acquires unocal or not it can much more easily and at basically the same price obtain oil to meet chinas domestic needs from geographically clos er supplier than from north america4 countering this is the perception of some that world oil supplies will be very tight in at least the medium term and that control of supplies will be advantageous petroleum is an integral input to the economies of i ndustrialized and industr ializing countries and to the armed forces of any nation disrup tion of supplies can di srupt economic activity and affect military readiness but there is some concern that widespread buying up of energy assets could greatly diminish the size and usefulness of the oil market5 extent and pattern of unocals oil and gas operations unocals worldwide operations produced total of 169000 barrels of petroleum liquids6 and 156 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas per day in the first quarter of 2005 table 1 7 it has total proven worldwide rese rves of 681 million barrels of petroleum liquids and 656 billion cubi c feet of natural gas unocals operations in the united states and canada combined accounted for 43 of the companys worldwide liquids pr oduction and 35 of the dry natural gas production with the united states accounting fo r about 80 of the north american total unocals us production of 58000 barrels pe r day represents 08 of us production of petroleum liquids and 03 of us consumption of petr oleum inasmuch as canada is major oil supplier to the united states it is reasonable to assume that unocals small quantity of canadian pr oduction is at least potentially av ailable to the united states onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22182crs3 8 cnooc limited acquired stake in canadabased meg energy april 8 2005 at cnooc limited httpwwwcnoocltdcomc noocltdtemplate

with about 80 of each located in the united states table 2 it is clear from the above that operations overseas account for the bulk of unocals operations and holdings the rest of th world primarily

form 10k submitted to the us securities and exchange commission possible diversion of nort h american oil and gas it is likely that one of the considerations in any us government review of the bid by cnooc to acquire unocal is the risk that oil and gas now produced by unocal in north america and particularly in the united states will be diverted to markets elsewhere to the extent that it is significant it is clear from the data provided above that the amounts of such quantities are small rela tive to us oil and gas consumption also to the extent it is significant cnooc in proposing its ac quisition of unocal has committed to continue unocals practice of selling or marketing in us markets all or substantially all of the oil and gas produced from unocals us properties9
