industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32442cotton production and support in the united states summary while cotton along with other major crops has been subsidized by the us federal government since the 1930s cotton subsidies are now in the focus of an international spotlight the nature and extent of these subsidies have become roadblock in negotiating multilateral and bilateral trade agreements sharp criticism came from the west and central african countries during various doha round meetings also efforts to create free trade area of the americas faa foundered at least partially over us cotton subsidies now congress is watching to see if the united states will be required by the world trade organization wto to revise its cotton subsidies in response to dispute lodged by brazil one reason the international spotlight is on us cotton subsidies in contrast to other subsidizing nations is the sheer si ze of us cotton production nd expor ts the united states is the secondlargest producer of cotton in the world and the largest exporter therefore us co tton subsidies have global repercussions domestically what happens to cotton s ubsidies is important to broad group of interests because grains oilseeds and peanuts receive similar support us cotton production and export subsid ies provide comprehensive support for producers farmers with history of co tton production are eligible for direct and countercyclical payments on their actual production farmers may utilize the marketing loans and loan deficiency payments protection against low yields is available through subsidized crop insura nce and in some years congress has approved additional disa ster payments when us market prices rise and there is risk that competitors might capture more of the world export market and even deliver to us yarn and fabric mills socalled step 2 user payments are made to us exporters and mills if they purchase us cotton from 1991 through 2003 farm subsidies for cotton production have cost 176 billion per year on average this is the annual equivalent of 021lb of us production while the united states is not alone in subsidizing cotton this level of support is nearly the highest in the world according to the international cotton advisory committee when the 021lb average crop year farm subsidy is added to the 057lb average market price it has given produ cers an average revenue of 078lb from 1991 through 2003 this level of revenue is more than enough to cover average variable cash costs of 050lb and just enough to cover average total economic costs of 078lb according to the international cotton advisory committee variable cash costs of some of the comp eting cotton exporting nations are about half those of the united states this report will not be

substantial share of their revenue in some years some competing countries pa rticularly developing countries that lack the resources to subsidize th eir farmers recently have become highly critical of us and european union eu farm subsidies tensions over farm subsidies are said to be major reason for the failure of the september 2003 cancun ministerial confer ence of the wto to reach framework agreement on agricultural trade liberaliza tion group of 21 developing countries the g21 led by brazil demanded greater re ductions in domestic farm subsidies than the united states or the european union were prepared to accept the west and central african wca cottonproducing countries propose that all export and production related subsidies be eliminated by the end of four years the united states takes the position that cotton subsidies should not be singled out but should be included in the overall nego tiations on agriculture however the united states has agreed to address the african cotton initiative at the upcoming doha development agenda meeting although there is agreement yet on how to approach it see crs report rs21712 the african cotton initiative and wto agriculture negotiations brazil lodged an action in the wto arguing that us cotton subsidy programs unfairly encourage production and depress world market prices thereby causing harm to brazilian cotton producers and exporters the wto disput settlement panel issued confidential inte rim report on april 26 and final report on june 18 2004 reportedly the document which has not been publicly released is critical of several us subsidy programs that apply to cotton as well as other commodities allowing for the appeals process final ruling by wto may not be issued until late november 2004 see crs report rs21715

domestic and export use in the 200304 cotton marketing year however domestic manufacturing of cotton fabric and yarn has been declining rapidly while foreign manufacturing has increased on the other

bales c onstituting 68 of total use figure 5 graphically portrays the market shift in deliveries from domestic to foreign users observers may question whether cotton support and export promotion programs are contributing to the decline in us cott on manufacturing however by design the direct and countercyclical payments as well as the marketing loan provisions do not raise the market price for us cotton or constrain production to the contrary the subsidies support the income of producers nd enable them to incur variable and fixed production costs when market prices are low as shown in figure 2 us cotton pr oducti on did not drop in response to low market prices in 1999 through 2002 in fact average annual production increased after the price drop in 1999 compared to production levels in th higher price years prior to 1999 the united states does have tari ff barriers to discourage domestic manufacturers from importing lowerpriced world cotton these barriers arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32442crs7 intended to protect us cotton producer s from foreign competition at the same time cotton user marketing certificates also called step 2 payments special import quotas and the limited global import quota are designed to benefit us yarn and fabric manufacturers by partially offsetting domestic s upply shortages or higher us cotton prices the factors thought to be most important in the decline in us textile and fabric manufacturing are increased import competition and the scheduled phaseout of quotas on textiles and appare l in january 2005 efforts to boost

cancun ministerial conference and negotiations broke down see crs report rs21715 the african cotton initiative and wto agricultural negotiations earlier in december 2002 brazil initia ted dispute settlement case ds267 at the wto against the us cotton program brazil charges that us cotton subsidy outlays have exceeded us commitments to the wto which causes overproduction and higher exports that cause serious injury to the brazilian cotton sector us trade officials argue that the subsidies provided to us cotton growers have been within the allowable wto limits and are consistent with us wto obligations consultations between the two countries fa iled to resolve the dispute and dispute settlement pane l was formed on march 18 2003 to review the charges see crs report rs21715 usbrazil wto cotton subsidy dispute brazil also argues that the step 2 pr ovisions of the us cotton program as well as the favorable term s provided under us export credit programs and the market access program map function as export subsidies and are inconsistent with uswto obligations regarding export subsidies the united states considers step 2 payments as part of its domestic support program since they are targeted to domestic cotton users as well as exporters and reports the payments as amber box tradedistorting domestic s upport payments us trade officials also contend that both the us export credit gsm progra ms and map are consistent with wto obligations key to brazils case is the argument that the united states is longer exempt from wto dispute proceedings under the so called peace clause article 13 of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32442crs16 wtos agreement on agriculture artic 13 exempts domestic support measures from being challenged as illegal subsidies as long as the level of support remains at or below the benchmark 1992 ma rketing year my levels brazil argues that us cotton subsidies were about 2 billion in my1992 compared with over 4 billion in my2001 therefore brazil argues that the united states is longer in compliance with the requisite conditions and can longer seek protection under the wtos peace clause rule the dispute settlement panel released its confidential interim report to brazil and the united states on april 26 2004 news reports suggest at least partial finding against the united states the panels final report was released confidentially to the disputing parties on june 18 2004 but the ruling is not expected to be made public until late august if the ruling is unfavorable as expected the united states likely will appeal which would extend the process until mid to late november 2004 resolution of the wto case in brazil s favor could result in wto decision concerning implementation of us cott on program provisions noncompliance with such decision on the part of the unite d states could result in compensation to brazil or possible limited trade sanctions against us cotton or other exports us agricultural subsidies and import barriers in general and for cotton in particular have become complicating factor in negotiating free trade area of the americas that would encomp ass 34 countries brazil and the united states cochair the trade negotiating committee which is re sponsible for direc ting nine negotiating groups one of which is agriculture di fferences between brazil and the united states typify an underlying challenge th united states has relatively low average tariff compared to brazil and so is pushi ng for broad tariff reduction brazil and other latin american countries are pressi ng the case that the united states should relax use of its trade remedy laws curtail domestic subsidies for farmers and lower peak tariffs related to quotas for many latin american countries agricultural trade is at the forefront of concerns given th importance that it plays in their economies however the united states does not want to address its agriculture policies in regional ftaa preferring that this be part of the global d oha round negotiations see crs report rl30935 agricultural trade in the free trade area of the americas in each of the challenges described here cotton is the focus for policies that apply to grains and oilseeds as well thus if the united states is forced to make changes to cotton programs such changes can be expected to support programs that affect much of us crop

supply and demand conditions major crops produced in the united states including cotton have been subsidized since the 1930s most recently the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 au thorized price support framework that provides three unique subsidy mechanisms for upland cotton and other covered commodities including wheat corn sorghum barley oats rice soybeans and other oilseeds and peanuts by design none of the three support mechanisms raises the market price of cotton however they do raise the effective price received by farmers and so are called price support programs the three support mechanisms available to producers include 1 marketing assistance loans 2 direct payments and 3 countercyclical payments marketing assistance loan program upland cotton producers are eligible for the minimum national average price of 052lb under the market assistance loan program on all they produce els cotton producers are eligible for the minimum national average price of 07977lb under the marketing assistance loan program but are not elig ible for other support payments farmers with harvested cotton can use th stored commodity as collateral for nonrecourse marketing assistance loan from the us department of agricultures commodity credit corporation ccc the farmer has the choice of repaying the loan in full plus interest in order to recover clear title which is commonly done when market prices are higher than the loan rate alternatively when market prices are lower than the loan rate the farmer can repay the loan at the adjusted world price awp12 retain ownership of the cotton and sell it in the marketplace most advantageously when prices rise above the loan rate the difference between the loan rate nd the awp is known as marketing loan gain this gain is considered direct payment from the ccc and is reportable as such for income tax purposes this ma rketing loan gain is limited to 75000 per person per year but the rules allow doubling of th limit for spouse or for multiple farms by design repayment of loans at the awp is intended to avoid acquisition of cotton by the ccc due to forfeiture of collateral in settlement of the nonrecourse loans forfeiture of cotton to ccc is another alternative available to the farmer borrower still another way farmers can repay nonr ecourse marketing assistance loans is to purchase cotton commodity certificates from the ccc at the adjusted world price and use the certificates to repay the loans the only use that is allowed for the certificates gains achieved in this wa though identical to gains achieved by repaying loans at the awp are not s ubject to the per person annual payment limithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32442crs19 farmers otherwise eligible to put cott on under loan can agree to forgo the loan option and instead receive loan deficiency payments ldps when market prices fall below the loan rate the ldp payment rate is the difference between the awp and the loan rate financially equivalent to the marketing loan gain the loan deficiency payment option has several administrative nd financial advantag for farmers over actual nonrecourse loans which encourages its use however ldps are treated just like marketing loan gains in terms of contributing toward the per person annual payment limits marketing assistance loans reduce revenue risk associated with price variability and are considered production distorting in wtosense because benefits are linked directly to production direct payments program the direct payments program pays upland cotton farmers 00667lb on 85 of histori cal cotton production els cotton is not eligible these direct payments are not linked to either current production or prices in fact farms may but need not produce cotton to receive the direct payments they are allowed to grow cotton or any other major grain or oilseed but not fruits and vegetables the united states considers direct payments to be non tradedistorting under wto rules although some dispute this classification this decoupling of the support paym ents from production requirements and market prices was first adopted in the 1996 farm bill the payments were called production flexibility contract pfc paym ents or simply contract payments renamed direct payments in the 2002 farm bill they were extended another six years through crop year 2007 direct paymen ts are subject to an annual per person limit of 40000 which can be doubled under the spouse or threeentity rules while direct payments are decoupled from both production and market prices they are tied to acreage and so are capitalized into land values this wealth effect may have some effects on produc tion and investment decisions countercyclical program the countercyclical program was adopted in the 2002 farm bill and makes pa yments based on 85 of hi storical production to the same farmers receiving direct payments the payment rate is countercyclical to the market price it goes up as the seas on average market price for upland cotton declines below the target price of 07240 lb the difference with adjustment between the lower season average market price and the higher target price is the countercyclical payment rate this paymen t rate is constraine d on the lower end by the loan rate 052 plus the direct payment rate 00667 and so cannot exceed 01373lb alternatively if the season average price is above 06573 counter cyclical payments are made again farmers need not produce cott on to receive the countercyclical payments while benefits are not linked to farmers production decisions they are linked to market prices the linkage to ma rket prices may be seen by some farmers as reducing market revenue risks and so may influence some production decisions together direct payments and countercyclical payments are called the direct and countercyclical payments program dcphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32442crs20 13it is possible and even likely that any cotton acreage outside of the base acreage for cotton dcp benefits does receive dcp benefits for other covered commoditiescountercyclical payments are similar but not identical to target price deficiency payments that were made from 1973 through 1995 the difference is that target price deficiency payments were made on each farmers actual production of cotton each year whereas farmers now need not produ ce cotton to receive cotton countercyclical payments countercyclical payments are subject to an annual per person payment limit of 65000 which can be doubled under the spouse or threeentity rules market loss payments on an ad hoc basis congress directed that market loss payments be made to commodity progra m participants for the 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 crops these payments were reacti on to sharply lower market prices that in the absence of target price payments meant substantially lower farm revenue this experience played critical role in the decision to creat the countercyclical payments program in the 2002 farm bill mo st observers would say that the inclusion of countercyclical payments in the 2002 farm bill institutionalized market loss payments with countercyclical payments in place it is not expected that market loss payments will be applied to cotton or the other covered commodities through crop year 2007 the life of the current farm bill ccc expenditures for price support generally pound of cotton

producers can obtain subsidized crop insurance to protect against these losses in addition congress has authorized crop disaster payments nearly every year since 1982 to provide extra assistance for growers suffering substantia l crop losses disaster payments were available to qualifying growers who par ticipated in the fe derally supported crop insurance program as well as grower s who chose to forego insurance crop insurance multiperil crop insurance is available to cotton producers as well as most other crop producers to protect against losses of crop yield from natural hazards nearly every cause of yiel d loss is covered ie weather pests fire but not producer negligence hence the designation multiperil while the insurance is sold to farmers largely through private agencies the usdas risk management agency rma pays in excess of 50 of the premiums additionally the rma pays the private agencies nearly 24 of total premiums toward their administrative costs plus rmas own administrative costs whic h have averaged 4 of total premiums by design the crop insurance program is supposed to be actuarially sound in other words over time total premiums producer plus government premium contributions are supposed to cover total i ndemnities in practice however the ratio of cotton losses to premiums from 1991 th rough 2003 has averaged 13 to 1 and only in two years did premiums exceed inde mnities the net sses indemnities over premiums fall upon the federal government because it reinsures the privately marketed policies critics of the crop insurance program argue that the high premium subsidy and the lack of actua rial soundness imply that the program is merely another tool for transferring government funds to cotton farmers substantial revisions were made to th crop insurance program by congress in 1994 pl 103354 title i federal crop insurance reform act of 1994 that effectively mandated the participation of farm subsidy program recipients in crop year

loan gains and loan deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between the loan rate and the adju sted world price awp only when the awp is below the loan rate do farmers receive subsidy payment provision of the law allows the usda to lower the awp when the price of us upland cotton sold in northern europe usne is higher than the price of competing cotton this authority to reduce the awp is unique to cotton and creates the opportunity for increased marketing loan program subsidie s even when the price of upland cotton is higher than the loan rate step 1 downward adjustment to the

circumstance the usda may lower the awp up to the difference between the usne price and the ne price in other words when the awp is less than 0598 115 of 052 it can be adjust ed downward by the difference between the higher usne price and the lower ne price the practical result of step 1 adjustment is to enable loan deficiency pa yments when us prices are higher than the loan price of 052
