glossary 19restricted issue 10 mar 02 1 1 restrictedchapter 1 the istar concept introduction 1 intelligence surveillance target ac quisition and reconnaissance istar is defined as the coordinated acquisition processing and dissemination of timely accurate relevant and assured informa tion and intelligence which supports the planning and conduct of operations target ing and the integration of effects and enables commanders to achieve their goal throughout the spectrum of conflict1 it is command driven capability that s upports the maintenance of the common operational picture and the development of situational awa reness sa for commanders staffs and other users at ll levels of command both inside and outside of the land component istar w hen combined with an effective c4i capability is known as c4istar and is the practi cal application of the find concept2 the term intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance i sr is used at the joint level it follows the same basic concept as istar but does not tie targeting and isr to the same degree based on the perc eption that time critic target engagement reduces at the operational level and above 2 istar is system of systems that is made up of thr ee principal elements information either raw or processed the processes that enable information to be collected collated and analysed into intelligence and the physical architecture that encompasses the istar collection systems their organisations and the various staff cells all three elements have to be treat ed equally if any one element is neglected it may lead to reduction in the overall efficiency of the system purpose 3 istar must provide timely accurate relevant and assured information and intelligence to every level of command re membering that its primary function is to support the commander and his decision making process when manoeuvring and executing operations especially at the lower tactical levels the commander will require precise real time informa tion on the enemy and may even need to have dialogue with specific sens or or its controller the pr ecise requirement of the commander will vary with the level of comm and at which he is operating decision making times for example will expand at hi gher levels istar must also serve other related activities such as support for information operat ions info ops and media operations informa tion for evidential purposes can be expected to assume increasing importance but the crucial factor here will be the audit trail for the handling of information that may be used as evidence rather t han the quality of the information it is also anticipated that there will be an increas ing emphasis on those collection assets that can assist with the assessment for potential collateral damage as well as carrying out battle damage assessment bda 1 army definition 2 find is defined as the timely acquisition processi ng and dissemination of information on primarily enemy forces and the environment through the seamless in tegration of decision making planning operations including information operations and targeting throughout the battlespace in order to focus effects future army c2 paperrestricted issue 10 mar 02 1 2 restricted4 operations require full understanding of the environment current and developing istar systems will enable much more us able information about the environment to be collected it will be possible to analyse this more rapidly than at present and it is expected that considerable amounts of environmental data will be available throughout the land component such in formation will be an effective and vital input to sa 5 an effective istar capability will allow the commander to identify enemy weaknesses and enables him to make t he decisions that can exploit those weaknesses this is achieved by maki ng best use of the intelligence held and produced at higher levels of command co mbined with the information provided by istar collection assets held at that and lower levels of command systems that provide coarse grain information will be us ed to provide general picture of enemy activity and cue fine grain systems which will permit t he development of intelligence at the level of detail that the commander requires at lected points within the battle space this cross cueing between collection ssets is continual activity that spans levels of command as well as com ponent boundaries the whole process is sequential and iterative ensuri ng that appropriate information is provided to the right place at the right time to allow the appropria application of force it will also permit fleeting opportunities to be exploited and low mobile targets to be monitored and tracked characteristics 6 the component characteristics of istar are intelligence intelligence is defined as the product resulting from the processing of information concerning fo reign nations hostile or potentially hostile forces or elements or areas of actual or potential operations3 intelligence in military context is the product of our knowledge and understanding of the terrain weather activities capabilities doctrine and intentions of an actual or potential adversary or of any other forces with which the army is concerned intelligenc is fundamental to the planning and conduct of operations across the whole s pectrum of conflict as it allows the commander to understand the threat and gain mastery of the environment consequently reducing risk to his own force whilst enabling decisions which optimise their capabilities b surveillance surveillance is defined as the systematic observation of aerospace surface or subsurface areas places persons or things by visual aural electronic photogr aphic or other means4 surveillance monitors areas and activities this may be by pa ssive or active means surveillance cues and is cued by other surve illance systems reconnaissance and target acquisition resources to investigate s pecific activities or to obtain more detailed information on particular obser vation it provides for example security to friendly forces through early warning of adversary activity within 3 aap6 4 ibidrestricted issue 10 mar 02 1 3 restrictedgaps on exposed flanks or in rear areas surveillance implies that the adversary must act move or radi ate before it c an be detected c target acquisition target acquisition is defined as the detection identification and location of target in sufficient det ail to permit the effective employment of weapons5 target acquisition has evolved from simply supporting the employment of weapons ra ther it has become focused on the delivery of effects targets could be countries areas installations agencies or persons against which intelligence activities are directed target acquisition provides sufficient accuracy in locating adversary forces to enable their effective engagement by direct or indirect fire weapons or to enable other effects such as offensive info ops to be used against them d reconnaissance reconnaissance is defined as mission undertaken to obtain by visual observation or other detection methods information about the activities and resources of an enemy or potential enemy or to secure data concerning the meteorologi cal hydrographic or geogr aphic characteristics of particular area6 reconnaissance is generally focused and relatively short duration method of collecting in formation about the adversary istar collection assets are assigned missi on to obtain specific information about the adversary reconnaissance activity is not confined to reconnaissance units but may be undertaken as function by many nonistar elements information and intelligence 7 the purpose of istar is the production of in telligence from informati on in order to understand the istar system the clear di stinction between the two must be understood information information is unprocessed data7 of every description that may be used in the production of intelligence it is normally collected by individual sensors systems or capabilities b intelligence the product resulting from the processing of information concerning foreign nations hostile or pot entially hostile forces or elements or areas of actual or potential operations intelligence is the result of process involving the evaluation analysis int egration and interpretation of disparate pieces of information usually in relation to existing information and intelligence in order to clarify si tuation and produce meaningful conclusions assessments and predictions in res ponse to the commanders intelligence needs there are three types of intelligence 1 basic intelligence basic intelligence is intelligence on any subject which may be used as reference ma terial for planning and as basis for processing subsequent information or intelligence 5 ibid 6 aap6 7 this includes geographic datarestricted issue 10 mar 02 1 4 restricted2 current intelligence current intelligence is intelligence which reflects the current situation at the strategi c operational or tactical levels 3 applied intelligence applied intelligence is intelligence that has been analysed and refined to degree where it provides direct support to the decision making process 8 managing all of the information particularl timecritical information for targeting purposes is an important part of t he overall command and staff process information management must be enforced to prevent overload of istar staff and communications and information systems c is this will be prevented by providing only the information that is actually needed rather than that which is unwanted or unnecessary istar architecture 9 the istar architecture consists of four ements the staffs who conduct the istar process the formations and units that own the istar collection assets the collection assets themselves and the cis t hat enables the process the architecture should allow access to information wherev er it may be held the ability to pass requests for information rfi and tasking to different levels of command the ability to control the collection assets within level of command and to disseminate the intelligence produced the istar archit ecture is shown at figure 11 the development of new istar collection system s that will have their own c2 capability as well as the upgrading of cis should allow the architecture to work ore efficiently this in turn will lead to changes in workin g practices which will impact istar such as decrease in reliance on manually inputted reports and returnsrestricted issue 10 mar 02 1 5 restrictedfigure 11 the istar architecture principles of istar 10 istar is driven by series of guiding principles which aim to provide the most comprehensive possible understanding of t he adversary this includes knowledge of the adversarys goals tactical objec tives strategy intentions capabilities methods of operation vulnerabilities morale and sense of value and loss the intelligence staff must also understand t he adversarys character culture and customs they must develop and continuously refine their ability to think like thenotes 1 medium and smallscale operations

reactions and responses to our own actions the guidi ng principles that support the istar concept and enable the components to work effectively are command driven direction of the ist ar effort and determination of priorities must be led by the commander at each level of command unless the commander devotes sufficient effo rt to these requirements he cannot guarantee that he will receive the intell igence he requires for his decision making and conduct of operations b centralised coordination istar must be coordinated centrally at the highest level of command commensurate with the types and capabilities of the collection assets being used this ensures there is unplanned duplication of effort gaps in collection and enables the most efficient and effective use of limited resources in accordanc with the commanders priorities c responsive and timely istar must be highly responsive to the needs of commanders staff and users ensuri ng information requirements can be understood and dealt with quickly and effect ively responsiveness requires prioritisation of work to ens ure that effort can be focused the entire process must also be sufficiently timely to provi intelligence at the right time allowing actions to be taken inside the enemy s decisionaction cycle timeliness within istar contributes to operational tempo the focussing of effects and enables the initiative to remain with friendly forces d continuous coverage although istar collection assets will always be limited in number the aim must be to s trive for continuous coverage in time space and across the ems system of systems approach the most useful and complete intelligence can only be achieved through the collation and analysis of information andintelligence collected from multiple sour ces system of systems approach results in the production of complem entary data where information from one source confirms and augments informat ion provided by another and provides higher level of confidence in the resu lting all source intelligence product f robustness robust mix of collection c apabilities should be allocated to each level of command to provide flex ibility to the commander to ensure he can acquire the information he requires this will not only allow the cross cueing of sensors but also enable hi gher level of confidence in the information on particular target g accuracy information must be filtered analysed and interpreted to produce accurate intelligence intelligence must be factually correct and indicate the degree of confidence in intelligence assessments and judgements the drive to maintain tempo will act against this requirement and significant commandeffort will be required to balance t hese requirements and to ensure that accuracy is not sacrificed to achieve speed restricted issue 10 mar 02 1 7 restrictedh continuous review istar organisations and staffs must continuously review the collection plan processe s and products to ensure that changes in the information received operational situation and user requirements are being accommodated they must guard against any temptation to distort information to fit previous assessment s or preconceived ideas intelligence must also convey the uncertainties that are inevitable in assessments and not imply false degree of confidence i source protection sources must not be em ployed on tasks where their loss would be disproportionate to the value of the information they provide or are seeking to collect similarly in di sseminating intell igence sources and methods must be protected to av oid compromise and subsequent loss of collection ability in essence th is will involve command decision on the balance between the protecti on of the source and the satisfaction of users intelligence requirements this dilemma will become particularly acute in multinational operations j accessibility information and intelligence must be readily accessible both for users and for intelligence staff it must be stored in form that allows information requirements to be met this will require interconnectivity at each level of command between the cells organisations and collection assets that deal with istar processes 11 the istar process revolves around the f our elements of the intelligence cycle direction collection processing and di ssemination this cycle is adopted across the joint community and by many other countries traditionally the cycle has focused on determining what information is required collecting that information and then processing it to gain intelligence the istar process brings the intelligence cycle together with the integrated and co ordinated use of collection assets istar collection assets 12 istar collection assets are becoming more sophisticated and capable from 2005 onwards step change in capability will occu r as new systems are fielded istar takes system of systems approach to t he employment of collection assets this requires the assets to be used as an holis tic entity rather t han as series of stovepipes it seeks to provide robust x of assets at each level of command and to ensure the essentia l interplay between them8 avoiding reliance on any one type of asset within the land component ground based manned reconnaissance is now considered to be core capability at each level of command this combined with other systems such as unmanned aerial ve hicles uav elec tronic warfare ew and human intelligence humint provides the ingredients for this robust mix 8 key to this is the ability to cross cue between any sensor or systemrestricted issue 10 mar 02 1 8 restrictedthe characteristics of effective intelligence products 13 effective intelligence is intelligence t hat meets the commander s needs in order to achieve this intelligence products must have the following characteristics relevance intelligence must support the commanders mission concept of operations and intell igence requirements b usability intelligence products must be in format that can be easily used and they must highlight the significanc of the information or intelligence they contain and include an assessment of the validity of the intelligence c timeliness intelligence products must be available in sufficient time to enable decisions to be made and implemented d objectivity intelligence must be unbiased undistorted and free from political influence or constraints intelligenc methodology and product must not be directed or manipulated to conform to desired result preconceived views of situation or adversary or predetermi ned objective or institutional position availability intelligence must be readily available to those who need it taking account of both source prot ection and the penalty of intelligence compromise this may require pragm atic decisions to be made on the releasability of intelligence f completeness intelligence should be as co mplete as possible using all available information to answer custom ers requirements and provide full understanding of the situation whilst not slowing down the dissemination process supporting the common operational picture and situation awareness 14 the common operational picture is s napshot in time of friendly and adversary forces and of the battle space environment it is overlaid over common geospatial framework and formed from the output from the database of information and intelligence which is common thr oughout level of command and which is disseminated throughout that level of co mmand the common operational picture informs the commanders situational awar eness sa which is his understanding of the operational environment in the context of his mission istar contributes to the common operational picture by prov iding the database of information and intelligence on the adversary and to certain exten t on the environment it is therefore contributor to the common operational pictu re and sa but provides only part of the data support to targeting and information operations 15 istar supports targeting by detecti ng identifying and tracking target the component of target and the system to which it belongs further it indicates its vulnerability relative

operations info ops rely upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the adversary and the way in whic h he thinks and in which both he and his systems process information the analysis of

assessment and target system assessment it is the time ly and precise assessment of the effects of the application of lethal or nonlethal force against pr edetermined objective such assessment is primarily g2 responsibilit but must closely link with the targeting process and involves close cooperation with the operations and fire support staff 18 the production of bda will give rise to series of pre and postattack intelligence requirements that will be deal t with by istar in the normal manner they will require the tasking of the appropriate ist ar collection assets before an attack takes

set off against the need to develop in telligence rapidly the need to pass processed information or intelligence to t he commander is crucial direct access to raw data or individual sensors can lead to the commander being deceived until such time as information from all sources can be processed to produce more comprehensive picture counter istar also assists with own force deception in that it can determine what intelligence the adver sary is collecting and how this enables own forces to work out what adversary collection assets need to be deceived and how to achieve the desired effect educating users 22 istar organisations and staffs need to liaise closely with users in order to ensure that their requirements are clearly understood and met in timely and appropriate manner they should engender high degree of confidence amongst users that their requirements are being met not only in terms of the finished product provided but also in terms of collection r equirements being satisfied and intelligence databases being maintained to support the intelligence capability they should also ensure there is general aw areness amongst users of the intelligence process and the broad capabilities and limitations of is tar collection assets this will help to prevent users from setting unrealis tic intelligence requirements joint istar 23 the istar capability within the army should be seen in the context of the wider joint isr capability within the arm ed forces the government and mod are served by strategic istar capability whilst each rvice has its own istar capability however the real synergy of istar can only be achieved through the integration of each of the strategic and single servic istar capabilities there are an increasing number of istar collection syst ems capable of meeting the needs of all of the services and multiple levels of co mmand often all at the same time this requires the g2istar staffs at each level of command and particularly the land component hq level to consider the role that they play in the wider istar capability whilst also remembering that this wider capability can also be harnessed to meet the land component s requirements 24 rfi will regularly move outside singl service component when the means to satisfy them is located elsewhere within the joint istar capability there will be an increasing number of rfis targeted at the land component as the armys istar collection capability improves and the level of granularit required at the operational and higher levels becomes finer 25 the pattern of recent operations has involved smaller land components being deployed out of their normal chain of co mmand the employment of brigade hqs as land component command hqs is regular occurrence some have even acted as joint task force

their own approach to istar and their own istar collection c apabilities differ ent terms may be used such as rsta rista or isr but in most respects the underlying principles are the same istar doctrine for nato and abca14 countries already exists at the joint and army levels and where possible is re flected in this afm despite the doctrinal guidance that is available it is likely that formations involved in multinational operations will be provided with an istar capa bility that does not conform precisely with that envisioned in such guidance multinational operation will be supported by an istar capability that is likely to be an ad hoc amalgam of information process and architecture 27 intelligence support to multinational operat ions requires strict procedures for the integration of processes t he sharing of information and the use of istar collection assets such procedures should ideally be agreed prior to the commencement of combined operations additionally mult inational operations may involve non alliance nations and differences in language and culture may compound operational and procedural disparities two broad approaches to the resolution of these problems are possible depending on the nat ure of the combined operation and the participants integrated information sharing in these circumstances istar collection assets processes and personnel are fully integrated this allows for the ready flow of information and intelli gence and synergy over the use of collection assets it also reduces dup lication and simplifies the dissemination of the product in formats t hat are readily useable by dissimilar national force elements however the releasability of sensitive national information and intelligence may cause difficulties for participants that will often only be solved through pragmatism linked to an understandi ng of the sensitivities involved b parallel information sharing in these circumstances different national istar capabilities work separately and often in parallel wit h some integrated links to provide an ability to exchange information this allows for national control of product collection and security issues but promotes duplication of effort and may lead to suspicion of the amount of knowledge not being released by partners 28 during multinational operations the in telligence product suppo rting that operation should be shared and early liaison should be in itiated at the highest levels of the alliance or coalition to ens ure that the intelligence operat ions of each participant are coordinated this coordination shoul d involve the exchange of istar liaison officers with multinational headquarters and the establishment of an istar architecture complete with secure communications the diverse nature of 14

the flow of information to all pa rts of the multinational structure military information 30 in recognition of the impartial position fo r which the united nations strives in peace support operations they normally use t he term military information in favour of intelligence while istar for the uk is not bound by the same restrictions on its own operations as those imposed by t he it has to be

intelligence is determined the commander provides direction the staff plan and direct the collection of information coord inate the collection effort the collection assets acquire the necessary information the received information is then processed into intelligence and the inte lligence is disseminated to whoever needs it however current information and intelligence decays r apidly its value decreasing with the passage of time in order to reduce the rate of decay the istar process must be taut and flexible coordinating the process 2 to achieve truly effective istar capabi lity requires very high level of co ordination throughout the architecture coordination ensures that the correct questions are asked the most appropria collection assets are tasked any duplication of collection is planned and not accidental the information received is what is needed the product is created in timely manner and the intelligence is passed to those that need it coordi nation with the targeting process is of particular importance as at critical stages of an operati on targeting may be the most important activity being undertaken by h q istar coordination has two aspects coordination of the process the istar process must be centrally co ordinated at each level of command this coordination crosses the levels of command to ensure the istar process as whole is being run efficiently and effectively b coordination of the collection assets the effective use of the allocated collection assets must also be coord inated this ensures the system of systems1 approach to using collection assets can be supported this co ordination must be done for the assets organic to each level of command but also across levels of command to ensure best use is made of all the collection

level of command it is dynamic process that is constantly updated and crosses levels of command the current process is stifled by the lack of sufficiently capable cis support which pr events it being used to best effect the development and fielding of new cis will start to remove these barriers to enable the dynamic process that ipb was always envisaged to be 9 ipb can be applied to all types of

identified thes requirements will then be turned into information requirements and appropriate co llection assets can be tasked with the collection of information in response to them 10 ipb consists of three basic steps battlespace area evaluation this step assesses the effects of relevant factors concerning the battlefield environment on operations conducted by both friendly and opposing forces its prim ary purpose is to identify adversary and friendly forces mobility corridor s and avenues of approach aa or defensive positions and counter attack manoeuvre options 5 further detail of ipb can be found in afm vo l 1 part 8 command staff procedures 6 this includes the electro magnetic spectrum emsrestricted issue 10 mar 02 2 4 restrictedb threat evaluation this step identifies the adversarys doctrinal courses of action independent of terrain and weather constraints ie how the adversary fights according to his tactical doctri ne or based on past experience in fighting him the result of the threat evaluati on can be an overlay or series of overlays showing deployment and tacti cs for each doctrinal coa eg attack formation positioning of units in defensive operations etc c threat integration in the third step of ipb the results of the battlespace area evaluation are combined with the doc trinal coas developed in the threat evaluation the aim of threat integration is to i dentify how the battlefield environment will shape doctrine and turn it into practice the threat integration process consists of t he production of sequence of overlays as follows 11 ipb is produced as series of overlays7 these are transmitted across and between levels of command the coordination of overlay production in particular is important as the overlap between aiis and airs across levels of command could cause unnecessary staff effort and duplicatio n of asset tasking the main overlays are the situation overlay this overlay is produced as part of the threat evaluation step of ipb in it the adversarys doctrinal model is moulded to fit the restrictions imposed by the fact ors shaping the battlefield environment such as terrain infrastructure prot ected areas weather and other relevant factors based on an assessment of t he adversarys aim his strengths and weaknesses and his possible deployment and tactics situation overlay is produced for each coa showing his ta ctical

more often at higher levels of command when time permits or for nonwarfighting operations when the balance of intelligence required is less about physical locations and more about trends and

when mobile fleeting targets are to be acquired and engaged the g2istar staff will liaise with other branc hes to ensure the sensor decider shooter loop is as timely as possible 9 targeting has particular need for the tracki ng of mobile target s once acquired the istar input to the targeting process must ensure that the essential elements of information to support effectiv targeting are passed istar collection assets might also detect targets of opportunity ie targets not on the hptl the engagement of which may contribute to own force success delivery 10 during the delivery stage of the targeting process istar provides support through verification that the target and target ac tivity are as had been expected when the ipb was undertaken it may also be required to provide continuous target location and activity details to ensure that effects that are to be delivered ov er time can be applied effectively the effects of engagement s can only be properly assessed by an observer or analyst these will often come from within the istar architecture and it is important to ensure that the flow of information to the targeting process is maintained assessment 11 istar supports the assessment phase of the targeting process by providing bda bda contributes to the targeting process and the istar process in equal measure in that the output of bda is intellig ence and assessment bda requirements will normally have been predetermined in re lation to planned target engagements therefore istar collection assets avail able to provide bda information will already have been tasked or the r equirement will have been included in the intelligence collection plan however for targets of opportunity this will often not be the case and bda needs will have to be factored into the ongoing collection effort it is important to note that istar collectio n assets will have variety of tasks and support to bda is only one of them this m eans there must be careful prioritisation of these assets bda must be objective and rigorous and consequentially often time consuming bda can only be achieved through information received from sensorsand other levels of command restricted issue 10 mar 02 2 d 3 restricted12 bda has three components physical damage assessment physical damage assessment estimates the quantitative extent of physical damage through the munitions blast fragmentation andor fire damage effect s to target the assessment is based on observed or interpreted damage b functional damage assessment functional damage assessment estimates the effect of attack on the target to perform its intended mission compared to the operational objective established fo r the target this assessment is based on all source intelligence and includes an estimate of

commander 1 at all levels the commander is pivotal to the effective functioning of istar the commander should be continuously engaged in istar and his influence is the key to direction the commander should provide the direction to the istar process he must convey the essence of what he wants istar to achieve for any given phase of an operation and this must include his priorities b determining ccir although the commander may state in general terms what his requirements are if this guidance is not under stood then the ability for istar to satisfy them will be reduc ed his staff will interpret and refine those requirements but the commander should detail priorities and be available to answer the staffs questions and to define in more detail what he wants c arbitrating over asset allocation number of ist ar collection systems and capabilities are either multirole or very limited in numbe r and some are both there will inevitably be competing dem ands for their use and when the staff cannot resolve conflict of require ments the commander must be prepared to act as the arbitrator in any dispute d retasking and redirection the operational situation can change rapidly and istar must be able to adapt rapidly to these changes the commander needs to ensure that when he starts contingency planning or when changes to his mission are imposed he conveys the impact of these changes

access access implies relatively passive function of drawing on available information and intelligence access should be provided to information wherever it is held within the architectu re both internally and externally to the land component the access might be through the c4i infrastructure or via direct feed from sensors that are s upporting multiple levels of command c tasking many of the systems being dev eloped will be able to feed multiple levels of command at the same time commanders should therefore be able to pass tasks to assets at higher levels of command as well as being able totask assets at subordinate levels of command through their own collection plans such tasks will compete with many other tasks and priorities at these higher levels d control commanders cannot guarantee t hat their tasking requests will receive due priority especially in dy namic and unpredictable circumstances they should therefore be provided with so collection assets at each level of command to give them the ability to meet their essential information needs and to provide robustness to the overall structure other factors other factors t hat will determine the appropr iate mix of assets required at specific level of command include the scale and type of operation time and space the comp lexity of the environment and system capabilities in addition lower levels of command are more limited in their ability to either process inform ation or manage complex assets without considerable augmentation t hat could imbalance the ov erall functioning of the headquarters the functions

issue 10 mar 02 4 2 restrictedused in different ways that cut across any artificial division between s ta and r the guiding principle is to use collecti on asset in the most appropriate way to gather the information that is required additionally there are many systems that are not considered to have pr imary istar function such as attack helicopter ah but which depending on the oper ational situation can pr ovide effective input into istar as whole the exi gencies of operations will require collection assets to be used in ways for which they were not designed but this serves to underline the flexibility required of istar as whole planning considerations 4 the use of istar collection assets needs to be carefully planned this is not just g2 or istar function but one that requires involvement of staffs in many areas and across levels of command there shoul d be strong linkage between the g2istar staff and the g3 staff to ensure consist ency of effort the employment and tasking of istar assets will be the responsibilit of the g2istar staff whilst their movement within the battlespace must be conducted in conjunction with the g3 staff there are two main types of istar planning that can be carried out planning the allocation of assets this is planning the allocation of istar assets to match the collection require ments at each level of command in other words resourcing levels of comm and with sufficient collection assets to ensure they can service t heir commanders requirements b planning the use of assets this is planning the us of the allocated istar collection assets to gather the required information planning criteria for the allocation of assets 5 collection assets the numbers and types of which will vary with each operation phase of operation and other circumstanc will be allocated to each level of command number of principles apply to this form of planning robust istar mix robust istar mix means providing mixture of ground and airborne manned and unmanned imint sigint and humint collection assets at each level of co mmand this robust mix must be able to match the areas of influence and responsib ility for different levels of command and be flexible enough to allow for rapid changes in the operational situation however this does not require an identical mix of assets at each level of command as system capabilities will cross command boundaries b size and type of operation different types of operation will affect the type and number of istar assets deploy ed and how they are used humanitarian operation will require fewe r istar assets than war fighting operation peace support operation may require more of certain types of assets such as humint but less of ot hers such as astor rapid effect operation will require early deployment of istar colle ction assets that have broad utility but small foot print large operation will allow concentration of some assets such as ew at higher levels of command for medium and smallscale operations the balance of effort is pushed down the chain ofrestricted issue 10 mar 02 4 3 restrictedcommand which would necessitate the pr ovision of ew assets for example at lower levels of command c time and space the changing nature of warfare has increased the battlespace for which each formation and unit is responsible assets must beallocated to cover the maximum am ount of the physical and electronic battlespace and additionally to provide some built in redundancy d capability in relation to istar collection assets this includes such elements as field humint teams fht that ar not systems per but are collection capability in their own ri ght each system has strengths and weaknesses which affect how it is us ed and at what level of command the asset must have the appropriate sensor package to acquire the information and be capable of producing the informa tion required within the necessary timeframe for instance astor will have an excellent capability against asophisticated enemy with much armoured equipment but is of much lesser use against light guerrilla force the capability factor is the key in determining what asset might be best to acquire information of certain type chapter 5 of this afm will highl ight the particular advantages and disadvantages of each type of collection asset centralised coordination the best use of the va rious types of collection assets is through centralised coordinat ion such centralisation is normally carried out at the highest practicable level to ensure the most efficient utilisation of the individual capabilitie s however this should not be done at the expense of providing effective support to lower levels of command andcertain specialist capabilities may achi eve greater effect by being allocated to lower level of command 6 there are insufficient assets to permanent ly hardwire them into each level of command however there should be co re group of assets at each level of command that should be allocated for vi rtually all operations supplemented by additional assets depending on the circumst ances possible mix of assets for different scales of operation can be found at annex planning the use of assets 7 once allocated collection assets will be used to support the intelligence collection plan at each level of command however it is important to plan to make best use of the assets allocated as there are nev er likely to be enough planning can be broken down into three levels the planning of which collection assets can best service the requirement of the intelligence collection plan this is high level and generalised form of planning where it is determined that particular information requirement could be best met by particular collection capability this function would normally be the responsibility of the g2 staff b the planning of how the agreed collect ion assets can meet the individual tasks this is more detailed level of planning where the use of all of therestricted issue 10 mar 02 4 4 restrictedallocated collection assets is review ed and planned in concert coordination is carried out within the level of co mmand and also across levels of command to avoid unnecessary duplication this function would normally be the responsibility of the istar coordinat ion staff in conjunction with the tacps of the individual co llection capabilities c the tactical planning for the use of spec ific sensors and platforms this is the practical application of tactics techni ques and procedures ttp to the use of collection assets this function w ould normally be the responsibility of the operations staff within individ ual istar units or subunits 8 the planning process within each level of command must take into account number of planning considerati ons that are applicable to the use of collection assets clear direction collection assets must be given clear direction otherwise they are unlikely to produce the informa tion expected the way such direction is provided will vary from operation to operation and will also depend on the type of asset ground based and aviati on reconnaissance assets are much more likely to work to principl of mission command whilst wide area surveillance and air reconnaissance systems require specific tasking b time and space time and space is majo r consideration for the use of allocated assets the likelihood of ther not being sufficient collection assets demands that they be used in the most efficient way in order to cover the whole battlespace this will in parti cular drive the need to prioritise and sequence requirements c capability the way each system is used will depend on number of different factors each of thes must be considered when selecting particular system for use these are 1 security and risk the collection asset must be adequately protected whilst still being able to gather the required information there will always be an element of physical politic or military risk in the use of particular collection asset balanc has to be struck between the risk of loss of the asset and the in telligence gain likewise the compromise of an asset may indica to an adversary what is being collected against and this may give clue to own force operational plans if the risk is considerable then there may be need to refer to higher authority for decision 2 suitability there will be occasions when more than one type of collection asset can carry out colle ction task and is available to do so careful consideration must be given to the attributes of each asset to ensure the most appropriate one is used for the task 3 battlespace environment various components of the battlespace environment such as weather terrain or political constraint may limit the ability of an asset to collect info rmation such considerations must be taken into account during t he collection planning process restricted issue 10 mar 02 4 5 restricteddepending on how critical to success the collection of particular item of information may be alternative assets may be tasked on contingency basis to account for changes in the environment d multiplicity multiplicity of tasking is the deliberate process of using more than one asset to collect the sa information each asset will produce slightly different output which is valuable aid towards the verification of the information gather

considered balance balance is achieved by placing an even distribution of collection workload across the available collection assets care mustalso be taken not to place over reliance on any one asset f use of stealth in order to preserve capability and to try and prevent the enemy determining what collect ion assets are being used and what their collection targets may be istar collection will normally be conducted in stealthy manner thi s is particularly important for manned sensors that have to be depl oyed forward of own troops and which are consequently more vulner able in addition if an adversary does not really understand what istar collection assets we are using and how it becomes great deal more difficult for them to carry out camouflage concealment and deception ccd attributes of collection assets 9 growing number of collection assets are becoming available to the g2 staff all of these assets have certain number of c haracteristics that should be considered when their use is being planned there ar however two key attributes one or other of which will apply to all collect ion systems which must be taken into consideration active collection systems an active collection system such as radar is one that has to radiate to gain information the use of radiat ing systems brings level of risk as such systems are inherently detectable the likelihood of detection is based on the nature of the system and the amount of radiated power the use of radiating systems requires additional thought during the planning process it may not only provide the enemy with information on the type and location of the system being used but it may also provide them with information on the sort of activity about which we are trying to gather information reconnaissance is normally an active function that deploys and moves collection assets to search for information b passive collection systems passive collection system such as sound ranging is one that does not need to radiate to gather information and is characterised as surveillance system1 it is therefore i nherently safer to use but may not be able to gather as much information as radiating system 1 certain surveillance systems may be active ie synthetic aperture radar sarrestricted issue 10 mar 02 4 6 restrictedsurveillance is essentially passive activity monitoring an object target or area for changes or signs of activity this observation could range from short range visual observation by sentry to sophisticated strategic sigint systems 10 the first prerequisite for ta rget acquisition is having the information to acquire the target in the first place such information could come from many sources or could be provided by collection systems that cue specific target acquisition system or collection system being used in target ac quisition mode target acquisition brings with it specific level of detail this is normally tied to the effect to be achieved against that target precision guided wea pons require high level of accuracy an ew jamming system may only require an i dea of the general area of the target whilst information operations may require an understanding of the culture of the target once target is acquired it mu st where possible be tracked or monitored this enables the target to be engaged by the most appropr iate weapon available and at the time of own forces choosing collection capability should also be deployed to enable effective bda to be carried out rapidly countering camouflage c oncealment and deception ccd 11 in general terms an adversary will alwa ys try and conceal what they are doing sometimes this will be achieved by chance whilst at other times it is achieved through planned activities the latter prin cipally through the application of ccd techniques the effective use of istar collection systems and careful analysis will help to counteract this however it shoul d never be assumed t hat truly determined adversary cannot prevent us finding out specific information about him or deceiving usrestricted issue 10 mar 02 4 1 restrictedannex to chapter 4 current istar colle ction capability1 ground manoeuvre reconnaissance 1 ground manoeuvre reconnaissance

characteristics of collection assets general 1 there are considerable number of co llection systems available to the land component when these are combined with those assets available to the other components this results in an acceptable vel of overall capability the key to the successful use of these assets is better overall understanding of their characteristics much of the technica l detail of the systems is classified and this chapter will provide only the det ail that falls within the ov erall classification of the afm this chapter also provides some details of the conops for each system but it is not designed to provide the low level operating instructions that guide the use of each collection system these can be found in subordinate publications and user guides ground based manned reconnaissance 2 background ground based manned reconnaissanc gives depth and resolution to the istar mix and is likely to be mo st effective when used with opsec and when faced by weather and environmental constraints ground based manned reconnaissance will be cued by other is tar systems such as uavs in order to obtain more detailed information on particu lar target collection assets should be deployed without rigid adherence to templa tes rather they should be packaged to provide broad utility across spectrum of requirements to achieve the necessary coverage will not necessarily require the depl oyment of an identical mix of collection assets and associated c4i at each level of command 3 advantages and disadvantages there are num ber of advantages and disadvantages to the us of ground based manned reconna issance and these are listed below advantages 1 combination of man and sensor the combination of man and sensor extends the capabilities of both entities and within the manoeuvrist approach allows the use of mission command to exploit opportunities when man and sensor are colloca ted the operational effect is resilience 2 endurance ground based manned reconnaissance has particular capability to be able to loit er and self sustain it can operate continually for extended periods of time and has varying degrees of integral logistic support 3 counter ccd ground based

hr capability with endurance it is able to provide the full spectrum of ground environmental reconnaissance including nbc and is effective in areas of overhead cover 5 intimate view of the battlespace ground manoeuvre reconnaissance forces are also abl to determine adversary intent using their integral weapons pr otection and mobility the adversary response can provide useful informati on as to dispositions capabilities and intent b disadvantages 1 vulnerability the use of ground based manned reconnaissance contains risks that may be unaccept able in certain circumstances or types of operation the vulnerabiliti are particularly evident when all types of ground based manned reconna issance are deployed behind the adversarys flot as neither reliance on stealth nor robust approach will guarantee successful inse rtion or survival and may incur the likelihood of casualties with an inherent problem of extraction and treatment ground based manned reconnaissance in depth may require the support of assurance operations1 for their success 2 lack of mobility both long range reconnaissance patrols lrrp and surveillance and target acquisit ion patrols lack organic mobility and have limited redeployabilit once inserted armoured reconnaissance has greater mobilit but also greater sustainment requirement 3 combat identification the problems inherent in combat identification are common to all types of m anned reconnaissance and in some cases the coordination of infiltration and extraction is constrained bythe security classification of the operation formation and close reconnaissance 4 general armoured or vehicle borne reconnai ssance elements are used at corps division brigade and battlegroup levels at corps and division they are part of formation reconnaissance fr regiment s and normally consist of armoured reconnaissance subunits with other rms task organised as required at battlegroup level they may be armoured or vehicle borne troops and are integral to the units this is termed close reconnaiss ance fr elements may be allocated to brigades but they are not organic and t heir allocation will depend on the type of operation that is being conducted and the act ual operational situation this form of 1 operations by one force conducted in order to fa cilitate the conduct of another operation by separate forcerestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 3 restrictedreconnaissance is normally conducted by st ealth but most reconnaissance elements are task organised with at least selfdef ence if not offensive capability all formation and close reconnaissance element s take direction from the commander and g2istar staff at their level of command but they also have the ability to self re task in order to exploit tactical sit uation formation and close reconnaissance elements carry out reconnaissance patro lling scouting screening and op tasks as part of their istar function 5 formation reconnaissance fr will primarily be involved in deep and rear operations but the range of operations will vary widely it may be used as an istar collection capability or in other roles such as economy of force and may be conducted anywhere in the ar ea of operations to the limits of sustainability and available communications it will often be conducted at some distance from the other forces and as such may have i ndirect fire support assets within range nonetheless good c4i linkages to other means of fi repower eg close air support cas and aviation enable reccestrike opportunities to be seized 6 close reconnaissance close reconnaissance is normally carried out within the range of close support artillery and frequently within the protection afforded by the battlegroup it is the prim ary istar capability directly available to the battlegroup commander for his own collection effort as such it is fundament ally important that the close reconnaissance commander understands the battlegroup commanders intent and reacts to it engineer reconnaissance 7 engineer reconnaissance is carried out by re troops that ar part of the general and close support engineer regiments 1 per regiment thes troops are normally allocated to formations and will also be alloca ted to units as the operational situation dictates when allocated to formations they are normally put under tacon of the fr regiment whilst within battl egroup they should become part of any reconnaissance group engineer reconnai ssance elements are very versatile and there is often temptation to use t hem for nonengineer reconnaissance this should be resisted as it degrades their ab ility to perform their primary function and significantly reduces their ability to respond to engineer reconnaissance tasks 8 engineer reconnaissance2 is required to determine changes to natural and man made features caused by battle damage or natural weather effects such as flooding in general terms engineer reconnaissance can be used to carry out the following tasks route

observation behind enemy lines they have wideranging surveillance function but can also provided ta for strike assets as well as bda they are normally small in size and are by virtue of their covert nature and limited mobility best suited to observing naitaidps or ot her static targets these patrols deploy on foot by vehicle or helicopter and any subsequent moves must be carefully considered as they have integral transport and their current communications are limited they pr ovide very discreet from of ground surveillance operating in hostile areas they have particular utility in support of the deep battle and can operate across the spectrum of conflict long range reconnaissance patrols are provided by the sas r b surveillance and target acquisition pa trols are provided by 5 regt ra and

surveillance once in position long range patrols provide continuous surveillance capability for considerable periods of time 2 target acquisition patrols can undertake target acquisition and support

surveillance 13 tactical air reconnaissance this is used as an int egral part of the istar systems and capabilities available to the land component however as it is capability that is provided by other com ponents there are particular aspects of its use which do not apply to other assets t hat must be considered especially in the planning and tasking processes most fast jets are provided with reconnaissance capability but as most are also multiro or have utility at the operational and strategic levels of command there c an be guarantee that air reconnaissance will be available when the land com ponent commander requires it 14 sensors reconnaissance aircraft are eit her dedicated to reconnaissance tasks or are able to be fitted with sensors details of the various aircraft and sensors

15 advantages and disadvantages tactical air reconnaissance as nonland component collection asset is often not considered properly when making collection plan the following basic advantages and disadvantages should be considered advantages 1 range of aircraft aircraft will be able to range further into the adversarys rear areas than any groundbased sensor they are likely to be able to reach any point within the area of operations 2 types of sensors available whilst the primar role of 2 and 13 sqns tornado 41 sqn jaguar and 39 sqn canberra pr9 is air 5 sarmti aircraft are not current ly in service with the rafrestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 7 restrictedreconnaissance most fast jets can be fitted with multiple sensor types and can carry more than one type of sensor for each mission the gradual move towards external pods rather than internal payloads has increased the flexibility of the airc raft by being able to use sensor better tailored for the tasking and r educing aircraft turn round times between missions of differing types 3 crew linked to sensors just as with manned ground based manned reconnaissance the possession of manned sensor on board the aircraft provides greater flexibility as well as providing another source of valuable information all reconnaissance missions require writtenreport from the pilot misrep wh ich is provided in addition to the information gathered by the sensors b disadvantages 1 vulnerability aircraft are vulnerable to enemy action and even single reconnaissance aircraft can oft require supporting package of other aircraft if it is to oper ate in hostile environment this vulnerability will lim it where in the battlespace it is deemed safe to use the platform and at what height it ght be used this may also dictate the type of sensor to be used and c ould impact on the ability to be able to carry out the required task or to pr ovide the sensor information at the right level of detail 2 speed of response most air reconnaissance missions are pre planned and changes to the missi on requirements once planned are difficult to make especially when t he mission is part of complex ato the capability to provide on call ssions will vary according to the type of operation but will normally only be provided on an exceptionalbasis 3 product dissemination the current c3i architecture within the land component and between com ponents is not robust this limits both the type of data and the speed with whic h it can be passed imagery is particularly demanding of bandwidth most dissemination of imagery is still confined to hard copy although this situation will change in line with technological advances in the future 4 limited assets there will only be limited air assets available for air reconnaissance tasks which will be allocated on priority basis 16 asset allocation air assets are allocated to task according to the planning cycle dictated by the air component commander d ue to the complexity of air operations especially in mn environment the allo cation of air assets is normally planned some considerable time ahead although there remains flexibility to allocate aircraft to tasks at short notice this applies only to small number of aircraft and the requirement to support air reconnaissance will be in conflict with the requests for aircraft to be used in support of other missi on types allocation of tasks to collection assets is carried out within the air co mponent at the operational level by therestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 8 restrictedccirm cell the type of aircraft allocated will vary and as most of the fast jets are multirole it is often not easy to determi ne what type of aircraft might actually be available for air reconnaissance in mult inational environment it is quite likely that an aircraft from another country would carry out task however neither the platform type nor its nationality is the key iss ue the priority is to ensure that the air reconnaissance request is both correctly completed and identifies the exactcollection requirements 17 requesting air reconnaissance can be r equested by any level of command however the responsibility for coordi nation of land component requests will fall to an individual level of command which is normally the senior land hq deployed air reconnaissance requests are passed on the air reconnaissance request form f210 it is important to provide the nece ssary detail required by the form and it will often be necessary to consult the nearest raf liaison officer for advice the brigade air balo or division air dalo even when request has been submitted there is guar antee that it will be met as it must compete with requests from many other levels of command 18 product dissemination there are number of ty pes of product that may be generated and passed to the requester after all reconnaissance flights post flight report the reccexrep is pr oduced this provides gener detail of what has been detected during the mission this is passed via the squadron intelligence officer to the air and any pertinent det ails will be passed to the requester all imagery will be analysed at reconnaissance intelligence cell ric that is part of the air component istar architectu re the output can be either textual reccexrep imagery wit h annotation or combinati on of both these reports will be passed to the requester via the air through whatever communications channels are available cu rrent communications and c² systems provide very limited capability for the transmission of imagery and therefore text reports are normal imagery if it is required will normally be confined to hard copy produced either at the ric or at point closer to the requester if the c3 architecture will permit this the current process is slow but planned c3i enhancements will improve this between now and 2010 unmanned aerial vehicles 19 general uavs are highly flexible asset well suited to variety of roles in support of the istar requirement the current in service uav is phoenix which although initially procured as ta system in support of longrange indirect fire assets has developed into general istar asset thi s has resulted from the success of its employment in kosovo and the realisation by commander s of the contribution that uavs can make to the provision of informati on to support their decision making it is expected that uavs will be in high deman d in the future and can be expected to deploy at all scales of effort and across the spectrum of conflict to complement other istar systems in this cont ext it is vital that uavs ar seen as part of system of systems and are but one elem ent of the istar effort supporting other sensors and strike systems they will rely upon the ke enablers of digitisation information fusion and

use is being developed and will be published prior to it entering service key element of wat chkeeper is that the system is expected to provi capability at division bri gade and unit levels at the same time 20 system components uav systems including phoen ix comprise number of different components air vehicle av av are typically construct ed from lightweight composite materials and are of modular constructi on to allow for quick assembly simple transportation and storage they must be capable of carrying suitable payload sensor suite and providing t hat payload with stable platform in most weather conditions b ground control stations gcs is where mission planning flight control and initial analysis of the sensor product takes place communications between the gcs and uav will normally be vi ground data terminal gdt through which flight control data and sens or products are trans mitted it may have to emit continuously during the mission when it could be vulnerable to adversary intercept therefore the gdt can be remoted from the gcs by cable for phoenix this is 1000m each gcs will have workstations operated bypersonnel with the following roles c mission controller mc the mc will carry out t he detailed planning for the uav missions coordinate system deployment and the communications plan d air vehicle controller avc the avc will control the launch flight and recovery of the uavs imagery analyst ia the ia will be responsible for control of the sensors and display of the product from the uav he will conduct the initial analysis of the product which will then be dissemi nated for action or secondary interpretation f remote viewing terminal rvt rvt may be avail able not with phoenix which typically comprises portable screen and receiver this allows uav imagery to be received by users outside the gcs including hq staff or the commander the rvt may be connected by fi bre optic cable to the gcs or it may be standalone unit receiving imagery direct from the uav in the latter case where the communications link is uhf the rvt antenna will need with the uav the imagery received by t he rvt will be provided in real time and will be being analysed by the ia at the same time as others are viewing it 21 launch and recovery most medium and small uavs use some sort of catapult and rail to launch them larger uavs may require prepared surface or runway recovery can be in number of different ways phoenix uses parachute but the majority of uav use prepared surface or runway avs will return to pre determined recovery location whic h can be programmed into the system automatically where sma ll team will then collect dismantle and load the uav intorestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 10 restrictedthe recovery vehicle depending on the operati onal situation

deploy with his party to provide advice on uav matters his role will include the planning and co ordination of battery deployments and he will ssist in the deconfliction of airspace 23 advantages and disadvantages there are num ber of advantages and disadvantages relating to the use of uavs advantages uavs provide the co mmander with number of benefits that include enhanced sa ta and bda the combination of these benefits will help the commander to manoeuvre and conduct decisive operations 1 mobility uavs have considerab battlefield mobility the speed and range of the av allows it to move quickly around the battlespace out to its maximum range with the abilit to retask when in flight this provides highly responsive capability 2 view of the battlefield as uavs are airborne sensors they can look into areas of the battlepsace whic h other assets might not be able to cover and from different angle targets that are hidden from ground based sensor might be clearly visible to uav sensor 3 types of sensor future uavs should be fielded with range of sensors that will allo w broad and narrow area coverage and near all weather capability currently p hoenix has an effective eoti sensor but it has other sensor options 4 endurance future medium and large uavs are expected to have considerable endurance potentially ov er 10 hrs in some cases whilst smaller uavs will probably hav commensurate endurance with phoenix combined with rapid response and an effective gcs architecture it should be possible to maintain surveillance of given target areas for considerable periods of time 5 expendability although commander would wish to lose istar assets becuase uavs are unmanned c an be more readily used on high risk missions the loss must be balanced against the potential intelligence gain but this signific antly reduces one of the constraints that would apply to manned platforms 6 tracking uavs mobility allows them to maintain observation of targets whilst the target or av is moving this capability enables the tracking of targetsrestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 11 restrictedb disadvantages 1 airspace coordination deconfliction must take place within the current airspace management proc edures which can be lengthy process in order to ensure timely response to tasking specific measures may need to be agreed in advance such as the allocating ablanket altitude for uavs which ot her air users will stay out of specific measures will often have to be defined in theatre for specific operations 2 deployment due to the requirement for all of the system components

field strengths are below the limit defined in the military aircraft release mar 24 nrt information uavs currently phoenix ffer the ability to provide nrt information and intelligence to the commander at the tactical level this capability is both flexible and responsive and is applic able across the spectrum of conflictrestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 12 restrictedaviation reconnaissance 25 general principal role of army aviation is observation and reconnaissance the progressive introduction into service of increasingly sophisticated observation devices the arming of aircraft and enhanced defensive aids suites das has seen the capability of this role in an in contact hostile environment significantly enhanced aviation can provide an istar function where the crew together with their observationsurveillance devices and cis can provide highly effective collection capability for manoeuvre forc manned aviation reconnaissance is capable of acquiring information interpre ting it and acting on or reacting to that information aviation reconnaissance is complementary to manned groundreconnaissance aviation reconnaissance can be flexibly grouped to support all levels of command its use as an istar collection asset must be carefully balanced against its other roles the decision as to which role should be undertaken at any one time will almost always be command led procedure must be put in place to collect and process ah information post mission 26 advantages and disadvantages the following specific advantages and disadvantages should be considered wh planning the use of aviation reconnaissance advantages 1 high tactical mobility aviation reconnaissance is largely free from the constraints of terrain its speed allows it to match its tempo to that of the operational situation and is parti cularly useful in conjunction with the use of am forces 2 range of aircraft although unable to match the range of fixed wing aircraft helicopters have significa nt range and will be able to penetrate well into the adversarys depth they are likely to be able to reach out to most of the areas about wh ich the land component might wish to have information and intelligence within the area of operations 3 crew linked to sensor as with ground based manned reconnaissance the fact that the sens or platform is crewed allows the onboard sensors to be used with gr eater efficiency the crews analytical capabilities and the wide field of view afforded to them by the platform enhances the aircrafts use as collection asset b disadvantages 1 endurance aviation reconnaissanc has limited endurance and cannot for instance match that of ground based reconnaissanceassets 2 vulnerability aircraft are vulnerabl to enemy action and even single reconnaissance aircraft can often require supporting package of other aircraft if it is to operate in hostile environment thisrestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 13 restrictedvulnerability will lim it where in the battlespace it is deemed safe to use the platform and at what height it might be used 27 attack aviation reconnaissance the apache ah mk 1 has comprehensive mix of star capability embedded cis and weapon systems as such it can take more aggressive stance when being deployed for reconnaissance purposes andcould fight for information it can conduct reconnaissance as part of manoeuvre mission provide support to others conducting reconnaissance or conduct reconnaissance mission in its own right 28 combat support aviation reconnaissance combat support aviation based on battlefield light utility helicopters bluh can also provide an istar function in the form of manned reconnaissance specif ic tasks that might be requested are luh istar specific tasks screens observation posts op point route and area reconnaissance and bda b luh istar support tasks formation and battlegroup reconnaissance reconnaissance in support of engineers artillery ad and nbc reconnaissance c direction of fire helicopters including luh and ah fitted with the appropriate communications systems data links and star devices can be used to direct fire 29 other operations aviation reconnaissance has proved to have great utility in other operations uk exper ience in n ireland and the balkans has demonstrated the requirement for and the ability of bluh to conduct reconnaissance with specialist observation devices appropriate to the terra in and type of operation in addition the use of simple hand held stills and video ca meras still has cons iderable utility in certain circumstances ah has also dem onstrated an ability to deter coerce and where necessary to act during reconnaissance and surveillance missions sta systems 30 general these systems provide direct support to indirect fire systems within the land component they are coupled closel to artillery systems through the targeting process and specific cis thei r primary purpose is to carry out target acquisition however this information is so an important elem ent of the overall istar capability and contribut to the intelligence effort sta systems are broken down into active weapon locating ra dar wlr and passive acoustic weapon locating awl systems 31 wlr wlr are active systems and as such are detectable this disadvantage is balanced by overall capability acquisiti on range and the use of sops they will normally deploy some distance behi nd the flot and will operate when cued by other systems they will move regular ly using emit and move and need to be allocated sufficient real to support this tactic restricted issue 10 mar 02 5 14 restricted32 awl awl are passive systems and inher ently undetectable they work by detecting sound waves given off by the sound of indirect fire weapons or acoustic events however these sound waves will be attenuated by weather and certain types of terrain awl work by est ablishing baseline and triangulating sound events based on the direction of the detected sound this baseline takes time to set up and redeploy which limits the ta ctical mobility of the capability human intelligence 33 general humint6 covers broad spectrum of c apabilities and these are applied in different ways according to the type of oper ation certain humint activities will be more applicable to some military operat ions than others but humint operations occur as part of the istar process and complement the other intelligence disciplines humint activities have parti cular utility in supporting the security and counter intelligence elements of force protection 34 humint activities humint activities are brok down into number of elements these elements may be conducted at the same time but must be coordinated within the humint capability as well as within istar as whole source operations source operations invo lve structured interpersonal contact between trained humint operat or and an individual with access to information of potential intelligence inte rest conventional directed activity cda may be carried out by any manoeuvre unit as part of their stap whilst intelligence corps and some e2 pers onnel selected and trained in specific humint skills provide specialist capability at other levels source operations are complex and may also be covert and sensitive and cover the following 1 conventional directed activity this is humint collection carried out by military personnel as part of nor mal duties it is conducted by non specialist personnel as byproduc t of their normal function for example elements of ground manoeuv re unit talking to the local population whilst on patrol it will be monitored by the g2x through unit ios 2 military intelligence liaison liaison this is overt contact by humint operators and intelligence offi cers with members of friendly organisations examples would be host nation intelligence andsecurity services police and other official agencies the staff organisation contacted knows the stat us of the uk operat or or officer involved and usually his interest it is unlikely that formal tasking will occur however the aim is to foster cooperation so that requests for assistance are met with positive response 3 debriefing this is the detailed and formal questioning of selected and consenting individuals who are asse ssed as being likely to provide useful information examples ght be refugees or evacuees from conflict area released detainees non government organisations 6 category of intelligence derived from informatio n collected and provided by human sources aap6restricted issue 10 mar 02 5 15 restrictedngo or defectors from hostile organisation selected after wider screening and selection process it is usually an overt activity 4 source handling this is the handling of human sources that have access or potential access to information of significant intelligencevalue where the high risks involv ed require the employment of specialist techniques 5 interrogation this is the systematic and formal questioning of non consenting individuals in care fully controlled environment it normally applies to prisoners of war pw and members of other hostile organisations detained in ci rcumstances that may or may not amount to armed conflict this is an overt activity which may be conducted in uniform or civilian cl othes the interrogation function is performed by trained personnel generally from triservice reservistswith appropriate language expertise in joint field interrogation teams jfit b humint support skills personnel possessing t hese skills do not exploit sources but are used to support humint operations and other disciplinessuch as counterintelligence ci operat ions and opintel collection they are 1 military intelligence reconna issance reconnaissance this is when humint specialists with the appropriate skill sets carry out vehicle borne mobile reconnaissance outside the immediate battlearea this is in pursuit of specific information requirements often of sensitive nature that r equires confirmation or exploitation this would not usually be carried out by operators employed on other humint duties due to opsec considerations 2 covert passive surveillance cps this is covert systematic observation of person place or object from concealedcovert static observation posts ops or the obser vation of persons of interest by foot vehicle or aircraft this can be conducted over extended periods to detect and identify events or to determine patterns of behaviour but will only be sanctioned in this context in support of intelligence operations and mobile cps will only be carried out in permissive environments 35 advantages and disadvantages there are particular advantages and disadvantages that apply to humint activities these are advantages 1 information on intentions is mo re readily available than from other collection capabilities 2 humint allows the exact expre ssion of the commanders intelligence requirements direct to the sourcerestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 16 restricted3 intelligence requirements can be pursued in depth by the humint operator who can ask supplementary questions on his own initiative 4 humint operations are cost effective when compared to other sophisticated technological collection platforms b disadvantages 1 humint operations will become more limited as the operational situation becomes more dangerous and force protection becomes more of an issue 2 communication with potential s ources is essential language requirements are difficult to predic t and the use of interpreters unless vetted runs the risk of opsec lapses 3 humint is not precise operations may take time to develop and to shift emphasis to new irs once established case development may be rapid and it is essential that fficient humint collection assets are available in theatre to deal with this contingency 36 humint management within the g2 staff the g2x7 is the humint staff function it is the focus at the theatre level for taski ng and direction control coordination and deconfliction it also provides the focus fo r all ci related activity in theatre that requires humint support close relati onship will be required with the g3 ops staff unit and format ion ios will be responsible for managing cda at their respective levels but it will be monitor ed and coordinated by the g2x the g2x has the following key roles operational oversight this encompasses clearance procedures authorisation of operations and ensuring consistency of source reports and source accuracy grading across the theatre in addition it monitors compliance with human rights legis lation and maintenance of the theatre source register b liaison coordination and deconfliction this ensures that activities are synchronised with other governm ent departments ogd allied and host nation components where applicable and that part of the field force which is conducting conventional military liaison and cda as part of their operations c source handling responsibility for authoris ing source handling operations is an extremely important and sensitive issue ministerial approval will be required prior to deployment but for operational reasons once deployed approval may be devolved down to t he lowest acceptable level whilst recognising the constraints of british law 37 field humint teams fht are the specialist element of humint collection

can best fulfil its function inside or outside contingent force locations the fht has modular capability that is based on the skill sets of individual humint operators this allows individual fh ts to

surveillance static op capable and capability to advise on the suitability of more complex operations electronic warfare 38 electronic warfare is military discipline whose aim is the dominance of the ems it is divided into three subdisciplines as follows electronic warfare support measures esm defined as the division of ew involving actions taken to search for intercept and identify em emissions and locate their sources for the purpose of immediate threat recognition it provides source of information requi red for immediate decisions involving electronic counter measures ecm electronic protection measures epm and other tactical actions b electronic counter measures defined as the division of ew involving actions taken to prevent or reduc an enemys effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of em energy c electronic protection measures defined as the division of ew involving actions taken to ensure effective friendly use of the ems despite the adversarys use of em energy 39 however it is only the esm division of ew that is considered to be an istar asset and therefore is the only division dealt with in this section esm may be conducted against communications comms and nonco mmunications noncomms targets and each is described below electronic warfare support measures 40 esm is concerned with looking for and identifying electronic targets search exploiting those target once found interc ept locating targets by direction finding df techniques and then comparing this raw data with existing databasesrestricted issue 10 mar 02 5 18 restrictedanalysis esm is passive which means t hat it cannot be detected esm activities detect identify and exploit the characterist ic signatures of em emissions this exploitation can yield valuable informati on on an adversarys use of the ems and his future intentions esm operations target intentional emissions such as radio weapon systems radars and other sensors or unintenti onal emissions such as those at infrared frequencies made by for example an exhaust plume relationship to sigint 41 signals intelligence sigint is related but specialised activity that may contribute to the databases used within esm it c onsists of communications intelligence comint and electronic intelligence elint which are similar to the activities described above as comms and noncomms esm although sigint is beyond the scope of this chapter it should be noted t hat the electronic warfare coordination cell ewcc may act as secure condui t for national sigint during coalition operations and may link to the uknic at the coalition joint task force hq however it can be used in peace crisis or war its use in peacetime is essential to build up and maintain an ew database for operations such as the nato emitter data base nedb however nato and nati onal rules strictly govern the transfer of sigint information between force components 42 advantages and disadvantages the use of ew as part of istar capability has number of advantages and disadvantages advantages 1 although transmissions can be att enuated by weather and terrain ew effectively provides 24 hr all weather capability 2 esm is passive and therefor inherently nondetectable by an adversarys ew capability in other words they do not know when they are being listened to b disadvantages 1 ew can only work when an adversary is radiating and providing signals that can be intercepted 2 detailed analysis is dependent on li nguistic capabilities that may be in short supply this may be especially so when operating on jrrf

capabilities and purpose of the esm equipment 44 search the first step in the esm cycle is the search through the frequency spectrum to identify possible electronic targets these tar gets may be operating anywhere in the ems combat net r adio cnr in the hf and vhf bands radio relay and air traffic control nets in the uhf band ad surveillance and guided radars in the shf band 45 intercept once signal of interest has been detected it will be exploited so that as much information as possible can be extract ed from it it is not necessary to hear the contents of message to gain info rmation because technical data about the transmission or analysis of traffic flow will reveal much intelligence although nets not protected by online encryption devices are obviously the most vulnerable to interception 46 direction finding the purpose of df is to locate transmitters8 df sensors normally work in groups of three or f our known as baseline and will be tasked to take bearings on specific transmissions single df sensor will produce line of bearing lob two lobs intersecting pr oduce cut but ideally 3 or more lobs should be used to produce position fix the result will not be single point but probability ellipse whose size depends upon the accuracy of the bearings developments in technology now enable hf skywave single site locating systems to be employed on the battlefield these can estimate the location of the transmitter from lob although these timates are far less accurate than the fixes obtained using complete baseline it should also be noted that burst transmission and frequency hopping systems are easily inte rcepted and located and must not be considered esm proof 47 df techniques these may have the accuracy to provide target acquisition data sufficient for modern smart weapons or area weapons employment although the potential requirements for positive identific ation may require other istar collection assets to be tasked where this is not the case for example target acquisition for land indirect fire weapons the df accu racy will often be sufficient to cue another istar sensor transmit operator c an improve his resistance to df by implementing all epm meas ures and if the signal c annot be heard by enemy esm it is not possible to carry out df 48 analysis the information gained from intercept must be analysed by specialists before it can be usefully rned into intelligence out of this analysis also comes steerage for further ew tasking and target ing it is not only clear voice transmission which can be used as source of information other areas include the degree of traffic flow equipment charac teristics and signatures and groupings of emitters through process known as emi tter density location edl edl has 8 it is important to realise that it is

identified however in the communications band when data and secure systems are located reliable dispositio n of forces on the battlefield may be deduced noncomms esm 49 radar is the use of elec tromagnetic energy for the detec tion and location of targets there are several different types of r adar that can be found on the battlefield common examples are ground based surveillance radar examples of t hese are ad radars that are used for the surveillance of air space or battlefield surveillance and mortar locating radars b airborne radar examples of these ar radar aided flying such as navigation terrain following or av oidance radar systems or intelligence gathering radar eg si deways looking airborne radar slar synthetic aperture radar sar and moving target indicator mti 50 the interception of radar is relatively easy because the pulse has to be of sufficient power to illuminate the target and for the echo to return to the sensor maximum effective range however this means that the passive detect able range of the radar is considerably increased intercept and identification of radar emitter can be achieved by matching the measured param eters to known database and this can provide information in the following areas electronic order of battle eob the location and ident ification of radars can indicate the location and level of associated units since particular types of radars are often associated with particu lar units or hqs matching radar activity can also be an indi cator of future intentions adversaries are unlikely to undertake major operations without
