the house of representatives either after felony convi ction andor while incarcerated in prison specifically involves question of the qualif ications or disqualifications to be representative in congress there are th ree and only three positive qualifications for representative in congress set out in the united states constitution 1 age 25 years 2 citizenship 7 years and 3 inhabitancy one must be an inhabitantof the state from which chosen when elected it is now wellsettled that these three qua lifications for office in the constitution are the exclusive qualifications for congress and are not merely minimum qualifications and that they are fixed and may not be supplemented by congress nor by any state unilaterally specifically there is qualification in the constitutionthat one not be convicted felon nor disqualif ication for offenses other than in the14 th amendment for certain treasonous conduct by those who have taken an oath of office similarly there is qualifi cation in the constitution that person when elected to congress not be in prison furthermore state could permissibly implement such additional qualifications for federal office through election laws or ballot procedures the framers of the constitution intentionally implemented arepresentative scheme whereby significant discretion is given and deferenceprovided to the judgment and choice of the people as to whom they wish to have represent them in congress in this respect the adage of the french political philosopher joseph maistre might apply every nation has the government itdeserves the existing constitutional qualifications do require one to be an inhabitant of the state from which chosen when elected does being placed in prisonfacility outside of the state in which one is candidate disqualify one from being an inhabitant of that first state congre ssional precedents as well as the provisions enactment history indicate that inhabitancy is not to be interpreted in an overlystrict or legalistic sense but rather was meant to assure real connection to the statefrom which elected the development of the concept of inhabitancy in housequalifications cases indicates that the term appears to be somewhat akin to the legalconcept of domicile encompassing not only actions taken which evidence theestablishment of principal home in st ate but also recognizing persons intent physical presence in the state at the time of election is of course significant factor for consideration but is not necessarily th determining factor when an individual had lived in state previously but then had physically been away from that state considerations relevant to determining inha bitancy in that first state might include whether one had left there any of the insignia of household establishmentwhether one retained business in the firs t state the location of ones family ones intent to establish residency in the new state ones intent to return to the first state both stated and deduced from facts as well as physical presence or absence in the first state at the time of election when one is out of ones home stateinvoluntarily at the time of election that may cer tainly be

and areunalterable by the legislature the federalist papers 60 similarly james madison argued at the constitutional convention for minimal required qualifications for congress that ought to be fixed

qualifications for congressional office and are not merely minimum qualifications and that such qualifications are fixedand may not be changed added to or subt racted from by the united states congress nor by the state legislatures other than by an amendment to the united statesconstitution 3 the supreme court of the united st ates found that it is clear from the constitutional record that the framers in tended the constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for members of congress and that the framers thereby divested states of any power to add qualifications4 the history of the adoption of the qualifications provisions within the constitution demonstrates philosophic commitment of the framers to minimal qualif ications for congressional office fixed in the constitution so as to empower the electorate and to promote thefundamental democratic principle that in the new republic the people should choose whom they please to govern them 5 in our system of federalism there is division of author ity with respect to elections to federal office the states do have significant role in federal elections including the express function of establishing the qualifications to vote in federal elections as long as such qualifications are the same as those to vote in stateelections for the most numerous house of the state legislature 6 and the broad

qualificationsfor election to federal office such as fo r example state requirements of residency in congressional district di squalification of convicted fe lons or disqualification for certain longterm incumbents term limits have all been found to beunconstitutional when challenged 8 conviction of crime imprisonment since the united states constitution sets out the only three qualifications for congressional office age citizenship and inhabitancy the conviction of crimewhich constitutes felony can not constitutionally disqualify one from being amember of congress unless that convic tion is for certain treasonous conduct after having taken an oath of office 9 furthermore since state does not have the authority to add qualifications for federal offices the fact of conviction even for felony offense could not be used to keep candidate off of the ballot under state law either as direct disqualification of convicted felons from holding or being acandidate for office or as disqualification of one who is longer qualifiedelector in the state 10 once person meets the three constitutional qualifications of age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state when elected that person if dulyelected is constitutionally qualified to serv in congress even if convicted felon similar to the fact of felony conviction the fact that an individual is in prison in and of itself is

one from being member of congr ess if one is duly elected by his or her constituents the question still remains whether under constitutional qualificationsfor congressional office person who is incarcerated at the time of the election ina state other than the one from which he is candidate still qualifies as being when elected an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen it should be noted initially that the united states constitution expressly provides that each house of congress is to be the judge of the qualifications for office of its own members each house sha ll be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members 14 the supreme court of the united states has explained that each house of congress has the sole authority under theconstitution to judge of the elections retu rns and qualifications of its members and to render judgment which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal toreview 15 the congressional precedents interpreting the constitutional qualificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31532crs5 15continued apparently it has been fully recognized that that power is lodged exclusively in the legislative branch see also reed v

governor wilson 18id at 217 19id at 218 mason the delegates expressly rej ected any period of durational residency requirement however rejecting various durations of previous residence of one year three years or seven years apparently agreeing with mr williamson who stated that newresidents if elected will be most zealous to conform to the will of their constituents as theirconduct will be watched with more jealous eye 2 farrand supra at 218of inhabitancy when questions of seating memberelect have arisen provide therefore the relevant precedential gui delines for examining the constitutional provision there is it should be emphasized pr ecise constitutional definition of the term inhabitant the word inhabitant was substituted for the term resident at the constitutional convention an amendment supported and seconded by jamesmadison who believed that although both word s were vague the term inhabitant might protect ones right to be chosen fr om state even though that person may have temporarily not resided in the state because of an occasional absence even for considerable period of time on public or private business 16 some delegates objected to any inhabitancy or residenc requirement believing that people would rarely chuse nonresident and noting that there were great disputes in some state colonial legislatures over technical and legal definitions of the term which weredecided by the arbitrary will of the majority 17 or as noted by madison determined more according to the affection or dislike to the man than any fixt interpretation of the word18 george mason however argued for some requirement of inhabitancy or residency to preserve knowledge and understanding of the state and to prevent wealthy interlopers from neighboring states if residence be not required rich men of neighbouring states may employ with success means of corruption in some particul ar district and thereby get into the public councils after having failed in their ow n state this is the practice in the boroughs of england19 the apparent constitutional concern of the framers who debated this provision was thus to craft term that was not so ove rly technical that it could be applied in strict capricious fashion by political majo rity to their advantage but rather to express requirement of an actual connecti on to the state as ones home the mere absence of physical presence from the state for particular duration or presence for any period of continual duration was obviously not to be the definitive or conclusive concept since so strict an expression might be construed to exclude the membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31532crs6 20id at 218 21i hinds precedents of the house of representatives 434 pp 419421 22id at 421 23id at 421 see blacks law dictionary at p 501 7th ed defining the term domicile to include persons true fixed principal and permanent home to which that person intends to return and remain even though currently residing elsewhereof the legislature who could not be said to be actual residents in their states whilst at the seat of genl government20 early congressional decisions on inhabitancy might have appeared at first glance to have borne out to some extent some of the framers concerns about overly technical definitions but upon examination s how more reasoned conclusion in the case of john bailey in the 18th congress for example th house of representatives found memberelect from massachusetts not to be an inhabitant of that statewhen he had left the state to work for the federal government and reside in thedistrict of columbia for number of years even in this seemingly strictinterpretation however the committee and the house noted that it was voluntaryaction on the part of bailey to abandon his domicile and establish residency in thedistrict of columbia that he had lived ex clusively in the district for period of over 6 years that he had in the district married wife and established family of his own thereby leaving his natural or orig inal domicile in his fathers house and that significantly mr bailey had domestic establishment or estate inmassachusetts 21 noting that one may acquire inhabitancy in the district of columbia in the same way as in any of the states the house and committee on elections as reported in hinds precedents specifically concluded if the residence of mr bailey here the di strict of columbia had been transient and not uniform had he left dwelli ng house in massachusetts in which his family resided part of the year had he left there any of the insignia of ahousehold establishment there would be indication that his domicile inmassachusetts had not been abandoned it had been urged that the expressedintention to return to massachusetts should govern but the law ascertained intention in such case by deducing from facts the committee did not contendthat member must be actually residing in state at the time of his election 22 the concept of inhabitancy that volved in congressional decision making and has traditionally been employed in congressional consideration alluded to in the1824 case of john bailey appears to be some what akin to the understanding of the legal term domicile and thus would encompass not only actions taken whichevidence the establishment of physical and principal home in state such as the purchase or maintenance of primary personal residence but also intent that is theintent that place be ones permanent hom the place where one intends to return after an absence as such intent is deduced from the facts 23 citing as support of the inhabitancy of memberelect the co mmittee of elections of the house in the case of bayley v barbour fortyseventh congress for example noted that mr barbour testifies that he was native of the state of virginia had always been citizen of said state never claime d to have lived elsewhere in permanent sense or to have exercised citizenship in any other state or territory and

precedents prior to the supreme courts clarifications in 1969 in powell v mccormack and again in 1995 in us term limits inc would now appear to be of ma rginal relevance and reliabilitywhile he had temporary winter residence in the city of washington he had taken house in alexandria with his family in september 1880 before thenovember 1880 election 24 the majority of the house committ ee on elections in 1926 in ruling on whether memberelect of the house elect ed from pennsylvania was an inhabitant of that state when elected provided very cogent explanation of the concepts and factors to be considered in determining inhabitancy to be an inhabitant within the c onstitution it seems clear that one must have first place of abode and second that this place of abode be intended by him as his headquarters the place where his civic duties and responsibilitiescenter the place from which he will exercise his civic rights we think that fair reading of the debate on this paragra ph of the constitution discloses that it was not intended that the word inhabitant should be regarded in captious technical sense we think that fair interpretation of the letter and spirit of thisparagraph with respect to the word inha bitant is that the framers intended that for person to bring himself within the scope of its meaning he must have andoccupy place of abode within the pa rticular state in which he claims inhabitancy and that he must have openly and avowedly by act and word subjected himself to the duties and responsibilities of member of the bodypolitic of the particular state 25 in judging whether one was an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen the house of representatives has thus employed several and variedconsiderations depending on the facts and question before it when an individualhad lived in state previously but then had physically been away from that state for example considerations relevant to the question of whether one was an inhabitant of that first state might include whether one had left there any of the insignia of household establishment whether home was owned or occupied in the first or the new state and what type of home ie permanent home or merely vacation home where ones wife and family were located whether one retained license in the first state to practice profession whether one continued to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship in the first st ate such as voting and paying taxes ones intention to return to the first state both stated and deduced from facts as well as ones physical presence or absence in the first state at the time of election 26 cases in the senate demons trate similar application of something akin to domicile concept of inhabitancy in the 1899 senate case of nathan b scottthe challenge to mr

intent to retain his residence citizenship inhabitancy and domicile in wheeling wva and that he claims to be an inhabitant of wheeling w va and that heremained in washington in the discharge of hi s official functions with intent to return to his home in wheeling when his duties of office here ended the committeestated that the term inhabitant is legal equivalent of the term resident andnoting that mr scott also voted in west virginia unanimously found that despite his temporary physical absence from the state he was entitled to his seat 27 as demonstrated by the congressional cases if candidate were to be physically absent from the state at the time of election to congressional office thatfact would certainly be one considerati on in the houses review of the issue of inhabitancy of memberelect however absence from the state particularlyinvoluntary absence such as if one had b een injured and hospitalized out of state or had been involuntarily removed from the state to another state would not appear in itself to be the only consideration or even the determinant factor in judging inhabitancy in that state from which elected the involuntary nature of therelocation to another state would in fact significantly militate against finding that such person intended to abandon his inhabitancy and residency in the first stategenerally the house has looked to the totality of the circumstances to determinewhat might be characterized as ones true home including whether one has keptthe indicia of residence in that first state such as ones principal personal residence where ones immediate family resides as well as considering the intent of theindividual to return to and to make particular state his home evidenced anddeduced by statements and facts
