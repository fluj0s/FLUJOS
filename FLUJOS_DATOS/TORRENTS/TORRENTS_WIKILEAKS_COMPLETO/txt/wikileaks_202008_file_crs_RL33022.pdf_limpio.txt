available personnel and facilities21 ihs has stated that its funding doe s not allow it to provide all the needed care for eligible indians22 as result according to indian health organizations some services are rationed with the most critical care given first23 ihs regulations require that when resources or funds are in sufficient the agency must set priorities for both direct and contract health care based on relative medical need24 i n addition the drugs and medi cines available from ihs pharmacies may not include all drugs and medicines needed although ihs says its pharmacies will stock most drugs that have proven to be costeffective and beneficial25 ihs shortfalls in medical personnel contribute to this unevenness in health care delivery where health professional position is vacant either the health care may not be available or the f acility will have to use chs funds which according to ihs raises the costs of the care in january 2008 the ihs had job vacancy rates of 31

during the pregnancy and six weeks following birth as long as paternity is acknowledged the ihs also serves nonindians in specifi c circumstances particularly when an acute infectious disease is involved30 most ihs services are intended for members of federally recognized tribes since federal law does not restrict state recognition of tribes some states grant recognition to indian groups that are not recognized by the federal government members of such staterecognized tribes are ineligible for most ihs health services but are eligible for services at ih sfunded urban indian health projects for the most part tribal membership is determined by the tribe many tribes require recognized descent from particular tribal roll for membership in tracing descent tribes follow paternal or maternal bloodlines or both some tribes require minimum percentages of genealogical des cent and others require only proof of descent for few tribes congress has set membership criteria in statute31 the ihs service population as calculated by ihs is not evenly distributed throughout indian country in 2003 approx imately 35 of the population served by ihs resided in two ihs regions 144 lived in the navajo

adjusted for birth and death rates and for the areas ihs serves see figure 1 33 the census however asks respondents only to identify themselves by race34 not by confirmed membership in federally recognized tribe35 hence ihs service populati on data are based on self identification as aian by race not on tribal membership not all persons self identifying as aian are members of federally recognized tribes so not all aian counted by the census are eligible for ihs services the ihs also estimates its user population based on registered aian pa tients who used ihsfunded services at least once in the most recent three years36 but this figure does not include all eligible aian the bia publishes biennial estima tes of its own serv ice population based on estimates received from bia agencies and federally recognized tribes but these estimates are not based on actual censuses and cover only persons on or near reservations37 the bia also lists tribes reports of their enrollment

increase that is the same across ihs if congress makes appropriations above the adjust ed base to increase particul ar services or meet unmet needs ihs allocates such increases usin g formulas which have been developed in consultation with tribes68 some ihs programs or pa rts of programs are allocated solely by formulas such as routine mainte nance of facilities some sdpi grants some sanitation facilities funds the indian h ealth care improveme nt fund discussed below and others if c ongress appropriates funds for specific facilities the funds are usually added into and b ecome part of the base fundi ng for the relevant service unit and area basing ihs allocations on historical patterns of base funding means the allocations do not fully take into account changes in population health needs and health services one result has been that different ihs areas and service units receive widely varying levels of funding as measured by percapita funding69 fdi studies found significant

program is not an entitlement under federal law ihs cannot commit f unding for services if that funding has not been appropriated consequently ihs health services depe nd each year on the annual appropriation an entitlement program on the other hand such as medicaid and medicare statutorily obligates the federal government to make payments to any person who meets the legal criteria for eligibility an entitleme nt program may be funded through either permanent or annual appropr iations but the programs law requires that congress appropriate whatever funds are needed on of the major issues addressed in the ihcia reauthorization bills before congress is the tension between 1 the choices that must be made under the constraints of finite annual appr opriation and 2 the view of many indians that their health care services are or should be an entitlement and as such are the sole responsibility of the federal government under trust or treaty obligations to its proponents the advantage of an entitlement program for indians would be that federal spending on eligible indians health care would not be limited to specific appropriated amount spending controls on entitlement programs are done either by reducing benef its limiting the conditions covered changing the eligibility requirements for beneficiarie s or generating new revenue s so among the issues to be considered would be whether and how to limit the entitlements level of spending entitlement proponents argue that indians ss of land and resources justifies making indian health care an entitlement program despite the cost some advocates are concerned about how beneficiary woul d be defined and wh ether congress would require means testing as part of the elig ibility criteria these supporters argue that if congress imposed means testing those indians not meeting the means test would have their treaty rights abrogated some opponents argue that fede ral indian treaties and agreements did not promise unlimited health care services to all indians or else that indians have already been compensa ted for lost lands and resources other opponents question whether an entitlements benefit package would cover the non clinical services eg san itation facilities provi ded now through ihs if nonclinical services were not provided some believe that the quality of care would diminish under an entitlement program the commission authorized under s 1200 and hr 1328 would make recommendations on indian health care deliv ery and related issues including the optimal manner such as entitlement in which to

support costs th supreme court noted that the entire ihs appropriation from which ct support costs are drawn is available to pay the costs but only if the appropriations act does not cap the amount appropriated for contract support costs170 even before the court decision however from fy1998 on congress began including language in appropriation acts that explicitly limited amounts for ihs contract support costs the main proposals for fully funding contract support costs besides increasing the appropriations involve making them an entitlement proponents of entitlement argue that contracting and compacting tribes are operating federal programs and carrying out fe deral responsibilities and that tribes should not have to use tribal financial resources to s ubsidize federal contract support costs171 critics warn the proposal would be extremely expensive and argue that making an entitlement for one ihs funding source woul d jeopardize funding for other programs bills introduced in the 106th and 108th congresses hr 4148 and s 2172 respectively would have made these costs an entitlement for ihs and bia contracts and compacts but neither bill was enacted substance

are generally so meager and th auditing and repor ting requirements so onerous that it is simply not cost effective to attempt to operate program which combines multiple sources of available funding

with handling indian affairs 1 stat 49 so early federal health services to indians were most likely to be provided by military doctors and were probably chiefly to prevent the spread of infectious diseases congressional appropriations for the war department in this period did not mention indian health care in addition to whatever the war department spent some of the funds the federal government provided to missionaries for educating indians may have been used for medical care of indian students the earliest statutory authorization and appropriation explicitly for federal indian health care was the act of may 51832 4 stat 514 which authorized indian agents to employ local or us army doctors to provide smallpox vaccinations to indians and appropriated 12000 for the pur pose additional appropriations for smallpox vaccinations were made in 1839 5 stat 328 1853 10 stat 226 and annually from 1860 to 1915 the earliest indian treaty providing for h ealth services was signed on september 15 1832 7 stat 370 with the winnebago of wisconsin it included funding for two physicians for 27 years as part of the compensation for land cession of the approximately 210 trea ties made with indian tribes after this 1832 treaty until 1871 when congress ended indian treatymaking about 44 treaties committed the federal government to provide the signatory tribe s physician hospital medicines or vaccine or some combination of thes usually for delimited period of time after 1849 when indian affairs were tr ansferred from the war department to the new department of the interior 9 stat 395 federa l executive activities regarding indian health care fell under civilia n rather than military authority as the placement of indian tribes on reservations accelerated in the second half of the 19th century the federal government gradually became aware of the need for medical care on reservations as noted congress made annual appropr iations for indian vaccination against smallpox from 1860 to 1915 by the 1860s congress was also making appropriations for doc tors and medicine for some agencies and the bia was appointing physicians although only at some agencies the number of medical employees in bia agencies and schools in creased from at least 12 in 1865 to 86 in 1897 and by 1888 there were four bia hospitals by 1884 the bia published regulations specifying physicians re sponsibilities except for 18731877 however bia had organized medical division it was not until 1908 that commissioner of indian affairs first appointed chief medical supervisor critics and studies inside and outside the bia pointed out the severity of health problems especially tuberculosis in i ndian schools and reservations between 1900 and 1911 the number of bia hospitals nd sanatoria jumped from five to 50 in 1910 congress enacted its first appropriation for general indian medical needs 36 stat 271 as opposed to appr opriations for specific reservations or diseases for 40000 by 1920
