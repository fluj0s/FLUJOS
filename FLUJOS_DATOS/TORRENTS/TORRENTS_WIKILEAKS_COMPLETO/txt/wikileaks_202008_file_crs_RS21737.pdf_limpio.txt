effects on the us and mexican economies to be modest at most this report provides an analytical summary of the economic lessons reached in support of congresss role in the trade policy process it will not be updated introduction free trade agreements are supposed to enhan ce the welfare of participating countries so evaluating their effects is important nafta is particularly relevant to the bilateral trade agreements being considered by the unite d states today because it was the first trade agreement between developing and two deve loped countries as such it is important to note that this report focuses on usmexic issues because the uscanada free trade agreement predates nafta and is less contr oversial in the eyes of most trade critics because it involves trade between two devel oped economies and so is less relevant to the pending us trade agreements with latin america also trade between canada and mexico remains very small and the trilateral trade agenda is only beginning to emerge this report evaluates multiple studies whose assessments of nafta by and large are analytical in nature use established thodologies caveat thei r own work to reflect limitations of the

trade investment economic grow th productivity employment wages and immigration trade and investment effects nafta is broad agreement but permanently improved market access was the major goal after ten years most tariffs have gone to zero except for some very sensitive agricultural goods that ve limited protection for up to 15 years clearly usmexico trade and investment have grown sharply over the past decade from 1994 to 2003 us exports to mexico rose 91 compared to 41 to the world us imports increased by 179 compared to 89 from the world this surge however began prior to nafta so the question is how much of the post 1994 growth can be attributed to nafta nafta had modest effect on usmexico trade growth the cbo world bank and usitc approached the probl em differently but all found that nafta had modest effect on usmexico trade gr owth the cbo model of usmexico trade estimated that 85 of us export growth and 91 of us import growth would have occurred without nafta although the ffect was modest it accelerated over time accounting for 2 marginal growth of u s exports and imports in1994 up to11 and 8 marginal growth of us exports and imports in 2001 the imf notes that as percentage of gdp the increased trade wa s more pronounced for mexico than for the united states doubling from 25 to 51 from 1993 to 2000 the world bank makes the point that nafta has reinforced existing trends in trade growth and estimates that mexicos global exports would have been 25 lower without nafta2 the usitc analyzed tariff preferences by sector to isolate the effects of nafta on usmexico trade it estimated that naf ta tariff preferences accounted for onethird of the growth in us import shares from mexico higher among textile and apparel goods and 13 of growth of us exports to mexico the remaining growth in trade would have occurred anyway and was influen ced more by factors such as the 1994 peso devaluation and existing preferences provide d mexico under the generalized system of preferences gsp and productionsharing ma quiladora programs both the imf and csis studies support the modest trade grow th conclusion but add that the composition of mexican exports changed dramatically after nafta as they diversified away from oilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21737crs3 3 imf p 1316 csis p 9 and usitc pp 30204 308 313 4 world bank pp xviixviii and 298 imf p 14 and csis p 47 5

us benefit from nafta may also be seen in xicos response to the 199495 peso crisis which was to raise tariffs against nonnafta partners3 there is little evidence of trade diversion key concern of trade analysts is whether an fta results in trade shiftin g from nonmember countries to members of trade agreement because the tariff preferences have allowed them to become the lower cost producers this has the effect of switching trade from more to less efficient trading partners the world bank study found si gnificant evidence of trade diversion in nafta particularly with resp ect to textile and apparel pr oducers in neighboring central america and the caribbean this is consistent with majority of studies done earlier and is reinforced by the imf and csis studi both of which found nafta to be trade creating rather than trade diverting4 nafta did not cause the widening u s trade deficit with mexico from 1994 to 2002 the us trade deficit w ith mexico grew from 14 to 371 billion these studies found that trade deficits are rgely macroeconomic phenomena in this case predominantly attributed to the respective business cycles in mexico and the united states strong us growth in the 1990s co mbined with mexicos deep recession caused by the december 1994 peso crisis devaluation were the main factors cited for the large deficits importantly none of the studies attributed the peso crisis to nafta but to structural misalignments in the mexican economy combined with political events5 nafta helped increase bilateral foreign direct investment fdi6 from 1994 to 2002 us fdi in mexico rose from 161 b illion to 581 b illion or 259 mexican fdi in the us increased 244 to 79 b illion albeit from the much smaller base of 23 billion fdi in mexico mostly us grew on average from 11 of gdp in 198093 to 30 in 19942001 the world bank noted that nafta was one of numerous factors directing fdi and estimated that it led to 40 annual increase in fdi to mexico without diverting fdi from othe r countries the cbo usitc imf and csis studies basically agreed finding that naftas investment and trade liberalization provisions helped increase total investment flows to mexico by increasing investment opportunities reducing risk strengthening i nvestor rights and imp roving profitability domestic economic effects the various studies reached different conclusions with respect to the macroec onomic effects of nafta choice of methodology nd depth of research varied and likely explain many of the differenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21737crs4 7 cbo p 22 usitc p 32 and world bank p

slightly increased growth in output and productivity the cbo study which had limited model for estima ting the trade effects on gdp found that nafta increased annual gdp growth in the united states by more than 04 and for mexico more than 8 similarly the usitc cited other literature suggesting that us gdp could grow by an additional 01 to 05 once nafta is fully implemented the world bank study which undertook more elaborate modeling effort concluded that mexicos economic performance was similar to the rest of latin america prior to nafta after nafta went into eff ect mexicos per capita gdp converged increasingly toward that of the united stat although large discrepancy still exists estimates of the rate of c onvergence suggest that without nafta mexicos per capita gdp growth would have been 45 lower by 20027 over decade however this is not large amount growth was hindered by weak economic fundamentals and the 199495 peso crisis the world bank also suggested that nafta contributed to substantially faster rate of productivity c onvergence than in previous ears for example mexican manufacturers were able to lve the time needed to adapt us technological innovation the carnegie study also notes that productiv ity rose dramatically after nafta in both the united states and mexico and suggests nafta likely played significant role which was also supported by the imf paper8 nafta had little or impact on aggregate employment nafta is at the heart of longstanding debate over the employment effects of trade because of fears that trade with developing countries causes u s job losses and that trade deficits equate to higher unemployment none of the reports attributed changes in aggregate us or mexican employment levels to nafta but the author of the first chapter of the carnegie study suggests that changing the assumptions of usitc model would allow for net gain in us employment over the past d ecade of between zero and 270000 jobs small increase for mexico it concludes that the sum of the effects of the trade pact to date has not been strong net gain in overall employment the second chapter different author argues for zero net growth in us jobs the usitc study demonstrates contrary to some popular opinion that us trade defi cits tend to occur during periods of low unemployment and vice versa this evidence supports wellestablished economic theory that would suggest both the us trad deficit with mexico and us employment levels over the past decade were respondi ng to economic growth not each other9 nafta contributed to employment shifts among sectors the carnegie report observes shift in mexican employment away from agriculture toward services and manufacturing it attempts to correlate th is shift with naftainduced trade balances in agriculture deficit and manuf acturing surplus goods but concludes that it is impossible to establish precisely how much of the jobs shift can be attributed to nafta the world bank points to productivity growth in irri gated agricultural lands and the lack of opportunity in subsistence agriculture as altern ative reasons for these shifts in the united states employees who lost jobs because of nafta are eligible for nafta trade adjustment assistance the carnegie re port notes that at the end of 2003 some 525000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21737crs5 10 carnegie endowment polaski p 2028 wo rld bank p xv

many of whom are already reemployed nonetheless it is among the most salient adjustment issues related to trade along with the possible need for larger social safety net the usitc and world bank also show that structural shifts in both countries had been affecting l ongterm employment patterns as well10 nafta has had small effect on real wages the usitc in summarizing the vast literature on the observed rising us income gap between moreskilled and less skilled workers suggests that while estimates varied trade in general has contributed to more than 1020 of the wage gap ec onomists generally consider the wagegap problem to be function of skillbased technological change that causes an employment bias toward more highly educated or trained workers increased trade of intermediate goods using outsourcing or productionsharin g arrangements has also been linked in recent research for mexico the carnegie endowment and the world bank note that real wages are lower than when nafta began but conclude that it was not the cause decomposing the trend shows that mexico experienced 25 fall in real wages after the 1994 peso devaluation real wages began steady recovery in 1997 and are approaching 1994 levels the world bank study showed that those mexican states tied to fdi exports and maquiladoras had higher and fastergrowing wages than other states11 immigration patterns were not affected by nafta the longterm trend in legal and unauthorized worker migration from mexico to the united states continued and accelerated after nafta was implemented the trade agreement however was found to have little effect the carnegie endowment study points to many factors that outweigh any effect an fta can have on migra tion patterns mexican workers have been drawn to the united states by large wage differentials and the high demand for low skilled workers they have been encouraged to leave mexico by the burgeoning work force that cannot be absorbed periodic financial crises 1982 1986 1994 exacerbate the problem these cause huge losses in formal sector jobs large declines in real wages relative to those in the united states and failing confidence in the mexican economy all of which encourage emigration the worl d bank found that mexican emigrants had higher levels of educati on and earned more than none migrants and so migration may have contributed to mexicos growing wage gap the csis study concurred with these conclusions adding that family and village networks further encouraged immigration12 nafta has minor role in mexicos ruralurban migration the first chapter of the carnegie endowment study ar gues that the observed trend of migration from rural areas of mexico to urban cente rs along with the attendant problems of unemployment family disruption and poverty is directly the result of agricultural liberalization linked to nafta this is c ontradicted by second chapter different author that argues such migration pattern s have been in place since 1960 when over

trend that economists long have argued is common in the development process of most countries the csis study notes that rural poverty is not due to nafta but to the structure of mexicos agricultural sector which lacks skilled workers and investment in education and infrastructure needed to link the sector better to the formal productive economy13 outlook the studies discussed above point to three broad themes first by most aggregate measurements nafta has had only modest but positive effect on the us and mexican economies and tends to reinforce longterm trends already evident by its inception this is in keeping with what is widely und erstood about tr ade and trade agreements they work at the margin of economies and their effect can be easily confused with much more powerful factors such as longterm structural change and shortterm volatility eg financial crises such confusion is seen in the reluctance of many supporters and opponents of nafta to engage in more nuanced debate on trade second adjustment problems related to tr ade liberalization present the greatest challenge to policy makers for export firms and sectors the adjustment is positive and provides evidence of the winners from trade for import competing sectors displacement can have devastating effects on communities and raises the question of whether to fight freer trade or attempt to adjust to it as part of the larger global inte gration process the world bank report argues that trade agreements can do more by improving distorting rules of origin taking on the hard tasks of antidumping and countervailing duty measures and tackling adjustment problems the carn egie endowment study argues that trade agreements should address trad erelated adjustment issues through longer tariff reduction schedules use of special safe guards removal of agricultura l subsidies and provision for regionally funded trade adju stment assistance and soci safety net programs14 third four studies address common call fo r better integration of trade policy into countrys overall developmen t program by coordinating and supporting it with domestic structural reforms the carnegie endow ment study argues for more attention to agricultural environmental immigration tax and labor righ ts protection policies the world bank study prioritizes institutional reform especially rule of law and anti corruption efforts educational developmen t to promote technology transfer other innovation s upportin g policies and labor reform that facilitates employment transition among industries and sectors the imf em phasizes reducing labor market and judicial rigidities csis authors point to investment in education infrastru cture and transitional support programs in the end these reports do not provide easy answ ers to traderelated policy problems but they do attempt to explain how the gains from trade may be enhanced by understanding and responding be tter to the adjustment challenges all countries face15
