revised on definite cycle recent modifications of related past agency guidance have highlighted the controversy legislation to designate wilderness areas and to end wsa status has been introduced this report will be revised as circumstances warrant the 1964 wilderness act1 created the national wilderness preservation system units of which must be designated by c ongress following earlier reviews of lands managed by other agencies 603 of the fe deral land policy and management act of 1976 flpma2 directed the secretary of the interior to review the wilderness potential of those roadless areas of fi ve thousand acres or more nd roadless islands administered by the blm and to make recommendations to the president who then madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21917crs2 3 congress has also designated some wsas typically specifying areas to be reviewed and deadline for completing the reviews 4 this excludes an additional 2 million acres in arizona that were reviewed but for which recommendations were made because the arizona desert wilderness act of 1990 pl 101628 was enacted prior to blm making wild erness recommendations to the presidentrecommendations to congress the blm i nventoried its lands designated potentially suitable areas as wilderness study areas wsas for full study and made recommendations from among them3 in language referred to as the nonimpairment standard 603c also directs that until congress has dete rmined otherwise the lands under review be managed so as not to impair their suitability as wilderness therefore wsas must remain in this protected status indefinitely until congress takes action to release them following earlier wilderness recommendations for the national forests overs een by the department of agriculture congress enacted many statebystate national forest wilderness acts containing release language that allowed but did not mandate pres erving the wilderness characteristics of areas not designated by congress and also provided that wilderness suitability would again be reviewed as part of the cyclical forest planning process this language was compromise that resolved th issues of whether release should compel uses other than wilderness and whether w ilderness reviews were part of the normal planning processes or were onetime occurrence issues that are now occurring in connection with blm lands in addition to the wsas blm created pursuant to 603 blm also designated some areas as wsas pursuant to its authorities unde r other sections of flpma section 201 43 usc 1711 directs that inventories of blm lands and their resources be conducted on continuing basis 202 43 usc 1712 directs the development of land use plans based on those inventories and 302 43 usc 1732 elaborates on land uses and directs that the secretary pr event unnecessary or undue degr adation of the public lands additional wsas known as 202 wsas were designated under these authorities blm wilderness reviews and wsas involve several current issues including 1 congressional action on the 603 blm wilder ness recommendations 2 management of 603 and 202 wsas and blm protection of thos areas 3 release language for blm lands 4 wsas and wilderne ss reviews under authorities othe r than 603 and 5 recent changes in agency guidelines congressional action on blm recommendations by 1991 the department of the interior had recommended to the president that nearly 10 million blm acres of more than 26 million acres reviewed be designated as wilderness4 and presidents george hw bush and bill clinton made recommendations to congress with few changes by 1993 ho wever to date congress has enacted statewide blm wilderness statute only for ar izona 1990 and made other significant designations in the califor nia desert 1994 colorado 2000 and new mexico 1987 proposals for statebystate wilderness signation have gene rated controversy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21917crs3 5 44 fed reg 72014 dec 12 1979 this guidance was expected to be temporary until congress acted upon the blm recommendations it is now found in blm handbook h85501 interim management policy for l ands under wilderness review available from blmmanagement of wilderness study areas the wilderness act does not provide expr ess management direction for wsas but 603c of flpma provides for the nonimpairment of wsas til congress has determined otherwise the secretary shall continue to manage such lands according to his authority under this act and other applicable law in manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness subject however to the continuation of exis ting mining and grazing uses and mineral leasing in the manner and degree in which the same was being conducted on october 21 1976 provided that in managing the public lands the secretary shall by regulation or otherwise take any action required to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands and their resources or to afford environmental protection in 1979 blm provided an interim manage ment policy imp for managing the wsas5 this guidance revised in 1983 1987 and most recently in 1995 repeats the wilderness act definition of wilderness as undeveloped fede ral land retaining its primeval character and influence without permanent improvements or human habitation which is protected so as to pr eserve its natural conditions the imp identifies nonimpairment criteria to implement the provisions of 603 of flpma it specifies that any use facility or activity must be temporary not disturb the surface or permanently establish facilities and be easily terminat ed upon designation of the area also wilderness values must not be degraded so far as to significantly constrain the areas suitability for preservation as wilderness the imp also identifies five permitted exceptions to the nonimpairment rule s 1 emergencies such as wildfire suppression or search and re scue 2 reclamation efforts to minimize the impacts of violations and emergency activities 3 uses and facilities grandfat hered by the imp or under valid existing rights 4 uses and fac ilities to protect or nhance wilderness values or public health and safety and 5 reclamation of pre flpma impacts grandfathered uses are generally limited to grazing mining and mineral leasing that existed when flpma was enacted october 21 1976 similarl valid existing rights are those in existence on the date of flpmas enactment the imp also makes distinction between 603 and 202 wsas the imp notes that flpma does not require nonimpairment of 202 wsas but asserts that the bureau has the authority under secti on 302 of flpma to manage these lands similarly the principal differences relate to mineral activities the imp states that new mining activities in 603 wsas must meet the non impairment standard but valid existing mineral operations must be llowed to continue even if they impair the area if non impairment would unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of the benefit of the rights p 13 in 202 wsas however mining operations under the 1872 mining law will be regulated only to prevent unnecessary and undue degradation of the lands not to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability p 7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21917crs4 6 see archived crs report 93280 wilderness legislation hi story of release language 1979 1992 by ross w gorte and pamela baldwin available upon request from the authorssome interests alleged that the blm was not preventing impairment of wsas and filed suit to compel the blm to do more to protect wsas from incr eased offroad vehicle use in norton v southern utah wilderness alliance 124 s ct 2373 2004 the us supreme court ruled that although the pr otection of wsas was mandatory it was programmatic duty and not the ty pe of discrete agency oblig ation that could be enforced under the administrative procedure act apa 5 usc 7061 also the court concluded that language cont ained in relevant flpma nd use plans indicating that wsas would be monitored constituted only management goals that might be modified by agency priorities and available funding and was not basis for enforcement under the apa therefore it appears that although blm actions that would harm wsas could be enjoined forcing the agency to take protective action is difficult release language release language national forests wilderness release language was developed in the context of statutes signating national forest wilderness areas6 the term refers to provisions that address how an agency is to manage areas that were found to have wilderness characteristics but were not legislatively designated as wilderness issues had arisen as to whether suitable areas not designated as wilderness had to be managed for nonwilderness uses or if some lands could conti nue to be managed in their natural state through the planning process such as for habitat or scenic values second issue was whether wilderness review was onetime event or if remaining roadless areas would again be reviewed as pa rt of the cyclical planning process compromise language expressly released nondesignated lands from the re quirement that the wilderness characteristics of such lands be protected during the development and implementation of subsequent forest management plans but also allowed such protection in plans release language also specified that remaining areas with wilderness characteristics would be reviewed again as part of the cyclical forest service planning process and new wilderness recommendations for possible inclusion of nds in the national system could be made at that time release language blm the issue of release differs somewhat for blm as noted above 603c of flpma require s the blm to maintain the wilderness character of wsas until congress has determined otherwise some form of release language would be one way of addressing manage ment of blm lands not designated as wilderness by congress seven statutes have been enacted with provisions releasing blm areas from the nonimpairment requirements of 603 c the release language in these statutes notes the adequacy of existing studies for meeting congressional needs under 603 of flpma and states that areas not designated as wilderness are not subject to the requirements of 603c to maintain their wilderness characteristics the provisions do not specify whether future wilderness reviews may occur as part of the blm inventory and planning processes under 201 and 202 rath er than 603 of flpma httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21917crs5 7 see for example srept 101359 at 16 1990 on the arizona wilderness designations and hrept 103498 at 56 1994 on the ca lifornia wilderness designations 8 the multipleuse sustainedyield act of 1960 governing national forest system lands expressly mentions administrative wilderness management 16 usc 529 but flpma does not however various uses such as fish and wildlife habitat primitive recreation scenic protection watershed protection areas of criti cal environmental concern permit maintaining blm lands in natural statethe blm release language does not clearly state the management congress intended for the areas not designated clearly they are longer subject to the nonimpairment requirements of 603c but cong ress did not state as it did with respect to the national forest lands that these released wsa lands could be managed to retain their wilderness characteristics through the planning process committee reports indicate that congress believed it had directed that released nds be managed for multiple use under flpma7 various uses are allowed under flpma that coul d result in maintainin g lands in natural state and 302 of the act directs the secret ary to prevent undue gradation of all public lands8 whether congress intended that the lands could either be developed or not as indicated through the planning process position similar to that enacted to resolve the same issue when it arose in the context of the national forests is matter of debate future blm wsas and wilderness reviews section 201 of flpma directs continuing inventories of blm lands and resources appropriate for the land use plans require d under 202 the imp indicates that these inventory and planning pro cesses could include creating and protecting wsas known as 202 wsas and that blm would also make future recommendations to congress in connection with them it is not clear how the recommendation process would work unlike the forest service which must revi its land and resource management plans at least every fifteen years 16 usc 1604f5 blm is not required to revise its plans on specified cycle blm is require d to revise its land and resource management plans when appropriate 43 u sc 1712a therefore th ere is definite planning revision cycle that would provi consistent opportunity to review blm lands for their possible suitability for wilderness designation recent events and changed administrative guidance the ambiguities surrounding blm wilderness i ssues have been heightened by recent events in 1996 following debate over add itional wilderness areas pr oposed in legislation for utah thensecretary of the interior babbitt used the 201 flpma inventory authority to identify an additional 26 million acres in utah as having wilderness qualities although the stated purpose of the inventor was only to ascertain which lands had wilderness characteristics the state of utah filed suit alleging various flaws in the process and that the inventory was illegal even unde r 201 the di strict court enjoined the inventory preliminarily but the 10th circuit remanded to the district court to dismiss on various grounds all but the cla im that related to facto wilderness management of the inventoried lands utah v babbitt 137 f 3d 1193 10th cir 1998 the department under secretary gale norton subsequently settled the case and on september 29 2003 issued new wilderness guidance instr uction memoranda n 2003274 and 2003275httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21917crs6 9 utah v norton 96cv870 dut 204 10 see crs report rl32142 highway rights of way on public lands rs 2477 and disclaimers of interest by pamela baldwinthese directives apply to blm lands nationwid except for alaska and certain categories of lands and state that 1 the 603 aut hority terminated following presidential recommendations in 1993 2 blm cannot conduc t further wilderness reviews 3 blm cannot administratively create more wsas under 603 or other authority and 4 the 603c nonimpairment standard cannot be applied to nonwsa lands the directives further indicate that protective management of remaining blm roadless areas can occur only through designation of lands as part of the planning process for uses that preserve their natural state such as areas of critical environmental concern critics disagree with these positions noting that wilderness guidance under all other administrations since 1978 carter reaga n bush and clinton allowed wilderness reviews designation of new 202 wsas nd wilderness recommendations as part of planning these issues are currently in litigation9 and their importance is accentuated by the emphasis of the current bush administr ation on energy development on the federal lands and by the promulga tion of new regulations on disclaimers of interest that may facilitate the validation of highway rightsofway in roadless areas thereby disqualifying additional lands from fu rther consideration10 legislation various bills are introduced in every congre ss to designate wilderness areas several would designate wilderness areas administe red by the blm but only two companion bills in the house and senate include release language for blm areas wilderness designation bills have been reported or passed in either chamber in the 108th congress bills have also been introduced in house in the 106th 107th and 108th congresses to place time limits on wilderness study area status hr 1153 in the 108th congress would terminate wsas 10 years after enactment or 10 years after establishment of new wsas regardless of which federal agency administers the area this would end the 603c protection for all existing blm wsas not designated as wilderness within 10 years of enactment the bill would also prohibit future wilderness reviews of all released wsas and would define wsa broadly po ssibly precluding subsequent 202 wilderness reviews and those in the national forests as well the house committee on resources reported bills in the 106th and 107th congresses but the bills did not see floor action action on this legislation has occurred in the 108th congress
