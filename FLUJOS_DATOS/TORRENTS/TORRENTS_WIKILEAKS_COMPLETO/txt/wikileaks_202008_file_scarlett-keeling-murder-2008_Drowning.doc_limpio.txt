picdrowning the law offices of kevin j mahoney pc pic picdeath by drowning drowning occurs when liquid enters the breathing passages preventing air from getting to the lungs this can take place in deep water such as an ocean or in water as shallow as six inches although drowning is sometimes used as method of homicide it is very difficult to determine the manner of death when victim is found in the water pichow drowning occurs when person is submerged under water obviously he holds his breath carbon dioxide increases and oxygen decreases until breaking point is reached the person involuntarily inhales and takes in water some is swallowed and the person may vomit the involuntary gasping for air continues for several minutes cerebral hypoxia continues until it becomes irreversible and death occurs the irreversibility begins after three to ten minutes in warm water however children and infants who are in cold water can be resuscitated after as long as 66 minutes whatever the temperature of the water all humans usually lose consciousness within three minutes hyperventilating causes decrease in carbon dioxide which leads to cerebral hypoxia therefore the person may lose consciousness before reaching the breaking point person is considered victim of near drowning if after being rescued from he survives for 24 hours after being submerged in water even if he dies shortly after or suffers brain damage 1015 of all drownings are considered dry drownings this takes place when small amount of water enters the larynx or trachea and causes spasm of the larynx the larynx becomes clogged by mucous foam and froth and water never even enters the lungs the concept of dry drownings is only hypothesis however and cannot be seen through an autopsy after death occurs the body sinks it will not move far unless it is carried by strong currents the body decomposes and gas forms causing it to rise to the surface where it is usually found in very cold water decomposition is delayed and the body may stay submerged for months pictests to determine drowning the diagnosis of drowning is based more on the circumstances of the death than on tests complete autopsy is done and if the person is found in water and other causes of death are discovered the examiner presumes the victim has drowned chemical tests are nonspecific and unreliable test that traditionally was used is the gettler chloride test where the amounts of chloride on each side of the heart were compared to determine if the person drowned in fresh or salt water another test uses the gravity of blood on the right and left atrias to determine if the person drowned neither test yields reliable results examiners also look for the presence of diatoms which are microscopic algae found in all types of water this test too is unreliable as diatoms can be found throughout the environment it is not uncommon for medical examiners to find diatoms in the organs of individuals who had not drowned one can obtain diatoms by inhaling or digesting them or by aspiration of water containing them picproblems with diagnosing drowning aside from the unreliability of tests it is hard to diagnose drowning based on the circumstances of the death alone people sometimes die of other causes such as drug overdose heart attack or epileptic seizure then fall into water also people can dispose of already dead bodies in water making it difficult to know how the person actually died occasionally there are suicides by drowning as well symptoms such as hemorrhages pulmonary edema washerwoman appearance of the hands and feet and goose flesh may indicate drowning however heart attacks drug overdoses and other causes of death can also cause the same symptoms wounds that do not bleed also do not help distinguish the manner of death because they could have been inflicted post or antemortem good indicator that the person was alive while submerged is the presence of vegetation and stones from the bottom of the water in the hands of the victim so difficult is it to determine the cause of death an innocent person could be prosecuted for murder for an accidental drowning or suicide picreferences dimaio vincent j and dominick forensic pathology second edition crc press new york 2001 geberth vernon j practical homicide investigation third edition crc press new york 1996 forensics virtual autopsy performed with multidetector computed tomography mdct can aid forensics teams in determining if person has drowned according to study published in the june issue of radiology mdct is comparable to conventional autopsy in demonstrating airway froth and sediment that are indicative of drowning our findings show that mdct can be used either to facilitate or reduce the need for conventional autopsy when drowning is the suspected cause of death said lead author angela d levy md from the department of radiology uniformed services university of the health sciences in bethesda md the determination of drowning as cause of death for body that is found in water is imperative in forensic investigation because becoming submerged in water may be secondary rather than primary event autopsy findings that support the diagnosis of drowning include but are not limited to frothy fluid in the airways or lungs hyperinflated and congested lungs and fluid in the paranasal sinuses or stomach there are some advantages to virtual autopsy compared to conventional autopsy in cases of suspicious death the procedure does not damage or destroy key forensic evidence as can happen during conventional autopsy in addition mdct can be used in situations where autopsy may not be feasible or is prohibited by religious beliefs however in most cases mdct would best be employed as an adjunct to routine autopsy dr levy and colleagues performed totalbody mdct exams on 28 consecutive male drowning victims and control group of 12 men who were victims of sudden death from coronary artery disease following mdct routine autopsies were performed mdct images were evaluated for the presence of fluid and sediment in the paranasal sinuses and airways fluid in the ear frothy fluid in the airways obscured groundglass appearance or thickening in the lungs and swelling fluid or sediment in the stomach images were then compared to autopsy reports and photographs mdct indicated that all of the drowning victims had fluid in the paranasal sinuses and ears and groundglass opacity in the lungs twentysix 93 percent had fluid in the subglottic below the vocal cords trachea and main bronchi fourteen 50 percent had sediment in the subglottic airways six 21 percent had frothy fluid in the airways and 25 89 percent had groundglass opacity and thickening in the lungs twentyfive 89 percent exhibited swelling of the stomach members of the control group had frothy fluid or sediment in the airways or sinuses 11 92 percent had subglottic airway tracheal and bronchial fluid all members of the control group exhibited collapsed stomachs autopsy results in these categories were similar to mdct results for both study groups airway froth and sediment can be demonstrated on mdct and were specific to drowning thereby replicating the findings seen at autopsy said dr levy based on this study mdct may provide support for the diagnosis of drowning when other causes of death have been excluded by limited autopsy or external examination of the body in addition mdct virtual autopsy may be useful as preautopsy triage tool in mass casualty scenarios more and more advanced imaging tools such as mdct are being applied to forensic investigations dr levy said in the future imaging in forensics may be just as important as imaging in clinical medicine article

accident reconstruction contact contact us online request form introduction medicolegal is the term which incorporates the basics of two sister professions ie medicine and law everybody talks about the law but few aside from lawyers judges and law teachers have more than the vaguest notion of what constitutes law the average layman often has about as much accurate information about the law as he has about medicineor life on venus and unfortunately two professional groups suffer from more ignorance of law and medicine than is good for them lawyers at least those who do not constantly deal with medical issues in their legal practice know very little about the medical profession and its problems physicians frequently comprehend too little about the law and how it affects them in the practice of their profession medico legal experts can provide link between these two professions for their smooth effective functioning in scientific manner the physician meets the law at every turn he confronts it when as the treating doctor he is subpoenaed as witness in personal injury lawsuit he meets it when his aid is sought as an expert in connection with claim that another member of his profession has been negligent and when he is faced in his office or clinic by narcotic addict man with gunshot wound or young couple seeking blood test he is facetoface with the law when he is required to render an aggravating array of governmental reports or to preserve physical evidence for the benefit of law enforcement agency the physician in fact finds great deal of the law intensely irritating often because he is not absolutely clear as to its purpose the following subjects deal with all the above aspects of law and medicine forensic medicine medical jurisprudence toxicology medical jurisprudence is the application of medical science to legal problems it is typically involved in cases concerning blood relationship mental illness injury or death resulting from violence autopsy is often used to determine the cause of death particularly in cases where foul play is suspected postmortem examination can determine not only the immediate agent of death eg gunshot wound poison but may also yield important contextual information such as how long the person has been dead which can help trace the killing forensic medicine has also become increasingly important in cases involving rape modern techniques use such specimens as semen blood and hair samples of the criminal found in the victims bodies which can be compared to the defendants genetic makeup through technique known as dna fingerprinting this technique may also be used to identify the body of victim the establishment of serious mental illness by licensed psychologist can be used in demonstrating incompetence to stand trial technique which may be used in the insanity defense albeit infrequently autopsy autopsy is the systematic examination of cadaver for study or for determining the cause of death autopsy means see for yourself it is special surgical operation performed by specially trained physicians on dead body its purpose is to learn the truth about the persons health during life and how the person really died autopsies also known as necropsies postmortems or postmortem examinations use many methodical procedures to determine the etiology and pathogenesis of diseases for epidemiologic purposes for establishment of genetic causes and for family counsel there are many advantages to getting an autopsy even when the law does not require it there is always something interesting for the family to know postmortems may be performed at the request of the authorities in cases of unexplained and suspicious death or where physician did not attend death in other circumstances postmortem examination may be performed only with the consent of the deceaseds family or with permission granted by the person himself before death these examinations are more frequently being used for the acquiring of organs and tissues for transplantation valuable medical information can be learned from postmortem examination legionnaires disease for example was discovered as result of autopsies and improved safety standards have resulted from the examination of the bodies of crash victims the autopsy deals with the particular illness as evidenced in one individual and is more than simply statistical average every autopsy is important to expose mistakes to delimit new diseases and new patterns of disease and to guide future studies morbidity and mortality statistics acquire accuracy and significance when based on careful autopsies the autopsy procedure itself has changed very little during the 20th century it is detailed examination of body and each of its part not only superficially but also through various tests on tissue in labs its purpose is to learn the truth about the persons health during life and how the person really died apparently autopsies are being performed with decreasing frequently where earlier in the century as many as half of all bodies had autopsies performed now only 510 percent of corpses undergo the procedure generally an autopsy is only done when there is some cause of doubt as to the cause of death although the family of the deceased can always request an autopsy even if the hospital doesnt think it necessary the first step is gross examination of the exterior for any abnormality or trauma and careful description of the interior of the body and its organs this is usually followed by further studies including microscopic examination of cells and tissues then the pathologist proceeds to the dissection which consists of removing and examining carefully all parts of the body dna fingerprinting dna fingerprinting or dna profiling or any of the several similar techniques for analyzing and comparing dna from separate sources are used especially in law enforcement to identify suspects from hair blood semen or other biological materials found at the scene of violent crime it depends on the fact that two people save identical twins have exactly the same dna sequence and that although only limited segments of persons dna are scrutinized in the procedure those segments will be statistically unique the dna samples of the culprit can be obtained from the scene of crime itself for example blood samples from scene of murder or samples of seminal fluids deposited on the clothes or furniture or in the body of the victim of rape can be used to acquire sample of the culprits dna these samples can be compared with those taken from possible suspect in the case dna evidence apart from its use in criminal law to determine the killer or the rapist is also employed for various other purposes amongst its varied applications paternity testing personal identification of mutilated body or skeletal remains study of the evolution of the human population and study of inherited diseases like alzheimers disease etc are included the success rate in solving complex cases in criminal law has greatly increased after the discovery and use of dna evidence technologies the introduction of dna evidence in the field of criminal law has particularly facilitated convictions in the matters involving the offence of rape prior to the use of dna evidence matters involving the offence of rape could be solved primarily by circumstantial evidence only it was very difficult for the victim of rape to prove the offence in the absence of either circumstantial evidence or an eyewitness which was very rare since the introduction of the dna evidence this has been greatly simplified first samples of the seminal fluids found at the scene of crime by the investigating officer are analysed if this is not available then samples of the seminal fluid are extracted from the victims body itself the dna from this sample is then compared with the dna sample taken from the accused if the report establishes that these samples match then this acts as evidence in the court proving rape as regards the offence of murder dna samples that are collected from the blood mucous saliva skin hair samples etc found on the crime scene are employed to extract the dna sample this provides for very effective technique to nail the culprit dna testing should be viewed against the fact that the growing citizen concern over crime is not merely about mounting statistics it is also over the detectives inability to solve many gruesome crimes the question that is often asked is how far the police are equipped to handle investigations using modern science and technology and how far does the current law of evidence in the country recognize evidence gathered from such tests there is more than trace of popular cynicism over police willingness to spurn third degree methods in favour of scientific investigation it is mainly in this context that many critics of police performance raise the issue of dna profiling frequently apart from its use to nail the culprit postconviction dna testing is also very effective method to exonerate the innocent the sophisticated technology makes it possible to obtain conclusive results in cases in which the previous testing had been inconclusive postconviction testing will be requested not only in cases in which the dna testing was never done but also in cases in which more refined technology may result in an indisputable answer the remarkable feature of dna is that individuals leave at least traces of it almost everywhere few of the everyday objects handled by us such as pens telephones mugs and keys are some of the things that require attention from crime investigator variety of offences such as murder rape armed robbery extortion and drug trafficking yield themselves to the application of dna collection and testing according to study by the national institute of justice nij of the united states justice department there are many unusual sources of dna evidence that need to be explored by an investigator these include saliva found on the flap of an envelope containing threat letter spittle collected from the sidewalk where suspect in sexual assault case was under surveillance and blood collected from bullet that had injured an assailant himself in case of murder collection of samples at scene of crime requires some skill and observance of basic rules of hygiene there are two dangers here one is that as in the case of hand fingerprints there is distinct possibility of several persons having left their dna behind in scene of crime the need therefore is to identify all visitors and collecting their samples also apart from those of the victimsuspect this assiduous process can try an officers patience secondly dna samples are extremely susceptible to contamination it is essential that the technicians collecting the sample adopt all precautions that surgeon would while performing critical surgery any slackness could render the entire operation wasteful and susceptible to easy picking of holes by the defense counsel during trial benefits of medical jurisprudence the introduction of medical jurisprudence has immensely benefited both the medical and the legal field of work better understanding and cooperation has resulted and has facilitated smoother working of both disciplines previously unsolvable cases are now solved with ease with the development of the field of medical jurisprudence it covers in its ambit the provision of evidence for wide range and scope of cases it can be used to determine the paternity of child and also be employed in determining the identity of human bodies which have been mutilated beyond recognition in accidents like bomb blasts factory explosions etc in the field of evidence laws it can be appropriated to solve cases involving murder rape etc medical jurisprudence techniques like autopsy can also be employed to discover important facts vital to the case after the person has died however despite their vast benefits to the field of law medical jurisprudential techniques are not treated as primary evidence till date the present indian evidence act continues to treat technical findings such as the results of dna tests as expert evidence this situation will continue till legislation is drafted and enacted by the parliament under section 45 of the indian evidence act 1872 it has been inter alia provided that when the court has to form an opinion upon point of science or art or as to identity of handwriting or finger impression the opinions upon the point of persons specially skilled in science or art or any question as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions are relevant facts and such persons are called experts the expression opinions upon point of science of persons specially skilled in science is capable of application to all future advances in science which enable an expert opinion on point due to the heavy misuse and lack of knowledge of the courts as regards scientific evidence they are hesitant in applying these techniques in order to determine whether scientific evidence is admissible the court may consider 1 whether the principle or technique has been or can be reliably tested 2 whether it has been subjected to peer review or publication 3 its known or potential rate of error 4 whether there are standards or organizations controlling the procedures of the technique 5 whether it is generally accepted by the community and 6 whether the technique was created or conducted independently of the litigation the situation appears hearty only as regards autopsy reports which have been given the status of documentary evidence under the indian evidence act the merit attached to them however remains subjective and varies from case to case the complete benefit of these medical jurisprudential techniques can be enjoyed only by an enactment recognizing these techniques as primary evidence giving it the credit it deserves pic picthe author can be reached at sneha_venkylegalserviceindiacom pic pic home contact us guest book objective disclaimer add link f q sitemap pic rape and indian law after having studied the case laws it is necessary to also study the definition of rape as given in the indian penal code 1860 as per section375 of ipc man is said to commit the offence of rape with woman under the following six circumstances 1 sexual intercourse against the victims will 2 without the victims consent 3 with her consent when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person that she may be interested in fear of death or hurt 4 with her consent when the man knows that he is not her husband 5 with her consent when at the time of giving such consent she was intoxicated or is suffering from unsoundness of mind and does not understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent 6 with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age further explanation provided to the section states that penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to constitute the offence of rape whereas the exception leaves out marital rape altogether if the wife is not under fifteen years of age impediments to justice in the present circumstances when offences against women are on the rise when young girls are raped by their doctors by presidential guards in broad daylight the definition of rape to be of any deterrence falls extremely inadequate it does not address forced penetration of objects and parts of the body into the vagina and anus and forced oral or anal intercourse it also does not recognize other forms of sexual assaults like protracted sexual assault by relatives marital rape etc as aggravated forms of rape this causes grave injustice to many victims in many cases of child rape the child has been penetrated through fingers or by objects or been force to perform oral or anal sex yet this is not considered rape by the courts adding to this is section 1554 of the evidence act which allows the victim to be questioned of her past sexual history which the defense uses to humiliate the victim in the courtroom one of the major obstacles in delivering justice in rape cases is the poor quality of investigations the reason behind this ranges from gender bias and corruption to the general inefficiency of the police in many cases the police have even refused to lodge the fir or have lodged incomplete fir the victims are not taken for prompt medical examination because in cases of rape or attempt to rape medical examination of the victim and of the accused soon after the incident often yields wealth of corroborative evidence therefore such an opportunity should not be lost by the police the manner in which some courts have interpreted the law or assessed the evidence has often proved to be an obstacle also inspite of supreme court judgments to the contrary lower court judges often insist on evidence of physical resistance or marks of injuries to hold that woman has not consented womans evidence without corroboration is not considered sufficient the long time that is taken to complete rape trial often by allowing senseless adjournments and the giving of evidence by the victim in the presence of the accused and the harsh cross examination in the court are some other major obstacles as observed by krishna iyer j in rafiques case13 when woman is ravished what is inflicted is not mere physical injury but the deep sense of some deathless shame judicial response to human rights cannot be blunted by legal bigotry therefore rape laws in order to be of great deterrence must have cooperative victim professional investigation diligent prosecution and an expeditious trial for otherwise it shall not be the law that fails but the applicants the process and application failure of law reflects the failure of the society to protect and serve huma
