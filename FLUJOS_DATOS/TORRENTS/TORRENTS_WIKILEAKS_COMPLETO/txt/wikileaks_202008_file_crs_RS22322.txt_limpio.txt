reconciliation instructions calling for tax cuts of 11 billion in fy2006 and 70 billion over five years congress began consideration of the taxreduction reconciliation legislation as 2005 drew to

those of s 2020 an important part of both the house and senatepassed bills was the extension of numerous temporary taxreducing provisions that are scheduled to expire at various times over the next several years although most of these extenders were the same in both plans there were some differences including extension of the increased alternative minimum tax amt exemption contained in the senate proposal but not the house bill and reduced rates for capital gains and dividends which were in the house measure but not the senate plan aside from the extenders the senate bill contained number of additional items not in the house plan including tax incentives for development in areas affected by recent hurricanes both tax benefits and reforms related to charitable contributions and revenueraising items in the area of tax shelters and elsewhere in addition on december 7 the house passed stand alone bills extending the increased amt exemption hr 4096 and providing disasterrelated tax benefits hr 4440 the disasterrelated bill was approved by the senate signed by the president and became pl 109135 but the senate did not act on hr 4096 on may 9 conference committee reached

reductions for two years and amt relief for one year many extenders however were not included in the package and are expected to be addressed in forthcoming legislation this report will be updated as legislative developments occur congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the figures in the budget resolution do not place an absolute limit on the tax cuts congress can pass for fy2006 or subsequent years for example the budget resolution itself called for total of 106 billion in tax cuts over five years the same amount proposed by president bush in his fy2006 budget proposal however the congressional budget resolution contains only 70 billion in its reconciliation instructions 11 billion for fy2006 tax cuts specified in the reconciliation instructions are protected from certain points of order under senate budget consideration rules if point of order is raised supermajority is required for passage thus as practical matter the 70 billion fiveyear and 11 billion fy2006 reconciliation figures may place constraint on the amount of tax cuts that are likely to be considered and may lead to tradeoffs between specific tax cuts or the adoption of revenueraising offsets large number of extended provisions were common to both the house and senate bills in most but not all cases the extensions carried through the end of 2006 some of the more prominent extensions in both bills were the alternative deduction for state and local sales taxes extended through httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22322 2006 in both measures the research and experimentation tax credit extended through 2006 in both measures the deduction for highereducation expenses extended through 2006 in the house proposal and 2009 in the senate plan the 15year depreciation recovery period for leasehold improvements and restaurants extended through 2006 in both proposals the work opportunity and welfaretowork tax credits extended through 2006 in both plans application of nonrefundable tax credits against the amt extended through 2006 in both proposals and the increased 100000 expensing tax benefit for small business investment extended by both measures through 2009 two prominent extensions that differed between the two proposals were the increased alternative minimum tax amt exclusion for individuals and reduced rates for capital gains and dividends the senate bill extended the amt exclusion for one year but did not extend the capital gains and dividend rate reductions the house bill extended the rate reductions for two years through 2010 but did not extend the amt exemption on december 7 however the house passed hr 4096 standalone bill extending the increased amt exemption due to the prominence of these two items some background information is useful the temporary tax cut for capital gains and dividends was enacted by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 jgtrra reduced the tax rate on both capital gains and dividends to 15 5 for income in the 15 and 10 regularincome brackets with complete elimination in 2008 however the reductions are temporary and are scheduled to expire on january 1 2009 absent congressional action the capital gains rate will revert to prior laws 20 rate 10 for income in the lowest brackets dividends will be taxed under the tax rates applicable to regular income which range from 10 to 35 but which are also scheduled to revert to 15 to 396 range in 2011 according to jct estimates twoyear extension of the reduced crs3 rates for capital gains and dividends will reduce revenue by an estimated 204 billion over five years and 508 billion over 10 years1 the context of the amt exemptions extension is this individuals generally pay either their amt or regular tax whichever is higher taxpayers tentative amt is partly dependent on flat exemption amount specified by law the value of the exemption is subject to erosion due to inflation and the growth of real income partly for this reason an increasing number of taxpayers are faced with the possibility of paying the amt rather than the regular tax beginning in 2001 congress enacted series of temporary increases in the exemption the most recent increase was provided by the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108121 under its terms the exemption is 58000 for couples and 40250 for individuals however the increase expires at the end of 2005 and absent congressional action in 2006 the exemption will revert to prior laws level of 45000 and 33750 for couples and individuals respectively aside from the extenders the senate bill contained number of additional items not in the house bill these included number of tax cuts for areas affected by the recent hurricanes set of provisions applying to charitable contributions and number of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22322 revenueraising provisions the disasterrelated provisions were generally more in the nature of development incentives for stricken areas than were the provisions of the katrina emergency tax relief act pl 10973 that congress enacted in september the earlier measure generally focused more on providing direct tax relief to individuals affected by the hurricanes providing for example more generous rules for deducting casualty losses and set of tax benefits for charitable giving the senate bill would generally have extended ketras scope to include victims of hurricanes rita and wilma in addition it contained package of tax benefits for development in the affected areas and included provisions such as bonus depreciation for investment in the gulf area and increased lowincome housing tax credits on december 7 the house passed stand alone bill hr 4440 containing set of disasterrelated tax benefits similar to those in the senate reconciliation package the disasterrelated bill was approved by the senate and signed by the president becoming pl 109135 the charityrelated items in the senate bill included both tax benefits and revenue raising measures the tax cuts included proposal that would have allowed taxfree withdrawals from iras if used for charitable purposes and provision to allow non itemizers to deduct charitable contributions in certain circumstances the proposal however would also have instituted minimum floor amount below which deduction is not permitted for itemizers revenueraising items in the charitable area included provisions intended to curtail the involvement of taxexempt organizations in tax shelters and the doubling of certain fines and penalties applicable to charitable organizations in terms of revenue impact the largest of the revenueraising items was codification of the economic substance doctrine that is aimed at suppressing corporate tax shelters other revenueraisers were additional measures designed to suppress the movement of uschartered parent corporations to lowtax countries corporate inversions or 1 oneyear extension that was dropped by the finance committee would reduce revenue by an estimated 117 billion over five years and 262 billion over 10 years crs4 expatriation and requirement that large oil companies that use the last in first out lifo method of inventory accounting revalue their inventories according to estimates by the joint committee on taxation jct the version of hr 4297 approved by the full senate on february 2 would have reduced revenue by 694 billion over five years by 495 billion over 10 years and 983 million in fy20062 the bill approved by the full senate differed slightly from the finance committee proposal the house bill was estimated to reduce revenue by 556 billion over five years 801 billion over 10 years and by 49 billion in fy20063 debate over reconciliation legislation focused in part on its specific provisions their fairness and their likely economic impact supporters of the tax cuts in general however in some cases cited philosophical reasons belief in low tax burdens in addition supporters linked the economys recovery from the 2001 recession to the tax cuts enacted in egtrra jgtrra and elsewhere arguing that the stimulus from the tax cuts helped make the slump shorter and less severe than it otherwise would have been it was argued that continuation of those cuts many of which will expire without congressional action is important to sustain economic growth4 opponents of the tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22322 cuts generally questioned the prudence of enacting tax cuts in time of budget deficits and also tend to be skeptical of the tax cuts beneficial economic effects5 the conference agreement on may 9 conference committee approved budget reconciliation tax bill hr 4297 the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 the president signed the bill on may 17 it became pl 109222 the measure extends both the dividend and capital gains reduction for two years and amt relief for one year and also extends the increased business expensing allowance the conference agreement however does not include most other extensions contained in the house and senate bills according to press reports the extensions not contained in hr 4297 will likely be addressed by subsequent legislation not included in the budget reconciliation process6 in addition the conference agreement does not contain the bulk of the revenueraising items contained 2 ibid p 7 3 us congress joint committee on taxation

the amt that was contained in both the house and senate bills though for different periods and the increased exemption amount the increased exemption is higher than those applicable to 2005 reflecting indexation for inflation the exemption amount is 62550 for joint returns and 42500 for single returns the extended dividendcapital gains tax cut applies to 2009 and 2010 the increased expensing
