religious activity particularly among the uighur nationality in the wake of the ptember 11 2001 terrorist attacks against the united states the potential for sinous c ooperation against global terrorism may bring changes in the policy calculations of us officials who may seek to downplay traditional us concerns in the interest of assuring prc cooperation despite shared sinous interests against terrorism it is not yet clear how much actual support the prc will be w illing or able to give the usled effort key problem for us policymakers is that the prc commonly makes distinction between terrorists who perform violent acts and separatists even those advocates that are entirely peaceful also the prc strongly prefers that global efforts such as the antiterrorism campaign be conducted through the auspices of the security council where it has voice and not purely through us unilateral effort or coalition of us allies beijing officials also may be cautious about app earing too proamerican political problem that working through auspices could mitigate also prc officials in the past have attempted to exact policy concessions from the united states such as on taiwan or tibet in exchange for their support fo r us initiatives the prc may attempt to condition its future support for the global anti terrorism campaign through these and other mechanisms linkage that would complicate us policies toward taiwan and the dalai lamas tibetan communityinexile
