sec tion 1115 demonstration waiver s total of 19 states3 plus the district of columbia have comprehe nsive demonstration waiv ers many of which extend coverage to certain groups of people who are not traditionally eligible for medicaid although the data are weak we know that those programs together cover at least five times the number of individuals covered through the seven abovedescribed programs4 in fact new yorks medicaid dem onstration program one covers almost twice the number of those covered in all of the above seven prog rams combined while most states have abandoned th eir stateonly programs to tablish demonstration waivers under medicaid and more recently schip the bove seven programs ve held on to the stateonly approaches and some of those have both stateonly program and waiver program in place this is likely to be because those states not wish to change program features in order to obtain federal approval under the demonstration waiver authority it remains to be seen if those programs can withstand budget environment that may make the matching payments available under dicaid and schip waivers relatively more attractive than the state flexibility
