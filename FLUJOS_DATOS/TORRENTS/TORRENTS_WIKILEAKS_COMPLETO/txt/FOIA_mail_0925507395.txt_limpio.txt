re gec paper john could you have quick look at this paragraph see below from the gec fasttrack paper i do not understand why co2doubling forcing for cm2 is cited see your original email at the end of this message as 326wm2 when i thought it was 3471wm2 im sure ive seen 3471wm2 cited elsewhere for hadcm2 mitchell john fb 3471 in longwave 326 when shortwave also taken into account unfortunately modellers do not always make clear how they have estimated their co2 forcing and b why the forcing curves in the plot william ingram sent show higher forcing in cm2 than cm3 by about 05wm2 when the co2doubling forcing is lower in cm2 cf cm3 mitchell john fb hadcm2 is 1year increase in co2 which is only approximately equivalent to is92a hadcm 3 is 95a in fact 95a i think differs only from in the conversion of the 92a emissions to concentrations so strictly speaking is not an emissions scenario as far as i know tom never did explain why his concentrations in 1995 were different form the ones jonathan and i derived using his 1992 model i think ch4 liffetimes and the co2 sink were the main factors is this solely due again to the difference between is92a and is95a concentrations and c why the globalmean warmings in cm2 and cm3 are quite similar when cm3 has higher sensitivity than cm2 33 to 25k over the next century and cm3 also has higher co2doubling forcing 374wm2 to 326wm2 or 347wm2 see surely this should lead to faster warming in cm3 cf cm2 mitchell john fb see above hadcm2 uses 1year increase in co2 which gives greater forcing than hadcm3 even after the effect of explicit trace gases is added in about 05wm2 by 2100 the greater climate sensitivity does not make as big difference as one would expect the difference in co2 forcing per doubling is not the issue the net forcing is and that has ben calculated taking the difference in co2 response into account m aybe i have misinterpreted something here thanks mike ______________ paragraph from gec paper in hadcm3 greenhouse gas concentrations were increased from their 1860 values up to present 1990 as observed and then following the ipcc emissions scenario is92a leggett et 1992 from 1990 to 2100 only one simulation was carried out the increase in radiative forcing during the twentyfirst century is very similar to hadcm2 being only 05 wm2 about 10 smaller by 2100 than in the hadcm2 experiment figure 2 note that the ratio of the increases in co2 concentration hadcm2hadcm3 is much greater than the ratio of the changes in radiative heating there is greater increase in heating in hadcm2 so greater increase in co2 is required to produce the same fractional increase in heating also because the heating due to doubling co2 in hadcm2 is less than in hadcm3 326 wm2 compared to 374 wm2 larger increase in co2 is required to give the same change in heating note also that the increase in forcing varies as the logarithm of the change in co2 concentration at 1454 090499 0100 you wrote hi mike 2xco2 hadcm2 326 wm2

paper john here is word 6 version of the gec paper you need to give two references gregory and mitchell 1998 and gordon et 1999 and check through the bits i have added see especially what i have worded about co2 concentrations in section 7 quite what we cite for hadcm3 im not sure it depends what the impacts people say about the sensitivity of their results to co2 concentrations i also have question in the text in section 5 for you figure 10 is not made yet i thought i would produce this intermodel comparison plot for the amazon given the interesting results we were getting there i will wait for your comments before sending it to martin and the other impacts people but i must do this by the 19th april at latest i think i understand where the various co2 numbers come from now regards mike at 1159 090499 0100 you wrote dear mike i think we have traced where the different co2 values have come from hadcm2 hadcm3 assumed correct assumed correct 2020s 441 470 457 434 2050s 565 590 574 528 2080s 731 770 712 638 the left hand hadcm2 value we think comes from sa90 peter cox will check the second hadcm2 value is notional i dont think the inconsistency between the the columns matters that much since there is correct hadcm2 value the hadcm3 values do matter the right hand side value is what was used in the model and what willaim took from the tom wigley as being the sar is95a values i do not know where these are publicaly available and i have asked dave griggs that if we use new scenarios eg sres in the tar they are publicly available and well documented the left hand column appears to be from the 1992 ipcc supplementthe annex by mitchell and gregory this used the then current uea enrgy balancecarbon cycle model to convert co2 emissions to concentrations i presume the discrepancy comes from changes to the carbon cycle model and anything elses affecting the conversion from emissions to concentrations unfortunately as far as i can tell the sar never refers to these or explains why the concentrations are different this could easily happen again the situation with the new sres scenarios to seems rather chaotic anad again they are emissions scenarios not concentration scenarios the initial gcm runs will use co2 concentrations from one particular model the tar may report probably will report different values since they will use different model the best thing is to talk to the people who set up the gcm run to find out exactly what was used in the model with best wishes john jfbmitchellmetogovuk hadley centre for climate prediction and research the

parrymlaolcom andrew white jfbmitchellmetogovuk gjjenkinsmetogovuk rnichollsmdxacuk subject hadcm3 co2 concentrations importance high dear fasttrackers in putting the scenario paper together for the gec issue john mitchell and i have come up with slightly different co2 concentrations for hadcm2 and hadcm3 to what we had earlier assumed these co2 concentrations will really have to appear in the scenario paper to be consistent with the gcm experiments given the differences from the values i think you have all used in the impacts work what significance does this have for your work hadcm2 hadcm3 assumed correct assumed correct 2020s 441 470 457 434 2050s 565 590 574 528 2080s 731 770 712 638 the difference is that the assumed hadcm2 concentrations are 2030ppmv too low while the assumed hadcm3 concentrations are 2070ppmv too high the assumed hadcm2 concentrations came from cox and friend they had already run hybrid with these concentrations before the ft work got under way so we adopted their values i cannot yet trace where the assumed hadcm3 concentrations came from but the correct values are what both john mitchell and the ipcc 1996 report have calculated for the is92a scenario your suggestions on how best to handle this inconsistency would be appreciated how big difference do these differences make to your impacts thanks mike dr mike hulme reader in climatology tel
