act pdufa i to give the food and drug administration fda revenue source fees paid by the pharmaceutical manufacturers to supplement not replace direct appropriations the impetus behind the 1992 law stemmed from the length of time between manufacturers submission of an fda new drug application nda or biologics license application bla and the agencys decision on approval or licensure fda had attributed the delay wh ich affected patient s and manufacturers to constraints on its ability to hire and support review sta ff congress reauthorized the user fee program in 1997 pdufa ii in 2002 pdufa iii nd most recently in 2007 pdufa iv as title i of the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 11085 congress intended pdufa to diminish the backlog of applications at fda and increasingly shorten the time from submi ssion to decision pdufa ii expanded the programs scope to include activities related to the investigational phases of new drugs development and to increase fda communications with industry and consumer groups pdufa iii again expanded the scope of authorized activ ities to include both preclinical development and threeyear postapproval period in keeping with the law fda has worked with the drug manufacturers to set pdufa performance goals which the secretary of health and human services hhs has submitted in letters to the chairs of the relevant congressional authorizing committees the secretary also submits annual performance and financial reports in crafting pdufa iv the most recent reauthorization the 110th congress addressed workload and compensation adju stments expanded the authorized range of safety activities to include development of data collection systems and analytic tools and enforcement of postapproval st udy labeling and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy requirements increased public communication requirements and authorized user fee for the advisory re view of prescription drug television ads the general view is that pdufa has succeeded fda has added review staff and reduced its review times at each r eauthorization however discussion returns to certain issues in the context of pdufa that also reflect broader fda concerns these include budget choices under limited resources including the relationship between direct appropriations and user fees the identification and amelioration of conflicts of interest when the regulated industry is major source of industry funding and the tension between making new drugs available to the public and ensuring that those drug s be safe and

was the third fiveyear extens ion of the original 1992 law since 1993 the program has enabled the food and drug administration fda to collect and use fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to review marketing applications concerning prescription drug and biological products the law intends those fees to supplement direct appropriati ons not replace them this most recent version of the user fee program often referred to as pdufa iv retains the basic structure and elements of the original pdufa like pdufa ii and pdufa iii pdufa iv addresses issues that had been either unn ecessary or unrecognized in earlier versions of the law the current authority expires october 1 2012 this report reviews the history the four pdufa authorizations as well as the issues concerning them it first

more scientists to review the drug applications that were coming in and the ones already backlogged in its files it had not received sufficient appropriations to hire them for decades fda had asked congress for permission to implement us er fees the pharmaceutical industry generally opposed them believing the funds might go into the treasury to reduce federal debt rather than help fund drug review the 1992 law became possible when fda and industry agreed on two steps performance goals setting target completion times for various review processes and the promise that these fees would supplem ent rather than replace funding that congress appropriated to fda those step s helped persuade industry groups the fees would reduce review times and gave fda the revenue source it had sought for over 20 years the prescription drug user fee act and its reauthorizations pdufa i congress first authorized fda to coll ect fees from pharmaceutical companies in 1992 with the prescription drug

treated the perapplication fee about 100000 fy1993 and over 1 million fy200816 as an acceptable cost relative to the estimated 10 million monthly cost of delay in the years immediately before pdufa was enacted meanwhile pdufa has enabled consumers to have quicker access to new drugs such quicker access however has raised concerns first critics ask whether pdufas emphasis on speed results in inade quate review second they ask whether the increase in industry funding might lead to undue i ndustry influence they are concerned that pdufa in the name of speed might lead fda to sacrifice

activities the review of manufacturer applications to market drugs and biologics and still directs majority of fees to those tasks it is widely assert ed that pdufa is responsible for what some observers view as an inappropriate budg et imbalance between fdas premarket drug review and its postmarket safety activities they point out how pdufa requirements the trigger requirements th at congressional appropriations for fdas review activities be maintained at leas t at 1992 levels nd congressional budget trends increasing fda responsibilities at relatively flat funding levels result in squeezing out of nonpdufa related pr ograms faced with losing fee revenue if pdufaauthorized activities decrease f da must prioritize its use of appropriated dollars to those activities critics say that nonpdufa ac tivities such as the review of generic drug applications therefore suffer in part to address this concern the congress has with each pdufa reauthorization extended the scope of covered activities the top and middle sections of figure 3 illustrate the five stages of drug development beginning with basic research and continuing th rough preclinical developmen t which could be

too much influence over fda acti ons they believe that by structuring industry participation into the setting of performance goals the law creates conflicts of interest this is compounded because th

preparation for each pdufa reauthorization to discuss workload nd revenue needed fda then submitted letter to the authorizing committees that presents performance goals for the following five years

inspections and generic drug reviewsinfluence on the management of fda res ources at the least those speculations could threaten confidence in fda reviews at the worst are the concerns of some that the fee system contri butes to quick and suboptimal reviews fda staff reports of pressure to meet performance goal deadlines suggest to some that safety and effectiveness data are being inadequately evaluated21 interaction with congressional appropriations decisions as previously noted user fees are an increasing part of fdas budget in fy2008 user fees contribute 242 of fda budget looking only at the agencys human drug program basically that is the center for drug evaluation and research and related activities of the office of regulatory affairs as in figure 1 and tables 2a and 2b in the appendix for fy2008 user fees contribute 484 of the drug programs budget not shown on the figure the fy2008 enacted budget for the human drug program shows user fees contributing 58 of the premarket activities total and 253 of the postmark et activities total22 fda relies on fee revenue for maintaining its expert science base via staff retention critics say that fda is becomin g too dependent on industry fees to carry out its normal review activities related concern is that the large percentage of fdas budget being covered by user f ees may undercut cong ressional s upport for increases in direct appropriations to the agency leaving aside some critics distrust of the pharmaceutical industrys motives other political and health analysts believe that drug application review is regulatory responsibility that the federa l government should shoulder completely they believe that rather than rely on user fees congress should appropriate the full amount necessary to support fda is its missi
