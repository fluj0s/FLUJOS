administration bpa the southeastern power administration sepa the southwestern power administration swpa and the we stern area power administration wapa each operating in distinct geographic area see figure 1 1 congressional interest in the pmas has included diverse issues such as rate setting cost and compliance associatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22564crs2 2 for example bpa purchases the entire output of the columbia generating station 1100 megawatt mw nuclear power plant in eastern washington 3 see httpwwwwapagovaboutfaqpmhtmwith the endangered species act pl 93205 16 usc 1531 et seq and questions of privatization of these federal agencies with minor exceptions2 these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams operated by the corps of engineers corps and the bureau of reclamation bor pmas must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives and sell their power at costbased rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles the pmas serve 60 million americans in 34 states3 in general the pmas came into being becau of the governments need to dispose of electric power produced by dams construc ted largely for irrigation flood control or other purposes and to promote small commun ity and farm electrification that is providing service to customers whom it woul d not have been profitable for private utility to serve though pmas were all created to market federal power and they share the common mission of providing electricity at costbased rates with preference to public customers each pma also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business they will be discussed in alphabetical order source derived from httpwwwwapagovregionspmadmaphtm note both wapa and swpa ma rket power in kansas bonneville power administration created by the bonneville project act of 1937 16 usc 832 just before the completion of two large dams in the paci fic northwest bonneville dam in 1938 and grand coulee dam in 1941

2005 available at httpwwwbpagovpowerplr egionaldialogue09122005_concept_paperpdfgeographical area bpa is on par with wapa which serves the largest area in the size of its transmission system the agency cons tructed and maintains approximately 75 of the high voltage transmission lines in th northwest system of over 15000 miles of transmission line and appr oximately 300 substations4 bpa differs from the other three pmas in that it is selffinanced it receives federal appropriations since passage of the federal columbia river transmission system act of 1974 16 usc 838 bpa covers its operating costs throug h power rates set to ensure repayment to the treasury of capital nd interest on funds used to construct the columbia river power system bpa also s permanent treasury borrowing authority which it may use for capital on large projects this money is also repaid with interest through power sales bpa borrowing author ity totals 445 billion through congressional allocations of 125 billion on th ree separate occasions nd final allocation of 700 million in 2003 the agency intends to use 461 million of its remaining borrowing authority in fy2007 and 538 million in fy20085 current issues two ongoing issues will likely affect the agency over the long term the first conflict over salmon recovery in the columbia and snake rivers centers around the operation of the dams that produce th electricity sold by bpa environmental fishing and tribal advocates have sued th federal government successfully arguing that the national marine fisherie s service nmfs biological opinion the regulatory document dictating operation of the dams to ensure survival of species listed as threatened and endangered under the endangered speci act pl 93205 16 usc 1531 et seq is inadequate to keep the thr eatened species from extinction in addition some parties argue that removing four dams on the snake river in washington is the only way to ensure survival of some salmon and steelhead species the final resolution of the lawsuit and the ultimate disposition of the snake river dams may not allow bpa to sell as much electricity which would likely increase the power rates second issue concerning bpa is the socalled regional dialogue the regional dialogue refers to the devel opment of plan to define bp as power supply and marketing role over the long term key elements of the plan are 20year contracts and tiered rate methodology for the period following fy2011 wh many of bpas current contracts will expire challenge in the regional dialogue is developing plan that is supported by bpas customers and that addresses such issues as service to public utilities service to direct service industries such as aluminum smelters benef its for residential and small farm customers of investorowned utilities and longterm cost controls6 southeastern powe r administration sepa is unique among the four pmas in two ways it is the smallest pma with just over 40 employees

selffunding provision receives annual appropriations and subsequently repays this funding through power revenues sepas fy2007 appropriation reque st was 65 million8 actual appropriations reflecting an acrossthe board rescission for the depar tment of energy were 64 million9 current issues sepa is contending with re duced generation from one of the dams whose power it markets the wolf creek dam corps project on the cumberland river in kentucky has had seepage problem since the late 1960s 309 million rehabilitation project is sche duled to run from 2006 to 2014 the corps of engineers has determined it necessary to reduce the water elevation behind the dam lowering power generation capability the dams powerhouse s capacity of 270 mw or roughly 8 of sepas total generating capacity10 southwestern power administration swpa serves over 100 preference custom er utilities with over 7 million enduse customers in the southcentral united stat the agency manages nearly 1400 miles of highvoltage transmission lines with 24 subs tations swpa return s revenues to the us treasury for repayment with interest of the federal investment in generation and transmission facilities and like sepa and wapa fo r repayment of annual appropriations11 swpa requested an appropriation of 304 milli on in the presidents fy2008 budget12 appropriations reflecting depar tment of energy acrosstheboard rescission were 302 million13 current issues swpa had been challenged by low water conditions recently it has rainbased water supply rather than one that is snowbased like the mountain snowpack water supply of wapa and bpa and sells power from comparatively small reservoir system which stores that water as of december 2006 the agency had been operating through 21 months of drought it was forced to call upon continuing fund in the summer of 2006 to cover the co st of power purchases brought about by droughtreduced generation tinued dryness in the area would keep swpa struggling to purchase the power allocated for delivery to its customers generation figures were closer to normal through the remainder of fy2007 and to date fy2008 generation has been better than the drought period as well14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22564crs5 14 continued pdfsswpa_octdec_update_2007pdf 15 see httpwwwhousegovlistpressmo08_emersonpr_060 620html and http wwwhouse

the continuing fund was initially denied by the office of management and budget omb and some members of congress felt omb had reinterpreted its policy in granting access to the fund15 continued drought could force swpa to request acce ss to the fund in fy2007 additionally proposal in the fy2008 congressional budget request would require all of the pmas except for bonnev ille to recover any expenditure from their continuing f unds from ratepayers within one year these issues may raise the same omb policy questions for the 110th congress western area power administration created by the department of energy organization act of 1977 pl 9591 wapa is the newest and largest of the pmas wapas service area covers 13 million square miles and its power transmitted by high voltage grid over 17000 miles long serves customers in 15 western states like the other pmas wapas electricity comes from federal dams opera ted by the corps and bor howeve r it also sells power provided by the international bounda ry and water commission and markets the united states 243 share 547 megawatts of the coalfire d navajo generating station in arizona in addition to the types of public bodies tr aditionally served as preference customers by the other pmas wapa has developed polic to give preference to native american tribes regardless of their utility status16 for fy2008 the agency made budget request of 2010 million17 actual appropriations reflecting an acrosstheboard rescission for the department of energy were 2289 million18 current issues an issue of importance to wapa is its role in relieving transmission congestion within its marketing area there are number of constrained transmission paths in the west whose limited capacity to transfer power may reduce the ability of utilities to serve electric loads on seasonal or ongoing basis examples are the main transmission link between northern and southern calif ornia called path 15 and the transmission corridor between southeastern wyoming and northeastern colorado known as tot 3 while wapa does not currently ve resources to fund construction of new lines or upgrades to these congestion points the agency is interested in working collaboratively with other affected parties to resolve the problems19 wapa has expertise in transmission design and construction planning land ac quisition and environmental assessments and may contribute these resources to transmission upgrade projects in the west under pl 110161 c ongress appropriate d approximately 30 million more than the administration requested for wapa c onstruction rehabilitati on and om fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22564crs6 20 us department of energy fy2006 congressional b udget request power marketing administrations vol 6 feb 2005 21 telephone discussion with jack dodd west ern area power administration assistant administrator power marketing liais on office washington dc on dec 4 2006in the presidents fy2006 budget request wapa sepa and swpa proposed an alternative to the current method of appr opriations that provides for their operating expenses the fy2006 budget proposal included plan to reclassify receipts to allow these pmas to fund their program directi on and their operation nd maintenance om expenses through offsetting collections also known as netze ro appropriations20 the pmas currently deposit receipts into the treasury and congress appropriates general treasury funds to the pmas for these expens reclassifying the pmas receipts in this way would make them discretionary budget items they are now mandatory putting them on the same side of the dger as pma appropriations21 an effect of this change may be reduction in reallocation of pma appropriations to other efforts because the subsequent incoming receipts would be reduced by s imilar amount congress did not agree to this change for fy2006 the proposal was not reported for fy2008 but renewed proposal to change to netzero appropriations pproach to pma operations funding may be an issue for the 110th congress
