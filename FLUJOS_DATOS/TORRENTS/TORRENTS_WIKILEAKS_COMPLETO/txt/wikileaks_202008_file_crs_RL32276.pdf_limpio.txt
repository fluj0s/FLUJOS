nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment c at requires signator parties to take measures to end torture within their territorial jurisdictions for purposes of the convention torture is defined as an extreme form of cruel and inhuman punishment committed under the color of law the c onvention allows for circumstances or emergencies where torture could be permitted additionally cat article 3 requires that state party expel return or extrad ite person to another country where there are substantial grounds to belie ve he would be subjected to torture cat article 3 does not expressly prohibit persons from being removed to countries where they would face cruel inhuman or degrading trea tment not rising to the level of torture the united states ratified cat subject to certain declarations reservations and understandings including that the conventi on was not selfexecuting and therefore required domestic implementing legislation to take effect in accordance with cat article 3 the united states enacted statutes and regulations to prohibit the transfer of aliens to countries where they would be tortured including the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 s ection 2340a of the united states criminal code and certain regulations implemented and enforced by the department of homeland security dhs the department of justice doj and the department of state these authorities which require th withholding or defe rral of the removal of an alien to country where he is more likely than not to be tortured generally provide aliens already residing within the united states greater degree of protection than aliens arriving to the united states who are deemed inadmissible on security or terrorismrelated grounds further in deci ding whether or not to remove an alien to particular country thes rules permit the considerati on of diplomatic assurances that an alien will not be tortured there nevertheless under us law the removal or extradition of all aliens from the united states must be consistent with us obligations under cat cat obligations concerning alien remova l have additional implications in cases of criminal and other deportable aliens the supreme courts ruling in zadvydas v davis suggests that certain aliens receiving protection under cat ca nnot be indefinitely detained raising the possibility that certain otherwisedeportable aliens could be released into the united states if cat protections make their removal impossible cat obligations also have impli cations for the practice of extraordinary renditions by which the us purportedl has transferred aliens suspected of terrorist activity to countries that possibly employ torture as means of

torture by government entities2 perhaps the most notable international agreement pr ohibiting the use of torture is the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading

severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflic ted on personby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of pub lic official or other person acting in an official capacity6 this definition does not include pain or suffering arising only from inherent in or incide ntal to lawful sanctions7 according to the state departments analysis of cat which was included in president reagans transmittal of the conve ntion to the senate for its advice and consent this definition was intended to be interpreted in relatively limited fashion corresponding to the common unders tanding of torture as an extreme practice which is universally condemned8 indeed cat article 16 further obligates signatory parties to take action to prevent other acts of cruel inhuman or degrading punishment which do not amount to acts of torture9 according to the state department this distinction reflected the belief by the drafters of cat that torture must be severe and that rough treatment such as police brutality while deplorable does not amount to tortu re for purposes of the convention10 further cat provides that offenses of torture require actual intent to cause severe pain and suffering an act that results in unanticip ated and unintended verity of pain and suffering is not torture fo r purposes of the convention11 in accordance with article 2 of the conve ntion parties agree to take effective legislative administrative judicial and other measures to prevent acts of torture from occurring within their territorial jurisdicti on further parties are required to ensure that all acts of torture as well as attempts to commit torture and complicity or participation in torture are criminal offenses subject to penalty12 importantly cat article 2 makes clear that exceptional circumstances whatsoever including state of war or any other public emerge ncy may be invoked to justify torture13 the state department has claimed that this explicit prohibition of all torture regardless of the circumstances was viewed by the drafters of cat as necessary if the convention is to have significant eff ect as public emergencies are commonly invoked as source of extraordinary pow ers or as justification for limiting fundamental rights and freedoms14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32276crs3 14 continued us executive branch appears to be that ca t does not

of their membership in particular race nationality or social or political group see immigration and naturalization act ina 101a42 208b 8 usc 1101a42 1158b applicants for protection under cat must prove that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured if removed to particular country proving that torture would more likely than not occur is more difficult standard to meet than proving that an applicants fear is wellfounded standard that only requires fear to be reasonable see ins v cardozafonseca 480 us 421 1987 in having higher burden of proof cat protection is similar to withholding removal on the basi s of prospective persecution cat protections and withholding of removal are also similar in th at neither form of relief grants the recipient or his immediate family legal foothold in the united states additionally torture is more particularized act than persecution however it is important to note that cat affords certain aliens broader protection than that provided by general asylum law an alien generally cannot receive asylum or withholding of removal if he inter alia 1 persecuted another person on account of the pe rsons social or political group membership 2 committed particularly serious crime maki ng him threat to the community or 3 is danger to the security of the united states see ina 208b2 8 usc 1158b2 on the other hand cat protections

obligations upon signatory parties with respect to their transfer of individuals to other count ries cat article 3 requires that state party expel return or extradite pers on to another country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he w ould be in danger of being subjected to torture15 in determining whether grounds exis t to believe an individual would be in danger of being subjected to torture state parties are require d to take into account all relevant considerations including where applicable the existence in the state concerned of consistent pa ttern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights16 the state department has interpreted the words where applicable to indicate that competent authorities must decide whether and to what extent these considerations are relevant factor in particular case17 cat article 3 does not expressly prohibit persons from being rem oved to countries where they would face cruel inhuman or degradin g treatment

applicant for nonremoval to demonstrate that there are substantial grounds to believe that he would be subject ed to torture if removed to the proposed country19 further the committee has interp reted the nonremoval provisions of article 3 to refer to both di rect and indirect removal to state where the individual concerned would likely be tortured meanin g that state cannot remove person to third

bound to article 16 to the extent that such cruel unusual and inhumane treatment or punishment was prohibited by the fifth eighth andor fourteenth amendments to the us constitution25 the united states also opted out of the disputesettlement provisions of cat article 3026 though it reserved the right to specifically agree to follow its provisions or any other arbitr ation procedure in resolving particular dispute as to the conventions application in providing its advice and consent to ca t the senate also provided detailed list of understandings concerni ng the scope of the conven tions definition of torture these understandings are generally reflect ed via the specific us laws and regulations implementing the convention importantly under us implementing legislation and regulations cat require ments are understood to apply to acts of torture committed by or at the acquiescence of public official or other person acting in an official capacity27 thus persons operating under the color of law do not necessarily need to directly engage in acts of torture to be culpable for them for public official to acquiesce to an act of torture that official must prior to the activity constituting torture have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity28 subsequent jurisprudence and administrative decisions have recognized that willful blindness by officials to torture may constitute acquiescence warranting protection under cat29 but acquiescence does not occur when government is aware of

the aliens designation as inad missible is based on nonconfidential information however the regional director has discretion to eith er conduct further examination of the alien concerning his

provided an aliens claims for protection under article 3 shall not be considered further by an immigration judge the board of immigration appeals or an asylum officer and the alien may be removed72 in 2008 federal district cour t held that immigration authorities reliance upon diplomatic assura nces to effectuate the re moval of an alien who has shown likelihood of facing torture is subj ect to judicial review pursuant to farra and the due process clause of the fifth amendment73 it should be noted that cat article 3 provides little guidance as to the application of diplomatic assu rances to decisions as to whether to remove an alien to designated country while article 3 obligates signatory pa rties to take into account the proposed receiving states human rights record it requires the proposed sending state take into account all relevant cons iderations when assessing whether to remove an individual to the proposed receiving state74 further article 3 does not provide guidelines for how these consider ations should be weig hed in determining whether substantial grounds exist to believe an alien would be tortured in the proposed receiving state accordingly it does not necessarily appear that the use of diplomatic assurances by the us c onflicts with its obligations under cat however the united states has an oblig ation under customary international law to execute its convention obligations in good faith75 and is therefore required under international law to exercise appropria discretion in its use of diplomatic assurances it could be argued for exam ple that if country demonstrated consistent pattern of acting in manner contrary to its diplomatic assurances to the united states the united states would need to look beyond the face of these assurances before permitting transfer to that country for its part the cat committee has opined that diplomatic assurances that provide mechanism for enforcement do not adequately protect agains t the risk of torture and therefore do not absolve the sending country of its responsibility under cat article 376 in 2006 the committee recommended that the united states establish and implement

decisions on extradition are presented to the secretary of state following fugitive being found extraditabl by united states judicial officer78 in cases where torture allegations are made or otherwise brought to the state departments attention appropriate department officers are required to review relevant information and prepare for the secretary recommendation as to whether or not to extradite and whether to surrender the fugitive subject to certain conditions79 as with us regulations concerning the deportation of aliens regulations concerning the extradition of fugitives reflect cat requirements before permitting the extradition of person to another count ry the state departme nt must determine whether the person facing extradition is more likely than not to be tortured in the requesting state if extradited80 for the purpose of determining whether such grounds exist the state department must take into account all rele vant considerations including where applicable the existence in the state concerned of consistent pattern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights81 one consideration presumably taken into account are any dipl omatic assurances obtained from the state requesting extradition extraditions are prohibited in cases where the state department concludes that it is more likely than not that the person facing extradition would be tortured82

torture outside the united states are genera lly subject to the same penalties faced by those who commit or attempt to commit acts of torture except that they cannot receive the death penalty87 the united states claims jurisdiction over these prohibited actions when 1 the alleged offe nder is national of the united states or 2 the alleged offender is present in the united states irrespective of

on us alien detention policy the provisions of cat article 3 appear to protect all individuals from removal to state where they are likely to be tortured regardless of whether these individuals

aliens ie arriving aliens who have not been granted legal entry also could not be indefinitely detain ed though the courts holding in this case was based on statutor construction of the ina rather than belief that inadmissible aliens were accorded the same due process protections as deportable aliens91 it is important to note however that despite generally rejecting the practice of indefinite detention the zadvydas court nevertheless sugge sted that indefinite detention of particular aliens might be warranted in limited cases where the alien was specially dangerous92 though the court only specifically mentioned mental illness as special circumstance perhaps warranting indefinite detention93 it appears that aliens detained on security or related grounds such as terrorists might also be

percent of criminal aliens who have received cat protection ve been released from custody following final order of removal101 however given the courts ruling in zadvydas and subsequent jurisprudence suggesting that the use of indefinite detention may be severely limited as well as the growing number of aliens who have been granted deferral of removal under cat102 the magnitude of this potential obstacle to alien removal may increase over time it is important to note that cat only prohibits signatory parties from expelling persons to states where they would likely to be tortured it does not provide aliens with protection from removal to states where they would not be tortured even if such aliens would face cruel inhum an or degrading treatment not rising to the level of torture reaching agreements with countries to permit th removal of criminal aliens to these countries possibly for the purpos of prosecuting them subject to the condition that they will not be tortured or perhaps face other harsh forms of treatment could be one possible met hod for handling this potential problem although it is unclear whether other states would be receptive to such agreements
