the bulk of base realignment and closure brac costs funding for rebuilding parts of the pentagon destroyed in the terrorist attack of september 11 2001 is likely to be included in military construction appropriations preliminary estimates of the total cost vary from 100 million to 1 billion part of the emergency funding legislation hr 2888 pl 10738 passed by congress friday september 14 will be allocated for this rebuilding to date 1734 million in contracts have been awarded for emergency structural assessment repair and restoration to the pentagon with provision for additional awards at 60day intervals on june 27 the administration submitted 3435 billion amended fy2002 defense budget request 100 billion of this is intended for military construction of that amount 46 billion is intended for the active services and dod 06 billion for the national guard and reserves 41 billion for construction and operation of military family housing 02 billion for the nato security investment program and 05 billion for brac separate versions of appropriations bills both granting 105 billion in new budget authority have been passed by congress hr 2904 and s 1460 key issue in congress is funding for quality of life construction military work facilities particularly those overseas and those by the national guard and reserves are perceived by many as being deteriorated and underfunded recently congress has often appropriated more in construction funds than the administration has requested congress has similarly augmented budget requests for military family housing appropriations the fy2002 military construction bill exceeds the requested amount by 53 an additional key issue is the future of the efficient facilities initiative efi dod recommended legislation on august 3 to initiate worldwide assessment of military installatio n requirements based on the results of the current quadrennial defense review and subsequent round of base closures and realignments the legislation as submitted would permanently authorize the service secretaries to convey base property to local or state government or private enterprise and lease back what is necessary for military use this is modeled on demonstration project begun during fy2000 at brooks air force base texas if enacted the efi is likely to affect the future need for military construction and operations and maintenance funding other issues include the provision of construction contingency funds in budget requests to enable uninterrupted construction an understanding of the total costs of dod real

military construction appropriations and defense authorization bills the department of defense dod manages the worlds largest dedicated infrastructure covering more than 40000 square miles of land and physical plant worth more than 500 billion the military construction appropriations bill provides large part of the funding to enhance and maintain this infrastructure the bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army navy and marine corps air force and their reserve components additional defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program formerly known as the nato infrastructure program and military family housing operations and construction1 the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure brac account which finances most base realignment and closure costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31010crs2 2 see crs report rl31005 appropriations and authorization for fy2002 defense by amy belasco mary tyszkiewicz and stephen daggett for details on the defense authorization and appropriation process including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmental cleanup at closing sites the military construction appropriations bill is one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense other major appropriation legislation includes the defense appropriations bill which provides funds for all non construction military activities of the department of defense and constitutes more than 90 of national securityrelated spending and the energy and water development appropriations bill which provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy and for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers two other appropri ations bills vahudindependent agencies and commercejusticestate also include small amounts for national defense2 the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all of the activities in the defense appropriation measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriatio ns bills intertwine this report includes salient parts of the authorization bill in its discussion of the military construction appropriation process the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s and early 1960s when congress funded large defense infrastructure buildup precipitated by the heightened security threat posed by the soviet union defense construction spending soared as facilities were hardened against potential nuclear attack missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity and the separate military construction bill was created the first standalone military construction bill was written for fy1959 pl 85852 previously military construction funding was provided through annual defense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance and minor construction accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recreationrelated facilities are partially provided through proceeds of commissaries recreation user fees and other nonappropriated income most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year military construction appropriations though are an exception because of the longterm nature of construction projects these funds can generally be obligated for up to five fiscal years reflecting the longterm nature of capital building programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31010crs3 3 the facility replacement rate measures the time required to replace all existing dod facilities if spending is maintained at the rate set in the billconsideration of the military construction budget starts when the presidents budget is delivered to congress each year usually in early february this year is unusual though because the president did not submit his amended dod fy2002 budget request until june 27 2001 status table 1 shows the key legislative steps necessary for the

bill for the president key policy issues elective quality of life construction budget actions affect service member perceptions of the quality of military life through its impact on matters such as pay and benefits health care deployment schedules and the like in recent years quality of life including the use of military construction funds has been focus of the defense debate recent committee attention has focused on improvements to housing workplaces and installation infrastructure such as water sewer and electricity systems through both new construction and improved operations and maintenance of existing facilities subcommittee hearings have discussed at length the application of military construction funds to housing and workplace improvements at bases overseas and within the continental united states efforts to leverage appropriated funds through the partial privatization of military housing and installation utility services have also been subjected to protracted dialogue in committee hearings for an indepth discussion of the privatization of housing see crs report rl31039 military housing privatization initiative background and issues by daniel h else requested congressional additions to the military construction budget in recent years some analysts have criticized the military construction appropriations process for being prone to the insertion of unwanted and unnecessary undertakings others though have supported the addition of construction projects not requested by the department of defense as being necessary for military viability an historical comparison shows that the divergence between dod budget requests and congressional appropriation enactments originated relatively recently and has mainly affected the less than 20 of military construction funding dedicated to the national guard and reserves see table 5 at the end of this report military construction funding since the mid 1980s can be broken into three distinct periods prior to fiscal year 1989 fiscal years 1989 1994 and fiscal year 1995 to the present before fy1989 the relationship between funding requested by the administr ation and budget authority enacted by congress appeared stable congress typically appropriated approximately 80 of dod requests for military construction funds beginning with fy1989 regular ie active duty component funding continued in the established pattern but reserve component requests which include the federal reserves and the army and air national guard took sudden and sharp downturn see figures 1 and 2 congress responded by

requested and appropriated for brac fell sharply from high of 3898 million for fy1996 to low of 664 million for fy2000 as closure and realignment wound down4 the cost of environmental remediation contributed to 1024 million fy2001 brac appropriation of which 865 million was dedicated to base environmental cleanup members of the senate appropriations and armed services committees in hearings held few days after the submissi on of the presidents amended fy2002 budget request noted that department of defense had requested only 532 million in brac funds at time when the navy and air force had announced combined shortfall of between 140 million and 150 million in immediate brac cleanup needs5 dod witnesses responded by indicating that the request would be sufficient for upcoming requirements explaining that the shortfall estimates had been based on set of assumptions that were longer thought to be accurate the upturn in expenditures had come about through recent legal requirements and agreements between the services and local communities dod expected the insufficiency to be satisfied through transfers of unused funds from other accounts and by adjustments in the enduse of some property that would significantly reduce the cost of needed remediation the passed bill added more than 100 million in brac funds to the request primarily for remediation of the environmental impact of the 1995 round of base realignments and closures the efficient facilities initiative efi the efficient facilities initiative efi was announced by the department of defense on august 2 and the departments general counsel submitted proposed legislation to congress on august 3 the efi includes three major actions the potential realignment and closure of us military installations overseas the potential realignment and closure of installations within the united states and the permanent authorization of the brooks air force base development demonstration project expanded to include all military services in support of the first action the secretary of defense has instructed the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to undertake thorough assessment of all overseas military installations based on the results of the upcoming quadrennial defense review qdr his recommendations on the retention realignment or closing of bases are due to the secretary six

httpslibrabrooksafmilbrooksbaseinfo_inhtml sicsecretarys recommendations for submission to the president and congress both of these differ somewhat from the brac process of the 1990s6 for an understanding of the third action one must look to recent activity at brooks air force base texas the brooks air force base development demonstration project also known as the base efficiency project or the brooks citybase project is partnership between the secretary of the air force and the city of san antonio texas and represents an alternative to traditional base closings or realignments congress has authorized the secretary to convert any military or civil service appropriated or nonappropriated fund activity at brooks air force base texas into contracted activity or an exchange of services compensated for by the lease sale conveyance or transfer of real or private property7 this has empowered the secretary to convey in exchange for appropriate compensation the whole of federal real property at brooks to the city and to lease back for military use those parts which directly support the bases military mission8 the cost of maintaining and operating the facilitys physical plant including fire and police protection upkeep and the like is effectively transferred along with ownershi p from the department of defense to the local community funds generated from the lease or sale of property reimbursements and so on is placed in special project fund which the secretary of the air force may employ for operations leaseback maintenan ce and repair of department facilities and other uses at brooks9 efi proponents have maintained that conducting single definitive round of base closures and realignments could relieve communities of uncertainty about their future proponents further contend that review commission with restricted ability to change the secretary of defenses recommendations might reduce the potential for politics to influence its outcome and that joining the military departments with local and state governments and private enterprise could significantly reduce the need for military construction and defense appropriat ions critics though have suggested that the selection of the commissions members and the method used for creating the list of recommendations may actually repoliticize the brac process and have asserted that benefits to the defense budget accrued to date from the brooks project are hypothetical real property costs the broader picture with military construction comes maintenance plant maintenance adequately funded and conscientiously carried out prevents deterioration and reduces the need for replacement as facility ages though it tends to demand greater effort and expense to maintain it in

the funding forreal property maintenance rpm is contained within the operations and maintenance function of the defense budget which falls within the jurisdiction of the defense subcommittees of the appropriations committees10 figure 3 gives graphic representation of the relative sizes of the military construction and rpm appropriations for fy2001 rpm funding includes not only repairs and maintenance for existing structures but also minor construction projects whose costs do not exceed 500000 the fy2001 defense budget request included 53256 million for real property maintenance and repair and 2511 million for minor construction even that total does not capture the full cost incurred in maintaining dod real property to gain more complete picture one should add items not easily broken out from the general budget submission such as the pay and benefits of military personnel assigned to rpm activities installation maintenance for example projects financed through dod working capital funds and construction supported through dod research development test and evaluation rdte appropriations11 therefore the final cost to the department of defense of building maintaining and operating its holdings in real property is extremely difficult to capture in its entiretyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31010crs9 12 these and subsequent quotations for military construction exclude

and construction funding overall administration proposals for military construction funding have fallen in nearly every year since the mid1980s nevertheless until the mid1990s congress consistently granted significantly less budget authority to the department of defense than had been requested by the administration see figure 4 this pattern of partial funding reversed with the fy1995 budget the administrations fy1994 military construction budget request was 4007 million while congress authorized 37879 million12 the fy1995 request fell to 22402 million to which congress added 4319 million13 every year since then congress has added significant amounts to the administration requests countering what members have termed inadequate funding for military construction three related explanations have been given for recent congressional actions first some members of the military construction subcommittees have argued that military construction has been chronically underfunded this viewpoint
