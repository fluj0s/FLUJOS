petitioned the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to review the fccs oct ober 2004 ro and 2006 moo in its brief the arrl contends among other things th at the fccs actions in adopting rules to govern unlicensed bpl systems fundamentally alter the long standing rights of radio spectrum licensees including amateur ra dio operators in april 2008 the court remanded the rules to the commission in january 2007 represen tative mike ross introduced hr 462 the emergency amateur radio interference protection act which would require the fcc to conduct study on the interference caused by broadband internet transmission over powerlines the bill was referred to the committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet on february 2 2007 further action has been taken in june 2007 senator mark pryor introduced s 1629 which contains the same st udy requirements as hr 462 that bill was referred to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation in august 2007 the house of representatives passed hr 3221 the new direction for energy independence nationa l security and consumer protection act if signed into law section 9113a8 would require an assessment by newly established grid modernization commission to determine bia nnually the progress being made toward modernizing the electric system including an assessment of ancillary benefits to other economic sectors or activities be yond the electricity sector such as potential broadband service over power lines in october 2007 the national tel ecommunications and information administration ntia

throughout the nation both in expanding the geographic availability of such services eg into rural as well as more urban areas as well as expanding the service choices available to consumers eg promoting additional service options at reasonable prices the telephone cab and satel lite i ndustries and more recently the electric utilities all provide broadband services to consumers electric utilities have long had the ability to send communications over their powerlines through what is called powerline communications plc technology but that capability was used primarily to maintain the

significant role in increasing the competitive landscape of the electric utility and telecommunications industry as well as making broadband available to more americans than ever before bpl howev er like any technology has its advantages and disadvantages for example bpl in general is less expensive to deploy than the cable and telephone comp anies broadband offerings because it does not require upgrades to the actual electric grid and is not limited by certain technical constraints of its competitors specifically the tele phone companies broadba nd service digital subscriber line dsl is limited to consum ers within 18000 feet of central office unless expensive remote equipment is placed close to the customer cable companies while not limited by the same distance restrictions as the

servi ce with dialup connection required to send data to the internet however critics of bpl have expressed concern that it will interfere with licensed radio spectrum such as amateur radio government and emerge ncy response frequencies companies both in the united states and abroad have pilot tested bpl and many are now deploying it commercially for example in 2004 manassas va began testing bpl service and became the first us community with commercial bpl offering7 the service is now being used by roughly 1000 of the 12500 households in the manassas area howeve r in manassas as well as in other areas where bpl is being deployed there have been some concerns and difficulties for example amateur radio operators have stated their concern that bpl will interfere with their radio signals8 efforts are being made by industr and government to address these concerns while still continuing bpl deployment in addition to providing new choices for consumers and increased competition in the broadband market bpl can provide other benefits both to the electric utilities and to others as tests and commercial deployments continue the electric utilities can capitalize on their existing relationships with consumers and the ubiquity of their networks also bpl can be sold either as retail service under the electric utilitys brand or as wholesale service to thir dparty isps offeri ng smaller broadband providers another wire to the customer and electric utilities have expressed interest in providing such open access on wholesale basis9 concerns among electric utilities and investors about bpl deployment do remain however although the pilot sts and limited commercia l deployments have thus far proven successful the viability of largescale commercial implementation remains unproven also while name recognition will help the electric utilities as they roll out their service there is also concern that they may have an unfair competitive advantage over smaller less established providers in this casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32421crs4 10 the first wave of bpl rollouts doesnt pose much of threat to the comcasts and verizons of the industry which boast millions of

broadband providers the tele phone and cable companies10 finally although bpl is likely to be deployed further out into rural areas than either cable or dsl it remains to be seen if bpl is as economical to deploy in those areas as policymakers and rural consumers hope the fcc opened rulemaking proceeding on the technical issues related to bpl deployment in february 2004 and adopted report and order on the proceeding in october 2004 see regulatory activity federal communications commission page 6 congress may wish to monitor how the fcc implements the rules that will guide bpl

categories of issues are discussed in detail at th end of this report see issues for congress stakeholders in addition to marketplace competitors nd consumers the key stakeholders in this issue are the bpl industr amateur radio operators re presented primarily by the american radio relay league arrl and various government entities in favor of bpl deployment and the f ccs rules is the bpl

trade associations involved include the edison electric institute the powerline communications association plca the plc forum united power line council uplc and the united telecom council utc11 these groups have financial stake in bringing bpl successfully to market and are eager to enter the broadband business amateur radio users have expressed opposition to bpl deployment because of concerns over its potential negative impact specifically interference on amateur radio frequencies by bpl emissions although some of its concerns had been addressed in the bpl report and or der the arrl rema

of 1996 pl 104 104 110 stat 56 1996in addition to the abovementioned groups several governme nt entities have an interest in how bpl is deployed sp ecifically local and regional emergency responders the department of defense the federal emergency management agency now part of the department of homeland security and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia within the department of commerce have expressed both concer n and support for bpl although these groups express concerns similar to thos of arrl namely that bpl could potentially interfere with emergency communi cations and steps need to be taken to ensure noninterference they also expre ss support for bpl because they believe it will contribute to more secure and bettermanaged electric transmission and distribution network13 the ntia expresses support for bpl because of its potential to further close the digital divide14 one of its major goals further because of the services that can be offered over bpl eg voice over internet protocol voip the law enforcement community is also concerne d about the regulatory treatment of bpl specifically whether bpl services should be subject to federal wiretap requirements set forth in the communica tions assistance for law enforcement act calea the fcc has the largest role in how bpl will be deployed it not only is the regulatory agency that developed the rule s governing bpl it also has statutory obligation under section 706 of the teleco mmunications act of 1996 to encourage the deployment on reasonable and timely basis of advanced

decision in the matter on april 25 200825 finding that during its rulemaking process the fcc relied on five scientific studies that measured bpl devices radio emissions in an attempt to determine interference risks with other users of the spectrum although the agency re leased those studies during public comment proce ss required by federal law it redacted portions of them arguing they were just internal communications that didnt influence its deliberations but after reviewing the unredacted studies in private the majority of the judges agreed with the arrl that it was against federal administrative procedure law to keep those portions under wraps par ticularly since they could call the fccs rules into question the court also said the fcc had not ffered reasoned explanation for why it rejected arrlsubmitted data that could have influenced its interference estimates and potentially reshaped its rules the judges opted to send the rules back to the fcc with instructions to clarify those points and publicize its studies more fully although they did not overturn the rules themselves the court did not side entirely with the arrl on other key poi nts related to the substance of the rules for instance the arrl had argued that the fcc was departing from longstanding agency precedent by refusing to require that bpl operations found to cause harmful inte rference be shut down

spectrum from harmful interference 47 cfr section 15 36 ntia report pp 57 37 ibidthe fccs noi the ntia described federa l government usage of the 1780 mhz spectrum identified associated interference concerns and outlined the studies it planned to conduct to addr ess those concerns the re port 1 contains findings on interference risks to radio reception in the immediate vicinity of overhead power lines used by bpl systems access bpl onl 2 suggests means for reducing these risks and 3 identifies techniques fo r mitigating interference should it occur34 one of the most important findings of the report was that existing part 15 compliance measurement procedures for bpl tended to signif icantly underestimate bpl peak field strength35 such underestimation increases the risk of interference according the report as currently applied to bpl systems part 15 measurement guidelines do not address the unique charact eristics of bpl emissions overall the report concludes that bpl c ould interfere with licensed radio spectrum even though under the current part 15 tes ting parameters mission levels would be within the limits therefore it was recommended that the compliance measurement procedures be refined the ntia stated however that refining the compliance measurement procedures should not impede deployme nt of bpl because the technology can reportedly be deployed within more narrow range of frequencies that will not cause interference36 for these reasons the ntia did not recommend that the fcc relax part 15 field strength limits for bpl systems instead ntia recommended new measurement provisions derived from ex isting guidelines including using measurement antenna heights near the height of power lines measuring at uniform distance of 10 meters from the bpl device and power lines and measuring using calibrated rod antenna or loop antenna in connection with appropriate factors relating magnetic and electric field stre ngth levels at fre quencies below 30 mhz37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32421crs12 38 ibid 39 although electric utility entry into telecommunications is addressed in the 1996 act issues dealing primarily with electric utility regulation are beyond the scope of this report for more information on those issues see crs report rl32728 electric utility regulatory reform issues for the 109th congress by amy abeloverall ntia supported the continued development and deployment of bpl and suggested several means by which bpl interference could be prevented or eliminated for example mandatory registration of certain aspects of bpl systems would give radio operators the information needed to advise bpl operators of any anticipated interference problems or suspected actual interference ntia also recommended that bpl devel opers consider for example routinely using the minimum output power needed from each bpl device avoiding locally used radio frequencies using filters and terminations to extinguish bpl signals on power lines where they are not needed and carefully selecting bpl signal frequencies to decrease radiation38 issues for congress issues potentially of interest to congress may be divided into three categories industry and societal issues such as the impact of bpl oncompetition in broadband services and the potential for bpl to reach previously unserved and underserved populations larger regulatory and industry governance issues such as how the regulatory classification of bpl might affect other fcc regulations and proceedings eg the appropriate regulatory classification of ip based services and electric utility regulations eg reliability mandates federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulations and public utility holding company act puhca exemptions39 technical issues such as how bpl should be implemented to minimize interference with other services eg amateur radio frequencies and what effect bp l technology may have on reliability and security of the transmission and distribution systems and homeland security goals ie bpl may result in benefits as well as risks each issue is discussed below industry competition and societal issues since the passage of the 1996 telecomm unications act congress has sought to increase both competition between broadband service providers as well as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32421crs13 40 as mentioned above the fcc has mandate under section 706 of the 1996 act to promote broadband deployment 41 according to pew internet project repor t issued in april 2004 availability can figure into broadband adoption in two ways firs t the physical infrastructure to provide broadband is an obvious prerequisite to having service second the availability of multiple providers may matter as the existence of some competition in the market may be conducive to adoption among consumers with respect to broadband infrastructure 77 of americans say they live in an area in which broadband is available 8 said they do not live in an area where broadband is available and 15 say they do not know this compares with 71 of americans who said in october 2002 that broadband is available where they live 12 who said it was not available and 17 who did not know of those who live in place where they say broadband is not available 54 say they would like to get it higher than the 40 average for dialup users when asked whether there is more than one broadband provider in their area 61 of those who have broadband or know it is available said multiple providers serve their area one in six 17 said one provider serves their area and 22 did not know broadband users who lived in areas with multiple service providers said they paid 3850 per month for service while those who said they had one option for service paid an average of 4280 per month pew

competition between cable and dsl providers both policymakers and consumers alike would likely welcome third wides pread facilities based option for receiving that service satellite broadband service is not widely available as it usually requires dialup uplink to the internet bpl could provide that opportunity for the third wire to the home while further increasing consumer choi ce is goal of both congress and the fcc there are still consumers who have options or perhaps only one option for receiving broadband service41 some of those consumers are likely part of those populations that are traditionally underser ved eg rural residents lowincome consumers and for them bpl may also provi at least partial solution bpl not being limited technically by distance and not requiring upgrades to the electric lines themselves is significantly easier to deploy to what might be considered by cable and dsl providers to be undesi rable areas of course co st and potential profitability are still issues in those areas and there will always be areas where deployment is simply not realistic ither technologically or economically or both congress may wish to continue monitori ng how the fcc balances ensuring that bpl as new technology is given every opportunity to reach the market while also ensuring that it is not given an unfair regulatory advantage over other similar services in the coming months the electric utilities will roll out their commercial bpl offerings as electric utilities deploy their commercial systems the fccs rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32421crs14 42 during april

regulatory and industrygovernance issues broadband over powerlines is just the late st in growing list of technologies and services that challenge the current structure of the fcc and the statutory and regulatory stove pipes re quired by current law while bpl is technology for the delivery of internet service it challeng traditional and embedded thinking and paradigms about telecommuni cations and information services because it does not fit neatly into an existing category of service if congress decides to amend the countrys current communications laws it may consider the impact that such new technologies are having on the way lawm akers and regulators have traditionally looked at underlying transmission technologies42 with respect to ipenabled services that would be provided over bpl the one with the most legal and regulatory impact may be ipbased voice service voice over internet protocol or voip voip is different from traditiona l telephone service in that it does not employ single dedicated path between the calling parties called circuit switching instead voip translates analog voice into digital packets and transmits those packets along multiple paths called packet switching and reassembles the packets at the receiving end43 this is the same format or protocol used to transmit email instant messages video and other data via the internet thus voice is longer

to the consumer as well as to thirdparty vendors ie internet service providers as the market develops tension may develop over whether these ne w entrants should be required to adhere to existing requirements or perhaps how existing requirements should be changed to better reflect the current technol ogical and competitive environment technical issues the fcc focused on technical issues in its bpl proceedings these issues have included how bpl should be implemented to minimize interference with other services eg amateur radio frequencies and what effect bpl technology could have on reliability and security of the transmission and distribution systems ie bpl may provide benefits as well as potentially create risks although the fccs regulations mandate the technical standa rds under which bpl will be deployed those standards will very likely have an impact on the previous two categories of issues and therefore congress may have an interest in monitoring the development of these technical issues as well interference with other licensed services some stakeholders have continued to express varying degrees of concern over the potential of bpl to disrupt licensed radio services incl uding amateur public safe ty and emergency response frequencies44 the fcc continues to address those concerns in its bpl proceedings service reliability and security issues other
