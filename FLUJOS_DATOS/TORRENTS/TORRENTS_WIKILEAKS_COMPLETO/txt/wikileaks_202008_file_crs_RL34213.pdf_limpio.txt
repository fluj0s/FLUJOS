to the us department of labor 43 of privatesector employees participated in defined contribution retirement plans such as those authorized under 401k of the internal revenue code in march 2007 the amount that these workers will have accumulated in their retirement accounts by the time they retire will depend on number of factors including the extent to which the expenses incurred to administer the plans are borne by plan participants for this reason it is important for participants in 401k plans to understand the fees and expenses that they pay and the services that they receive in exchange for paying these expenses whether participants in 401k plans are able to identify the fees and expenses that they pay has become topic of interest both to congress and the department of labor on april 30 2007 the department of labor published notice of its intent to propose regulations that will require plan sponsors to provide clearer and more detailed information about fees and expenses to plan participants according to the investment company institute ici the average assetweighted expense ratio for stock mutual funds in 401k plans in 2006 was 074 for this report crs estimated the effect of expenses ranging from 04 to 20 of assets on the amounts accumulated in retirement accounts over thirtyyear period by married coup and single persons with high median and low earnings who contribute 6 8 or 10 of earnings each year to retirement account invested in mix of stocks and bonds we comp ared annual expenses of 08 12 16 and 20 of plan assets to lowcost base case in which annual expenses were equal to 04 of assets in the account the results of the analysis indicate that expenses paid by plan participants can substantially reduce their retirement account balances based on the distribution of rates of return in us stock and bond markets over the 80year period from 1926 through 2005 medianearning couple who contribute 6 of family earnings each year for 30 years to retirement account that is invested twothirds in stocks and onethird in bonds could expect to accumulate 356434 in constant 2004 dollars if investment rates of return are at the historical median over the investment period and annual expenses are equal to 04 of plan assets with annual expenses equal to 20 of plan assets this couple could expect to accumulate 263663 or 260 less than under the lowcost plan medianearning single person who contributes 6 of earnings each year for 30 years to retirement account that is invested twothirds in stocks and onethird in bonds could expect to accumulate 187738 in constant 2004 dollars if investment rates of return are at the historical median over the investment period and annual expenses are equal to 04 of plan assets with annual expenses equal to 20 of plan assets the individual could expect to accumulate 138344 or 263 less than under the lowcost plan this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34213g20g142g157g146g155g142

based on length of service and final pay or average pay the employer is responsible for funding defined benefit plan and must ensure that the plan has sufficient assets to pay the benefits that have been earned by the plans participants because most employersponsored retirement plans are defined contribution plans workers bear much of the responsibility for accumulating the assets that will provide their income in retirement the amount that worker will have accumulated in his or her retirement account by the time he or she retires will depend on number of factors including the age at which contributions to the plan begin the number of years over which contributions are made the amount contributed to the plan each year by the employer and employee whether any withdrawals are taken from the account before retirement the annual rate of return on investment of the assets in the account and the extent to which the rate of return on investment is reduced by fees and expenses that are borne by the plan participants an earlier congressional research service crs report described the effects of the number of years of saving the amount contributed to the plan and the rate of return

reasonable expenses of administering the plan4 the department of labor has in regulations construed this statute as requiring the employers who offer 401k plans to their workers to monitor the fees and expenses charged to plan participants to assure that they are reasonable plan sponsors are required to provide participants with regular statements of their accrued benefits under the plan and they must file reports with the departments of labor and treasury that include the fees and expenses associated with operating the plan whether participants in 401k plans are able to identify the fees and expenses that they are required to pay has become topic of interest both to congress and the department of labor on march 6 2007 the house committee on education and labor held hearing on the subject of fees paid by participants in 401k plans 5 on april 30 2007 the department of labor published notice of its intent to propose regulations requiring plan sponsors to provide participants with the information they need including information about fees and expenses to make informed investment decisions 6 employers often hire financial institutions to op erate their retirement plans the cost of the services provided by these institutions is typically borne in part by the employer that sponsors the plan and in part by the plan participants the services necessary to operate 401k plan or other defined contribution plan include maintaining the financial records of the plan processing participant contributions and withdrawals tracking account balances and preparing monthly or quarterly account statements some plans allow participants to borrow from their accounts and the cost of processing plan loans is borne by the plans participants in addition the plan administrator is responsible for filing annual reports with the department of labor and the internal revenue service the specific arrangements by which the plan administrator charges fees to the plan sponsor for these services vary from plan to plan as do the ways that these costs are shared among the plan sponsor and the plan participants the fees paid by plan participants for the services provided by the plans administrator usually are expressed as the ratio of these costs to the value of plan assets the total value of plan assets the number of participants the average account balance and the kind of investments offered by the plan all affect the plans expense ratio plans sponsored by large employers often have belowaverage expenses while plans offered by small employers often have aboveaverage expenses large employers are able to spread the fixed costs of establishing and maintaining plan over more accounts and also may be able to negotiate discounts with fund managers because of the large volume of assets that will be under management small employers have fewer accounts over which to spread their fixed costs and are less likely to be able to negotiate lower fees with fund managers plans typically offer range of investment options including money market funds bond funds and stock funds money market funds and bond funds typically have lower expenses than stock funds but also have lower average rates of return among stock funds those that track stock market index usually have lower expenses than actively managed funds that attempt to achieve rates of return in excess of the market indices 4 erisa 404a1 29 usc 1104a1 fiduciary is someone who holds position of trust or confidence with respect to the property of another 5 are hidden 401k fees undermining retirement security

assetweighted expense ratio for stock mutual funds in 401k plans in 2006 was 0747 expense ratios vary widely around this average however the ici estimates that 77 of 401k plan stock mutual fund assets were invested in funds with expense ratios less th an 10 in 2006 only 3 of 401k plan stock mutual fund assets were invested in funds with expense ratios more than 15 in 2006 according to the ici however because these expense ratios are assetweighted more than 3 of individual participants 401k accounts had expense ratios of more than 15 mutual funds which comprise more than half of all assets held in 401k plans also incur the cost of buying and selling securities according to the ici while these costs are not included in the funds total expense ratio they are reflected in the calculation of net return to the investor 8 g20g142g156g158g149g157g156g561 for this report crs estimated the effect of expense ratios ranging from 04 to 20 on the amounts accumulated in retirement accounts over

earnings each year for 30 years to retirement account that is invested twothirds in stocks and onethird in bonds could expect to accumulate 356434 in constant 2004 dollars if investment rates of return are at the median over the 30year period based on the estimated distribution of rates of return there is 90 probability that their account balance measured in 2004 dollars would be between 155943 and 819955 these amounts represent the account balances that would occur if investment rates of return were at the 5 th percentile and the 95th percentile respectively of the distribution of

account compared to the estimated amounts accumulated in highercost accounts panel 1 of table 2 is identical to panel 1 of table 1 it shows estimated account balances under the base case scenario in which expenses equal 04 of plan assets panel 2 through panel 5 of table 2 show the difference in account balances due to higher expenses expressed in constant 2004 dollars for example the difference in the estimated median account balance for median earning couple investing in an account in which expenses equal 04 of plan assets 356434 and their median account balance in plan in which expenses equal 20 of plan assets 263663 is 92771 see panel 5 of table 2 similarly the difference in the estimated median account balance for medianearning single person investing in an account in which expenses equal 04 of plan assets 187738 and the median account balance in plan in which expenses equal 20 of plan assets 138344 is 49394 table 3 shows the effect of higher expenses on retirement account balances expressed as the percentage difference between the estimated amount accumulated in lowcost account and the estimated amounts accumulated in highercost accounts panel 1 of table 3 is

same layout as previous tables they differ only in that tables 4 through 6 show estimated account balances for couples and singles who invest 8 of pay over 30 years and tables 7 through 9 show estimated account balances for couples and singles who invest 10 of pay over 30 years g15g142g157g145g152g141g156g561 the estimates presented in tables 1 through 9 are based on earnings data by age and marital status derived from the march 2005 current population survey we used as our estimate of future real earnings growth the 11 annual rate of growth in real earnings that was developed by the actuaries of the social security administration for their most recent estimate of the longrun solvency of the social security program the estimated account balances are based on assumed annual contributions to retirement plan of 6 tables 1 through 3 8 tables 4 through 6 and 10 tables 7 through 9 of family earnings this is the most common range of contribution amounts observed in the federal reserve boards 2004 survey of consumer finances the estimated account balances are based on twothirds of account assets being invested in common stocks and onethird of plan assets being in vested in corporate bonds this is the average distribution of plan assets in the data base of 401k plans jointly maintained by the employee benefit research institute and the investment company institute 9 we estimated the amounts accumulated in retirement accounts through monte carlo process using proprietary software called risk which was developed by the palisade corporation the key inputs to these estimates in addition to the estimates of earnings and the assumed rate of annual contributions to the retirement accounts are the estimated future real rates of return on investment in stocks and bonds and the correlation between the rates of return on these two classes of assets our estimates are based on the annual real rates of return on the standard and poor s 500 index of common stocks and the annual real rates of return on aaarated corporate bonds over the period from 1926 through 2005 the risk software program uses these historical data to determine the shape of the distribution of rates of return for each type of asset and the correlation between these rates of return on the basis of these distributions and correlations thousands of simulations are run in which the annual rate of return on each asset is chosen from the possible range of rates of return as determined by the shape of the distribution in our simulations each 30year period of in vestment returns was simulated 5000 times the results generated by the simulations include the estimated mean and median account balances as well as the balances generated by the rates of return at the 5 th and 95th
