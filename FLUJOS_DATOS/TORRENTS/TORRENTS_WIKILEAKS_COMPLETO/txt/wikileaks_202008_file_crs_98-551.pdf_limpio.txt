vietnam economic reforms and commercial relations with the united states raymond j ahearn specialist in trade relations foreign affairs defense and trade division summary vietnam has made considerable progress in implementing economic reforms since 1986 the reforms have nudged vietnam to more marketoriented economy and have facilitated higher rates of economic growth particularly during 19881996 momentum for deepening the reforms however has stalled in recent years and since 1997 there has been significant decline in foreign investment as well as deterioration in the underlying performance of the economy to address these problems multilateral institutions and us officials have urged vietnams leaders to initiate second wave of economic reforms that will make its economy more marketoriented and efficient vietnams leaders have moved cautiously in adopting additional economic reforms following president clintons recommendati on of june 3 1999 to renew vietnams jacksonvanik waiver for year joint resolutions sjres 28 and hjres 58 were introduced to disapprove the renewal on july 20 1999 the senate rejected motion to discharge sjres 28 from committee by vote 594 and the house on august 3 voted down hjres 58 by vote of 130297 although the united states and vietnam on july 25 1999 reached an agreement in principle on the terms of bilateral trade agreement vietnam has postponed signing

economic review april 15 1999in these circumstances vietnams leaders adopted pragmatic albeit partial reforms to regain economic growth at the heart of the reforms adopted in the late 1980s were measures that eliminated price controls on most key goods established land use rights for farmers clarified the legal status of private businesses and tightened government spending as part of the latter attempt efforts were made to limit subsidies to state ownedenterprises soes by providing greater autonomy in production investment and pricing decisions vietnams economy prospered in the decade following the initiation of the reforms after years of stagnant production shortages and limited famine associated with orthodox communist economic policies economic activity increased by 39 annually from 1986 1990 and by 76 annually from 19911993 in real terms the economy grew by 88 in 1994 by 95 in 1995 and by 93 in 1996 rates of growth that enticed foreign investors to flock to ho chi minh city and hanoi in the early 1990s amid much media speculation that vietnam was poised to become the next asian tiger2 growing economic problems beginning in 1997 and continuing in 1998 and 1999 vietnams economy has experienced host of problems instead of leading to continuing predictions that vietnam was about to become an asian tiger the problems have cast vietnam more in the image of an asian lamb economic growth slowed to 82 in 1997 and dropped to 35 in 1998 behind the deceleration of economic growth are cutbacks in foreign direct investment commitments and declines in exports both of which have been exacerbated by the financial crisis in asia3 vietnams strong economic performance from 19881996 was substantially driven by foreign investment inflows by the end of this period foreign directinvested projects accounted for about 9 of gdp total output per year 20 of the countrys export earnings and 300 million in annual tax revenues4 however beginning in 1997 the number of new foreign investment commitments slipped to about 3 billion compared to 79 billion in 1996 57 billion in 1995 and 36 billion in 19945 new commitments for 1999 are predicted to drop to about 18 billion the lowest level since 19916 actual disbursements according to the asian development bank may not even reach 500 million in 19997httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98551crs3 8economist intelligence unit vietnam

the early commitments in 1999 have come from asia compared to about 70 since 19888 red tape bureaucratic corruption constantly shifting legal structure excessive licensing procedures weaknesses in the banking system and massive smuggling are longstanding problems that help explain the declining interest of foreign investors this catalogue of problems is manifested by one business service poll which ranked the attractiveness of vietnams business environment 15th out of 16 asian countries9 with the cost of doing business dropping elsewhere in asia vietnams many investment hurdles evidently are now being weighed more heavily by foreign investors than its considerable locational and resource advantages10 the downturn in foreign investment has also been exacerbated by asias financial crisis nearly threefourths of vietnams foreign investment has come from asia with pressing restructuring problems at home many cashstrapped asian companies are being forced to shelve plans for new investments or close down existing operations11 asians financial crisis is also having negative effect on vietnams exports as customers for more than 60 of vietnams exports the slower growing asian countries are buying less from vietnam and as competitors many asian countries are also able to undercut vietnams exports to third country markets with goods that are cheaper now as result of their own large currency devaluations12 the world bank estimates that the combination of declining inflows of foreign investment and stagnation in export earnings is equivalent to about 3 billion or 12 of vietnams gdp this shock or cost to the economy has come on top growth rate that according to the bank had probably already peaked13 economic reforms calls for second wave citing many of these economic problems and challenges the world bank the international monetary fund imf and us officials all publically urged vietnam during 1997 to launch doi moi two or second wave of economic reforms to underline the seriousness of the problem both the imf and world bank have denied vietnam loans until it agrees to implement strong and comprehensive package of economic reforms suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98551crs4

financial sector reforms and trade liberalization14 despite progress in closing down some 6000 mostly small and townbased soes since doi moi commenced vietnam still operates an estimated 5800 state enterprises these remaining soes dominate strategic sectors such as banking cement chemicals telecommunications and steel altogether the soe sector accounts for about 30 of gdp 20 of total investment 15 of nonagricultura l employment and about 50 of outstanding bank credit15 as about 60 of these enterprises are considered to be unprofitable and many are highly indebted on the average soes have larger debt than equity reform of the state sector is required for the modernization of the economy to improve the efficiency of the soes the government during 19951996 grouped nearly half of the state enterprises under 18 big holding companies known as general corporations in industries such as steel rubber electricity coffee food and chemicals patterned after the south korean model of huge conglomerates or chaebol the government hoped that the grouping would allow these corporations to compete more effectively internationally while at the same time retaining control over their activities skeptics however maintain that their creation has served to reduce competition and undermined efforts to allow more scope for private sector activity16 so far the government has resisted outright efforts at privatizing soes but it established program in mid1992 to equitize convert soes into joint stock companies by march 1999 some 147 enterprises had been equitized an accelerated process of equitization faces formidable opposition from the army individual ministries and regional authorities that now control them closely related to challenges of soe reform are problems in the banking sector stateowned commercial banks scobs still dominate this sector accounting for 80 of all loans and deposits their problems include large accumulation of nonperforming loans weak capital base and low profitability the banks also lack basic regulatory procedures situation conducive to lax and politicallyinfluenced lending practices progress in opening vietnam up to foreign trade has been most rapid on the export side with the reduction of export bans and quotas and the gradual opening of trading activities to private business vietnam however continues to restrain imports by imposing high tariffs quotas bans and nontariff barriers since the onset of the asian regional crisis trade protection to promote strategic industries has increased as in the case

updatedbanking reform full trade liberalization reform appears to be intimately connected and dependent on major reform of the state enterprise sector17 leadership divisions over economic reform although the vietnamese communist party has relinquished some of its control over the economy as part of the doi moi process it still exercises near absolute political power decisions are made collectively and behind closed doors opposition to the communist party rule in the streets or in the press is not tolerated18 at the same time vietnam is not the same highly regimented centralized and doctrinaire communist state that it was few decades ago its citizens may not have political freedom but they appear to have considerable personal freedom provincial and local officials also have considerable power and often act contrary to decrees issued from hanoi top party leaders are most often described as pragmatists who are focused on two overriding objectives bringing prosperity back to vietnam and maintaining the partys monopoly on political power the pace and scope of the economic reforms however are matter of serious divide among vietnams ruling elite one group of reformers advocates more active policy reforms that support the development of stronger private sector the contraction of the largely inefficient state sector and the countrys continued integration into the regional and world economy second group of conservatives worries that an increase in the pace of economic reforms could undermine the countrys socialist values as well as the partys monopoly on power through an increase in societal demands for political reforms the leadership tensions are manifested in considerable policy ambiguity and caution concerning globalization prime minister phanvan khai for example argued in recent speech that vietnam cannot play by its own rules but at the same time must carry out reform program that is proper for vietnam the leaderships continuing repressive attitude toward dissent and campaigns to purify party members also puts brakes on efforts to open up the economy more rapidly currently there are few indications that the leadership will agree anytime soon to initiate and implement comprehensive second wave of reforms yet deteriorating domestic economy growing unrest in some provinces and weak regional economy could prove strong impetus for moving in this direction accordingly vietnams leadership decisions on economic reform will continue to condition relations with the united states including efforts to normalize commercial relations19httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98551crs6 20information provided by the usvietnam trade council washington dcusvietnamese commercial relations since president clinton in 1994 ordered an end to the us trade embargo on vietnam usvietnamese commercial ties have grown twoway trade has increased almost fourfold rising from 224 million in 1994 with the united states running 122 million surplus to 827

foreign investor in vietnam future increases in trade and investment flows could be affected by president clintons decision march 9 1998 to grant vietnam waiver from the jacksonvanik amendment which denies nonmarket economy countries that severely restrict free emigration certain benefits eg mostfavorednation status in trade and access to us government financial facilities the waiver smoothed the way for the overseas private investment corporation and exportimport bank to begin providing support for us investments and exports to vietnam20 on june 3 1999 president clinton again issued an annual waiver of jacksonvanik restrictions on us interactions with vietnam joint resolutions disapproving the presidents action were introduced in the senate sjres 28 june 7 and in the house hjres 58 june 9 on july 20 1999 the senate rejected motion to discharge sjres 28 from committee effectively defeating the measure by vote of 594 on august 3 1999 the house voted down hjres 58 by vote of 130297 in addition to providing vietnam access to variety of us financial facilities the annual waiver on jacksonvanik is one necessary step before vietnam can receive most favored nation mfn trading status mfn status would allow vietnam to export its goods to the united states under much more favorable tariff rates many observers believe that until vietnam gets access to the us market on an mfn basis it will remain severely handicapped in trying to attract largescale foreign investment and in building more sophisticated industrial base the other necessary condition for granting mfn status as required by the trade act of 1974 is the conclusion of bilateral trade agreement the office of the us trade representative ustr announced on july 25 1999 that an agreement in principle on the terms of comprehensive bilateral trade agreement had been reached vietnam however has resisted signing the agreement to date perhaps due to opposition from conservative elements in vietnams 18member politboro according to one report the vietnamese army opposes the agreement due to concerns it will threaten its extensive commercial activities some ustr officials reportedly now hope that vietnam will sign the agreement before the november 30 1999 world trade organization ministerial in seattle
