of whic h have important implications for congress as congress c onducts oversight of the federal agencies engaged in terrorist precursor crime investigations and intelligence efforts this phenomenon and us efforts to identify investigate and counter it may be of particular concern one such issue is how these agencies coordinate with one another on the issue of terrorist precursor crimes and whether there is an acrossagency strategy on how to deal with such activity beyond the federal government agencies there are numerous state local and tribal slt agencies that are well positioned to assist in the identification and investigation of terrorist precursor crimes but it is often unclear and at the very least inconsistent how these agencies are incorporated into existing efforts in

account is accurate qaedas choice may have been borne of logistical security concerns and lack of acute need for funds yet there are reports suggesting that while qaeda has not actively joined in on the opium trade it has increasingly utilized th smuggling routes used to move opium from continuedactivity to forward their agendas it is beyond the scope of th is report however to address each of the myriad national security policy implications associated with this issue thus one area the role of federal state and local agencies in addressing domestic terrorist precursor crimes is examined in greater detail increase in precursor criminal activity causes according to numerous terrorism scholars and analysts there are indications that terrorists are increasingly relying on nonterroristic precursor crimes to facilitate their terrorist attacks andor further their terrorist campaign2 additionally it appears that terrorist groups are diversifying and expanding the variety of crimes they commit3 the cause for the increase in preattack criminal activity may be due to the following four factors the decline in state sponsorship the amateurization and decentralization of terror enhanced counterte rrorism measures and changing terrorist demographics ie shifts in ideology strategy and capabilities it is important to note that not all gr oups and not all memb ers andor supporters of such groups engage in such activity there are some groups that appear adverse to conducting cr iminal acts in orde r to facilitate their objectives out of ideological concerns some may avoid criminal activity out of logistical concerns for example criminal activity may be viewed as liability enhancing the potential for detection and apprehension of operatives in other instances criminal activity may be isolated within particular strata or division of group in orde r to protect key operatives spokesmen and charismatic leaders from potential detection there are instances where groups

state sponsorship of terrorism has dram atically decreased since the 1970s and 1980s when dan byman estimates that almo st every important terrorist group had some ties to at least one supportive

threats and attacks the foiled 2004 plan to stage simultaneous suicide attacks in the united states the 2005 suicide bus and subway bombings in london and the august 2006 plot to blow up 10 planes

far more than military might angeles times february 20 2007 while these new cells like the one that perpetrated the 2005 london transit bombings may have connections to and in some cases may have been in part trained funded or dir ected by corporate qaeda there is clearly distin ction between this type of cell and those that were handpicked and directly managed by qaedas upperlevel leadership the former are clearly part of more decentralized inspired cell network of likeminded believers who see themselves as part of the global jihad even if they dont ve the same level of involvement with the

tigers of tamil eelam ltte and the revolu tionary armed forces of colombia farc among many others9 amateurization of terror as terrorism has become more decentra lized over the last decade with groups adopting less hierarchical cell networks and the pro liferation of technology information and inspiration to support autonomous terror there has been proliferation of smaller aut onomous or semiautonomous cells10 such groups often have fewer conc rete links to larger more or ganized terrorist groups and thus limited access to organized largescale fundr aising mechanisms in addition many of these smaller cells mount more limited and less sophisticated attacks which require less infrastructure expertise and expensive weaponry thus amateur terrorists are likely to require significan tly fewer funds for example while the september 11th attacks are estimated to ve cost approximately 400000 50000011 the july 7 2005 london bombings are estimated to have cost between several hundred and 8000 approximately 1560012 this is not phenomenon limited to britain it appears that small semiautonomous terrorist cells in many countries have discovered that they are capable of conducting

counterterrorism m easures especially with regard to freezing certain charity and front business holdings additiona l regulations within the banking sector and monitoring money remittances may have caused terrorist elements to utilize different techniques for fundraising and money laundering one notable example of possible causal relationship is the result of the us law enforcement crackdown on the irish republican armys ira ameri canbased fundraising activities which some experts have cited as the driving cause of the iras turn to criminal activity to fill that void and continue to fund its

running to cigarettenarcotics smuggling shift in threat environment the terrorist threat environment has changed significantly since the dawn of modern international terrorism in 1968 fo r example the number of terrorist groups with primarily religious objectives has risen dramatically the lethality of terrorism has increased and the number of groups th at are longer satisfied with limited symbolic violence but rather seek to cause largescale carnage has increased this altered terrorist demogr aphic may help to explain wh terrorist groups today are increasingly reliant on precursor crimes at that time the height of the cold war the terrorist threat environment was thought to be dominated by leftwing re volutionary marxistleninist ideological organizations15 in 1968 according to data from

engage in significant criminal activity today groups with pre dominately religious or religionationalist ideologies dominate the curre nt threat environment for example in 1968 none of the

religious17 as of october 2005 the state department had designated 42 groups as foreign terrorist organizations ftos of which at least 21 50 could be classified as religious terrorist groups18 somewhat counterintuitively many of th terrorist groups that are religious in nature are involved in precursor criminal activity even when said activity is expressly prohibited in religious scripture19 potential rationalizations for this activity could include first any action that is undertaken in pursuit of the groups ultimate cause is deemed permissible for ex ample numerous islamist terrorist groups promote the use of suicide bombing as legitimate tactic in jihad despite the explicit condemnation of suicide in the quran second sometimes criminal activity allows groups to achieve two goals simultaneously generate funds and harm their enemies this is iterated by the purported comments of abu baka r bashir spiritual leader of the qaedalinked jemaah islamiyah ji an islamist group in indonesia when questioned about jis involvement in series of jewelry store robberi believed to have financed the 2002 bali bombings bashir purportedly commente d you can take their blood then why

attorneys office in or bout 1990 baz mohammad met with members of the baz mohammad organization in his karachi pakistan residence and told them that selling heroin in the united states was jihad

successfully prosecuted cases andor allegations of terrorist precursor criminal activity could fall under the category of white collar crime as this report demonstrates terrorists have engaged in wide variety of criminal activities ranging from lowlevel street crime to sophisticated whitecollar crimes however there is not enough publicly available data from which to draw finitive quantitative conclusions regarding the breakdown of types of domestic precursor crimes in general it appears that larger professional groups are more likely to be able to engage in sophisticated white collar crimes while smaller terrorist cells that l ack extensive links to such groups and whose members have little formal terrorist training ar more likely to engage in less sophisticated smallerscale

there are numerous reports that suggest terrorist precursor criminal activity is occurring across the globe with criminal trends emerging within each region some analysts have suggested that terrorist

differences among groups and individual cells identifying terrorist precursor activity will not serve as unive rsal counterterrorism panacea such an approach may be extremely effective agai nst some groups those heavily involved in criminal activity but less effective agai nst others those not involved or not significantly involved in criminal activity the same goes for types of operatives entrylevel members assigned to fundraising efforts may engage in criminal activities on greater scale then highlevel commanders potentially rendering the former more vulnerable to capture than the latter in addition to division of labor decentra lization of the flow of funds and goods may further frustrate interception and intelligence efforts it has been suggested that some terrorist groups are careful about co mingling funds and thus separate funds intended for different genera l purposes eg training vs operations vs propaganda etc some may separate funds for specific operations in an attempt to protect those channels from discovery or leading to greater discovery by the security officials this practice may frustrate law enforcement and intelligence efforts to identify and thwart

communities whose work deals with these terrorist precursor crimes vigorously and comprehensively employ terprisefocused approaches to terrorist precursor crime investigations whether an investigation is narrowly or broadly focused could potentially influence terrori st behavior and as such impact future efforts to uncover terrorist activity in the united states some might argue that exposing terrorist engagement in criminal activity could potentially discredit terrorist group in the eyes of its supporters however as more terrorist organizations turn to criminal activ ity to fund and facilita their agenda and as their supporters increasingly accept such justifications there is distinct possibility that such an approach could have negative consequences for example groups could become more clandestine in their activities or adopt new techniques and novel scams making it difficult for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify them there are indications to suggest

dealing with terrorist predicate crimes do we have coherent st rategy or do individual agencies approach this issue differently what metrics are used to measure the success of us strategyiesfor terrorist precursor activity is that strategys effective are there unintended consequences thatactually work against the strategys stated goals implications for congress the existence of domestic terrorist precursor criminal activity has myriad far reaching implications the presence of terrorist precursor activity within us borders has relevance for areas of cong ressional oversight nd interest such as existing laws for enforcement and pros ecution of precursor crimes funding of various counterterrorism prog rams and oversight of numerous agencies engaged in such activity to ensure coordination issues directly related to the terro rist precursor crime phenomenon include concerns whether existing terrorism material support statutes and the way they are interpreted and utilized are sufficient for effectively prosecuting individuals who conduct terrorist precursor crime s another related issue is the role the private sector role plays in identifying reporting and helping facilitate the prosecution of fraud schemes many of wh ich may be utilized by terrorist groups to raise funds including credit card fraud coupon fraud and benefits fraud furthermor the question of the role and the effectiveness of the banking and financial sector in identifying and thwarting terrorist financing is an importa nt issue it is beyond the scope of this report however to explore each of these topics indepth the next section provides single narrow prism through which to examine the congressional implications of terrorist precursor criminal activity the id entification of terrorist precursor criminal activity by agencies at all levels of g overnment and the subs equent collection of intelligence on and investigation of such activity federal role in intelligenceinvestigation of precursor crimes traditionally federal inte lligence agencies were pr imarily responsible for counterterrorism ce the september 11th terrorist attacks however there have been changes to that approach and additional federal agencies have become closely involved in counterterrorism activities for instance the fbi has begun to transition into more preventionfocused intelligencedriven agency in order to combat terrorism as agencies continue to enhance their ability to detect and deter terrorism several questions are raised do they utilize consistent approach in dealing with precursor crimes if so what is the accep ted formula for collecting intelligence vs enforcement are precursor crimes that are committed in the united states or by us residentscitizens abroad priority for these agencies what is their assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34014crs25 106 according to the most recent publiclya vailable statistics from the department of justices bureau of statistics there were nearly 800000 sworn law enforcement officers in the united states in 2000 only 88496 11 worked for federal agencies while approximately 711000 89 were state local and tribal law enforcement officers us department

state and local intelligence in the war on terrorism santa monica ca rand co 2005 1 of the breadth and diversity of criminal activity terrorist groups are engaging in within the united states which groups ar the most active in the united states testimony at congressional hearings in recent years suggests that intelligence sharing and coordination in general has been improving between the various intelligence and law enforcement agencies involved in counterterrorism specifically with regard to terrorist precursor criminal activity in the united states this issue may be worth further examination is there c oherent strategy for dealing with precursor crimes across agencies have agencies made sufficient progress coordinating with other agencies on individual cases relate d to terrorist precursor crimes are additional congressional measures needed to ensure the effective coordination of terrorist precursor crimes strategy amongst disparate agencies based on information available it is unc lear whether there is coordinated federalwide strategy for pproaching terrorist precursor crimes occurring within the united states similar question relates to the intelligence and law enforcement communities assessment of how the presen ce of such activity affects the security environment slt role in intelligenceinvestigation of precursor crimes since the september 11th attacks there appears to be consensus that the stakeholders responsible fo r counterterrorism need to be expanded to include non traditional partners such as state local and tribal slt law enforcement amongst others there is far less agreement over wh at kind of role slt forces should play or how to further incorporate count erterrorism efforts into their daily duties given the proliferation of proposed players many of which have overlappi ng jurisdictions the issue of defining the lanes in the road am ongst federal state local and tribal law enforcement and intelligence agencies begs further examination of all the terrorism prevention roles that have been discussed for slt agencies identifying terrorist precursor crimes is perhaps the most natural given their existing skill sets legal authority to investigate and prosecute such offenses sheer numbers106 and intimate familia rity with their jurisdictions slt personnel are wellpositioned to develop information on cr imes activities nd organizations that support terrorist organizations during the cour of their normal duties107 further issues include what is the current level of involvement of slt agencies in identifying terrorist precursor activities are th ere appropriate ways to st rengthen that involvement through additional training programs or ex ercises do slt agencies have access to current intelligence regarding precursor cr iminal trends and other terrorist modushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34014crs26 108 for example scholars and media sources have recently questioned the effectiveness of antimoney laundering strategies several recent studies suggest that such regulations are ineffective and increasingly so given the cos tbenefit ratio and increasing electronic nature of the financial industry for example mari anoflorentino cuellar argues that the fight against money laundering delivers less than what it promises in the article the tenuous relationship between the fight against mone laundering and the disruption of criminal finance journal of criminal law and criminology winter 2003 in october 2005 the editors of the economist suggested that post9 11 efforts to thwart terrorist financing via continuedoperandi that could assist them in identifying such activity within their own jurisdictions slt agencies can utilize homeland security grant monies to fund such training but the availability of training is unclear there appear to be few if any federally certified courses available to slt agencies that specifically focus on terrorist precursor crimes that said there are numerous classes that examine preincident indicators and other terrorism related trends that may address the precursor crime issue with regards to overall integration of slt agencies in the area of terrorist precursor crime investigation and intelligence efforts anecdotal information suggests it is likely that progress in these three areas varies significantly from agency to agency given the importance of preventing future attacks and the potential role slt agencies could play in identifying terrorist precursor activities within their communities congress may further examine the role that slt agencies play in identifying and thwarting terrorist precursor crimes coordination of federal and slt efforts it is also important to examine the in tersection between count erterrorism efforts conducted at various levels of government andor the pot ential for such involvement how do federal agencies currently engage sl t agencies in this area at what point do slt agencies contact federal agencies when they believe they have identified nexus to terrorism in the course of examining criminal activity what happens next is the case taken over by federal agencies or is it worked in concert moreover do current regulations on collecting intelligen ce at each level of government provide sufficient protections for civil rights while ensuring appropriate leverage for agencies working on counterterrorism have relevant agencies at all levels of government received adequate training on these regu lations and do they fully understand what they do and do not prevent the agency from doing as demonstrated by the wealth of stions generated by examining just one aspect of terrorist precursor crimes their identification and subs equent investigation several areas deserve furthe r attention the challenge posed by domestic terrorist precursor crimes is complex for exampl on occasion seemingly straightforward countermeasures applied to terrorist precursor activity ma have resulted in unintended and unforeseen consequences in some cases wellintentioned countermeasures could actually exacerbate some terrorist threats andor result in relatively few benefits given their overall cost108httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34014crs27 108 continued regulation may have cost billions of dollars while yielding depressingly few tangible results looking in the wrong places hindering flows across international financial networks is costly and does not stop terrorists primary activity the economist october 20 2005 print editionin addition to the complexity of the pr oblem at hand the complexity of the us counterstrategy as demonstrated by the sheer number of agencies involved can be daunting there are numerous agencies i nvolved in the us countermeasures many with overlapping legal and geographic jurisd ictions this oversight issue may require additional attention at level of detail beyond the scope of this report
