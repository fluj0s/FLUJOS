edelman reasons 15 bd 1 c summary pm erdogan expects washington to focus on cyprus economic reform and antiterrorism cooperation among other issues in turn he will press for 1 concrete us actions to block what turks believe is the formation by accretion of facto kurdish state in n iraq 2 concrete us actions against the pkk in iraq and 3 clear usg support for his government while the turkish side sees the visit as mainly about developing our broad common strategy erdogan is also looking for public outcome he can characterize as concrete results at the same time although erdogan is currently unchallenged as the paramount political figure in turkey he and his party face deep challenges which if he cannot rise to them will affect his longevity in government turkeys democratic development and usturkish cooperation end summary 2 c pm erdogan appears to be riding political high and uncommon luck as he prepares for his jan 2829 visit to washington where he hopes to demonstrate the administration recognizes him as an equal partner 3 c erdogan has been primed to hear plainspoken expressions of us interest in turkish action 1 to reach cyprus settlement by may 1 2 to hew to credible economic reform and macro policies 3 to cooperate unreservedly against terrorist groups of all stripes including islamist ones he rejects the term islamic terrorism 4 to cooperate on iraq 5 to open the border with armenia and 6 to reopen the ecumenical patriarchates halki seminary in way acceptable to the patriarchate 4 c in turn erdogan will argue that raising usturkish relations to higher level depends directly on 1 clear usg political and diplomatic actions to dispel the conviction and consequent resentment among turks of all political stripes that the us is tolerating stepbystep formation of facto independent kurdish state in northern iraq 2 concrete usg actions to remove the pkk threat from iraq 3 highlevel sustained usg support for the gots new cyprus initiative and 4 the clearest possible signal that the us stands behind the democraticallyelected government who are we dealing with 5 c charismatic and possessing common touch and phenomenal memory for faces and functions of thousands of party members across the country erdogan has strong pragmatic core his pragmatism has led him away from the radical islamist milieu of his past point noted to us unhappily by his radical former spiritual leader kemal hoca his pragmatism has also led him to avoid precipitously pushing islamic agenda items such as the wearing of islamist headscarves while using his outstanding preacher skills and persona as someone persecuted by the secularist establishment to maintain his hold on the hearts of his more religious supporters 6 c in short natural politician erdogan has common touch and an ability to communicate his empathy for the plight and aspirations of the common citizen he projects the image of the tribune of anatolia ready to take on corruption and privilege and to defend conservative traditions as result his ak party won twothirds parliamentary majority in nov 2002 national elections owing to aks image as the party of change at the national level good record in providing services at the municipal level and lack of viable political alternatives ak could gain around 50 of the vote in march 28 nationwide local elections party insiders project that such result would give ak control of 65 or more of the 3200 municipalities in turkey including probably istanbul and ankara and perhaps even izmir where ak has not done well to date plus most of the other large cities every step by the turkish establishment to try to diminish him whether by blocking legislation or attacking his motives cements his popularity in turkeys urban sprawls and across the anatolian heartland while opposition to him remains bitter in various loci of the state apparatus erdogan currently faces credible political opponent or party 7 c moreover erdogan knows his government has gained credit well beyond ak supporters as well as in the eu for political reforms which if fully implemented will substantially strengthen democracy in turkey his governments inability to pass legislation or regulations favored by ak supporters land registry reform supreme education board yok reform koran course reform has not eroded support indeed even rightofcenter turks who remain wary of ak readily tell us the establishments opposition to such reforms is counterproductive even if one can attribute turkeys lowest inflation and interest rates in 30 years to luck central bank skill and global emerging market trends rather than to the ak governments actions erdogan has reaped the political benefit 8 c taking highprofile approach in pursuing turkeys eu candidacy through direct campaigning in eu capitals erdogan has relished being feted by eu leaders for the past year he will have had positive visits by eu commission president prodi and german fonmin fischer before his washington trip and looks forward to the february visit by german chancellor schroeder he sees himself at this point as one of if not the most important leaders of the muslim world erdogans view of relations with the us 9 c erdogan recognizes that us support can be important for turkeys economy and eu aspirations he sees his task as managing turkss ambivalence toward us at the same time he wants to avoid being labeled proamerican from the low point in bilateral relations in march 2003 he has taken several supportive steps while being careful not to be too closely associated with us since opening turkish airspace for the iraq war erdogan agreed to ground line of communication for coalition forces in iraq he pushed through authorization for turkish deployment in support of the coalition he agreed to us troop rotation through incirlik airbase in line with longstanding us desires he took bold step in nov 2002 to try to move turkey away from its nosolution stance on cyprus and may be prepared now to do more he seems to be more open than any previous prime minister to reopening of the ecumenical patriarchates halki seminary 10 c on the other hand he has made public his discomfort with what most fellow turks also see as american complicity in creation of facto independent kurdistan in northern iraq and lack of concrete us action against the pkkkadekkhk he has not controlled antiamerican suspicions among the ak parliamentary group or within the cabinet defmin gonul told us recently on the margins of symposium in istanbul that in closed meetings fonmin gul continues to praise the parliaments march 1 2003 turndown of us deployment and to advocate more arabislamic foreign policy orientation as counter to relations with the us nevertheless erdogan and ministers like gonul and justice minister cicek see us support for his government as essential to his survival and he wants successful visit the deeper challenges for erdogan 11 c erdogan ak and his government face half dozen serious domestic challenges which if he does not manage them well will begin to put severe strain on his ability to govern by late 2004 and on his and our ability to maintain dynamic deep usturkish cooperation erdogans character erdogan has traits which render him seriously vulnerable to miscalculating the political dynamic especially in foreign affairs and vulnerable to attacks by those who would disrupt his equilibrium first overbearing pride second unbridled ambition stemming from the belief god has anointed him to lead turkey mustafa bilginer close confidant of erdogan and his wife emine from 19972003 has analyzed this trait in draft book on erdogans character erdogan used koranic allusion in his speech to the ak congress in oct 2003 to make the point about his godappointed mission third an authoritarian loner streak which prevents growth of circle of strong and skillful advisors broad flow of fresh information to him or development of effective communications among the party headquarters government and parliamentary group this streak also makes him exceptionally thinskinned fourth an overweening desire to stay in power which despite his macho image renders him fearful and prone to temporizing even at moments which call for swift and resolute decisions fifth distrust of women which manifests itself not only in occasional harsh public comments but also in his unwillingness to give women any meaningful decisionmaking authority in ak rival centers of power cabinet ministers erdogan advisors and raft of mps constantly tell us of the tensions between erdogan and gul with the latter appearing repeatedly to try to undercut erdogan parliamentary speaker bulent arinc who has strong following among more islamist ak mps has also caused problems for erdogan on controversial questions like pushing the right to wear headscarves at state functions although arinc has kept low profile for the past seven months he remains locus of troublemaking especially on questions involving the us eg troop rotation through incirlik lack of technocratic depth while some ak appointees appear to be capable of learning on the job others are incompetent or seem to be pursuing private or lodge cemaat interests ak is far from bringing the bureaucracy under control or making it work efficiently we hear constant anecdotal evidence not only from those on the secularist left who have deep prejudices against ak but also from contacts on the right that ak appointees at the national and provincial levels are incompetent or narrowminded islamists ak officials from cabinet ministers to locallevel party activists across the country admit to us that the partys choice of competent and broadly acceptable candidates for the march local elections will be exceptionally difficult and the election of controversial or inept ak candidates would complicate aks ability to govern both at the local and national level weakness of public relations and the image of hidden agendas erdogan lacks advisors who are able to preempt or handle the news cycle none of his advisors has good working relations with the turkish military his government has failed continually to consult broadly and openly or to prepare public opinion for legislative initiatives longoverdue reforms or foreign policy steps eg prewar us troop deployment or troop rotation as result ak creates the impression exploited by the establishment that it harbors an antirepublican deep islamist agenda or is selling out the country leading to establishment disinformation campaigns which cause the government to retreat corruption ak rode to power on the common citizens revulsion against corruption charges that erdogan amassed his fortune through kickbacks as mayor of istanbul have never been proven but we now hear more and more from insiders that close advisors such as private secretary hikmet bulduk mucahit arslan and cuneyd zapsu are engaging in wholesale influence peddling xxxxx that erdogan and he benefited directly from the award of the tupras state petroleum refinery privatization to consortium including russian partner erdogans direct acquisition of significant interest in food distribution company has become public controversy islamist complexes and prejudices some appointments such as prime ministry undersecretary dincer who stands by his 1995 article calling into question the relevance of the republic education ministry undersecretary birinci who in the past called himself an ummetci ie follower of greater islamic order and an opponent of the republic and head of staterun turkish radio and television demiroz who once paid homage to afghan fundamentalist hekmatyar have made the core of the state establishment armed forces presidency and judiciary profoundly uneasy erdogans refusal to condemn these positions the question of the level of influence of islamic brotherhoods and groups including the followers of fethullah gulen on the government and the presence of turkish hizbullah supporters in ak party provincial structures in the southeast have also raised deep concerns among many longstanding embassy contacts who themselves are pious erdogan himself recognizes the pernicious effect of closed brotherhood mentality cemaatcilik in political affairs as reflected in his jan 10 speech to symposium in istanbul but how well he can control the phenomenon remains very open question comment 12 c as erdogan rides the twin desires for reform in turkey and for wider prosperity he challenges those who have traditionally reserved power and wealth for themselves at least to yield pride of place to different elite while his ultimate direction and success remain to be seen at this time erdogan is the only partner capable of advancing toward the us vision of successful democratic turkey integrated into europe edelman
