1226 classified by pol minister counselor susan elliott for reason 14 d 1 c summary the prosecution in the khodorkovskiylebedev trial has finished reading its 188 volumes of evidence and has moved on to questioning witnesses an observer for the international bar association stated his belief that the trial is being conducted fairly related events outside of russia continue to affect the case deposition in us court by price waterhouse coopers pwc may show that pwc received gor pressure to disavow its prior yukos audits the russian supreme court upheld an echr ruling that lebedevs initial arrest was illegal and an arbitration court in the hague found russia to be bound by the energy charter treaty leaving it open to large judgment against it and possible seizure of gor assets abroad by yukos shareholders despite the cases wide implications it continues to be cause celebre only for foreigners and minority of russians the case also shows the great lengths that the gor is willing to go in order to place rule of law gloss on politically motivated trial end summary recent developments 2 c the trial of former yukos chief mikhail khodorkovskiy and his associate platon lebedev continues in moscows khaminovsky court having moved from the reading of the prosecutions evidence which comprised 188 volumes and lasted throughout the summer to questioning of the prosecutions witnesses thus far the prosecution has called 31 of its 250 witnesses meaning that the trial will probably last until 2012 xxxxxxxxxxxx told us december 23 that he believes the trial is being conducted fairly and that judge danilkin has been doing everything in his power to make sure that the defense gets fair opportunity to present arguments and challenge the prosecutions evidence 3 c among recent developments in the case the defense has been trying to introduce the testimony of former price waterhouse coopers pwc auditor who was deposed in california in august by khodorkovskiy lawyers the prosecution has objected to the introduction of the deposition into the case complaining that they had not received sufficient notice however according to teets the russian embassy did not inform the head investigator in russia until recently the pwc deposition goes to the heart of yukoss guilt or innocence as yukoss auditor it signed off on yukoss financial statements from 1994 to 2003 only to disavow this prior approval in 2007 as xxxxxxxxxxxx noted if the audits were properly withdrawn this will be black mark for the defense if not it could help the defense but would greatly tarnish pwcs international reputation teets said that the content of the deposition had not yet been made public but speculated that the auditor had testified that pwc had been pressured by the russian government into withdrawing its prior certifications of yukos books and records lebedev ruling and other international issues 4 sbu the yukos battle continues simultaneously both on domestic and the international fronts with some concrete effects on the cases proceedings in moscow on december 23 the russian supreme court ruled that the 2003 decision to arrest and detain lebedev was illegal in keeping with 2007 ruling by the european court of human rights echr note the gor often loses cases at the echr and its common practice is to pay the compensation required by the echrs rulings while ignoring the substantive redress of the systemic problem involved this decision represents rare departure from this practice and signals potentially encouraging trend end note the supreme courts ruling indicated only that the first two months of lebedevs six years to date of incarceration were illegal and thus might be considered only marginally relevant however the defense might use this ruling to argue that the entire conviction was tainted by the illegal detention and therefore should be thrown out defense lawyers told radio free europe that they have not yet decided how to proceed but called the ruling victory while expressing bewilderment at the supreme courts twoyear delay in ruling on the case 5 sbu on december 23 moscows basmanny court issued an arrest warrant in absentia for former yukos treasurer andrey leonovich which khodorkovskiys lawyers called ploy to pressure witnesses and which will likely further exacerbate tensions with the uk where leonovich now resides over the issue of extraditions this move follows december 2 ruling by an international arbitration tribunal in the hague that russia is bound by the energy charter treaty ect thus requiring the gor to defend itself against claims from yukos shareholders for an estimated 100 billion usd in damages ref this sum would be the largest arbitration award ever representing 10 percent of russias gdp and although collecting the entire amount would be difficult it could allow shareholders to seize state assets outside of russia the ect ruling could affect among others companies such as royal dutch shell and bp who were forced to renegotiate contracts on terms favorable to the gor russians apathetic but skeptical towards gor 6 sbu given such significant international implications to the case and given khodorkovskiys former stature one might expect large amount of focus on the yukos case inside russia however most russians continue to pay scant attention ref b according to december poll by the levada center encompassing 1600 respondents in 127 cities and villages only little more than onethird of russians are following the case may levada poll showed the same figure for people who were at all aware that the case existed the same poll however revealed notable divergence in public opinion from the party line maintained by prime minister vladimir putin in his december 3 televised question and answer session with the public putin defended the legitimacy of khodorkovskiys incarceration and accused khodorkovskiy of also being murderer he also claimed that all of the earnings from the sale of yukos were being funneled into the countrys housing and utilities fund the levada poll however showed that 65 percent of respondents did not believe putins claim about the housing fund and 50 percent believed that putin should be summoned as witness in the case khodorkovskiy starting to lose hope 7 sbu khodorkovskiy and lebedev have consistently maintained an upbeat demeanor frequently smiling and laughing during the proceedings and chatting buoyantly with supporters over the course of his imprisonment khodorkovskiy has written series of philosophical articles printed in liberal papers such as vedomosti that have amounted to shadow policy papers of the type that he might write if he were one of the presidents advisors he had also expressed faith that the russian court system would exhibit sufficient fairness and rule of law and judge danilkin sufficient independence to acquit him in recent months khodorkovskiy has made pessimistic statements that he does not expect ever to be freed by all accounts in 2003 khodorkovskiy did not believe he would actually be arrested his thinking here seems to following similar trajectory from naive refusal to believe what is happening to the gradual sinking in of the reality of his situation comment 8 c the fact that legal procedures are apparently being meticulously followed in case whose motivation is clearly political may appear paradoxical it shows the effort that the gor is willing to expend in order to save face in this case by applying superficial ruleoflaw gloss to cynical system where political enemies are eliminated with impunity it is not lost on either elite or mainstream russians that the gor has applied double standard to the illegal activities of 1990s oligarchs if it were otherwise virtually every other oligarch would be on trial alongside khodorkovskiy and lebedev there is widespread understanding that khodorkovskiy violated the tacit rules of the game if you keep out of politics you can line your pockets as much as you desire most russians believe the khodorkovskiy trial is politically motivated they simply do not care that it is human rights activists in general have an uphill battle in overcoming public apathy and cynicism but nowhere more so than in the khodorkovskiy case we will continue to monitor the case as it unfolds rubin
