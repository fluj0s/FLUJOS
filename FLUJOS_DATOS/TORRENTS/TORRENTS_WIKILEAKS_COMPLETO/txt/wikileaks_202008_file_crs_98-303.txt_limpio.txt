current activity march 27 1998 jonathan sanford analyst in international political economy foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report examines the population or family planning activities financed by the international financial institutions ifis based on survey of their activities only the world bank and the asian development bank currently fund family planning projects the regional multilateral development banks do not fund projects in this area the international monetary fund also does not finance projects brief reference is made to the international framework for family planning activity approved by the international conference on population and development held in cairo in 1994 tables are included listing all family planning programs funded by the world bank and adb between 1993 and 1997 the report will be updated if the ifis should institute significant policy changes in this area international financial institutions and population programs summary congress has been considering legislation to approve us participation in an expansion of the financial resources of the international monetary fund imf and to appropriate annual funding for the multilateral development banks mdbs in that context members of congress have raised questions whether the international financial institutions that is the imf and mdbs finance population or family planning programs and whether their programs in this area finance abortion this paper describes the policies and the activities of the imf and the multilateral banks in this regard the international monetary fund does not finance projects in its borrower countries in particular it does not finance projects aimed at helping countries provide family planning services or other activities aimed at limiting the growth of their population the united nations conference on population and development held in cairo in september 1994 identified number of important issues and highlighted roles that bilateral and multilateral agencies could play regarding this issue it did not specify any role for the imf in this issue the imf managing director in his address to the conference emphasized that rapid economic growth was principal means for cutting the link between poverty and rapid population growth and for creating the domestic environment in which countries could complete the transition to appropriate fertility levels the world bank and asian development bank adb regularly lend to help countries undertake family planning and population programs between 1993 and 1997 the world bank lent an estimated 870 million and the adb allocated 65 million for family planning activities this was approximately 1 of total world bank lending and two tenths of 1 of adb total lending for this period in recent years the world bank and adb have moved from funding freestanding family planning programs towards programs that treat family planning as one element in more comprehensive health program the adb does not finance abortion and it normally allows other foreign aid providers to fund the purchase of contraceptive materials the world bank finances the purchase of contraceptives in recent years the world bank has begun to shift its focus in the health sector from one of supporting specific autonomous projects to one of supporting comprehensive multi donor programs to strengthen national health care systems in the process in countries where abortion is legal and abortion services are supplied by government health providers bank loans may help support institutions that provide that service notwithstanding general understanding that the bank does not fund abortion programs one instance has been identified where the world bank has financed the purchase of suction equipment with the explicit understanding that it will be used for the medical termination of pregnancy the interamerican development bank european bank for reconstruction and development and african development bank do not finance family planning or population projects contents international

development bank lending for population programs 19931996 18 international financial institutions and population programs in 1997 and 1998 congress has been considering legislation to approve us participation in an expansion of the financial resources of the international monetary fund imf and to authorize annual funding for the multilateral development banks mdbs in that context some members of congress have raised questions about whether the international financial institutions ifis that is the imf and mdbs finance population or family planning programs and whether their programs in this area finance abortion this paper describes the policies and the activities of the imf and the mdbs in this regard in particular it analyzes several projects that the multilateral banks have said are exemplars of their activity and their approach to population or family planning issues development is by its very nature process entailing fundamental change development agencies often act as catalysts urging or pushing countries to consider changes in their perceptions policies procedures and priorities along this line the international financial institutions ifis often make significant effort to encourage countries to consider new ideas and new ways of dealing with their problems even so the international financial institutions ifis are hesitant about imposing social or cultural values on countries governments may be unwilling to accept the imposition of values that contradict their countries basic cultural norms and the backlash against pressure of this sort can have farreaching negative effect on the an ifis relationship with that country additionally borrower countries have considerable influence within the ifis themselves in the asian development bank adb interamerican development bank idb and african development bank afdb regional countries own majority of the voting stock and have substantial influence in the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd the borrower countries or non regional countries that are borrowers from other mdbs control only 127 of the voting stock however western european countries that share close cultural similarities with the borrower countries in eastern and central europe own an additional 65 of ebrd voting stock industrial countries own majority of the voting stock in the imf and all the loans windows of the world bank but developing countries have significant share of the vote 39 in the imf 43 in the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd world banks marketrate loan window and 38 in the international development association ida the world banks concessional loan facility this gives the borrower countries considerable influence as well as sense of participation and ownership that encourages cooperation and helps diminish potential donorrecipient tensions within the multilateral bodies crs2 the ifis do not implement projects or programs directly rather they help finance programs or projects implemented by their borrower country governments or the governments subsidiaries or designees the ifis may have substantial role in the project design process they may require in connection with structural adjustment loans that borrower countries adopt economic policy reforms the latter find painful for project loans the ifis may require borrowers take financial technical organizational or legal steps deemed necessary for the success of proposed project these conditions are generally related to the goal of project effectiveness and normally consistent with the principle set forth in their charters1 that only economic considerations shall be relevant to ifi decisions in general the international financial institutions are sensitive to the cultural values and religious belief systems of their borrower countries considering the influence that borrower countries have in the banks and the stipulation that only economic considerations should be relevant the ifis tend to be circumspect about issues likely to offend the cultural or moral sensitivities of their borrower countries this is particularly true as regards issues such as family planning developing countries vary considerably in their attitudes and cultural norms activities and policies that are deemed acceptable or appropriate in some developing countries are not acceptable in others it is in this context that the multilateral agencies finance their social sector lending international monetary fund the imf does not make projects loans and in particular it does not make loans to finance population or family planning programs imf loans are intended to help the borrower countries stabilize their economic situation and cover and ultimately reverse chronic deficits in their balance of payments generally countrys central bank is the borrower and recipient of the imf funds it uses the proceeds to help cover the countrys international payment obligations debts imports etc to receive an imf loan the borrower country must file letter of intent with the imf describing the steps it will take to rectify its economic situation when the imf approves loan it opens up line of credit for the borrower country and it disburses money against that line of credit when the country shows that it has met the targets and schedule specified in its letter of intent in april 1994 the joint imfworld bank ministerial committee on the transfer of resources to developing countries development committee discussed issues relating to the upcoming united nations conference on population and development held in cairo that september the participants on the development committee are high ranking financial officials minister of finance or equivalent in their home countries the press communique issued following the development committee meeting reported that the participants agreed that the worlds population was likely to double in the next fifty years if it continued growing at its present rate and they said the massive economic social political and environmental 1 see for example articles of agreement of the international bank for reconstruction and development article iv section 10 tias 1503 tias 5929 crs3 consequences of these changes cannot be ignored the ministers agreed that people should have the right to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children they also said that family planning is only one of the available instruments and needs to be seen in the broader context of changing social patterns and the increased awareness of womens role the ministers agreed that more emphasis should be given to improve the primary school enrollment rate improve access to family planning and related health services and to reduce maternal and child mortality in developing countries2 functions for the implementation of these goals were specified for the imf the ministers approved of the fact that the world bank had increased its lending for population health nutrition and education programs and they welcomed the banks willingness to respond to further requests in those areas they said they recognized that the bank is not the principal organization concerned with population but that its policy dialog and wider operations give it unique opportunity to promote population policies they called on the bank donors other multilaterals such as unfpa and borrower country governments to collaborate fully in operations and in mobilizing the institutional and financial resources needed3 the press communique issued following the development committees october 1994 meeting reports that the ministers welcomed the outcome of the recent united nations conference on population and development and they called on the world bank and conference participants to play an active role in implementing the program of action approved by the conference4 role was specified for the imf the imf annual reports for 1994 and 1995 reprinted the press communiques issued by the development committee as well as copies of resolutions adopted by the imf interim committee and the imf executive board during those years the imf has made official statements regarding family planning or population policy the closest thing to this may be the address 5 to the 1994 population conference in cairo by imf managing director michel camdessus in which he noted that rapid population growth in the context of poverty was the source of many serious problems the central concern he said is the need for more economic growth this will raise living standards and create the domestic environment needed to complete the transition to appropriate fertility levels to achieve highquality growth he maintained countries need sound macroeconomic policies appropriate structural policies trade and exchange regime open to international trade and investment good governance and effective social policies 2 joint ministerial committee

education for girls and women and enable people to exercise freely and responsibly their rights of parenthood including the number and spacing of their children the principal focus of his remarks addressed the need for improved economic policies in developing countries and international cooperation to create more open world economic system except for the above references to action by the development committee the imf does not mention population or family planning in its recent annual reports action by the executive board on this subject is mentioned and publications or studies on this topic are listed in the back of its annual reports the world bank world bank policy the world bank regularly lends to help countries undertake family planning programs it has made loans for this purpose from its marketrate loan window the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and from its concessional loan facility the international development association ida the international finance corporation ifc and multilateral investment guarantee agency miga the banks affiliates oriented towards private sector activity have not been active in this area the world bank published book in 19946 in connection with the population conference in cairo outlining its position regarding population programs it makes five basic points 1 slowing population growth is still high priority in the poorest countries 2 population policy should be integrated with social policies that address range of poverty reduction and human development objectives 3 population programs should provide the poor with access to highquality useroriented services that offer range of choices for fertility regulation and other reproductive health needs 4 country specific strategies are required and 5 other demographic issues such as urbanization migration and aging must also be addressed the book says there is growing consensus that population policy objectives should be integrated with broader social development goals and that population program strategies should build on the linkages between demographic behavior and social and economic progress in particular it says interventions which are responsive to individual needs and aspirations are not only better from humanitarian and social development perspective but also more effective in lowering fertility than are programs driven by topdown demographic targets for the most part the book treats the prevalence of resort to abortion as an issue of concern especially the use of abortion as means of fertility control in some countries ukraine for example with moderate rates of population growth it also notes that women in poor countries may resort to abortion when the inadequacies in available methods leads to contraceptive failure the book argues that the level of 6 world bank population and development implications for the world bank washington dc august 1994 crs5 contraceptive use will go up the health of women will be improved and rates of abortion will go down if women and girls are educated if family planning becomes an aspect of basic health programs and if patients are able to select from range of modern methods the birth control methods most appropriate for themselves the book notes in box 11 that the idea of offering project staff or prospective recipients financial inducements in order to achieve numerical targets for the use of specific birth control techniques is controversial and dubious it says that targets if needed should be stated in terms of the proportion of individuals who are provided with quality services rather than specific reductions in the fertility rate or adoption of particular methods the book also argues in box 62 that services for the management of unwanted pregnancy including medical termination of pregnancy where permitted is part of the essential womens health package it recommends it says in the text that the components of the package will vary on countryby country basis depending on local needs and institutional and financial capacity in his introduction to the volume armeane choki thenvice president for human resource development and operations policy at the bank emphasized the need for action to reduce maternal and child mortality in developing countries to increase womens education and to raise their economic and social status such investments are beneficial in their own right he said and will also help slow rapid population growth likewise he said sustainable economic growth is prerequisite for human development and for completion of the demographic transition current practice in its 1997 annual report the world bank indicated that it is trying to more closely link population policies with reproductive health policies thus integrating them into poverty reduction effort and the overall development agenda it said that two projects approved that year 100 million loan to argentina and 248 million loan to india illustrate this approach the argentine loan helps fund the second phase of the countrys maternal health and child welfare program all provinces that elect to participate in the argentina government program must provide the same package of services the program aims to reduce the rates of childhood and maternal mortality in argentina through immunization improved nutrition and better prenatal neonatal and postpartum maternal care it also provides family planning services the world bank estimates that approximately 31 of the money from the loan will be used to fund reproductive health activities it has separate figure for family planning alone spokesmen for the potential beneficiaries and for relevant nongovernmental organization ngos are supposed to participate in the design and implementation of the program there is indication in the project documents7 whether particular birth control methods will be emphasized or whether project staff will receive incentives to encourage increased utilization of this aspect of the program the documents seem to suggest however that womens participation in the family planning aspect of the program 7 world bank project appraisal document for proposed loan in the amount of us1000 million to the argentine republic for second maternal and child health and nutrition project april 24 1997 report 16419ar crs6 will be voluntary the private sector provides most of the medical care in argentina government programs are basically supplemental and directed at specific needs abortion is not legal in argentina the loan to india helps finance an expansion of the governments family welfare program in 19 rural or tribal areas and 7 urban slums the combined population of the areas to be served is about 36 million persons according to the world bank project appraisal document8 the project aims at reducing maternal and infant mortality and morbidity and unwanted fertility thereby eventually contributing to stabilization of population growth it focuses on helping women and children below five years of age by improving health during reproductive years and early childhood and by enabling couples to space or limit births the total cost of expanding the family welfare program through this project is about 309 million over five years of which 284 million will be provided by ida the world bank says the family welfare program is component of the indian government health care system when all other costs are included and allowance is made for the input by the national and state governments and other donors the world bank estimates that it is financing about 15 of the cost of the health care system the indian project will reportedly use participatory management approach to family planning the project appraisal document says this model previously called the target free approach removes management incentives that have placed excessive focus on achieving annual methodspecific contraceptive acceptor targets the removal of all such targets or incentives by the government of india is specified condition the world bank required for execution of the loan the world bank document says that different types of contraception will be available depending on the preference of the user to meet the needs of people at different stages of their life cycle it is the central hypothesis of the project that more clientoriented service which offers greater contraceptive choice and the ability to give attention to reproductive health needs will together with reductions in infant and child mortality increase the utilization of family planning services in effect it says this means shift away from permanent methods sterilization to temporary methods which allow control over the spacing of births the india loan document provides comprehensive description of the family welfare programs package of essential rch reproductive and child health services that will be provided by the project in the section outlining procedures for the prevention and management of unwanted pregnancy p 105 it mentions oral contraceptives condoms tubal ligations and vasectomies iuds with required screening for contraindications and counseling and medical termination of pregnancy within first trimester or referral to district health center for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester9 ngo and private sector services will be involved in the delivery of services though the public sector will continue to play the 8 world bank project appraisal document india reproductive and child health project april 29 1997 report 16393in 9 among the items to purchased in conjunction with the project are suction apparatus equipment for the medical termination of pregnancy p 36 crs7 central role ngos and beneficiaries will be involved in monitoring implementation of the program the world bank estimates that half the proceeds from the 248 million loan will be used for reproductive health activities separate figure for family planning is available because of the high levels of poverty governmentrun programs account for substantial share of the medical care available in india abortion is legal in india and is regularly available through the health care system administered by the national government or by individual indian states the indian loan underscores what seems to be an emerging trend in foreign aid funding in the health sector consolidated multidonor funding for general health care systems rather than targeted singledonor funding for specific activities according to the world bank foreign aid donors often have focused in the past on particular diseases or on specific issues such as immunization family planning nutrition maternal and child health or family planning separate administrative structures needed to be created to administer each program in order to assure that project funds were used for only the designated purposes and to guarantee that the policy or procedural requirements for each donor were met the result could be hodgepodge of fiefdoms where programs addressing the same problem could have different requirements depending on the source of funding and the recipient countrys ability to fund its overall health care system could be limited by the requirement that it provide local currency counterpart funds to match the foreign aid money provided for the special programs because the overall composition of the health care system was often beyond the scope of their individual projects foreign aid donors sometimes lacked opportunities to address general issues of priority and emphasis countries could use their own money to finance hightech medical treatment facilities for elites for example while expecting foreign aid agencies to help cover the cost of basic care for the general public the move towards consolidated funding is reportedly an effort to remedy this situation the recipient country government includes the issues of special concern in its national health care system and the donor agencies each agree to underwrite specific share of the systems cost as long as items are on the approved list of goods and services that will be financed and they meet the procedural requirements for procurement international competitive bidding for example the world bank will disburse funds to support its agreed percentage share of particular aspect of the indian care system from an operational or administrative perspective the many development specialists view this new approach as an improvement it is more efficient it involves less micromanagement and it gives the world bank and other foreign aid providers opportunities to influence the overall composition of the countries health care systems from policy perspective however the new approach limits foreign aid donors scope of policy choice in the past there was general understanding that the world bank did not finance abortion in its family planning or population programs if developing country wanted to include abortion on its menu of possible services it could seek bilateral funding from countries that offered such assistance under the new approach however the world bank and other donors all finance share of all the medical services provided by the national health regime if abortion is one of the medical services the system offers then in effect the foreign aid donors will finance share of that service along with the other system costs crs8 in the case of the india loan the world bank seems to have accepted the idea that the indian government should make the basic policy decisions in this area even though it will be paying roughly 90 of the costs for the particular functions covered by the loan and it stated in the project document that the suction equipment financed by the loan equipment that can have nonabortion related medical uses would be provided for the purpose of medical termination of pregnancy world bank staff argue that they do not advocate abortion or believe that it is an appropriate birth control technique they say the bankfunded family planning programs such as the one in india are likely to reduce the incidence of abortion because they assure women access to adequate contraception they also say that other bank programs such as education for girls have an intended effect over time in reducing the incidence of abortion they say the bank will not allow its funds to be used for sexselection activities or to fund population programs in countries where such practices are likely to be supported world bank funding for family planning programs 19931997 the world bank reports that between 1993 and 1997 all but 14 of its 106 loans in the population health and nutrition sector and 2 of the loans in its social sector involved reproductive health population and family planning activities are included in the total for reproductive health activities since 1995 the world bank has not regularly reported figures for population programs alone table 1 at the end of this report shows all the loans since 1993 that reportedly help fund reproductive health activities the total amount for the 94 loans was 708 billion the bank says that 196 billion of this funded reproductive health activities analysis of the data suggests however that the world banks emphasis on family planning and reproductive health is probably less than these figures would suggest four of the projects on table 1 dealt only with the prevention and treatment of sexuallytransmitted disease aids etc clearly an important issue but different one from the subject addressed in this report several other projects some of them very large had reported outlays for reproductive health these are shown as na not available on the table it is not evident why the world bank included them on its list furthermore of the 70 projects designed to finance the delivery of health services only 33 allocated third or more of their resources for reproductive health many devoted only small fraction for this purpose in 1993 and 1994 the world bank channeled into population or family planning programs some 75 of the 446 million it lent to fund reproductive health activities other than those targeting sexually transmitted disease if this trend continued during the period 1995 through 199710 then one can estimate that 870 million of the 118 billion the world bank lent for reproductive health programs other than the suppression of sexually transmitted disease during those years went to fund family planning for the period 1993 through 1997 the total would be about 121 billion 10 this assumption may not be sound however as the model used for family planning after 1994 involved considerably larger outlay for medical care than did the model used before that date crs9 this is 17 of the total the world bank lent committed in the population health and nutrition sector and 1 of the total it lent for all purposes during this period the asian development bank adb policy the asian development also lends to help support population or family planning programs in borrower countries most of its loans for this purpose have been funded by its concessional loan window the asian development fund adf though projects in the more economically advanced regional countries such as indonesia have funded by the adbs regular marketrate loan program the adbs policy in this area is set forth in policy paper11 published in 1994 in preparation for the cairo population conference that year the study said that integration of family planning with health and community development efforts as fully as possible is the preferred route to sustaining fertility decline in the context of general improvement in human welfare this replaced an earlier strategy described in 1991 adb publication which said that population and health issues could be dealt with separately12 the 1994 study said that particular emphasis should be given to programs that reduce maternal and child mortality improve prenatal neonatal reproductive health and child welfare and expand female education the approach stresses the availability of service wide choice of methods and reliable followup activity to monitor results the sector study said the crucial variable is the educated and healthy asian woman able to manage her productive and reproductive life in the best interest of family and society the report also specified that future health projects should consider integrating population components unless there is prohibitive reason for not doing so the policy statement said there should be clear distinction between public polices that encourage couples to have fewer children and policies that coerce couples in this respect protection of this most intimate right planning ones family is the sine qua non of humane population policy it concluded it also said that evidence regarding effectiveness does not provide convincing rationale for fertility policies involving clienttargeted financial incentives or various forms of coercion the document does not address the issue of abortion it indicated though that provision of wider and more appropriate choice of birth control methods appropriate to prospective users should encourage use of contraception and lessen the incidence of unwanted pregnancy the adb study found that there are four types of developing countries in the region those with little or concern some concern moderate concern or high 11 asian development bank population policy framework for assistance in the population sector manila 1994 approved by the adb board of directors july 12 1994 12 asian development bank health population and development in asia and the pacific manila 1991 approved by the president of the adb april 11 1991 crs10 concern about population planning and population issues the approach that the bank takes for each type of country will vary in countries with little or only some concern the report said the bank should gather information consult with officials and provide technical assistance population activities might be component of adb education or health loans in these countries on the other hand in countries where there is greater concern about population issues the report said the adb should undertake detailed studies it should help the country strengthen the relevant institutions and policies and it should finance integrated population and family planning projects or even standalone population projects when appropriate the study said that resources for population activities need to be concentrated in dmcs developing member countries that face acute populationresource problems and have not been able to bring down population growth rates sufficiently in the past it identified afghanistan bangladesh bhutan cambodia india laos nepal pakistan philippines and vietnam as being of particular concern current practice the adb said in its 1996 annual report the most recent report available that its main objective for the health and population subsector is to improve the quality of services increase efficiency and widen access particularly for women and children to primary health care and family planning services the annual report emphasized in particular health projects the adb had agreed to fund in cambodia indonesia and vietnam the adb also approved another project involving family planning that year not mentioned in the health section of the annual report in pakistan the adb has also made public its country economic reviews for cambodia vietnam and pakistan consequently it is possible to see how the population projects approved in 1996 fit into the adbs analysis and policy framework for those countries funded jointly by the adb the world bankida and the german export finance agency the adbs 43 million loan to vietnam in 1996 for population and family health project emphasizes safe motherhood and family health in order to improve population services in 15 provinces having population of 20 million persons the adb estimates that about 86 million of the total will be used specifically to fund family planning activities ida is financing the purchase of all contraceptive supplies and the family planning health delivery services in 5 provinces the adb will fund the delivery of these services in 10 other provinces the project will involve the private sector and ngos in the provision of services it will offer broader variety of modern contraceptive methods the adb believes this will help reduce reliance on iuds and sterilization with their attendant problems of infection overuse and nonuse by younger women it also believes this will also reduce the number of abortions abortion is legal in vietnam the project emphasizes health care for mothers and children and education on family health there is indication in the project proposal13 how vietnams current policies 13 asian development bank report and recommendation of the president to the board of directors on proposed loan to the socialist republic of viet nam for the population and continued crs11 limiting family size will be related to the program or if program staff will have incentives to encourage public participation in the program the project document says population growth is major problem in vietnam the adb country economic review for vietnam14 mentions the population issue only in passing it focuses instead on the flow of people from rural to urban areas that are unprepared to receive so many new residents one sentences says reduction in the population growth rate would lessen the pressure in that regard the adbs 200 million loan to pakistan for its social action program project in 1996 funds part of the 15 billion foreign exchange cost of the 7 billion program bilateral foreign aid agencies and the world bank will fund the other foreign exchange costs and the government of pakistan will pay the remaining 55 billion cost the project has four components primary health primary education population welfare and rural water supply and sanitation the adb estimates that of the 200 million provided by the loan 326 million will be used to fund health programs including 73 million for family planning or population activities in the population area the pakistan loan aims to expand coverage by family planning outlets from 40 to 85 of the population by the year 2000 operations will be integrated with the health education and water and sewerage components of the program and decentralized beneficiaries and ngos will be involved in its preparation and implementation there is discussion in the project document15 whether project staff will have targets quotas or incentives to encourage public participation or what types of family planning methods will be available to patients abortion is not legal in pakistan the banks country economic review for pakistan notes that high population growth and low rates of economic growth are major barriers to the elimination of poverty it attributes the countrys high levels of unemployment and underemployment to these problems the primary focus of the country economic review16 centers on ways for promoting economic growth it stresses in particular the need for sound economic policy more investment and saving more foreign investment and judicial and legal reform to facilitate private sector growth discussion of population issues is limited to few early sentences in the study the adbs 20 million loan to cambodia in 1996 funds all the foreign exchange costs and 80 of the total costs for the countrys new basic health services 13 continued family health project august 1996 doc rrpvie 26378 14 asian development bank country economic review socialist

project the objective is to reduce preventable mortality and morbidity particularly for poor women and children in rural communities in five provinces that previously lacked basic health care service there is separate emphasis on family planning the adb reported when queried that none of the funds for the project will be used for family planning activities however depoprovera and progesterone are listed among the medications to be purchased and one of the 18 objectively verifiable indicators is the goal that at least half the married women aged 15 to 45 will know at least three modern methods of birth spacing and source of supply for each the adb country economic review17 lists health and education as areas of major concern but does not mention population growth as factor inhibiting cambodian development improvements in economic policy and performance are the main focus of the review the adbs fourth action in 1996 to help fund family planning was 45 million marketrate loan to indonesia for family health and nutrition project it will provide basic health services to poor villages in five provinces it aims to help families identify their health needs and make informed decisions to address them via public health facilities some 122000 families are potential beneficiaries according to the project document18 each familys health needs will be identified and listed on family health card and families will be responsible for updating the card and taking appropriate action after consulting with health workers capacity buildingand empowerment of the beneficiaries to become responsible for their health are key objectives of the project the document reports the adb reported when queried that funds from the loan are being be used to finance family planning activity the design summary for the project p 41 indicates however that family partnership for health nutrition and family planning is one of the project components and 20 increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate and 20 increase in new family planning users are specified output indicators the project seeks to strengthen the capacity of villagelevel health centers and provide needed resources it will provide resources to community organizations to better support their health initiatives and help them serve as village health committee each village committee will analyze each familys priorities and actions and maintain village health map the project will also support minicampaigns at the local level there is indication in the project document how the family planning aspects of the project will be implemented or what methods will be available to potential users how the privacy of patients will be maintained how patients will be protected from pressure for services they do not desire and

specifically prohibits any use of coercion or inappropriate incentives to influence clients to participate in population programs against their personal wishes or best interests adb staff report that careful review of the projects approved since 1993 reveals that all comply with the letter and the spirit of the banks policy in particular as regards the four projects discussed above adb staff state emphatically that there are cases where coercion or inappropriate incentives have been sanctioned or tolerated in these projects adb staff did not indicate however if specific directives to this effect have been issued to project staff in the four countries or if disciplinary procedures have been specified or used to assure compliance with the policy adb funding for family planning programs

may have been small the combined total for these 10 loans was 494 million the adb says that of this amount about 65 million was to be used to support family planning activities this was approximately
