tax cut bills in 2003 comparison by david l brumbaugh and don c richards this report will be updated as events warrant the proposals size the administration estimates that the ta xcut proposals in its budget will reduce federal revenue by 146 trillion over 10 years and by 4934 b illion over its first five years based on congressional budget office cbo estimates for total revenue and gross domestic product gdp otherwise exp ected over the period the 10year revenue loss amounts to 52 of federa l revenue and 10 of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21420crs2 the revenue impact of the proposal howev er is better seen by separating the proposal into its likely longrun permanent ffects and its more nearterm transitory effects in the nearterm much of the pr oposals revenue cost c onsists of acceleration of the cuts that were previously enacted under the economic growth tax relief and reconciliation act egtrra pl 10716 but that were sche duled to be phased in over number of years according to the administrations estimates for the plans first 5 years the combined elements of the proposal would reduce revenue by 42 of otherwise expected revenues and 08 of gdp between onethird and onehalf of this 41 consists of revenue reductions from acceleration of egtrras tax cuts the longrun picture is different first to comply with procedural rules in the senate egtrra contained pr ovision repealing all of its tax cuts at the end of calendar year 2010 accordingly the presidents propos to make those cuts permanent will not register its full revenue effect until after the expiration is sc heduled to take place in fiscal year 2012 and beyond second the provisions of the current proposal that would accelerate egtrras tax cuts do not impose add itional costs in the long run the cost of the acceleration is confined to the first six to eight years of the plan for these reasons the longrun permanent revenue effect of the presidents proposal is best seen by looking at the revenue estimates for the plans out years according to the administrations estimates the revenue loss in fy2013 woul d be 2991 billion or again using cbo projections to scale the estimated loss 81 of otherwise expected revenues and 17 of gdp in fy2013 2035 billion of the re venue loss would be from extension of egtrras tax cut in terms of its longr general revenue effect the proposal can thus be summarized as reducing tax revenue by 55 so as to make egtrras tax cuts permanent plus providing roughly lf again as much in new tax cuts components of the plan table 1 presents the administrations estimate s of the revenue cost of the plans major components for its first 5 years its first 10 years and in keeping with the considerations outlined above for fy2013 the table listings can be separated into three groups the economic growth or stimulus pack age extension of egtrras tax cuts the plans tax incentives and other tax cuts on the basis of the numbers in the table the stimulus package would account for most about twothirds of the plans revenue cost in the proposals early years but falls to less than onequarter by 2013 the cancelling of egtrras expiration on the other hand accounts fo r very small part of the plans cost in its first 5 years but rises to over two thirds by 2013 among the other provisions the largest are generally extension of set of ex piring tax benefits that are not part of egtrra the socalled extenders tax benefits for health care and tax benefits related to charitable giving the provisions are descri bed in more detail in the following

proposals p 3 4 blue chip economic indicators jan 10 2003 p 1progress at the time with the economy contr acting during the first three quarters of 2001 since then the economy has registered positiv rates of growth and the administration has acknowledged that the economy continues to recover and long run fundamentals are solid with low inflation nd strong productivity growth3 nonetheless the administration has stated that the recovery is slow with busine sses expanding production slowly and too few jobs being created outside the administration economists also viewed the pace of the recovery in 2002 as disappointing but generally expect economic growth to gather momentum over the cour of 2003 despite lin gering uncertainties4 as described below in the report s last section however not ll analysts have concluded tax cut is the appropria economic remedy the stimulus portion of the presidents propos consists of the following elements acceleration to 2003 tax cuts phased in gradually under egtrra the specific reductions are cuts in individual income tax rates scheduled to be fully effective under egtrra in 2006 tax cuts for married couples scheduled to be phased in over 20052010 and an increase in the child tax credit also currently scheduled for 20052010 tax integration or elimination of individual income tax on corporate source equity income dividends and capital gains under current law corporate equity income is taxed twice once under the corporate income tax and once when received by stockhol ders as dividends or capital gains according to economic theory the double taxation reduces economic efficiency by diverting capital from the corporate sector to other sectors of the economy eg housing the administration would exclude dividends from individuals taxabl income and would in effect eliminate tax on capital gains by per mitting stockholders to increase their basis deduction when they calculate their capital gains tax increase in the expensing allowanc for business investment under current law firms are permitted to deduct in the year of purchase expense up to 25000 of equipmen t acquisitions the allowance is reduced for amounts by which investment exceeds 200000 thus restricting its use to relatively small businesses expensing confers tax benefit by speeding up tax deductions that firm s would ordinarily have to spread over the life of the equipment as depreciation the administration proposes to increas the annual allowance to 75000 and the beginning of the phaseout threshold to 325000 4000 increase in the individual alternative minimum tax amt exemption for individuals the increase would expire after 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21420crs5 making egtrras tax cuts permanent senate procedural rule the byrd rul provides that point of order can be raised against any provision of budget rec onciliation bill that is extraneous to the budget reconciliation legi slation included among the seve ral types of provisions the byrd rule defines as extraneous ar those that would increase th budget deficit or reduce the budget surplus for fiscal year beyond th at covered by the rec onciliation measure being considered to avoid app lication of the byrd rule egtrra contained language providing for the expiration of its provisions at the end of calendar year 2010 over the course of 2002 the house passe d several bills that would have made some or all of egtrras cuts permanent but the senate di d not act on them the presidents proposal would rescind the expiration of all of egtrras tax cuts other provisions the remaining elements of the presidents proposal fall into the following categories tax incentives trade tax administration and unemployment insurance tax simplification and other proposal s and extension of expiri ng provisions not included in egtrra the principal tax incentives are as follows tax benefits for charitable giving in terms of revenue cost the largest of these would be deduction allo wable to nonitemizer s an abovethe line deduction for charitable donati ons and taxfree withdrawal for charitable donations from iras tax cuts for education including refundable tax credit for the costs of switching attendance from failing pub lic school and an abovetheline deduction for certain outofpocket expenses of teachers tax benefits relate d to health care including refundable tax credit for the

for energy production and conservation prominent among these are tax credit for production of gas from landfills tax credit for the purchase of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles and tax credit for residential solar energy systems among the remaining proposals the most prominent simplification measure is structuring of the tax codes individual retirement account ira taxfavored savings benefit under the plan iras would be re placed with two sorts of taxfavored accountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21420crs6 5 see for example the views reported in kath erine m stimmel and nancy ognanovich senate democratic moderates opposition puts fate of white house plan in flux bna daily tax report jan 9 2003 p gg1 6 the proposal is described on the democrats si of the house budget committees web site httpwwwhousegovbudget_democratsanalyses house_dem_stimulushtm the estimated revenue loss over 10 years is smaller than the projected loss in 2003 and is likely the result of the plans depreciation component which sh ifts deductions to 2003 from future years 7 the proposal is described on senator daschles web site at httpdaschlesenategovpdf democraticplanpdf lifetime savings accounts which could be used for any type of saving and retirement savings accounts which would be restricted to retirement saving contribution limits would be 7500 per year for each type of account the administrative portions of the propos would increase rather than reduce revenues and include changes to the 1998 irs restructuring legislati on tighter restrictions on the deductibility of interest payments to related firms earnings stripping and an increase in restrictions on tax shelte rs the proposal would also extend or make permanent number of tax be nefits not included in egtrra that are scheduled to expire at various times prominent among the extended provisions are the research and experimentation tax credit which the plan would make permanent the work opportunity tax credit and welfaretow ork tax credit which the plan would also modify and certain amt re lief for individuals other proposals the presidents tax proposals have been cr iticized by some congressional democrats and others on three general grounds that th plan will dispropor tionately favor upper income individuals that it is overly costly in terms of lost tax revenues and will expand the federal budget deficit and that
