economy is beginning to recove r from its third recession over the past twelve years this lost decade of the 1990s and slow growth means that japanese gross domestic product is as much as 13 trillion dollars equiva lent to brazils gdp below what it could have been if it d continued to grow at the 36 rate it did in the 1980s japans economy faces three basic problems the first is the legacy of the bursting of the economic bubble in 1989 that includes large accumulation of nonperforming bank loans and deflation th second is the current global recession and the third is globalization the largest immediate economic probl em for japan is the 4177 billion in nonperforming loans held by its financia l sector despite decade of government programs which critics call halfhearted to strengthen japanese banks and private efforts to clean up the financial mess this is causing credit to contract monetary policy to be less effective and contri butes to the ongoing recession economic policymakers realize that if they do not act aggressively market forces may accomplish what policy will not japane government bonds already are being downgraded bankruptcies are rising ma jor capital flight out of yen denominated assets could occur premium on borrowi ng by japanese banks could return or financial instability could begin in japan that could spread to other countries in move that reflects near desperation in september 2002 the bank of japan announced that it would consider directly purchasing stock shares held by more than dozen japanese banks in octobe r prime minister koizumi reshuffled his cabinet to enhance the authority of reformist leaders and promised aggressi ve action by month end the bush administration has become mo re vocal in articulating its desires for japan to move forward to rehabilitate its econom and has advocated that japan cut taxes and clean up the bad loan problem to spur investment nd economic recovery in the security area japan responded to the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states by approving new laws that allowed its selfdefense forces to directly assist the usled war on terrorism the japanese navy was sent to the indian ocean to transport nonlethal supplie s and provide fuel and othe r supplies to us forces this was the first time since world war ii that japans navy had been allowed to operate outside of its

hi ghlevel japanese government officials members of the diet business leaders and us embassy officials for brevity this report deals prima rily with those topics discussed in japan even though other topics also may be of interest to the congress for additional information and analysis see other crs products on japan2 introduction japan currently is mixture of incongruities it has some of the largest banks in the world but total credit in the economy is declining as banks struggle to whittle down an accumulation of more than 400 billion in nonperforming loans it is the second largest single economy in the world with worldclass corporations but it is just beginning to recover from its third recession in decade the talk in japan is of hard times and real estate bust but streets are teeming with shoppers and in tokyo building cranes perch atop rising skyscrapers3 the government has enacted legislation that allowed the country to nd its navy in support of the afghan war effort outside the defense of its territory for the first time since world war ii but at the same time japans military still is constrained by its usimposed antiwar constitution prime minister koizumi had enjoyed skyhigh approval ratings only to see them plummet over the firing of hi s foreign minister in what one government official described as childrens spat and then see them rise again as he visited north korea and received an unexpectedly positive response on issues of concern to japan his much anticipated economic reforms have scarcely materialized but in october 2002 he shuffled his cabinet to make it more reformist mindedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs2 4 for details see crs report rl31107 steel industry and trade issues by stephen cooney 5 for details see crs report rl31337 japanus cooperation on ba llistic missile defense issues and prospects by richard p croninjapan is concern to the congress because its national interests and societal values overlap considerably with those of the united states despite some friction in trade whaling the environment and agricultural policy next to the european union and canada the united stat generally can count on japan for cooperation and support both bilaterally and in internationa l fora the large size and influence of japans economy particularly the risk of global financ ial turmoil stemming from its poor economic conditions the fl uctuating value of its yen its huge trade surplus with the united states and the critical flow of billions of dollars of japanese capital into foreign markets make japa ns economic performance global concern japan also plays key role in us security policy in asia including the hosting of american bases and cooperation in the antiterror campaign in terms of policies the united states has been visibly articulating its concerns and in cases recommending specific policy actions partly to provide some outside pressure on the koizumi government and partly to help overcome resistance by vested interests and the bank of japan specifically the united states has been recommending that japan 1 stabilize its financial system and avoid financial panic that could add fuel to mounting cerns over financial problems in argentina brazil and other latin american nations 2 clean up the badloan problem among its banks 3 continue to ope n domestic markets particularly in financial services in accord with its world trade organization and other obligations regardless of the threat to japanese industrie s 4 not adopt exchange ra policies that would unduly weaken the yen and harm us business inte rests 5 continue support of the war on terrorism6 take larger security role in world affairs while avoiding conflicts with neighbors and 7 continue to support us forces in japan japans concerns with the united states as articulated by japanese officials to this staff delegation include future cooperation in the war on terrorism us protection of its steel industry4 the state of the us economic recovery and its implications for japanese exports to the united states reducing the footprint of us forces on okinawa including the moving of training off okinawa and returning land being used for bases to local jurisdiction refining the status of forces agreement and future actions on missile defense5 japan also shares us concerns about the future of china chinas economy and co mpetition with japan military trends and demographics in addition japanese industry has compla ined that the process to obtain export licenses on items under us expor t controls is too slow in some cases arbitrary and being handled by understaffed agencies if the process is not improved japanese industry may turn to french nd russian suppliers japan is also unhappy with the space station and nasas plan to scale it back japan is to receive 12 of the capacity for its use under reduced scale plan its allocation of astronaut slots could be cut severely foreign ministry official stated that with respect to relations with the bush administration tokyo feels that it has not been adequately consulted on severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs3 6 in multilateral military

agency httpwwwstatgojpenglishdatageppouindexhtmkmatters particularly the us rejecti on of the kyoto protocol the lack of coordination however did not imply lack of mutual understanding s till japan would like for the united states to follow the three noes for the relationship surprises politicizing of issues and taking japan for granted the japanese side also noted that initially the bush administration intended to raise the priority of relations with japan relative to those with china and to rely less on gaiatsu or outside pressuring of japan to take certain policy actions japans economic crisis japans economy is beginning to recove r from its third recession over the past decade for tokyo this poor economic pe rformance transcends the usual concerns over rising unemployment business bankruptcies and swelling national debt because the countrys national prestige ngs on its economic success without significant international military role japan has sought national purpose and recognition through economic mig ht and checkbook diplomacy6 if japan does not restore health to its economy many japanese feel that the country is in danger of becoming second or thirdrate power the prolonged economic stagnation along with other factors such as the aging of society is destroying the peoples confidence in their corporate system causing them to oversave thereby worsening the recession and eroding their confidence in the ability of their leaders to solve the nations ills some indicators of the seve rity of economic conditions in japan include the rate of unemployment at 54 in august 2002 up from 32 in 1995 this does not include vast hidden unemployment in busine sses that have retained surplus workers or discouraged unemployed workers who ve stopped looking for job business bankruptcies in 2001 reached 19441 cases up from 15046 cases in 1995 and were expected to exceed 20000 in 2002 of the bankruptcies in 2001 30 were in construction 18 in manufactur ing and 33 in wholesale and retail trade between 1995 and 2001 total loans and discount s of banks dropped 12 from 512747 billion in 1995 to 451281 billion at the end of 20017 perhaps the most serious problem in japan is result of the others deflation consumer prices have fallen in four of the past seven years real and stock prices so have fallen half or more from their peaks at the beginning of the 1990s falling prices have resulted in lower rates of consumption ss investment higher saving s and have contributed to the nonperforming loan problem during the 1990s and through 2001 japan grew at an average of 16 down from the average of 39 in the 1980s if ja pan had continued to grow at 39 in the 1990s and through 2001 its real gross domestic product would have been 304 higher at the end of 2001 that it actually was in other words the lost decade of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs4 1990s and its continuation has cost the japanese economy as much as 161 trillion using 1995 prices or about 13 trillion dollars almost as much as the gross domestic product of brazil france or italy japanese government officials insist that the country has ba nking or financial crisis they admit that shortrun problem exists but are confident that in the long run the economy will be all right however in the shortrun if the economy worsens to the point where series of large bankr uptcies occurs causing the exchange value of the yen to plummet and risk premium to be added to interest charges for large japanese borrowers japanese financial crisis could velop that could spread to other countries in the region visitors to japan however look around and ask just where the recession is there are few visible signs of it people are shopping traffic is congested and new stores continue to be ope ned the severity of the economic problem does not meet the eye as one japanese official put it there is huge hole in the keel of ship japan but the passengers are still sipping champagne while the ship is sinking japan needs to focus more on creating new patterns for success rather than finding ways to cushion failures this official conclude d that japan needs to move away from centrally managed economic system to competitive diversity within the economy society at large also s eems fairly complacent about the countrys economic conditions while there is considerable media coverage and di scussion there is sense of crisis at the educated level of the population people are depending on the government to solve the problem there is serious public bate and apparent sense of urgency poor economic conditions also have not deterred american companies from operating in japan most major us companies have subsidiaries or joint ventures there when asked why they are in ja pan and not in countries such as china american executives in japan replied th at 75 of the action and revenues for companies in asia is in japan it makes more sense to locate there than in other asian countries although most also have subs idiaries in those markets if company is not in japan it is not major player at one time american multinational corporations thought that their survival depended on how well they could compete with japanese businesses at home now th at japan is less an economic threat there is less emphasis on that strategy now companies are in japan because it is the second largest market in the world contai ns huge amount of pentup demand in the form of household savings has opened doors to markets b ecause of trade liberalization and is the center for development of much hightechnology particularly in consumer electronics japans economy faces three basic problems the first is the legacy of the bursting of the economic bubble in 1989 that includes large accumulation of nonperforming bank loans and declining real estate and stock values the second is the current global recession cyclical problem resulting from the worldwide downturn in 2001 exacerbated by the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and the pentagon rising pessimism in societ and ineffective monetary and fiscal policies the third is rela ted to globalization including the inability of industries to compete with imports under more liberaliz ed trading regime and the end of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs5 8 jp morgan securities asia japans bank problem is about to see policy action economic research note march 2 2001 9 powell bill were not turning japanese burst stock bubble torpid recovery continuedindustrial catchingup process in which ja pan could grow faster than the more advanced industrial nations by mere ly closing the technological gap burst of the asset bubble during the latter half of the 1980s japans monetary authorities flooded the market with liquidity money in order to enable businesses to cope with the rising value of the yen businesses did invest in new capital equipment to become more competitive in international markets but the excess liquidity also found its way into sp eculation in japans stock market in real estate ventures and in foreign investments at that time the market value of both land and equities was rising so fast that investors and speculators could hardly miss making huge profits from capital gains the larger mistake for them it appeared at the time was not to borrow and make speculative investments and consequently not be positioned to reap returns from rising sset values banks considered most loans with real estate as collatera l as being unquestionably secure when japans economic bubble burst in 1989 causing stock and land prices to plummet the value of colla teral underlying many loan s dropped below the value of their loan principal commercial real tate ventures especially office buildings also became unprofitable as rents fell and vacancies rose as the economy slowed companies faced excess capacity bloated inventories and lower profits as more loans turned sour more of the underlying colla teral had to be sold at bargain prices commercial land values in the six major metropolitan areas peaked in 1991 and by 2000 had fallen by 80 japans nikkei stock market average p eaked in 1989 at 40000 and subsequently had dropped by more than tw othirds to roughly 12000 by august 2001 it sagged even further in early 2002 before recove ring slightly to 11000 by april 1 2002 as the fiscal year ended but then droppe d to around 9000 in september as one business executive in japan stated the c ountry suffers from rational inexuberance in which investor attitudes toward its stock markets are extremely pessimistic but for rational reasons as result of the di smal performance of japans stock market unrealized capital gains on holdings of st ock by major banks which stood at 491 trillion 355 billion in 19898 had dropped to approxima tely 5 trillion 42 billion in 2001 since banks now must report thei r stock holdings at market rather than historical value some banks face huge capital losses on their shareholdings those banks that purchased stocks whose prices have subsequen tly fallen had been able to value those stocks as part of their capital at their higher purchase prices rather than lower current market values problem with japan is that its pr otective economic system has not let companies go bankrupt as financial conditions have deteriorated for fear of rising unemployment and because of existing ties among companies and banks the process has gone so far th at some have called japan the zombie economy because so many businesses rema in alive that should have died long

economy wa s weakened further the world went through its first synchronized global rece ssion in quartercentury global growth was 14 for 2001 down considerably from 4 in 2000 for the world an annual growth rate of less than 2 is consider ed to be recession for struggling japanese economy already in recession nd relying on exports to lead it toward recovery september 11 was stinging blow the little recovery that had been occurring was attributable primarily to growth in net exports slide in the value of the dollar because of the attacks meant that japanese exporters had to sell their products with highervalued yen japane stock market va lues moreover have dropped in tandem with those on wall street globalization the third problem for japan s economy is that globalization has finally hit the countrys manufacturing s ector it is undergoing wrenching change caused partly by increased competitive challenges from abroad the japanese government has long succeeded in pr otecting certain of its producers from international competition even companies such as toyota motors and nippon steel that have become multinational still enjoy relatively insulated market at home in which competition is primarily among japanese companies and not with foreign competitors now however japanese indus tries without signif icant export sales or import competition particularly services and agriculture face increased competition from abroad in many cases japanese co mpanies themselves have moved their production facilities to neighboring countries and are ta rgeting the home market with products made to japanese quality standards nd under familiar brand names in the case of food imports from china prices ar so low that in april 2001 the japanese government imposed curbs on imports of shiitake mushrooms leeks and rushes and china retaliated by levying punitive tariffs on the import of japanesemade automobiles mobile phones and washing machines eventually the two nations took managed trade solution of export restraints by china the net result of this increased competition from abroad is that when japanese companies invest in new plant and equipmen t much of it is going to other markets instead of into the domestic economy japa ns automobile makers for example have invested more than 17 billion in producti on facilities in the united states which by 2003 are to employ 47010 workers working in plants with capacity to produce nearly 25 million units10 nissan motors recently announced it would follow toyota and honda into the chinese market by investing 103 billion in an existing chinese automaker to produce cars and trucks11 while these facilities contribute to overall corporate profits they are at the heart of the socalled hollowing out of japanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs7 12 japanese investment in china however still is problematic one business executive in japan pointed out that for every two companies that go into china two or three come out they usually have been victimized by the chinese government or have had their intellectual property stolenmanufacturing industries12 not only is manufacturing capacity in japan not increasing from 1995 down 6 in february 2002 but capacity u tilization has remained low down 10 from 1995 further complication is that japans industries reflect dualism generated partly by the degree to which they have b een exposed to foreign competition on the one hand there are globally competitive co mpanies such as sony and nikon who can compete with the best in world market s on the other hand there are companies in sectors that have been relatively isolated from global competition and often have been protected and heavily regulated th include retail stores and financial services which now are considered to be drag on the economy an element manifested in the countrys nonperforming loans furthermore japans industrial policy in most cases has outlived its usefulness when japanese industries were catching up with those in the united states and europe small group of the be st and brightest in the g overnment could justifiably lead the economy the goal was clear and the means to attain the goal was through government leadership and guidance by the 1990s however the old system did not work any more it actually hindered economic growth because of social norms and vested interests that had veloped in particular soci norms of groupism and paternalistic corporate system in wh ich individualism was frowned upon proved problem in the new fast moving world in which industries are at the cutting edge and not closing the technology gap ve sted interests in industries such as construction moreover came to expect lucr ative government contracts and wielded disproportionate political power nonperforming loans the nonperforming loans npls held by ja pans financial sect or total at least 4177 billion despite decade of government programs to strengthen japanese banks and private efforts to clean up the financial mess this huge problem with private debt is causing credit to contract monetary policy to be less effective and contributes to the ongoing recession desp ite bank of japan inte rest rates of less than 1 small and mediumsized busine sses in japan face relatively high interest charges and reluctance on the part of ba nks to lend them funds total bank credit has been declining japanese banks so have been reducing their lending in international markets particularly in southeast asia as of march 2002 deposit taking financial institutions

these official figures however are thought to be unders tated if one includes problem loans that might go sour if the economy goes into prolonged recession the total could be as high as 1409 trillion 113 trillion or nearly three times as much14 experience with firms declaring bankrupt cy indicates that only about 30 of their bank loans had been listed as nonperforming yet they became insolvent for most japanese banks only extensiv government efforts and financing of bank recapitalization packages have kept them from bankruptcy or severe punishment by stock and lending markets even with government intervention fitch an international rating agency rates the intrinsic strength of individual japanese banks as d or the bottom of the scale alt hough fitch gives ratings mostly of or on longterm debt for major ja panese banks this is based on the theory that the banks longterm debt instruments are of relatively higher quality than the issuing banks because the japanese government would intervene to support them if necessary15 the poor condition of japanese banks did cause crisis in 199798 when they had to pay premium of as much as 07 percentage points over international bank borrowing ra tes to compensate lenders for their increased risk over the 1990s the japanese governme nt announced various programs and measures to resolve the problem of nonpe rforming bank loans this included 18 trillion 1375 billion in public funds inj ected into 21 major banks in 1998 and 75 trillion 625 billion in public funds that included 56 trillion 467 billion allocated to be transferred to the top tier of japanese banks th rough the sale in 1999 of new preferred bank shares to governmentrun organization16 the government furthermore has replenished funds in its woefully undercapitalized deposit insura nce fund and nationalized two banks before selling them to private investors the defunc t longterm credit bank of japan was bought from the government by the new yorkbased ripplewood holdings it also has tightened accounting auditing and repor ting standards for much of the 1990s however the hope of the government was th at if it could keep banks operating and the stock market

policy will not do the internati onal financial market may punish japanese banks and companies in the words of private sector economist referring to argentinas financial crisis todays argentina could be tomorrow s japan the conventional wisdom in japan however is that since th major part of japa nese government debt is being held by japanese citizens there is risk of capital flight as occurred in argentina but the situation in japan is potentially precarious already many japanese private investors and depositors are moving out of yen denominated assets into foreign currency assets the absolute amounts are not large yet but the rate of increase is substantial interest rates in japan moreover are so low that banks find it difficult to generate profits from yen denominated assets at some point they will have to diversify their holdings in move that reflects the near desp eration in japan to resolve the banking crisis on september 18 2002 the bank of japan announced that it would consider directly purchasing stock shares held by mo re than dozen japanese banks to shield them from latent losses on their sharehol dings the shares would be purchased directly from the banks and not through stock exchanges19 the problem for japans banks is that they now have to value their stockholdings for reporting purposes at market prices just as these new reporting requirements were being implemented at the end of september the nikkei stoc k average dropped to the 9000 to 9300 level 19year low and quarter of the peak vels reached during the late 1980s japans major banks therefore are expected to in cur trillions of yen in new paper losses this could threaten the capital adequacy of the banks and compel them to further curtail their loans to the struggling business community on

the fo reign exchange market and the japanus economic relationship japan economic currents august 2002 pp 14inflation targeting several economic policy analysts have recommended that japan adopt an inflationary monetary policy the theory behind this is that deflation is macroeconomic condition being caused primarily by the bank of japans monetary policy propone nts of this approach assert that if the bank of japan would announce target inflation rate it woul d help reverse the slide in real estate and stock prices improve the rate of return on capital investments and spur consumption in february 2002 however ba nk of japan officials stated that they were considering inflation ta rgeting but had intention of introducing it at the time the banks position was that deflation cannot be reversed by conventional monetary policy the banks discount rate of interest has b een 01 since september 2001 while the shortterm prime lending rate of private ba nks has been 1375 since the end of 2000 the bank also does not want to reduce pressure on the government to carry out reforms by adopting what they consider to be risky monetary policies economic analysts in japan point out that an inflation target will not necessarily induce people to spend more in its september 2002 world economic outlook however the international monetary fund urged japan to adopt more aggressive monetary stimulus to support economic activ ity this monetary policy would include public commitment to end deflation in more than 1218 months and further quantitative easing21 yen depreciation another policy that the government has pursued is yen depreciation this bolsters japans ex ports and stimulate s business activity deliberately intervening to weaken the yen however can be doubleedged sword while buying dollars and selling yen may have temporary depressing effect on the yen whether it will last is another question once interv ention is ceased currencies usually return to their former levels

of multila teral trade negotiations under the world trade organization wto american business executives noted that it is unlikely that japan will willingly open its agricultural sector to imports once wto agreement is in place however the agreement becomes an effective catalyst for change within japan if the wto requires japan to change its domestic regulations it usually will do so during the negotiation phase however resistance in japan can be strong and usually continues until further resistance becomes futile then the tactic turns toward salvaging protection in one form or another such as long phase in period or trading off protection on one commodity for reducing it in another strategy japan has been pursuing is to seek closer trading arrangements with certain of its trading

now seem reluctant to deposit money in chogin so as of early 2002 the flow of currency from japan to north korea had virtually stopped as part of the norma lization of relations between japan and

united states and china other asian nations stand between and among the big powers the key to both economics and security in asia lies in which direction china will move japan is watching how the united states proceeds in its relations with china particularly with the war on terrorism and following the military aircraft collision incident in 2001 in japan there are two basic views of china the first is that china will continue to grow and develop and beco the worlds second largest country in terms of gnp by the mid2000s china will i nvest in its military so it will be large economic and military power that will put pressure on its neighbors the second view is that communist rule in china w ill be unable to manage the economy local communities will become more independent of rule by beijing businesses will become more independent as stateowned terprises disappear or become privatized china will become more like other market economies with its reve nue base more and more dependent on its ability to tax rather than owners hip of means of production the large stake by the business community in stable trade and investment relationships could temper any aggressive actions by the

to intimidate japan with ballistic missiles the c ountry would have to turn to some kind of missile defense also japan has 6000 nautical miles of coast land which are difficult to protect with just its maritime lf defense forces japan has to cooperate with the us seventh fleet in its coastal defense another official stated that while china is not an immediate threat it could become one in 10 to 20 years still according to one official japan probabl will not participate in security arrangement that is overtly designed to oppose china japans approach to china has been to work within the framework of economics and trade and then progress to security in the next stage in 2001 japan incurred deficit in its trade with china of 266 billion exports of 317 billion and imports of 583 billion despite this trade defi cit many in the japanese business community do not see china as threat virtually all large japanese companies have subsidiaries or joint ventures there th idea is to keep the home offices of the company along with research and marketin g in japan but to move the assembly operations to china this is the hollo wing out of the economy if one japanese business goes into china other businesses in the industry rush to go there as well most view china as great opportunity to build economic interdependence and possibly for japan to escape from its economic stagnation compared with investment in north america and europe however japanese direct investment in china is still re latively small between 1979 and 2001 japan had invested total of 324 billion in ch ina 43 billion in 2001 by comparison in the year 2000 alone japan invested 126 billion in north america and 250 billion in europe difference however is that investments in the industrialized regions of north america and europe are primarily to serve those and neighboring markets although much of the japanese i nvestment in china also is to serve the local chinese market much is also for ex port to third country markets and to japan still the rapidly expanding japanese presence in china holds important national security implications japanese industr is becoming embedded in china japanese analyst observed that japan as nation has to put national security first businesses put profits first with minimal considerations of national security once the economies of china and japan become more integrated however

than 50 of the japanese population w ould have sympathies with taiwan if the island were attacked by mainland china what kind of support japan would offer however is different question according to military official japans offi cial position is that taiwan is part of mainland china japan will not intervene in conflict over reunification but if japanese national interests ar damaged by conflict the country would defend its national interests currently approximately 30000 japanese citizens are in taiwan according to the japanese sdf in case of an attack on taiwan by china japan would take action to defend its citizens if china should close the sea lanes in the straits of taiw an japan would likely act to defend them if the united states did not although it is pres umed that the united states would do so foreign ministry official however pointed out that strategic ambiguity with respect to taiwan has worked japan is committed to work with both beijing and taiwan to achieve peaceful resolution of the situa tion in his words it is better to see the situation as it is rather than to have abrupt change in terms of probable russian response to an attack by the prc on taiwan one japanese official pointed out that russia and china have disparate interests russia has recently moved closer to the united stat and has basic interests in taiwan russia probably would not endorse the

another question with respect to tmd is whether taiwan would be allowed into the system certainly for the pe oples republic of china it would not be acceptable to have joint control by the united states japan and taiwan of tmd radar system japans self defense forces also can be engaged only in the defense of japan but under the above tmd system that would not be the case if japan were to

protocol the rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases by the bush administration in ma rch 2001 reverberated rather widely among the japanese people40 in addition to the fact that th protocol was agreed to in japan the us rejection was viewed as another example of american unilateralism some japanese officials see thei r country as being caught between the americans and europeans but not being strong enough to do much as an independent actor actually the issue in japan with the ky oto protocol was not only the environment but concern about american unilateralis m in view of japans preference for multilateralism this dic hotomy affected japanese public support for the war on terrorism the japanese government had to mollify public opposition to us unilateralism when arguing for japans support of the antiterror campaign actually many japanese busine sses also think that they cannot comply with all the provisions in the kyoto protocol it would be

in february 2002 president bush visited japan for mmit meeting with prime minister koizumi at the same time this congressional staff delegation was in tokyo for bush this was makeup visit for the summit originally scheduled for november 2001 but postponed in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks the purpose of the visit was to thank japan for its support in the war on terrorism provide support for the prime minister nd to encourage the government to take action to address its economic problems particularly th disposal of nonperforming loans according to embassy officials the visit was not complicated and did not result in joint statement baseball turned out to be strong common interest which the two leaders discovered when president bush picked up an autographed baseball that the prime minister had in his office the japanese side also was able to accommodate request by the president to dine one evening in typical japanese restaurant as precaution the japanese side asked the chef s to substitute steak for raw fish on the menu both sides agreed that the two had established friendly personal relationship warmer than prime minister koizumi enjoyed with fellow leaders of asian nations or even with many mbers of his own party highlight of the visit was president bushs address to joint session of the diet the speech was punctuated by applause rarity for the solemn japanese body at one point in the speech however bush mentioned prime minister koizumis economic reforms and was taken aback when the statement was greeted with ripple of laughter in the assemblage white house staff first speculated that communist party members had planned to respond with laughter to express their disapproval of koizumis inac tion on promised reforms however as it turned out the simultaneous translati on being broadcast to earphone s was sentence behind the actual delivery of the speech and the ughter was in response to humorous translation of bushs previous sentence and not about the reforms or the lack of them conclusion in summary japan is like hobbled giant that is seeking to cast off some of the fetters that have kept it from assuming more prominent and independent security role in world affairs the war on terro rism has provided tokyo with the opportunity to ease out from the some of the constraints imposed by the pacifist attitudes of its people and its nowar constitution concu rrently japan is viewing with some apprehension the rising economic and military challenge of china and the new terrorist threats two recent indications of japans effort to gain more prominent position in world affairs are the greater visibility by its navy in the war on terrorism and prime minister koizumis september 2002 visit to north korea for the first time since world war ii japans maritime self defense forces are operating in military campaign outside its territorial waters th role is noncombative but japans diethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31609crs24 has supported this wider military support activity despite its cost and some objections from inside japan and mild protests from certain of its asian neighbors twentyseven japanese citizens were killed in the attacks on the world trade center in new york this underlined the f act that japans businesses abroad as well as much of its infrastructure at home such as its nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attack tokyo is responding to these new threats with legislation to allow greater role for its military and more effective police force but it still recognizes its role as subordinate to that of the united states in the global war on terrorism prime minister koizumis summit with north korean leader kim jong il seemed to indicate two new policy thrusts the first is the willingness of japan to undertake major diplomatic initiatives w ithout prior concurrence by the united states the second is to put its domestic in terests ahead of any us grand strategy in particular after the bush administrati on had labeled north korea as one of the triad in the axis of evil japan took bold step in the opposite direction the summit is leading to normaliza tion of relations between the two countries payment of billions of dollars to north korea in foreign aid and significant reduction in bilateral tensions this summit indicated that despite japans close military relationship with the united states it is willing to proceed on its own to resolve issues that it considers important japan also is grappling with the rise of china it is apparent that over the past two decades china has increased its infl uence in asia both through economic and military means in many cases this has come at the expense of japan not only are japanese manufacturers investing in china but many of those investments appear to be zero sum in that chinas gain is japans loss the numbers are still not large but they are growing and the burgeoning manuf acturing presence of china is adding to the pessimism in japan over its own econo mic future added to this economic challenge from china is the uncertainty over the chinese military and beijings threats to take taiwan by force if nece ssary even though japans military budget is more than twice that of china japans arsenal is confined to defensive weaponry whereas china has developed considerable offensive capability while japan is reluctant to join missile defense system aimed at china or to get drawn into military conflict over taiwan its ties to the united states and its extensive investments and business presence in taiw an could thrust it into unprecedented and uncomfortable situations for the united states while the military relationship with japan seems secure the relationship is becoming more like that with other industrialized countries the alliance is strong but japan does not want to be taken for granted and tokyo is more willing to pursue its own interests even if not on the same track as that of washington
