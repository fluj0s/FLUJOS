primarily through taxes which are deposited in the us treasury and credited to the social security trust fund any revenues credited to the trust fund in excess of the costs benefit payments and administrative costs are invested in special us obligations debt instruments of the us government the social security trust fund represents funds dedicated to pay current and future social security benefits however it is useful to view th trust fund in two ways 1 as the balance of an internal federal accounting concept and 2 as the accumulated holdings of the social security program for internal accounting purposes certain accounts within the us treasury are designated by law as trust funds to properly track revenues dedicated to certain purposes or expenditures number of trust funds are in the us treasury including those for social security medicare unemployment compensation and federal employee retirement the monies in the social security trust fund in the us treasury are owned by the us government which can by changing the law raise or lower revenues to the trust fund or payments from the trust fund by law any positive annual balance or cash flow surplus in the social security trust fund must be invested in us government obligations the accumulated holdings of us obligations are often viewed as being similar to assets held by any other trust on behalf of the beneficiaries however the holdings of the social security trus t fund differ from those of private trusts because 1 the types of investments it may hold are limited and 2 the us government is both the buyer and seller of the investments this paper will review some of the basics of how the social security program is funded and how the social security trust fund works this report will be updated as needed to reflect legislative or other activity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33028g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g497g561g22 g145g142g561g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158 g151 g141g561 g561

is primarily financed by revenues from federal insurance contributions act fica taxes and self em ployment contributions act seca taxes commonly known as social security taxes fica taxes are paid by both employers and employees but it is employers who remit the taxes to the us treasury employers remit fica taxes on regular basis through the year for exampleweekly monthly quarterly or annually depending on the employers level of total employment taxes generally fica medicare and federal personal income tax withholding currently both the employer and employee pay fica tax rate of 62 on the employees wages up to 97500 seca taxes are paid by selfemployed individuals and are normally paid once year as part of filing an annual individual income tax return the current seca tax rate is 124 of 9235 of net income with onehalf of the seca taxes allowed as deduction for federal income tax purposes in addition to these two major sources of fundin g the social security program has two other sources of revenue certain social security recipi ents must include portion of social security benefits in taxable income for the federal income tax and the social security program receives part of those taxes 1 in addition the social security program receives interest from the us treasury on its investments in special us obligations the internal revenue service irs processes the tax returns and tax payments for federal employment taxes and federal individual income taxes all of the tax payments are deposited in the us treasury along with all other receipts from the public for the federal government g22g145g142g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158g151g141g561g138g156g561g138g561g6g142g156g146g144g151g138g157g142g141g561

designated as special fund in law is because the funds are dedicated to specific purposes and are not for general government program use the monies or holdings of trust fund in the treasury are owned by the us government the us government can by changing the law raise or lower the revenues going into the trust fund and the payments made by the trust fund

employment taxes deposited in the us treasury by the irs in practice there are two separate accounts for the social security program the old age and survivors insurance oasi trust fund and the disability insurance di trust fund the fica and seca taxes are allocated between the oasi and di trust funds based on proportion specified in law 2 the combination of the oasi and di trust funds often referred to as oasdi is generally what is meant by the phrase the social security trust fund g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 the u s treasury on regular basis makes social security benefit payments to eligible individuals the us treasury is directed by the social security administration ssa as to whom to pay and the amount of the payment when benefit payments are made by the treasury the social security trust fund is debited for the payments periodically the social security trust fund is also debited for the administrative costs of the social security program these administrative costs are incurred by several government agencies including the social security administration the us treasury and the irs

any year revenues are greater than costs the secretary of the treasury as managing trustee of the trust funds is required to invest this positive annual balance or cash flow surplus in securities backed by the us government3 the purchasing of the securities allows the surplus to be used for other government purposes4 if in any year costs are greater than revenues this negative annual balance or cash flow deficit is offset by selling accumulated security holdings to pay the benefits and administrative costs there are two measures of the social security balance the current or annual balance and the accumulated holdings5 the current or annual balance in the social security trust fund is measure of current or annual revenues and current or annual costs the current balance can be either positive or negative that is current revenues can exceed current costs or current costs can exceed current revenues however unlike other federal programs without trust funds the social 2 social

current revenues to current costs each year if the ratio is greater than 1 the current balance is positive and if the ratio is less than 1 the current balance is negative in the past there have been periods in which the current balance was negative the ratio of revenues to cost is less than 1 figure 1 shows the ratio of annual revenues to annual costs in the social security trust fund for selected years over the historical period 19572006 and for selected years over the future period 20072040 as projected by the social security trustees in their 2007 annual report 7 the forecast of annual revenues and annual costs for the ratios shown in figure 1 uses the intermediate forecast of the trustees under this forecast the current balance is expected to begin to be negative ratio of less than 1 beginning in 2017 although the social security program has had negative annual balances run cash flow deficits in the past and is expected to become negative again beginning in 2017 assuming current benefit levels and projected revenues social security benefits can continue to be paid at the levels promised under current law by the us treasury as long as the accumulated balance in the social security trust fund is positive this is because the social security program has budget authority to pay benefits as long as the balance in the designated account is positive however if current revenues are not sufficient to pay benefits the us government must raise the funds necessary to honor the redemption of the us obligations held by the social security trust fund when they are

congressional budget process whereas offbudget generally refers to programs not included in the annual congressional budget process the social security program is government program like the postal

budget resolution in its legislative language separates the offbudget totals receipts and outlays from the onbudget totals receipts and outlays the report language accompanying the resolution usually shows the unified budget totals which combine the on and offbudget amounts as well as showing the on and offbudget totals the presidents budget tends to use the unified budget measures in discussing the budget totals the administrationss budget documents also include as required the totals for the on and offbudget components the congressional budget office uses the unified budget numbers in its analyses of the budget it does not generally include on and offbudget data in its regular annual reports the annual congressional budget process provides the budget authority for relevant federal

g10g152g149g141g146g151g144g156g561 the social security trust fund can be and often is viewed as trust fund similar to any private trust fund that is to be used for paying current and future benefits as noted earlier any revenues credited to the trust fund in the treasury in excess of costs are invested in nonmarketable us government obligations these obligations are physical paper documents issued to the trust fund and held by the ssa when the obligations are redeemed the treasury must issue check physical document to the trust fund for the interest earned on the obligation however unlike private trust that may hold variety of types of assets and obligations of different borrowers the social security trust fund can only hold nonmarketable us obligations the sale of these obligations by the us government to the trust fund is federal government borrowing from itself and counts against the fede ral debt limit the requirement that the social security trust fund purchase us obligations serves several purposes it offers mechanism for social security to recoup the surpluses it lent to the rest of the government it pays interest so that the loan of the surpluses does not lose value over time it ensures that the trust fund and not general government receives credit for the interest earnings it ensures level of return interest to the trust fund and it provides means outside of the securities market for the us government to borrow funds investment of social security trust funds in other private security instruments such as stocks would increase the potential returns and the risk for negative earnings for the trust fund purchases of private security instruments increases the risk in the future value of trust fund holdings it is important to note that the current accumulated holdings of the social security trust fund are lower than the projected future obligations for benefits of the social security program 11 percentages calculated by the
