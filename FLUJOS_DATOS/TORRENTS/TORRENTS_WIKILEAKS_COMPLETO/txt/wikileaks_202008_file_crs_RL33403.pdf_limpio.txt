crimes involve hate perhaps in the traditional sense yet they are not classified as hate crime the distinguishing feature of hate crime is that the offender is motivated to move against the victim because of an ascribed characteristic that marks the victim as justifiable target in the mind of the offender nevertheless determining an offenders motivation is difficult in many case s moreover the definition of hate crimes varies among states some states for example do not include sexual orientation as victim characteristic in their definitions of hate crime consequently such states would likely not report crime committed against an individual because of their sexual orientation as hate crime 14 us department of justice office of justice programs bureau of justice assistance

discrimination in the past and to tolerate any further persecution and discrimination on such counts as manifested in either crimes against persons or property is longer acceptable opponents of creating separate and distinct federal offense for hate crime often counter that the victim of any crime suffers regardless of the offenders motive they claim that the perpetrator of an assault in the course of an armed robbery should be punished less vigorously matter what his motivation might have been they maintain that the public interest would be better served if law enforcement efforts addressed crime acrosstheboard rather than focusing on the offenders motive opponents also view separate federal offense for hate crime as redundant and largely symbolic asserting that separate hate

the mid1950s18 although the initial focus of the civil rights movement was on promoting the legal social and economic status of african americans it soon expanded to include other racial and ethnic minorities in the 1960s19 through nonviolent protest and other forms of political activism these rightsbased movements coalesced to expand civil rights and reduce violence directed at minorities20 by the 1970s the contemporary womens rights movement and the gay and lesbian rights movement constituted what some experts have termed the secondwave civil rights movements21 in addition the crime victims movement emerged as part of the womens rights movement22 according to social scientists by the 1980s support from both the wider civil rights movement and the crime victims movement provided the broad constituent base that proved critical to the formation of the early antihatecrime movement23 even within the antihate crime movement however defining what constituted hate crime and who would be protected against such crimes proved matter of controversy24 g7g138g155g149g162g561g5g146g159g146g149g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561g15g152g159g142g150g142g151g157g561 in the not so distant

to address jim crow laws and other forms of discrimination was pioneered by the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and southern christian leadership conference sclc27 under the leadership of dr martin luther king jr and others the united states made great strides in addressing social injustices associated with the residual effects of slavery and other forms of institutionalized discrimination that were contrary to the principle of equal justice for all as set out in the us constitution 28 other disadvantaged groups were influenced by the early civil rights movement particularly the success of the naacp and sclc29 based on those models in part and the principle of nonviolent protest minority groups mobilized by organizing themselves into nongovernmental

second wave of civil rights movements the womens rights movement and the gay and lesbian rights movement emerged in the 1970s out of the wider civil rights movement 31 particularly in the womens rights movement the issue of the rights of victims of violent crime became an important issue as crime victims and their advocates voiced concern about the secondary victimization of victims of rape and domestic abuse32 secondary victimization is term used to refer to the psychological trauma suffered by crime victims at the hands of the criminal justice system33 in particular the crime victims movement was critical of the warren supreme court for expanding defendants rights in criminal cases34 advocates for greater crime victims rights asserted that in many cases the perpetrators of crime were inadequately punished and victims were inadequately protected35 according to social scientists who have studied the hate crime movement the crime victims rights movement lent impetus and considerable support to the antihate crime movement36 g3g151g157g146g556g10g138g157g142g561g5g155g146g150g142g561g15g152g159g142g150g142g151g157g561 the convergence of the civil rights movement the

for tougher laws targeting hate crime began lobbying state and federal legislators 39 this model legislation consisted of five proposals that addressed vandalism directed at religious institutions intimidation civil action for both types of crime data collection and police training40 based on one or more elements of this model legislation more than half the states had enacted hate crime

1981 civil rights advocacy groups including the southern poverty law center splc the adl the coalition on hate crimes prevention and the klanwatch project called for the collection of national hate crime statistics42 at that time there was national source or mechanism for collecting hate crime data although some states collected such data characterizing hate crimes accurately or determining the extent of hate crimes nationally was difficult if not impossible nonetheless civil rights advocates maintained that such data would 1 provide an empirical basis from which to shape public policy 2 raise the consciousness of reporting law enforcement agencies and 3 stimulate local prevention strategies more effective responses and greater sensitivity to the specific needs of hate crime victims 43 although hate crime proposals initially included categories of protected classes that were limited to race religion and ethnicity the scope of those provisions were later expanded to include sexual orientation and gender g9g142g151g141g142g155g561 within the ranks of hate crime legislation supporters the inclusion of gender under the hate crime statistics legislation proved contentious for example antigender biasmotivated crime was not included as hate crime by the coalition on hate crimes prevention one of the leading advocacy groups44 the coalition noted that statistics on domestic violence and rape were already being collected45 in many of these crimes they pointed out the offenders were acquaintances of the victims46 they maintained that hate crime involved attacks on victims

motivated by the offenders irrational fear and hatred of women48 and even if the offender was an acquaintance violent crimes against women often involve an element of misogyny49 some observers have noted that the coalitions opposition to inclusion of antigender bias under the definition of hate crime was likely based upon the notion that if it were included other types of hate crime would be washed out by the prevalence and sheer volume of antigender bias motivated crime misogynistic violence against women50

orientation and gender identity as characteristics for which certain violent crimes would be considered hate crime if it could be shown that the perpetrators were motivated by an animus for their victims for reasons related to those characteristics issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity often overlap but the characteristics are conceptually distinct while sexual orientation speaks to an individuals sexual desire gender identity speaks to an individuals gender expression 51 gender identity has been defined as persons internal deeply felt sense of being male or female that is not always congruous with their biological sex 52 nevertheless gender identity was largely subsumed under the debate over sexual orientation and hate crime during the 1980s53 the inclusion of sexual orientation as characteristic under proposed legislation generated considerable debate during the 1980s in congressional hearings on antigay and lesbian violence and during legislative debates leading to the hate crime statistics act54 those debates often focused upon the question of whether sexual orientation should be considered an ascribed and immutable characteristic like race or ethnicity or matter of individual choice in some cases those favoring the inclusion of sexual orientation as category for which hate crime statistics should be gathered held the former view whereas those opposing such proposals often held the latter view it has been argued that transgender personsthose who do not meet genderbased expectations or engage in gender variant behaviorare inordinately

in violent crimes committed against persons for reasons related to their race religion sexual orientation ethnicity and other characteristics 56 as hate crime statistics were not collected nationally however it was unknown whether hate crime was increasing remaining the same or decreasing nevertheless the perception that bias crime was on the rise was reflected in the effectiveness of the antihate crime movement 57 and many states were prompted to enact legislation against hate crimes58 congress responded by considering several proposals that addressed hate crime and it passed legislation that 1 required the attorney general to capture hate crime statistics annually 2 increased penalties for certain civil rights offenses that were determined to be biasmotivated and 3 expanded federal jurisdiction over the arson destruction or vandalism of religious property as well as violent interference with an individuals right to exercise religious freedom also congress attached hate crimerelated provisions to other pieces of legislation such as the fy1997 defense authorization act and the child left behind act of 2001 furthermore congress appropriated funding for antihate crime training 55 one such case was dramatized in the 1999 movie entitled boys dont cry which was based upon the murder of brandon teena born female physiologically teena was living as man in the early

reports are similar the number of victimizations reported in each report stand in stark contrast for example for 3½year period july 2000 through december 2003 bjs reported an annual average of 210000 hate crime victimizations of these victimizations survey results indicated that victims only reported them to the police on 92000 occasions for comparable time period 2000 through 2003 the fbi reported 40266 victimizations or about 10000 annually 85 hence bjs reported over nine times the number of hate crime victimizations than were reported by state and local police to the fbi for about the same time period this variance on the one hand suggests that some state and local police agencies may be resistant to classifying crimes as hate crimes despite the perceptions of victims on the other hand it also suggests that the fbi and bjss methodologies for determining whether crime should be considered hate crime are very different for example under the ncvs definition of hate crime there must be corroborating evidence of bias motivation which could include 1 the offender using derogatory language 2 the offender leaving hate symbols or 3 the police confirming that hate crime had taken place 86 the fbi protocol for determining hate crime appears to be more rigorous for such determinations the 85 for 2000 through 2003 the fbi reported over 40266 hate crime victimizations or an annual average of 10067 86 bjs hate crime reported by victims and police p 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33403g10g138g157g142g561g5g155g146g150 g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561

several factors support finding of bias87 those factors include the following were the offender and victim of different race religion disability sexual orientation andor ethnicitynational origin did the offender make oral comments written statements or gestures which indicated his bias were biasrelated drawings markings symbols or graffiti left at the crime scene were other objects items or things used that would indicate bias is the victim member of racial religious disability sexual orientation or ethnicnational origin group which is overwhelmingly outnumbered by other residents in the neighborhood where the victim lives and the incident took place was the victim visiting neighborhood where previous hate crimes were committed against other members of his racial religious disability sexual orientation or ethnicnational origin and where tensions remain high against his group had several incidents occurred in the same locality at or about the same time and the victims were all of the same race religion disability sexual orientation or ethnicitynational origin did substantial portion of the community where the crime occurred perceive the incident as biasmotivated was the victim engaged in activities promoting his race religion disability sexual orientation or ethnicitynational origin at the time of the incident did the incident coincide with holiday or date of particular significance related to race religion disability sexual orientation or ethnicitynational origin was the offender previously involved in similar hate crime or hate group member were there indicators that hate group was involved did historically established animosity exist between the victims and the offenders groups was the victim although not member of targeted racial religious disability sexual

regarding underreporting hate crime doj has made some general observations for example some small and rural law enforcement agencies do not have the manpower inclination or expertise to report such crimes89 victims are often reluctant to report such crime for fear of reprisals in some cases90 for example studies have cited the prevalence of nonreporting by victims of crimes based on sexual orientation for fear of secondary victimization and concerns about public disclosure of ones homosexuality91 in other cases some agencies are reluctant to report such crimes for fear of the cultural political and economic repercussions that could result from admitting that such problems exist in their communities92 differences in state hate crime statutes have also led to differences in collection that make it difficult to compare such data from one jurisdiction to another and weaken the overall national assessment of hate crime trends and patterns93 to address some of those shortcomings the fbi has developed an antihate crime training curriculum for state tribal and local law enforcement94 in addition the fbi continues to advance its latest generation crime statistics program the national incident based reporting system nibrs under this more comprehensive crime reporting system the fbi endeavors to capture additional data including demographic characteristics for both victim and offender that will improve determinations as to whether crime is biasmotivated as of november 2005 29 states were certified participants in nibrs95 those states were arizona arkansas colorado connecticut delawa re idaho iowa kansas kentucky louisiana maine massachusetts michigan missouri nebraska new hampshire north dakota ohio oregon rhode island south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia west virginia and wisconsin 96 of these states however only eight submit all their data through nibrs these were delaware idaho iowa south carolina tennessee virginia west virginia and vermont97 as full state participation in nibrs is far from complete the fbi continues to maintain the preexisting ucr summary reporting system in addition in one

hate crime is underreported98 based on national mail survey of law enforcement investigators in several agencies the studys researchers reported that 31 of respondents n58 indicated that they believed their departments had investigated hate crimes in 1997 yet their departments had reported zero hate crimes to the fbi as participants in the ucr program99 consequently the researchers concluded that there was disconnect between what line officers believed and what was reported to the fbi the northeastern researchers concluded that because of problems with underreporting ucr statistics do not capture an accurate enough picture of hate crime nationally to allow for cross jurisdictional comparisons or national estimates 100 in followup study published in february 2003 the northeastern university researchers reiterated the previous reports finding that there was evidence that hate crime was seriously underreported in the ucr statistics 101 based on examining the hate crime reporting procedures at several police departments across the united states the researchers concluded that the fbi recommended twotier reporting process was the best procedure for ensuring greater accuracy and consistency in hate crime reporting102 this process removes the responsibility for making the final bias motivation determination from the responding patrol officers and gives it to criminal intelligence analyst or hate crime specialist although the northeastern university researchers made other recommendations which are beyond the scope of this report they concluded that because of problems with underreporting ucr statistics do not capture an accurate picture of hate crime nationally 103

has been concern for policymakers nevertheless data on juvenile victims and offenders is limited104 for example researchers at west virginia university wvu have provided analysis of selected nibrs data which could suggest that juveniles represent disproportionately high percentage of victims and offenders in hate crimes105 the wvu researchers culled through 5855 bias crime incidents reported through nibrs for the years 1995 through 2000106 of the 5855 incidents there were 7070 victims and 98 jack mcdevitt et improving the quality of and accuracy of bias crime statistics nationally an

broadened federal jurisdiction over hate crime the language of this amendment was similar to the hate crimes prevention act s 622 which was also sponsored by senator kennedy senator orrin hatch offered an alternative amendment that would have required the department of justice and the then general accounting office to conduct studies on hate crime activity the language of this amendment was similar to bill to combat hate crimes s 1406 which was introduced by senator hatch the hatch amendment passed by recorded vote 5049 the kennedy amendment passed by recorded vote 5742 on september 13

on the judiciary committee successfully offered an amendment to the childrens safety act hr 3132 on september 14 2005 which included the language of the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2005 hr 2662110 the conyers amendment would have broadened federal jurisdiction over hate crime by among other things establishing two partially overlapping categories of hate crime offenses under federal law 111 first it would have prohibited the attempted or otherwise willful bodily injury to any person through the use of fire firearm explosive or incendiary device if such criminal conduct were motivated on the basis of actual or perceived race color religion or national origin of any individual second it would have prohibited the same criminal conduct if such conduct were motivated on the basis of an individuals gender sexual orientation gender identity or disability in addition to the other four characteristics listed above as asserted in the amendments findings both provisions were arguably founded upon congresss legislative authority under the commerce clause of as well as provisions of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the us constitution the reach of the second offense however would have been limited to specific jurisdictional ties to the commerce clause which were outlined in the amendment in the past opponents of expanding federal jurisdiction over hate crime have argued that such an expansion would be an overreach of congressional power which could possibly be challenged in the supreme court opponents pointed to supreme court cases in which rulings were made based upon tighter interpretations of the commerce clause 112 in addition to the language of hr 2662 representative conyers also offered another hate crime related amendment that would have required additional hate crime statistics be collected for genderbiased crime and that breakouts be reported for juvenile victims and offenders 113 with little debate the house adopted this amendment by voice vote the language of the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2005 hr 2662 proved more divisive however representative f james sensenbrenner jr chairman of the judiciary committee argued that the amendment would be poison pill and would possibly erode the bills bipartisan support 114 the house nevertheless passed the amendment by recorded vote of 223199 on september 14 2005 on the same day the house passed hr 3132 by recorded vote 37152 the senate did not acted upon this measure however on march 8 2006 the house passed the childrens

appropriations for doj to hire additional staff to respond to alleged violations of the hate crime provisions described below the bill would also broaden federal coverage of hate crimes under two scenarios first under any circumstance it would prohibit willfully inflicting bodily injury to any person attempted or otherwise through the use of fire firearm explosive or incendiary device if such conduct were motivated on the basis of actual or perceived race color religion or national origin of any person second it would prohibit the same conduct if such conduct were motivated on the basis of the victims gender sexual orientation gender identity or disability in addition to the four characteristics enumerated under the first scenario the reach of the second offense would be limited to specific jurisdictional ties to the inte rstate commerce clause of the us constitution which were outlined in the bill under either scenario offenders could be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fine or for any term up to life imprisonment if the crime resulted in the victims death or involved attempted murder kidnaping attempted kidnaping rape or attempted rape for hate crime cases prosecuted federally under these provisions it would require the attorney general or his subordinate to certify that pertinent state or local officials 1 were unable or unwilling to prosecute 2

for congress is whether the prevalence and harmfulness of hate crime warrants greater federal intervention to ensure that such crimes are systematically addressed at all levels of government federal state tribal city and county although many believe that hate crime is deplorable determining the federal role in combating hate crime has proven complicated and divisive g21g145g152g158g149g141g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g12g158g155g146g156g141g146g140g157g146g152g151g561g4g142g561g4g155g152g138g141g142g151g142g141g501g561 as described above congress has and may in the future consider legislation to broaden federal jurisdiction over hate crime by creating separate offense for such crimes under federal law although fbi hate crime statistics document that hate crimes continue to be perpetrated it is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33403g10g138g157g142g561g5g155g146g150 g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

accurate picture that allows for crossjurisdictional comparisons or national estimates116 nor is it definitively known whether state and local authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute such crimes consequently opponents of creating separate hate crime offense are likely to argue on the side of caution until better data are available and that congress should not intervene into matters that may be best handled at the state and local level proponents counter that state and local authorities are often not in position to pursue such cases because of their complexity and cost moreover they point out that under the c onyerskennedy proposal federal intervention would be the course of last resort under their proposal the attorney general would have to certify that the local authorities had been unable or unwilling to prosecute hate crime under existing state laws among other conditions before the federal authorities would take up the case finally proponents argue that it is the federal governments duty to ensure that such cases are adequately addressed to combat vestiges of biases that as civil society the united states has collectively found to be intolerable

collected under the hcsa are arguably not complete and comprehensive enough to yield valid hate crime trends and patterns at the national level congress could choose to require the collection of additional data as described above senator hatch has made past proposals to assess ucr hate crime data 117 as result of such an assessment new reporting requirements might address the false zero phenomenon regional trends types of crime trial outcomes as well as sentences imposed as corollary issue congress could address the slow pace with which states are participating in the nextgeneration fbi crime statistics program nibrs congress could call upon the bureau of justice statistics or the government accountability office to assess the status of the nibrs program as first step towards establishing timetable for the programs full implementation with an eye on dovetailing such efforts with more complete and comprehensive hate crime statistics report

if congress should consider legislation to broaden federal jurisdiction over hate crime it is likely that proposals to expand the federal collection of hate crime statistics to include gender would be offered proponents assert that crimes that are motivated by genderbias ought to be singled out for special consideration as hate crime they point out that like other forms of hate crime violence against women in the united states has reached levels that require greater monitoring and federal intervention is necessary opponents counter that the consideration of gender as protected class suggests that every domestic abuse battery rape and murder case in which the victim was of the opposite gender 116 jack mcdevitt et bridging the information disconnect in national bias crime reporting

to require hate crime statistics be expanded to include breakouts for juvenile victims and offenders selected data arguably suggest that juveniles could represent disproportionately high percentage of
