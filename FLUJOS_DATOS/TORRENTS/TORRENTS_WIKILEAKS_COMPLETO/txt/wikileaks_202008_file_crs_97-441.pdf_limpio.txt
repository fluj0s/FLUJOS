magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act of 1976 had as one of its original aims xpanding the us commercial fishing fleet and displacing other nations that were fishing within 200 miles of the us coast by 1993 us landings had risen by 50 and employment on us fishing vessels by 60 thi s expansion was aided by rising prices and demand for fish products governmen t encouragement and open access to most fisheries1 both experience and ec onomic models show that in the absence of enforceable access or catch restrictions competition among commercial fishermen results in n expansion of fishing capacity and resultant fishing effort beyond the sustainabl e2 limits of the fish population being pursued this unsustainable harvesting causes catch rates to fall inducing investments in more effective equipment to maintain shortterm profits regardless of the sequences for the fish stocks the absence of individual property rights to the fishery resource effectively deters individual fishermen fro m taking action based on longterm view of fish stocks because individual decreases in shortterm landings from the fishery are likely to be taken by current competitors or new entrants attempts to regulate the total amount of fish captured eg through total allowable catch tac restrictions may indu ce further investment as the fastest vessels with the best equipment will probably

upgrading ie capital stuffing increasing the size r fishing power ie efficiency or effectiveness of remaining vessels the benefits of capacity removal could again be negated bodies governing limited access fisheries at local state national an d international levels have initiated various buyback or retirement schemes to reduce7 overcapacity and the consequent overfishing the nature and scope of thes programs have been as varied as the fisheries they have covered in some fisheries buybacks have been attempted to prevent the collapse of seriously depleted stocks or after stock collapse serious enough to have caused the closure of fishery in others the aim has been to increase profitability for vessels remaining in the fishery the common objective of vessel buybacks or license retirement is the permanen t withdrawal of effort ie fishermen and their vessels from particular fishery i n most cases however the reduction in the number of vessels or licenses has had relatively modest effect on fleet capacity since the firs t to accept buybacks are usually the oldest and least efficient units although som etimes conceived as means for easing financial hardship caused by reduced landings of fish capacity reduction is more often viewed as measure to realign effort and eventually increase sustainable catch levels unlike economic aid however capacity reduction aims to prov ide longterm benefits to those choosing or able to remain within the ind ustry and may thus indirectly confer benefits to some of the communities that the fishery supports in some cases the demand for vessel s created by buyback scheme has caused vessel prices to rise this may allow some vessel owners to receive more compensation for the capital they have invested and also may help pr event entry into other marginal fisheries that is only profitable when vessel prices are very low but it also raises the cost of the retirement programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs4 althoug h theoretically any level of capacity could yield sustainable fishery as long s8 quotas were strictly enforced such program would become increasingly difficult to enforce effectively at extre capacities due to the ability of such fleet to harvest large amounts of the resource in short timethe ultimate aim of most capacity reduction schemes is to improve th economics of the fishery for those fishermen choosing and able to remain as well as to provide some economic aid for those exiting the fishery methods of effor t limitation other than capacity reduction are possible and many have been tried i n conjunction with capacity reduction measures quotas closed areas and close d seasons have all been tried with varying degrees of success these same alternatives however often have provided the very incentives that encourage further capita l stuffing the frantic derby fishing that often occurs in open access fisheries managed by tac quotas in fisheries where effort is controlled by individual quota shares eithe r transferable or not buyback of quota shares is an option although this does t reduce capacity in itself economic forces after quota share buyback can lead t rationalization ie realigning effort and sustainable catch levels of the flee t concerned and subseq uent reduction of the capacity within it until there is better balance between capacity and sustainable yield8 vessel buyback vessel buyback schemes generally rely on reverse bid approach fishermen offer bids for g overnment purchase of their vessels which are accepted if they are lower than other bids tendered methods of deciding the lowest price for very different types or sizes of vessel may depend on the vessels landings track record length tonnage engine size or combination of these and othe r factors in few cases vessels were purchased on firstcome firstserved basis with compensation based on appraised vessel value vessels purchased may be disposed of in various ways some schemes hav involved the resale of vessels into any fishery other than the one from which it wa s purchased other schemes have allowed the vesse ls to be sold to fisheries outside the affected area or country elsewhere buyback has involved either the mandator destruction of the vessel or permanent withdrawal of i ts ability to join any commercial fishing register these latter two options alleviate the problem of exportin g overcapacity to other fisheries which may in turn suffer the same problems as those in the original fishery license retirement in many cases license retirement involves tenderin g processes similar to those descr ibed for vessels however in other cases acrossthe board payments for individual licenses have been made with regard to the history or potential effort of each licensee prices may be set at the market rate althoug h expectation of increased revenues after capacity reduction may cause license prices to rise sha rply or at the value required to encourage the chosen proportion f fishermen to surrender their licenses in some ca ses compulsory purchase has been used where licenses ar measured in capacity or effort units of some sort ie fractional licensing ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs5 this approach is more effective for s ome types of nets than for others it is fairly ineffective9 for trawls b ecause once the codend mesh is filled fish of all sizes are caught however minimum mesh size requirements can be quite effective in making gillnets more selectivepercentage of each vessels units must be sold back to the management authority every vessel wishing to remain in the fishery must th purchase additional units from vessels choosing to retire to regain the required number of units an alternativ approach is where the management authority announces that at some future date an increased number of units will be required for continued participation in the fishery after this announcement fishery participants must purchase additional units fro m within the fishery and the ensuing capacity reduction is industry rather tha n governmentfinanced gear retirement in addition to reducing overall effort as in vessel buybacks and license retirement g ear retirement can be used to reduce specific types of effort or to change overall effort patterns gear retirement can be used for example t reduce discards bycatches or environmental damage to reduce the take of certain species within mixed multispecies fisher or to enhance the profitability of certain sectors within fleet gear retirement program may invo lve destruction of the gear or storage and subsequent sale to another fishery but all will subsequently prohibit or restrict u of that type of gear in the fishery from which it was purchased alternatively compensat ion may be paid after use of gear type has been prohibited or in the case of fixed gear such as traps or pots after reductions in the amount of gear allowed per vessel have been introduced an alternati ve approach is through gear limitation or restriction this may for example limit the num ber of traps vessel may set or the size of trawl net other technical measures such s increasing mesh size which increases the average size at first capture of species may allow m ore individuals within stock to spawn as well as increase the economic yield per unit of fishing effort invested by allowing fish to reach more marketable size althoug h catch may be reduced this approach tends to9 increase individual effort sources of financing financing for buyback and retirement schemes has come from number f sources ifrom the federal government

has caused difficulty in other capacity reduction schemes may become more apparent as stocks of the principa l groundfish species recover if it becomes economically attractive for vessels to return to

from 302 to 137 decline in prawn prices and increased effort and costs from purchasing new units and paying the levy for those remaining in the fishery reduced the longter m biologic and economic benefits of the scheme an announcement of compulsor unit purchase price prior to the request for bids might have considerably reduced the overall cost of the scheme although those choosing to sur

1987 twoyear license retirement schem was initiated mainly in bid to increase economic efficiency with the objective f retiring 40 licens or 2400 pots the state government borrowed a65 million to initiate the program which was repaid by the industry through an annual levy n remaining license holders licenses were not transferable during the twoyea r program t he scheme was oversubscribed and 41 license holders of total of 238 were bought out before the sch eme was closed in 1989 3 months ahead of schedule retirement prices were paid on fixed perpot basis and thus ones total retirement payment was related to the number pots the license holder was entitled to use subsequent analysis of the fishery showed that although catches for thos e36 remaining within the fishery rose economic efficiency did not increased cost s associated with the levy and an increase in effort were cited as the main reasons although decline in the real pr ice of rock lobsters compounded the problem effort increase s among vessels continuing to fish were such that overall effort within th fishery was reduced only marginally despite 17 reduction in vessel numbers license values rose significantly fo

after depleted fishery has recovered and is once more economically profitable if controlled fishery expansion is possible subsequent to recovery of depleted fishery priority on ne w entrants could be given to those fishermen displaced by the reduction program however care must be taken to limit the expansion of sustainable capacity sinc allowing new entrants can defeat the purpose of buybackretirement program not to mention waste money capacity reduction might also be viewed as part of transition from structure that permitted unsustainable harvests to more sustainable structure this ne w structure implies smaller fishing fleets less peak employment and possibly changes in the location and nature of fishing communities major question is what role if any congress might take particularly with respect to anticipated transition cost s including temporary economic assistance it should be kept in mind that marke t processes including lack of harvest opportunities as well as price pressures due to competition with aquaculture and commercial catch from other regions can an d may exert more substantial impact on fishing capacity than formal capacit reduction program might48 the differences between capacity and effort have been mentioned earlier but are of great importance and can be easily confused since both are hard to define ultimately what is often referred to as effort the combined effect of the number of days fished nets h auled hooks set etc finds expression in the mortality rate of fish stock due to fishing capacity reduction schemes unless they remove substantial percentage of effort will not reduce the fishing mortality rate and ma have little measurable effect on the biological state of fish stock since vessel s remaining might fish harder or longer capacity reduction is an inefficient way t manage fishing effort reduction in capacity may increase economic profitability forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs22 due to specialized equipment or unique vessel configuration that may not be easil y49 convertible for use in another fishery or simply the advanced age of the vesselthose remaining within fishery by concentrating harvest among fewer vessels but capacity reduction does not assure recovery of depleted stock because it does not necessarily reduce the total harvest although reduction in capacity from vessel buyback or license retirement may be identical the localized effects on the fishing industry could be different license retirement unless it removes substantial portion of the fishermen in fishery will not result i n capacity reduction if the remaining vessels can be upgraded or replaced by larger vessels to fish harder and longer mandatory destruction of vessel s purchased in buyback scheme may prevent prices of vessels in nearby open access fisheries from dropping substantially ie maintain current values of pas t investments if vessels are not destroyed low v essel prices could promote entry into other marginal fishe ries where access is not limited or put lessexpensive equipment on the market for use in upgrading vessels within limited access fishery effectively increasin g capacity conversely if destruction of vessels should increase the pric paid for vessels in buyback fewer vessels ma be purchased and sellers may acquire sufficient capital to purchase more efficient vessels for use in other fisheries since resale of purchased vessels into other fisheries has been shown to b expensive to administer it has largely been abandone d as an option resale prices are generally very low and resale merely relocates or exports the problem f49 overcapacity to other fishe ries this problem has been highlighted by developmental and environmental nongovernmental organizations who especially seek to prevent overcapacity problems from being relocated to lessdeveloped nations wher managers may have even less expertise to deal with overcapacity concerns mandatory destruction of purchased vessels is not popular among suppliers of fishing equipment as experience has demonstrated development of substantia l market for secondhand deck and wheelhouse equi pment however the value of such sales will be taken into consideration by prospective sellers when furnishing bids giving those paying for the buyback greater value for money the regulated sale of vessels for nonfishing p urposes such as research may allow purchase by nonprofit organizations that could not otherwise have been afforded however care must be taken to assure that such vessels do not inadvertently find their way back into some fishery either in the united states or abroad experience shows that direct sale s between vendor and purchaser are much more cost effective than via the buybac k authority the mandat ory destruction of vessels raises strong emotion in many but als presents feeling of fait accompli among those remaining in the fishery th perception that problems caused by overcapacity are being addressed directly ma help in securing support for additional recovery measures such as quota or gea r restrictions or seasonal closures although by means unanimous support from the fishing industry for mandatory destruction or permanent withdrawal from th fishing register is widespreadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs23 in addition to speculative buying of licenses those already in fishery may engage i n50 strategic behavior to establish significant catch history within the likely qualifying period such behavior may be engaged in by former but recently inactive participants as way to capture share of the anticipated windfall profits associated with many limited acces s programs such behaviors have been justified as providing compensation for individuals who participated in pioneering such fishery speculative investors typically see themselves as savvy capitalists who seized upon an opportunitywhile potentially offering greater capacity reduction per dollar ie licens generally costs less than vessel license retirement is more likely to export th problems of overcapacity to other fisheries since the ability to fish is less damaged by surrendering ones license than ones vessel indeed buybacks without wid application of limited access are unlikely to be successful in reducing rather tha n merely relocating overcapacity problems as alternative openaccess fisherie s become more scarce this will become less of problem but the ultimate extension will likely be that vessels without licenses will become progressively less valuable and vendors will seek to be paid more for their licenses eventually approaching vesse l buyback prices success and failures schemes that have achieved their aims of restoring profi tability or allowing stock recovery have one common thread the relatively high proportion of the capacity removed whether active or not from the f ishery the successful buyback of 25 of the norwegian seine fleet and 57 of the australian northern prawn fishery capacity units are in marked contrast to reductions achieved in some of the earlier nort h american schemes althoug h apparently high percentages of licenses were removed in many of these multiple license holdings and latent capacity meant that little effort reduction was achieved as active cap acity was withdrawn many fishermen that had accepted buyback finance reentered the fishery through purchase of licenses fro m inactive vessels in some cases the premium paid for buyback vessels even helpe d their replacement by more efficient vessels increasing the problems of overcapacity rather than reducing it some have recognized latent capacity as serious problem speculativ participation in fishery escalates when limited access management is firs t acknowledged as possible on the other hand latent capacity may provide th e50 alternative s and flexibility that fishermen need to succeed in very volatile an d uncertain industry the dual buyback of both active and in active capacity as intended by the fcri in new england is one ap proach to solving this an annual renewal fee may be sufficient to deter some individuals from maintaining their eligibility but s access to fisheries becomes progressively mo re difficult licenses will be seen as being more and more desirable and the fees may need to be quite high to cause significant attrition requiring license use ie verified

license eligibility or cover the fee an understanding of the forces within particular fishery is needed to formulate capacity reduction scheme where significant latent capacity exists experienc indicates that any scheme which does not address the latent capacity problem wil l either fail or require great deal of financing over long enough period to mobilize all of the latent capacity another welldocumented aspect of the latent capacity problem that reduces the success of capacity reduction schemes is subsequent increase in effort or capacity of those vessels remaining in the fishery ie capital stuffing or mobilizin g underuti lized capacity such an increase has been the aim of certain schemes i n fisheries where economic is sues were of primary concern and where stock depletion has been prevented or minimized by othe r management measures however in other cases increases in effort or capacity of individual vessels have canceled any of th perceived benefits of the buybac k the experiences of british columbia in the 1970s and 1980s show the difficulties in preventing upgrading of vessel capacity within fishery the use of some sort of capacity units is an attempt to resolve this problem the united kingdoms scheme going step f urther and imposing 10 unit penalty when licenses are stacked responds to the generally greater efficiency of newe r vessels technological improvements are such that even in fisheries with laten t capacity and where license transfer to larger or more powerful vessels is forbidden catching p ower of individual vessels will increase over time detailed study in the oregon bott om trawl fishery estimated 2 annual increase close to the estimate51 of 2 to 4 by fishermens federation in the united kingdom with respect to the north sea trawl fleet52 figures such as these suggest that current buyback schemes within the united states will not be fficient in themselves to correct the problems caused by years of overcapitalization while lessons from the p ast have been learned capacity reduction schemes will prob ably not succeed if they are not of sufficient magnitude it may be easier during times of fiscal restraint to suggest schemes of limited scope bu t underfunded capacity reductio n programs have been shown repeatedly to act as little more than subsidies that encourage further ov ercapitalization latent capacity andor capital stuffing can easily negate the achievements of modest capacity reductio n programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs25 shrank william extended fisheries juris diction origins of the current crisis in atlantic53 canadas fisheries marine policy v 19 1995 285299a review of canadian experiences extending as far back as 1969 has shown53 how shortterm political reasons prevented sufficient reduction in the canadia n atlantic fleets to sustain pr ofitability as well as any reduction in total allowable catch to achieve sustainable harvests even though this was recognized at the time th shortterm effect was to maintain employment in the fisheries at unsustainably hig h levels at substantial cost to the taxpayers the longterm effects are now known the world over complete closure of several onceprolific fisheries and c19 billion f government money to prevent economic collapse of the affected coastal regions valuable natural resource has in effect been considerable drain on governmen t funds for the last 20 years instead of productive asset even now despite thes lessons funds for license retirement cont inue to be diverted and it is widely accepted that capacity will still be greater than the fully recovered resource can profitabl sustain admitting that jobs may be lost often in areas that can ill afford it and i n communities where fishing is way of life is painfu l and has been repeatedly avoided alternative fisheries in which to deploy vesse ls retiring from overcapitalized fleets are becoming increasingly rare however fishery managers do have choice in how to affect the spectrum of vessels within fishery what appears to have been lacking are clear objectives or priorities for manag ers for influencing the size and structure of the fishing fleet the formulation of such objectives or priorities could seek t incorporate the view s of all stakeholders in the fishery involving them in sharing the responsibility for man aging this resource alternative decisions on how to distribute capacity reduction among different gear types within fishery could result in ver different effects on local employment in the fishing industry and fishing communit economies regulations within fishery may be used to optimize whatever asset of tha t particular fishery is valued most in areas where num erous small communities depend on traditional fisheries buyback scheme and subsequent management measure s could be tailored to remove the most highly capitaliz ed vessels those that provide the smallest number of jobs for the amount of fish they land in other areas wher economic returns from the resource are viewed as being of chief importance buyback and licensestacking regulations could encourage rationalization in favor of fe w highly capitalized and efficient factory ships however defining objectives fo r individual fisheries that managers can then strive to achieve is political decision that affects wide array of interested parties eg fishermen coastal communit businesses large fishing companies processors scientists managers the closure of fisheries that have tradition of open access is bound to caus some controversy an d ill feeling among those who are excluded especially when or if there are significant economic returns for those holding licenses some argue that vessels with the privilege of access sh ould compensate those denied this privilege in places where closure of fisheries to new entrants is particularly controversial license fees of some sort might not only pay for enforcement costs within the fishery bu thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs26 efficient can mean different things to different people for an individual skipper gear that54 allows maximum capture of resource in the shortest time is most efficient for society however gear that maximizes sustainable returns in the longterm may be more sociall efficientcould also be used in retraining or job creation schemes within the communitie s traditionally supported by the fishery the economic difficulties faced by many fishing fleets within the united states are such that few could currently afford to finance capacity reduction scheme from within however subsequent economic recovery of the fleet may be sufficient t allow annual license fees that could repay at least some of the cost of the capacit reduction scheme whether such fees would be politically acceptable is anothe r matter gear retirement gear retirement has been infrequently discussed and little used but does offe r the potential to stabilize em ployment within some fisheries while reducing incidental bycatch within the fishery and da mage to the environment critics however see any restrictions on gear choice to be regulation by ineffici ency forcing the fishing industry to operate with less profitability and in fashion that is less than economicall optimal many laborintensive methods of fishing eg targeting larger individuals within species have lost favor as technology has improved gear retirement an d subsequent bannin g of certain types of gear may allow or force fishery to change to more tainable methods that in the long term may prove to use the fisher resource more efficiently the recent move to ban dragging for lobsters in ne w54 england is an example of restrictions on efficient gear for the individual in favor f greater societal efficiency such restrictions may however impose costs an d inefficiencies that will be distributed among various segments of society and should therefore be identified and assessed prior to their implementation harpoon fis hery for swordfish on the atlantic coast that targeted only older larger individuals has existe d for many years it appeared to be sustainable as it was relatively laborintensive required little capital and allowed individual swordfish to spawn sev eral times before they were susceptible to capture the development of longline fishery that captured t only the larger fish but many juveniles that had not reached sexual maturity caused the harpoon fishery to become uneconomic and i t has almost died out some argue that t his experience indicates need for greater use of social and economic studies i n decisionmaking and that managers exert reasoned control over what types of gear might be legally fished in another example scallop dredges have been shown to kill large number of juvenile scallops as well as causing considerable damage to other seabed fauna shallow waters however make possible dive fishery in which juvenile mortality and seabed damage is nonexistent the larger individuals targeted have not only had chance to spawn but also command higher prices due to their perceived highe rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs27 quality buying scallop dredges and subsequently banning dredg ing from certain areas could increase long term revenues and employment in the fishery full accounting of the relati ve costs of such gear decisions would also include the differential risk to the fishermens health and safety effects on total market suppl of the product effects on the perunit costs of harvesting resulting market price to the consumer and other factors fishermen are adept at circumventing regulat ions designed to limit their catches and are often loath to change fishing thods that they have developed and practiced over number of years unilateral implementation of gear restr ictions may cause both resentment and economic difficulti in what are often already hardpressed fisheries the 1995 gillne t buyback in florida is an example of some of the problems that may be encountered and policing of unpopular gear restr ictions can be expensive and time consuming gear retirement may be way of reducing these problems and allowing fishermen to finance more sustainable methods of fishing they could not otherwis have afforded to turn to thus gear re tirement could play beneficial role in helping fisheries return to profitability and sustainabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97441crs28 appendix restricted access fisheries in the united states the following fisheries are considered to be currently under some form of limited entry or controlled access fisheries for which there is complete closure r moratorium in federal waters eg weakfish atlantic striped bass atlantic salmon are not considered to be under limited entry or controlled access since there i s essentially access at all while few of these fisheries have structured systems of limited access eg individual transferable quota systems others have minima l restrictions such as income qualification for permits note also that while th following li st generally equates to fishery management plans fmps some fisheries have been broken out eg atlantic surf
