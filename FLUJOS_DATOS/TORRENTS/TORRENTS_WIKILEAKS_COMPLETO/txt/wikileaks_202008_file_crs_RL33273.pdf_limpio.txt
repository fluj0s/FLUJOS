collection use and sale credit freezes and fraud alerts on consumer reports identity theft penalties causes of action and preemption some of these bills preempt and sometimes limit recently enacted state laws laws affected some of the bills attempted to amend the grammleachbliley act to require fina ncial institution to notify customers consumer reporting agencies and law enforcement agencies of

without authorizati on concealing security breaches involving personally identifiable information and unlawfully accessing anothers means of identification during felony involving co mputers amendmen

consumer reporting agencies businesses sharing information with affiliates entities with established business relationships with the data subject news organizations private investigators and labor unions any agency or person engaged in inters tate commerce that owns or licenses electronic data containing personal information financial institution or consumer reporting agency reporting broker or reporting collector the federal bills included provisions that define protected information regulating either personal information sensitive financ ial identity information sensitive financial account information or sensitive personally identifiable information some bills established limitati ons on the sale or tr ansfer of sensitive personal information data privacy and security safeguards the federal bills required covered entities to take reasonable steps to protect against security breaches and to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive personal info rmation that the entity sells maintains collects or transfers some bills prescribe data security safeguards and guidelines for joint promulgation of security regula tions others required the federal trade commission ftc to promulgate regulations governing the conduct of information brokers many of the federal bills included provisions that would have imposed mandatory security requirements for sensitive personal in formation required implementation of technical security safegu ards and best practi ces and mandated the development of security po licies governing the processi ng and storage of personal data regulations in some cases were to include requirements for financial institutions to dispose of sensitive pers onal financial information an online information security working group to deve lop best practices was created in one of the bills another theme that existed within some of the bills was application of fair information practices similar to the privacy act 5 usc 552a and other privacy laws such the health insurance port ability and accountability act hipaa to information brokers not currently subject to similar protection to give individuals more control over the sharing of their

methods and content of notice and the duty to coordinate with consumer reporting agencies were generally included sometimes exceptions to notification requirements were permitted for national security and law enforcement purposes with notice to congress when exceptions are made the purpose of law enforcement ex ception to request hold on notification is to gather additional information pending investigation some bills required notice to individuals if it is determined that the breach has resulted in or poses reasonable risk of identity theft or if the breach is reasonably likely to result in harm or substantial inconvenience to the consumer some amend gramml eachbliley to require financial institutions to provide notice when breach occurs to the consumer to consumer reporting agencies to ne wly created ftc information clearinghouse and to law enforcement agencies in some cases entities that maintain personal information for financial institutions are required to notify the institution when breach has occurred some of the proposal s provided an exemption from the notice requirement when the information was encrypted in some of the bills covered entities were required upon disc overing breach of security to report the breach to the ftc or other appropriate federal regulator and to notify consumer reporting agencies if the breach is determined to affect the sensitive personal information of 1000 or more individuals restrictions on social security numbers recently congress has sought to further limit uses of the social security number and is likely to continue to consider such measures in the 110th congress including proposals to remove social security numbers from medicare cards and limiting or prohibiting solicitation display sale purchase use or access to social security numbers in the private sector11 credit freezes thirtyeight states now have credit freeze laws12 some bills would have permitted consumer to place credit or security freeze on

other bills would have created nationa l notification standard without preempting stronger state laws and still others would not preempt state trespass contract or tort law or other state laws that relate to fraud compliance concerns have been raised with the prospect that multiple laws requiring potentially different notification requirements will make compliance an overly complex and expensive task bu siness groups and privacy advocates differ in their views of whether federal data s ecurity law should allow stronger state laws industry groups and affected companies dvocate narrow notification standard that would preempt diffe ring state laws 15 privacy advocates seek uniform national notification standard without pr eempting stronger state laws16 the question of over notification has been raised by industry pa rticipants business groups argue that the california breach notification law has prompted overnotification companies notifying consumers of data security breaches when there is risk of economic harm or fraud related question is wh ether breach notification should occur for all security breaches or whether it shoul d be limited to significant breaches some of the federal bills would have established federal notice requirement when there has been breach that raises significant ri sks to consumers federal legislation was also introduced to establish federal floor for notification requirements that are not preemptive of state laws an approach suppor ted by the majority of state attorneys general business interests have pointed out that federal floor approach will mean that in practice the law of the strictest state will become the facto standard and thus prefer clear federal preemption of state lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33273crs9
