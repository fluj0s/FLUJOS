1997 concluded that the mining law provide s only one millsite of more than five acres per mining claim critics argue tha t nowhere in the statute 30 usc 42 does it state that there can be only one millsite per mining claim based on the november 1997 opinion the solicitor ruled in march 1999 that the battle mountain gold companys plan of operation could not b approved for the crown jewel mine in the state of washington because the number and acreag of millsites exceeded the five acre limit per mining claim as part of the emergency supplemental bill pl 10631 congress overturned the solicitor s decision at least for the remainder of fy1999 two opposing views have been staked out within the context of the interio r appropriations bill for fy2000 the senate appropriations committee approve d language that would permanently prohibit limits on the number and acreage f millsites per mining claim the house passed language that supports the solicitors view some would like the issue resolved in the context of broader revisions of the general mining law of 1872 the house language supporting the solicitors opinion is considered far to restrictive by the industry according to the national mining association nma many operations would not survive the nma contends that modern minin g operations typically require much larger tracts of nd for waste disposal miners also believe that onetoone claim to millsite ratio would make it necessary to go outside the federal domain to obtain sufficient area to locate milling facilities an alliance of environmental groups known as the okanogan highlands alliance has opposed the crown je wel mine and contends that overall tougher environmental provisio ns are needed in the mining law specifically the alliance has expresse d concern over how the excess acreage for waste d isposal would affect water quality the alliance argues that the mine waste would have significant impact on th headwaters of several creeks that flow into the kettle and

be developed even without patent to support the developmen t of mining claim the claimant has the right to use and patent nonmineral noncontiguous lands for the purposes of setting up ancillary facilities or millsites to mill and proce ss ore more specifically the mining law states that where nonmineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is used or occupied by the prop rietor of such vein or lode for mining or milling purposes suc h nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced and included in an application for patent for suc h vein or lode and the same may be patented therewith but

claimant to maximum of 5 acres per mining claim onetoone millsite to mining claim ratio after review of patent applications the solicitor of the department of the interior i n november 7 1997 opinion concluded that onetoone ratio is the correct interpretation solicitor john leshy states my office has closely examined these questions th mining law of 1872 provides that only one millsite of more

crown jewel mine would have to review other options for locat ing the desired number of millsites in excess of the 5 acres per claim such options include land exchanges leases or government buyout which could require congressional action legislation the denial of the plan of operations for the crown jewel mine was overturned in congress as part of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fy1999 pl 10631 section 3006 this law removed the millsite limitations for the crown jewel mine notwithstanding the opinion of the interior solicitor more specifically the law states that in acc

on the blm handbook for mineral s examiners and the blm manual supporters of this view maintain that nowhere in the statute is there expressly stated fixed number of millsites per claim and tha t current practice allows for millsites to exceed one toone ratio the senate defeated floor amendment on july 27 1999 that sought to delete the millsite languag reported by the appropriations committee

1987 p 181 of the november 1997 opinion and another twenty application have excess millsites another 27 out of total of 338 pending plans of operations are reported to have9 excess acreage the industry argues that to uphold onetoone millsitetoclai m ratio would not be in keeping with common practice by the blm and the minin g industry it is recognized throughout the ning and regulatory community that five acre millsite is inadequate for most modern commercial mining operations mining operations typically require much larger tract s of land for waste disposal particularly open pit gold mining operations using heap leach technology which allows lowe r grades of ore to be mined this process results in larger amounts of rock to be dug and larger disposal ponds needed to contain the waste miners also believe that enforcing onetoone claim to millsite ratio woul d make it necessary to g outside the federal domain to obtain sufficient area to locate milling facilities major question facing b oth industry and government is are other public or private lands available and suitable in an earlier article written by him solicitor john leshy stated that f ive acre millsite is likely to be insufficient for most modern mining operations thus the miners only remedy is to acquire the needed land by exchange or purchase often the only land avail able is federal land which the government is not required to sell10 solicitor leshy also stated that the millsite provision is hopelessl anachron istic or ambiguous provision of the mining law because of congress s inability to confront headon the need for new laws better suited to moder n conditions many believe that the solution to the millsite and other issues is t o11 amend the entire mining law environmental conc erns an alliance of environmental groups known as the okanogan highlands alliance has opposed the crown jewel mine and contends that tougher environmental provisions are needed in the mining law

proposed project would directly affect 376 acres f wetlands and eight springs and seeps indirect impacts would occ ur on about 15 acres of wetlands and nine springs and seeps discharges of leachate

would violate th senior rights of downstream users 12 broader mining law reforms the millsite debate may place the general mining law of 1872 under mor scrutiny this congress this is partly because the debate raises many broad polic issues for instance to grandfather all the patent applicants under patent moratorium provisions that ve received their firsthalf final certificate would appear to defeat the administrations policy of limiting the number of patents issued the millsit ruling would assist the administrations ef forts to slow down the patent process even further by invalidating number of mining claims however to settle the millsit issue based on the current legislative pro posals could either allow the mining industry to use and patent as much public land as it needed for ancillary facilities associated with mining operation s 1292 or on the other hand hr 2466 possibly shut down many mining operati ons both parties have developed versions of mining law reform they would prefer to advance the industry wants mining law bill tha t13 would continue to allow patenting of federal lands and generally minimize the impact of any royalty the environmentalists are opposed to open pit heap leach mining using cyanide to extract gold and would prefer comprehensive reform that include s environmental provisions
