beyond that date w ill likely be legislative issue during the first session of the 111th congress in the 109th congress renewal of the gsp wa s somewhat controversial owing in part to concerns of some

gi ven to the most favored other nation therefore with certain exceptions including gsp re gional trading arrangements and free trade agreements every country gets the lowest tariff that any country gets and reductions in tariffs to one country are provided also to others the term mostfavorednation has been changed in us law to normal trade relations fourth possible implications of gsp expi ration and other options for congress are mentioned history and rationale of the gsp the basic principle behind the gsp is to provide certain goods originating in developing countries with pr eferential market access usua lly in the form of lower tariff rates or dutyfree status to deve loped country markets in order to spur economic growth the program was first adopted internationa lly in 1968 by the united nations conference on trade and development unctad at the unctad ii conference2 economic basis the gsp was established based on an economic theory that preferential tariff rates in developed country markets could promote export driven industry growth in developing countries it was believed that this in turn would help to free beneficiaries from heavy dependence on trad in primary products whose slow long term growth and price instability contributed to chronic trade deficits3 i t w s thought that only the larger markets of i ndustrialized trading pa rtners were large enough to provide enough economic stimulus to attain these goals4 some economists also mention that the generalized system of preferences was established in part as means of reconciling two widely divergent economic perspectives of trade equity that arose during early negotiations on the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt5 industrialized deve loped nations argued that the mostfavorednation principle6 should be the fundamental principle governing multilateral trade while lesserdeveloped count ries believed that equal treatment of unequal trading partners did not constitute equity and called for specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs3 7 oecd gsp review p 11 8 ibid p 10 9 wall david problems with preferences international affairs vol 47 october 1971 p 95 10 world trade organization ministeria l declaration annex f december 18 2005 wtmin05dec 11 ibidand differential treatment fo r developing countries g sp schemes thus became one of the means of offering form of special treatment that deve loping nations sought while allaying the fears of developed countries that tari ff disarmament might create serious disruptions in their domestic markets7 due to differences in developed count ries economic structures and tariff programs as well as different domestic industr ies and products each wanted to shield from such competition it proved difficult to create one unified system of identical tariff concessions therefore the gsp became system of individual national schemes based on co mmon goals and principles each with view toward providing developing countries with ge nerally equivalent opportunities for export growth8 as result the preferencegranting countries implemented various individual schemes of temporary generalized nonr eciprocal nondiscriminatory preferences under which tariffs were lowe red or eliminated on certain imports from developing countries as condition for providing such tariff preferences gsp preferencegranting countries reserved the right to 1 excl ude certain countries 2 determine product coverage 3 determine rules of origin governing the preference 4 determine the duration of the scheme 5 reduce any pr eferential margins accruing to developing countries by continuing to lower or re move tariffs as result of multilateral negotiations 6 prevent the concentration of benefits among few countries and 7 include safeguard mechanisms or escape clauses9 although gsp programs were intended to be temporary an international legal framework under the gatt as discussed be low was developed to allow these programs to continue add itionally many devel oped countries have also decided to grant additional market access through gsp or other preferential programs to products of countries they designate as leastdeveloped countri ldcs at the sixth world trade organization wto nisterial conference in hong kong in december 2005 developed country wt members and developing country members declaring themselves in position to do so agreed to deepen this commitment by providing dutyfree nd quotafree market dfqf access on lasting basis for all produc ts originating from all leas t developed countries by 2008 or later than the start of the implementation period in manner that ensures stability security and predictability10 members facing difficulties with providing such access would be permitted to exempt 3 of all tariff lines provided they take steps to achieve the goal of total duty and quotafree access by incrementally building on the list of covered products11 since dda talks have been suspended this dutyfreequotafree offer is in jeopardyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs4 12 this section was written by jeanne grimmett legislative attorney american law division for

clauseinternational legal framework12 because it is preference program by its very nature the gsp posed problem under the gatt in that the granting of pref erences would be facially inconsistent with the fundamental obligation placed on gatt parties in gatt article i1 to grant mostfavorednation mfn tariff trea tment to the products of all other gatt parties as noted however preference prog rams were viewed as vehicles of trade liberalization and economic development for developing countries thus gatt parties accommodated them in series of joint actions in 1965 the gatt parties added part iv to the general agreement an amendment that recognizes the special economic needs of developing countries and asserts the principle of nonreciprocity under this principle developed countries forego the receipt of reci procal benefits for their negotiated commitme nts to reduce or eliminate tariffs and restrictions on the trade of less developed contracting parties13 because of the underlying mfn i ssue gatt parties in 1971 adopted waiver of article i for gsp programs wh ich allowed developed contracting parties to accord more favorable tariff treatment to the products of developing countries for ten years14 the gsp was described in the deci sion as system of generalized non reciprocal and nondiscriminatory prefer ences beneficial to the developing countries at the end of the tokyo round of multilateral trade ne gotiations in 1979 developing countries secured adoption of the enabling clause permanent deviation from mfn by joint decision of the gatt contracting parties15 the clause

country extends to qualifying beneficiary developing countries as termined by each benefactor an exemption from duties either reduced tariffs or dutyfree access on most manufactured products and

defining and iden tifying developing c ountry beneficiaries consequently the list of beneficiaries and exceptions may vary greatly between countries if political changes have take n place in beneficiary country the country might be excluded from gsp programs in so countries such as the united states but not in others most count ries exclude countries if they have entered into another kind

dutyfree access or reduced tariffs for everything but arms30 is currently perhaps the most inclusive gspgranting countries may also have incentivebased programs that provide enhanced bene fits for beneficiary countries that meet certain additional cr iteria for example in 2007 the european community implemented regulation that grants additional gsp benefits to those countries that have demons trated their commitment to stainable development and internationally recognized worker rights31 each preferencegranting nation also has safeguards in place to ensure that any significant increases in imports of cer tain product do not dversely affect the receiving countrys domestic ma rket generally these rest rictions take the form of quantitative limits on goods entering under gsp under japans system for example imports of certain products unde r the preference are limited by quantity or value whichever is applicable on first come firstserved basis as administered on monthly or daily as

congress70 effectiveness of gsp the statutory goals of the gsp are in part to 1 promote the development of developing countries 2 prom ote trade rather than aid as more efficient way of promoting economic development 3 stimula us exports in developing country markets and 4 promote trade liber alization in developing countries71 it is difficult to assess whether or not the program has achieved these goals however because the gsp is only one of many such foreign aid initiatives employed by the united states to assist poorer c ountries economic ccess within countries is also related to internal factors such as stability wise policy decisions availability of infrastructure to foster industry and legalfinancial fra meworks that encourage foreign investment what follows therefore are general comme nts rather than hard data about the impact of gsp on developing countries and possible economic effects on the us market the positions of various stakeholde rs regarding the value of the program are also discussed effects on developing countries in the last ten years total us imports from bdcs have increased dramatically from 1078 billion in 1996 to 3134 billion in 2007 see figure 1 this may indicate in very general terms that th gsp and other prefer ential programs have helped create some exportdriven growth in developing countries total exports entering under the preference have also increased markedly from 116 billion in 1996 to 326 billion in 2006 in 2007 imports under gsp declined slightly to 308 billion however the percentage of goods tering the united states under the gsp program relative to total us imports from bdcs has remained relatively flat at around 10 this may be due in part to the presence of the automatic competitive need limits absent cnl waivers on gspeligible produc ts and mandatory graduation of countries from the program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs21 72 organization for economic coope ration and development oecd agriculture and food

accountability office us trade preference programs provide important benefits but more integrated approach would better ensure programs meet shared goals march 2008 p 19 73 ibidanother indicator of the gsps impact on developing countries is the utilization rate of the preference at first glance it seems that only few beneficiary developing countries use gsp to great extent howe ver as one study pointed out the apparent lack of utilization masks the fact that many gspeligible goods may also be imported dutyfree under other us regional preference schemes such as agoa72 the study also illustrated that for certain industr ies in bdcs the positive impact of gsp is quite significant for example for all agricultural commodities eligible for gsp treatment the gsp utilization rate was approximately 5873 therefore for individual industries in deve loping countries the positive impact of the gsp could be seen as quite significant many developing countries with na tural competitive advantage in certain products use trade preferences such as the g sp to gain foothold in the international market for example india and thailand have wellestablishe d jewelry industries and argentina enjoys an advantage in cer tain leather goods that are imported under the preference exporters in these indus tries have been able to expand their international reach through gsp programs on the othe

in value of importsactually become competitive over time trade diversion74 although the costs of trade diversion are real empirical evidence suggests that the overall effects of gsp are relatively small75 the lack of reciprocity in the gsp prog ram could also result in longterm costs for beneficiary countries in multilatera l trade negotiations such as the dda countries may engage in reci procal tariff reductions mean ing that all parties would agree to reduce their tariffs by avoi ding such reciprocal concessions some developing countries may ve tended to keep in place protectionist trade policies that may in fact impede their longterm growth moreover these preferences can become an impediment to negotiations as developing countries seek ways of maintaining their preferences from eroding for this reason many economists pref er multilateral nondi scriminatory tariff cuts because preferential tariff programs ch as the gsp can lead to inefficient production and trade patterns when tariffs are reduced acrosstheboard rather than in preferential manner countries tend to produce and export on the basis of their comparative advantage thus exporting products that they produce relatively efficiently and importing products that others produce relatively efficiently however while some developing country producers especially those whose products do not qualify under gsp may benefit from multilateral tariff reductions other industries may be hurt becau their margin of preference under gsp is reduced economic effects on the us market overall effects of the gsp on the us economy are relatively small imports under the program in 2007 represented bout 308 billion in comparison to total us imports of 19 trillion in addition th rate of increase of imports entering under gsp in the past ten years is relatively flat see figure 1 indicating that there may be little impact on the us market as whole by extending the preference in federal budgetary terms the congressi onal

eligible articles be withdrawn78 the fact that as illustrated in figure 1 the dollar amount of imports entering under gsp has remained fairly level for at leas t the past 10 years may also indicate that the gsp has little impact on most domestic producers many us manufacturers and importe rs benefit from the lower cost of consumer goods and raw ma terials imported under the g sp program us demand for certain individual products such as je welry leather and aluminum is quite significant79 however it is difficult to gauge other than anecdotally the overall impact of the gsp program on the us market when compared to similar imports from other countries that do not receive th preference it is possible that some merchandise entering under the gsp c ould be competitive even without the preference but it is also possible that the dutyfree status is the primary factor that makes imports from these count ries more attractive stakeholders concerns supporters of the gsp include beneficiar developing country governments and exporters us importers and some u s manufacturers who use inputs entering under gsp in downstream products some policymakers favor gsp renewal because they believe it is an important devel opment and foreign policy tool those who oppose the program include us producer s who manufacture competing products and some in congress who favor more reciprocal approaches to trade policy what follows is thematic approach to the major topics of discussion in the gsp renewal debate special and differential treatment developing countries have long maintained that special and differential treatment such as that provided by the gsp is an important assurance of acce ss to us and other developed country markets in the midst of increasing globalization80 many of these countries have built industries or segments of industries based on receiving certain tariff preferences those who oppose automatic renewal of g sp have expressed th desire to see some reciprocity and appreci ation on the part of bdcs in the form of offers of improved market access in return for renewal of the program81 some of

based on this premis however other us preference program is more broadly ba sed or encompasses as ma ny countries as the gsp conditionality of preferences additionally some supporters of the gsp and other nonreciprocal preferences believe that the conditions such as worker rights intellectual propert requirements or drug eradication incumbent on developing countries if they are to qualif for gsp

foreign and commercial interests93 however some beneficiar countries actively object to these country practice provisions and regard them as penalties some countries such as brazil and india that have been targeted for eligibility review in the past perceive that such action indicates that they are being penalized for advocating for their own national development goals in multilateral talks94 moreover some intellectual property i ndustry representatives worker rights groups and other constituencies in the united states sometimes oppose in their view the us administrations allegedly inconsistent enforcement of these provisions for example one lobbying group expressed that they were shocked and dumbfounded that the gsp is being annually renewed for such countries as brazil venezuela and russia in spite of in tellectual property rights violations95 t h i s domestic opposition may indicate that at time s the conditionality of the preferences is of limited usefulness according to ustr however us officials work with beneficiary countries during country practice reviews to actively address compliance issues prior to removing the country from eligibility between 2001 and 2006 one country was removed from eligibility for g sp because of intellectual property rights concerns but was reinstated few years later after taking steps to resolve the problem96 lower costs of imports us importers of goods who import components parts or materials dutyfree under the gsp maintain that the preference results in lower costs for these intermediate g oods which in turn can be passed on to consumers in may 1 2006 letter to the house ways and means and senate finance committees coalition of importers and retailers warned that if the gsp was allowed to expire or if its benefits we re reduced it would impose costly hardship on not only beneficiary countries but their american customers as well97 industry representatives mentioned that smaller domestic manufacturers who regularly import inputs under the preference may be especially affected by lapse or expiration of the program because they are less able to adjust to the increased costs that would result98httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs27 99 19 usc 2463c 100 administration decides to keep russian gsp benefits for titanium inside us trade july 9 2004 101 19 usc 2466b as amended by section 7 of the agoa acceleration act of 2004 pl 108274on the other hand even though most us producers are shielded by the automatic safeguards triggered by incr eased imports under the gsp some us manufacturers and workers might be adversely affected by the program due to cnl waivers99 for example in 2004 three us producers of titanium complained that the bush administration refused to terminate dutyfree market access for wrought titanium ordinarily subject to 15 duty assessment despite petition asking the government not to waive the import limits russian imports of titanium were allowed to continue to enter dutyfree unde r the presidential waiver even though its sales made up more than 60 of us imports100 conclusion and options for congress the us program as established by title v of the trade act of 1974 was extended for all countries for which it had not previously been extended through december 31 2008 in section 8002 of pl 109432 meaning that congress may consider its extension and that of other trade preference programs set to expire during the second session of the 110th congress the african growth and opportunity acceleration act of 2004 pl 108274 had previously authorized an extension of gsp preferences for all be neficiary developing subsaharan african countries under the african growth and opportunity act agoa through september 30 2015101 the extension in the 109th congress represented the first time since 1984 that the program had b een extended without lapse see table 5 several options are available to congress with respect to the treatment of the gsp program as explained more fully below congress could allow the gsp program to expire support reciprocal tari ff and market access benefits through free trade agreements renew the gsp for least developed beneficiar ies only renew the existing program for all beneficiaries w ithout major amendments or extend the program in modified form although the gsp is unilateral and nonreciprocal tariff preference any changes to the program would need to be considered in light of the requirements of the wto enabling clause as it has been interpreted by the wto appellate body at minimum the united states would need to notify and possibly consult with other wto members regarding any withdrawal or modification of gsp benefits as required by 4 of the clause the united states could also pursue wto waiver were any modifications of th gsp program considered not to comport fully with us wto obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs28 102 19 usc 2465 103 19 usc 2466b as amended by section 7 of the agoa

countries on december 31 2008102 except for all beneficiary subsaharan african countries for which the preference is authorized through september 30 2015103 legislative action would be re quired to pursue this option before the preference was renewed in 2006 some believed that if the gsp was not renewed it might spur positive movement in the wto doha development agenda this position was presented by thenhouse ways and means chairman bill thomas and thensenate finance committee chairman chuck grassley104 similar position was also advocated in early 2002 when while testifying on intellectual property issues thenustr robert b zoellick mentioned that the threat of loss of gsp benefits has proven to be an effective point of leverage with some of our trading partners105 on the other hand country gr aduation limitations on cnl waivers or other modifications to the gsp program could so weaken the hand of us negotiators in the dda because it could longer be used as an incentive for participation many developing nations already perceive the united states as generally unwilling to accept multilateral efforts to grant additi onal special and di fferential treatment for developing country wto member s an important dda goal unless more reciprocal concessions for improved mark et access are made for us products as result gsp expiration could cause the negotiating positions of developing countries to harden rather than soften as they seek to make up for these lost benefits through the negotiations the united states could also lose substa ntial leverage in addressing important traderelated foreign policy and development concerns th at beneficiary nations must accept prior to bdc designation furtherm ore interested pa rties may now file petitions requesting the ustr to review the gsp status of bdcs based on these statutory criteria eg worker rights practi ces if the program were longer in effect these avenues of encouraging certa in developing country practices would longer be available106 some domestic manufacturers such as the us automobile industry may be adversely impacted by gsp expiration or m odification at least in the short term due to dependence on dutyfree thus lowerc ost manufacturing inputs imported under the preference smaller businesses could be disproportionately affected because theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs29

increased cost s of factors of production on the other hand some us manufacturers of importcompeting products mig ht at least marginally benefit some leastdeveloped gsp recipients c ould be harmed substantially by gsp expiration or other legislative changes for example equatorial guinea 91 of its exports mostly petroleum products ente r under gsp in 2006 and angola 59 of its exports to the united states ente red under gsp in 2006 both subsaharan african countries not designated recipients under the agoa preference107 are both leastdeveloped gsp beneficiaries othe r bdcs or regions with significant percentage of us trade entering under the gsp in 2006 included yemen least developed about 87 the west bank bout 29 zimbabwe 66 armenia 60 paraguay 48 mozambique l eastdeveloped 70 and niue 70 and togo 64 scrap gsp in favor of freetrade agreements or regional trading arrangements some in congress have suggested that the gsp should be abandoned in favor of free trade agreements ftas or regional trading arrangements rtas that would provide the united states with reciprocal benefits such arra ngements could provide additional markets for us exports as well as stimulate the growth of industries in developingcountry trading partners thus us exporters as well as importers could benefit from reciprocal tariff conce ssions since these tariff concessions under these agreements would probably apply to many more goods and industries than are covered by the existing gsp program th ey might increase the likelihood of across theboard economic stimulation in the deve loping country trading partner in addition absent favorable conclusion to the dda negotiations ftas and rtas could also be used as way to lead countries toward furt her multilateral trade liberalization however such reciprocal agreements could actually harm importcompeting us manufacturers more than unilateral preferences under the gsp because automatic safeguards written into the statute such as competitive need limitations might longer apply any such agreem ent could also involve greater number of us tariff concessions thus certain importsensitive items ineligible for gsp status could also be on the table on the othe r hand other us manuf acturers might benefit from the increased market access that an fta or rta would provide some developing countries could also be put at greater disadvantage in an fta or rta because they are illequipped to implement the add itional standards that accompany comprehensive u s free trade agreement108 indeed some countries such as south africa and other countries in the s outh african customs union sacu have been unsuccessful in negotia ting ftas with the united states due tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs30 their inability to reach these standards in addition since the gsp is the largest us preferential trading program some developing countries that currently receive gsp benefits could easily be left out of such agreements either because their markets are of little commercial value to us interests or because time constraints involved in the negotiating process do not make it worthwhile for us negotiators to include them authorize gsp only for leastdeveloped countries some in congress favor modifying the gsp so that it applies only with respect to leastdeveloped bdcs since many frican leastdeveloped beneficiaries will continue to receive the gsp prefer ence until mid2015 under agoa an ldconly gsp extension would apply only to th following countries afghanistan bangladesh bhutan comoros cambodi central african republic comoros congo kinshasa equatorial guinea haiti kiribati mauritania nepal samoa somalia togo tuval u vanuatu and yemen of these countries only si x afghanistan congo kinshasa equatorial guinea samoa somalia and yemen export goods that account for more than 10 of total us imports under the program therefore if the preference were extended to ldcs only absent any other modifica tions these countries at least initially would be the primary recipients to benefit modify gsp another possible approach for congress would be to modify the generalized system of preferences scheme as it applies to all benefi ciary developing countries including leastdeveloped countries restrict application of preference the following is list of possible approaches if congress desired to extend but further restrict imports under the gsp refine statutory criteria for gsp tr eatment for example make the existing discretionary criteri mandatory requirements strengthen the requirement that benefits under the preference may or must be terminated for noncompliance with mandatory or discretionary criteria add additional criteria to include movement toward sustainable development or environmental preservation reconsider criteria for gradua tion of countries from gsp or strengthen the provision that allows graduation of individual industries within beneficiary countri for example the president could be required to grant bdc stat us only if country 1 complies with all mandatory requirements and 2 has percapita income below certain level modify the rules of origin requi rement for qualifying products to require that greater percentage of the direct costs of processinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33663crs31 109 19 usc 2463a2aiiii the statute fu rther specifies that product may be made in one bdc or any two or more such countries that are members of the same association of countries and are treated as one under secti on 19 usc 24672 for beneficiary countries under agoa this percentage may also include up to

allow some import sensitive products in which developing countries often have competitive advantage to receive pr eferential access improve rule of origin requirements to provide more predictability current rules provide measurab definition of substantial transformation therefore us officials often make eligibility decisions on casebycase basis therefore bdcs sometimes have predictable way of
