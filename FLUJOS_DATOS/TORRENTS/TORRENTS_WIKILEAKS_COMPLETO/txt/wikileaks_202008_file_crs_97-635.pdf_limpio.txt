planfehbp to retain the current government and enrollee premium shares thesemeasures would reduce the federal budget deficit by 4780 billion over 5 yearsincluding about 28 million in savings from the new fehbp formula on june 17 1997 the senate governmental affairs committee approved reconciliation proposals that were the same as those approved in the housecommittee with one exception the increase in nonpostal agency contributions forcsrs employees would have been 16 of pay in the year 2002 instead of 151 the house version prevailed in the final legislation some have questioned whether the employee retirement contribution increases should apply to postal employees for whom the csrs is fully funded and to federal and postal workers participating in the federal employees retirement systemfers which is also fully funded however exempting postal or fers workersfrom the contribution increases might be perceived as unfair because the effect would be that one group federal workers covered by the csrs would be required to absorb within 5 years the full 18 billion in deficit reduction this provision was estimated to achieve an amendment to the budget reconciliation legislation to

insurance provisions for postal and federal personnel retirement programs reducing the budget deficit the congress and the administration agreed to balance the federal budget by the year 2002 many believe that like any employer involved in laborintensivebusiness when faced with the need to reduce expenditures the federal governmentmust look carefully at its payroll costs the federal pension plans are major component of those costs to help with deficit reduction the administration and the congress agreed that federal employees s hould share more of the cost of their retirement system during their working years and that nonpostal federal agenciesshould finance more of the cost of th eir employees pensions by reducing other spending under federal budget rules in creasing employee and agency contributions to the retirement system are counted as revenues to the government and thus reduce the federal budget deficit in the years in which those revenues are received in its fy1998 budget the administration had proposed to achieve additional savings by delaying the date on which co stofliving adjustments colas would be implemented for federal civil service and postal retirees however the congress rejected that proposal in agreeing to the budget resolution for fy1998 hconres 84 approved june 5 1997 financing federal pensions retirement plan is considered to be fully funded if adequate funds are set aside during employees working years to pa the cost of their retirement benefits the federal employees retirement system fers is fully funded for both postal and nonpostal federal workers and the civil service retirement system csrs asapplicable to postal employees is fully funded however the csrs is only partially funded for nonpostal federal workers thus some contend that csrs funding for nonpostal federal employees should be increased others point out that federalpension funding is achieved by crediting special issue treasury securities toretirement trust funds but t hose securities can be redeem ed to pay retiree benefits only by replacing them with general revenues they say that even if csrs pensions were fully funded on an advance basis th governments share of federal pensions would still have to be paid from general revenueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97635crs2 in general the trust fund through which federal pensions are financed is primarily bookkeeping device for keeping track of future pension obligationsbecause the trust fund consists of us treasury securities and is not invested in private stocks or bonds it does not generate cash for paying benefits the fy1998 budget resolution concurrent budget resolution is an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate regarding federal spending and savings targetsthose budget targets are based on assumpti ons about certain programmatic changes the authorizing committees might make for federal retirement programs thefy1998 congressional budget resolution assumes that employee and agencycontributions to the csrs and the fers would be increased by specified amounts targeted to save 4762 billion over 5 years in direct spending programs direct spending programs are entitlement programs for which the level of spending is not limited by annual appropriations the authorizing committees may accept the assumptions on which the resolution is based modify the assumptions or substitute alternative provisions toachieve the same level of savings each congressional committee is required toreport legislation pertaining to direct spending programs under its jurisdiction ifany and the committees proposals are co mbined by the budget committees into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill the house committee on government reformand oversight and the senate committee on governmental affairs have jurisdiction over civil service programs fy1998 budget reconciliation proposals on june 11 1997 the house governme nt reform and oversight committee accepted the assumptions underlying the budget resolution and reported legislationto include them in an omnibus budget reconc iliation bill as follows all federal and postal workers would pay into the cs rs and fers an additional 025 of pay starting january 1 1999 an additional 015 on january 1 2000 and an additional 01 on january 1 2001 for total increase effective in 2001 of 05 of pay andb nonpostal agency payments to the federal retirement trust funds on behalf ofworkers in the csrs would increase fr om 7 to 851 starting october 1 1997 these increased employee and agency contributions would end after fy2002 on june 171997 the senate committee on governmental affairs approved the same provisions included in the house bill with one difference the senate bill would have increased the nonpostal agen cy payments for csrs employees by 16 of pay in the year 2002 rather than 151 in that year this was done because of slight difference in the savings targets th senate committee was required to achieve however the house version prevailed in the final budget legislation on june 25 the house passed hr 2015 including the provisions pertaining to civil service retirement and health insurance and the senate passed s 947 withits similar civil service provisions the senate then substituted the language of s947 into bill numbered hr 2015 the di fferences in the house and senate

httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97635crs4 1 on april 18 1997 the opm published in the federal register revised estimates of the cost of the pension component of fers these new estimates show that the cost of fers hasdeclined since the last estimate in 1993 as result agency payments for pensions for fers employees will be reduced from 114 of pay to 107 effective october 1 1997 thusalthough the reconciliation legislation would increase agency costs for csrs employees by151 of pay that increase would be partially offset by the 07 reduction in agency costs for fers employees on an agencywide basis the extent of the offset would depend on the proportions of csrs and fers employeesnonpostal agency contribution increases for csrs participants the balanced budget act of 1997 requires all federal agencies excluding the usps to increase their contributions on behalf of workers covered by the csrsfrom 7 of each workers pay to 851 of pay because fers is fully funded increase in agency contributions is proposed for it agencies will not receiveadditional appropriations to pay the increas ed contributions thus they may need to reduce spending for things other than retirem ent contributions in order to make the increased payments to the retirement system this provision is expected to decreasethe federal budget deficit because the increased agency contributions to the csrsare scored as receipt of the government budget function 950 undistributedoffsetting receipts and other agency sp ending would have to be reduced to make the required payment to the retirement system the senate version of the bill wouldhave required the agency csrs contributi ons to be 86 of pay in the year 2002 1 issues regarding the retirement program provisions under federal budget rules postal and federal employee pension contributions are scored as general revenue receipts therefore increasing those receipts reduces the budget deficit increased employee contributions funded and unfunded benefits the csrs for employees of the usps is fully funded by the combination of postal employee and usps employercontributions the fers is fully funded also for all usps and other nonpostalfederal employees by the combination of employee and employer contributionsthus increasing postal employee contributions into the csrs and postal andnonpostal employee contributions into fers without an offsetting reduction in theagencies contributions would exceed the total amount needed to fund fully the retirement plans for those workers some say that because retirement for postal workers and fers participants is fully funded those groups should be exempted from the retirement contributionincrease moreover they argue that the overpayments by postal workers wouldsubsidize the underfunded benefits for nonpostal workers in the csrs opponents of exempting postal and fers workers from the contribution increases acknowledge that fers and pos tal csrs benefits are fully funded but they maintain that the underlying goal of the contribution increases is deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97635crs5 2 for employees covered by the fers agencies must pay 114 of employee pay to the pension component of fers 62 to social security and up to 5 to the thrift savings planreduction not pension funding they argue that exempting those groups would be unfair because nonpostal workers under th csrs should not have to pay more than postal workers for the same benefits b it would break the agreement in the fers law that equalizes the required re tirement contribution of csrs and fers employees c uspscsrs benefits and fe rs benefits are fully funded because of higher employer contributions not because of higher employee contributions and d exemption of any employees from the proposed retirement contribution increasewould sacrifice deficit reduction unless larger increases were levied on thenonexempted workers ie nonpostal workers covered by the csrs on june 10 1997 when the house subc ommittee on civil service marked up its budget reconciliation legislation majority party committee member proposedan amendment to exempt postal employees in csrs and all workers in fers from the increased employee contributions the subcommittee did not approve theamendment reducing longterm csrs unfunded liabilities reason sometimes advanced for increasing csrs contributions from nonpostal federal employees isthat those contributions would redu ce the 540 billion longterm unfunded liability of that program according to the office of personnel management opmactuaries the increased contributions would cause reduction in csrs unfunded liabilities in the early years during which the increased contributions were in effectthe reduction would be approximately equal to the amount of the increasedcontributions 1829 billion however because of requirements in current lawregarding computation of government appropriations to the retirement fund thereduction in unfunded csrs liabilities would be small over the long term largelybecause future payments that the governme nt makes directly to the retirement fund ie not the agency contributions would decline as result of the increase inemployee contributions increased nonpostal agency contributions to the csrs reducing federal spending increasing agency contributions to the retirement system on behalf of csrs employees fro m 7 of worker pay to 851 under the house bill and 86 under the senate bill increases agencies costs for csrscovered workers and would require them to reduce spending for other purposes inorder to make the required retirement paym ents proponents say that agencies would have an incentive to economize and budget their nonpersonnel costs more prudentlythe increased retirement contributions might make federal managers more cognizant of the costs of personnel benefits and incr ease their incentive to compare the cost of labor and the cost of capital in making d ecisions between employing federal worker and the cost of contract employees or automation moreover because agencyretirement costs for fers workers are subs tantially higher than for csrs workers this increase in the agencies costs for csrs workers would be step towardequalizing the cost of employees in the different retirement programs 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97635crs6 3 currently slightly more than half of the federal workforce is covered by fers including employees of the usps and less than half is covered by the csrs because thegovernments share of csrs funding will decline in the future opm estimates that csrsbenefit payments will begin to exceed total cs rs income in about 2010 and retirement fund assets attributable to csrs will be depleted by about 2024 foreseeing that this situationwould arise as the transition is made from csrs to fers the congress established asystem whereby benefit payments under the cs rs will be authorized by fers trust fund securities as needed until there are more csrs benefits to be paid however those borrowed fers securities will be paid off th rough 30year amortization payments using 75year projection period opm estimates th at the trust fund will continue to grow ultimately reaching level of nearly 20 times the amount needed to pay annual benefits 4 the employer share of premiums for ac tive federal employees is paid by annual appropriations to their employing agency the usps pays the employer share for postalworkers and the opm pays the employer share for all annuitantscritics of this proposal say that the mission of many federal agencies is such that equipment cannot substitute for personnel and there are limited situations inwhich choice may be made between labor and capital they say that any provision that increases personnel costs could result in worker furloughs or layoffs which coming on top of the substantial downsizing that has occurred recently in the federalworkforce could compromise the governments ability to deliver required services reducing longterm unfunded csrs liabilities proponents of the proposal to increase agency contributions to the retirement fund on behalf of csrsemployees say that it would reduce both the federal budget deficit and unfundedcsrs liabilities opponents say its primary effect would be deficit reduction2933 billion over 5 years and that it woul d have very small effect on the long term funding of the csrs again rgely because appropriations for the governments share of contributions would decline opponents also note thatdespite unfunded liabilities of about 540 billion the csrs trust fund balance exceeds 340 billion and is danger of insolvency 3 federal employee and retiree health insurance the federal employees health benefits program fehbp provides health insurance to federal workers and retirees through variety of feeforservice plans health maintenance organizations and other managed care arrangements thepremiums for these plans are shared by participants and their employer postalworkers collectively bargain the share of th eir premium that is paid by the usps but the premiums for nonpostal federal employees and all retirees is determined by apremiumsharing formula 4 by law the employers share of fehbp premiums has been based on twopart formula generally referred to as the big6 formula this means that thegovernments share is fixed dollar amount set at 60 of the average premiumof six specified plans but it could not exceed b 75 of any particular planspremium under this formula on average the government pays about 71 offehbp premiums for nonpostal employees and annuitants and participants pay29httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97635crs7 5 fhebp premium sharing arrangements for the usps and postal employees are collectively bargained and would be unaffected by revi sion in the formula for nonpostal participantsthe formula currently governing the usps share of premiums requires it to pay 71 of the big6 average premium for active postal employees rather than the 60 paid for nonpostal employees not to exceed b 8875 of the premium of any plan in 1989 one of the big6 insurance plan s dropped out of the program but was continued in the formula as proxy or phantom plan the plan that dropped out was highcost plan sponsored by aetna because aetna was highpremium plan the average premium of the five remaining plans big5 would be lower than the average big6 premium the legislation authorizing continued use of the big6formula with proxy plan expires at the end of 1998 and the administrationmaintained that it could implement big5 formula without new legislationunder such formula the governments share of premium costs would declinebecause it would be 60 of the lower aver age big5 premium and the participants share would rise by an estimated 20 eff ective in 1999 this costshifting could result in federal budget savings of nearly 1 billion in fy1999 during discussions leading to th budget resolution congress and the administration agreed that the baseline budget assumptions would includecontinuation of premiumsharing formula that would not change the share ofpremiums currently paid by the government thus reconciliation legislation couldbe enacted to revise the formula without causing an increase in the budget deficit however the budget resolution included assumptions regarding replacementformula budget reconciliation proposal the balanced budget act of 1997 includes revision of the formula determining the governments and participants shares of fehbp premiums fornonpostal participants and the final legislation 5 the new formula will go into effect for health insurance premiums in 1999 the new formula will be based on the average total premium cost of all plans in the fehbp weighted by the number of participants in each plan the governments share of the weighted average premium will be set at level that will replicat as closely as possible the share of each premium the government pays under current w thus plan participants should not experience an increase in their premiums in 1999 due to the expiration of the current formula under the budget baseline assumptions agreed to by the administration andthe congressional budget committees this ch ange will reduce the governments share of fehbp costs by about 28 million over 5 years
