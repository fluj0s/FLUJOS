upon suit challenging the constitutionality of the latter two statutes the state argued that the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment does not apply to the states and alabama could establish state religion if it chose and that argument proved successful in the trial court4 but that decision was promptly overturned by the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit5 and in separate decisions in 1984 and 1985 the us supreme court upheld the appellate courts rulings6 in the latter decision the court specifically reaffirmed the proposition that the several states have greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the first amendment than does the congress of the united states terming the trial courts ruling to the contrary remarkable7 in 1993 the alabama legislature enacted fourth statute this one providing for studentinitiated prayer at public school events in its operative section the statute stated on public school other public or other property nonsectarian nonproselytizing studentinitiated voluntary prayer invocations andor benedictions shall be permitted during compulsory or noncompulsory schoolrelated student assemblies schoolrelated student sporting events schoolrelated graduation or commencement ceremonies and other schoolrelated events ala code 161203b 1995 this statute was response in part to the supreme courts decision in lee v weisman8 in 1992 in which the court held unconstitutional public secondary schools inclusion of clergyled prayers at its graduation ceremony soon after that decision the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit differentiated texas school districts policy of allowing the graduating class to select students to give nonproselytizing nonsectarian prayers at their graduation ceremonies and held it to be constitutional9 after the supreme court chose not to review the fifth circuits decision efforts to replicate that approach to school prayer began to mushroom the 1993 alabama statute was one result of those effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98523crs3 10 the suit initially included claim against the talladega county public schools but that complaint was resolved through

instituted suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute both on its face and as implemented on behalf of viceprincipal of school in dekalb county and student in one of the countys schools10 on march 12 1997 federal district court held the statute to be unconstitutional11 judge ira dement appointed by president bush in 1992 held in part that the statute infringed on students free speech and prayer rights in violation of the free exercise and freedom of speech clauses of the first amendment students the court said have the constitutional right to engage in sectarian proselytizing religious speech at times in the public schools and the alabama statute defined their rights in this respect too narrowly the court further held the statute to violate the establishment of religion clause analyzing its constitutionality under several tests the court said the statute had the non secular purpose of restoring prayer to the public schools had primary effect of endorsing religious speech and giving it preference at school events over nonreligious speech coerced students into participating in religious activity and precipitated excessive entanglement by requiring school officials to monitor the student prayers in order to ensure they were nonsectarian and nonproselytizing on june 23 1997 governor james sent judge dement 34page letter contending that the religion clauses of the first amendment do not apply to the states and asking the judge to dismiss the case for lack of federal question the federal district courts injunction on october 29 1997 the federal district court issued an injunction to implement its ruling12 the injunction barred state officials and school officials of dekalb county from enforcing the statute and from permitting school organized or officially sanctioned religious activity in the classrooms of dekalb county schools with respect to the latter the injunction specifically prohibited school officials from directing or permitting prayers and devotional messages at public school graduation exercises other than brief personal religious expression by speaker from organizing or sponsoring or advertising baccalaureate services encouraging student attendance at such services and from conditioning participation in commencement exercises on attendance at such services from using the publicaddress system or allowing it to be used for religious addresses other than announcements of meetings of non curricular student religious clubs from having religious devotionals or other presentations or activities of religious nature at schoolsponsored or schoolinitiated assemblies and events including sporting events from distributing or allowing nonschool persons to distribute gideon bibles or other religious tracts on

injunction further directed school officials to distribute the injunction to all principals and ptas to publicize it to all teachers and students and to conduct inservice training sessions for all faculty and administrators on the legal standards governing religion in the public schools the injunction further provided for the appointment of monitor to ensure compliance with the injunction finally the injunction set forth number of ways in which religious expression would be constitutional in the schools the court said religious texts can be used in classrooms to the extent that material so used is presented in an objective and academic manner students can express their religious beliefs in homework and other school assignments as academically appropriate students can wear religious symbols and clothing bearing religious messages on the same basis as nonreligious expressive symbols and apparel students can meet for religious purposes during noncurricular time under the equal access act and students can distribute religious materials to classmates during noninstructional time on the same basis as nonreligious materials can be distributed on november 4 1997 governor james issued statement condemning the injunction as ruling that cuts at the heart of all that is good in america and brings shame on our nation he said he would resist judge dements order by every legal and political means with every ounce of strength i possess subsequent rulings by the district court in subsequent opinions the district court held the implementation of the statute in the dekalb county schools to be unconstitutional and elaborated on the reasons it deemed sweeping injunction to be necessary in november 12 1997 opinion13 the court detailed history of noncompliance by dekalb county with previous judicial rulings and voluntary agreements concerning religious activities in the public schools the court found that school sponsored religious activity in violation of the first amendment and previous court rulings was pervasive and recurrent in the countys schools the evidence showed it said that teacherled prayer and devotional exercises common ly occurred in the classrooms in violation of engel v vitale14 and abington school district v schempp15 that clergy and studentled prayer frequently occurred at graduation exercises in violation of lee v weisman16 and that prayer over the public address systems often occurred at sports events in violation of the 11th circuit decision in jager v douglas county school district17 moreover the court noted that the county board of education had specifically adopted the position that prayer and devotionals over the intercom classroom prayer prayer at high school graduations and prayer at student assemblies were authorized by

had continued to encourage such practices even after entering into voluntary agreement with the plaintiffs to cease the challenged conduct during the pendency of the suit the court further found that the county had continued to engage in such activities after the courts march 12 1997 ruling holding the alabama statute unconstitutional and that school officials had failed to take action to stop harassment based on religion against plaintiffs all of that the court stated confirmed the depth of resistance toward ceasing unconstitutional practices on the part of the dekalb county school board and showed that unconstitutional conduct will not be willingly stopped by elected public officials thus it asserted an injunction was necessary including the provisions for monitor and for inservice training simple declaratory relief would in dekalb county it said be relief at all in another opinion released the same day the court vacated part of an earlier order denying as moot all pending motions and granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on the constitutionality of the practices detailed in the paragraph above18 finally on december 17 1997 the district court denied most of the defendants motion for partial stay of the injunction19 governor james appeals with the alabama attorney general disassociating himself from the action governor james on may 1 1998 filed petition in the us supreme court asking for writ of mandamus directing the district court to dismiss the case for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction and to vacate its injunction the petition contended that the courts have usurped power unconstitutionally and that the religion clauses of the first amendment have application to the states on june 22 the court rejected the petition20 the governor made the same contention regarding the non applicability of the establishment clause to the states in an appeal to the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit on july 13 1999 threejudge panel of the appellate court upheld the district courts ruling in that regard stating the states are bound by the first amendment21 appeal by the alabama attorney general on separate appeal filed by the alabama attorney general however the eleventh circuit did overturn one aspect of the district courts ruling and injunction in this appeal the state chose not to contest the district courts ruling that the statute was unconstitutional and it accepted most of the injunction issued by the district court but the state did argue that the injunction was overbroad in prohibiting the school system from permitting most studentinitiated vocal prayer or other devotional speech in its schools and in appointing monitor to oversee compliance with the injunction the appellate court agreed with the first contention but disagreed with the second private religious speech the court said is fully protected by both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the constitution only when the speech is commanded byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98523crs6 22 chandler v siegelman 230 f3d 1313 11th cir 2000 cert den 69 uslw 3702 june 18 2001the state does it unconstit utionally coerce it stated although it went on to hold that proselytiz ing speech is inherently coercive and the constitution prohibits it from the governments pulpit so long as the state does not participate in or actively encourage or endorse the speech the court averred genuinely studentinitiated religious expression must be permitted subject only to the same time place and manner restrictions applicable to other student speech on the second issue of the appointment of monitor however the appellate court affirmed the district court given the school systems history of unconstitutional activity with respect to religion it held the district courts appointment of monitor was not an abuse of discretion because of its first holding the court vacated the injunction and remanded the case for appropriate revision the alabama aclu then appealed this decision to the supreme court on june 19 2000 the supreme court in santa fe independent school district v doe 120 sct 2216 2000 held unconstitutional school policy allowing high school students to vote on whether to have student deliver an invocation at all home football games and on june 26 the court vacated the appellate courts decision in chandler and remanded the case to it for reconsideration in light of santa fe on october 19 2000 the eleventh circuit reinstated its previous opinion and judgment22 santa fe it said reaffirmed that the establishment clause of the first amendment prohibits school district from taking affirmative steps to create vehicle for prayer to be delivered at school function but it stated only statesponsored coercive prayer is forbidden by the constitution private speech endorsing religion is protected by both the free speech and free exercise clauses of the first amendment the court averred reiterating that the district courts injunction had assumed that virtually any religious speech in schools is attributable to the state and that as consequence it eliminated any possibility of private student religious speech under any circumstances other than silently or behind closed doors the court said this the constitution neither requires nor permits so long as prayer is genuinely studentinitiated and is not the product of any school policy which actively or surreptitiously encourages it the appellate court asserted prayer can be given aloud or in front of others as in the case of an audience assembled for some other purpose the court remanded the case once again to the district court and directed it to revise its injunction accordingly on june 18 2001 the supreme court refused to review this decision the district court will now revise its injunction
