g343g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 on november 7 2007 the house passed hr 3685 the employment nondiscrimination act of 2007 enda1 apparently modeled after title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 title vii enda if enacted would create the first federal prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination by private employers2 enda appears to represent one half of an earlier bill introduced by representative frank which would have additionally prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity 3 this report will discuss issues relating to employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and specific provisions of enda

prohibited by enda dovetail with title viis prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race color sex national origin and religion4 notwithstanding this overall similarity the text of enda does go beyond title viis text in two main ways 1 prohibiting discrimination on perceived characteristics and 2 textually creating associational rights under the act that is not to say however that the protections of enda appear uniformly at least as extensive as title viis protections as the bill explicitly disallows victims of sexual orientation discrimination from pursuing disparate impact claim5 each of these three differences is discussed in detail below g18g142g155g140g142g146g159g142g141

enda prohibits discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation6 the text of title vii contains comparable prohibition against discrimination on the basis of the perceived race color sex national origin or religion of person the americans with disabilities act ada however does include in it s definition of disability being regarded as having physical or mental impairment 7 the semantic similarity between perceived and regarded suggests that existing judicial interpretation of that language in the ada may be instructive for courts agencies or employers attempting to interpret what is meant by perceived sexual orientation in 1 employment nondiscrimination act of 2007 hr 3685 110th cong 2007 2 substantial minority of states have enacted laws prohibiting sexual

section 4g of enda disallows disparate impact claims on the basis of sexual orientation therefore whereas title vii claim could proceed where the plaintiff showed that particular job requirement disproportionately impacted one racial or religious group enda does not appear to allow plaintiff to show that particular job requirement disproportionately impacts one sexual orientation over another

contrast title viis prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex has consistently been interpreted to exclude discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation13 however courts have held that the fact that victim of discrimination is homosexual or bisexual does not preclude claim under title vii in some cases victims of treatment that would arguably also qualify as sexual orientation discrimination may be able to successfully assert that they were victims of sexual harassment or sex stereotyping under title vii 8 for further discussion of the defi nition of disability under the

sundowner offshore services 14 in that case male employee suffered physical abuse of sexual nature but his claims of sexual harassment were initially denied by fifth circuit precedent which held that samesex sexual harassment is not actionable under title vii the supreme court reversed holding that in cases of alleged sexual harassment the gender of the victim and harasser are not dispositive but rather the critical question is whether the harassment occurred because of sex 15 the court also recognized that an inference that harassment is because of sex is not obvious where the harasser and the victim are of the same sex16 but provided three examples of how such an inference could be established 1 if the harasser sexually desired the victim 2 if the harasser was hostile to the presence of one sex in the workplace or 3 if comparative data showed that the harasser targeted only members of one sex 17 the ninth circuit appears to have further held in rene v mgm grand hotel that harassment which targeted body parts clearly linked to persons sexuality constituted sexual discrimination prohibited by title vii18 even though the victim believed he was harassed because of his sexual orientation the court held that whatever else those attacks may or may not have been because of has legal consequence19 although the plaintiff in rene prevailed the holding of the ninth circuit may contradict the supreme courts earlier holding in oncale as the dissent in rene noted the ninth circuit relied in large part on doe v city of belleville in which the seventh circuit argued that evidence of physical abuse of sexual nature alone could lead to an inference that the victim was targeted because of his gender20 that judgment however was vacated and remanded to the seventh circuit after the courts decision in oncale 21 the text of the opinion in oncale also seems to require more than conduct of sexual nature in order to give rise to an inference that it was because of sex22 g21g142g161g561g156g157g142g155g142g152g157g162g153g142g156g561 based upon the supreme courts opinion in price waterhouse v hopkins victims of sexual orientation discrimination may also prevail under title vii where the facts also indicate the presence of discrimination for failure to conform to sex stereotypes23 in price waterhouse female employee was denied partnership in an accounting firm despite the fact that she was 14 oncale v sundowner offshore services 523 us 75 1998 15 id at 77 81 16 the court did note however that in the related context of racial discrimination it has never presumed that members of one race will not discriminate against other members of the same race id at 78 17 id at 8081 this discussion of oncale is not meant to imply that sexual orientation harassment is only perpetrated by persons of the same sex as the victim but merely to suggest that an employers assertion that harassment occurred solely because of sexual orientation and not sex may be refuted by the met hods of proof offered in oncale 18 rene v mgm grand hotel 305 f3d 1061 1066 9th cir 2002 in this case the court found that the sexual nature of the harassers attacks which were directed at the victims crotch and anus readily gave rise to the inference that he was targeted because of his sex id at 1065 19 id at 1064 1066 20 id at 1066 citing doe v city of belleville 119 f3d 563 580 7th

performer24 furthermore partners in the firm had instructed her to act more femininely in order to be considered for partnership in the future25 the court held that price waterhouse was applying standards for partnership in prohibited sexually disparate manner in that title vii did not permit an employer to evaluate female employees based upon their conformity with the employers stereotypical view of femininity26 relying on price waterhouse the third circuit held in bibby v phila coca cola bottling co that harassment of an individual for failure to conform to sex stereotypes could constitute harassment because of sex consistent with oncale 27 furthermore the court held that harassment for failure to conform to gender stereotypes is still because of sex even if the animosity towards nonconformance is caused by belief that such behavior indicates homosexuality28 therefore based upon the decisions in rene v mgm grand hotel and bibby v coca cola one could conclude that certain types of sexual or ientation discrimination are currently prohibited under title vii29 however one should not take this to mean that enda does not purport to prohibit conduct not already prohibited by title vii for example were an employer simply to require job applicants to state his or her sexual orientation on job application and consequently refused to hire applicants that indicated they were homosexuals it is not clear that this would be prohibited by title viis existing provisions ho wever such actions would almost certainly be prohibited by plain reading of enda

organizations selection of clergy or other positions involved in worship or ritual discrimination on the basis of race sex national origin or religion has been held to be permissible in these

this exception to title vii allows discrimination on the basis of any characteristic including race and sex but only with respect to religious institutions choice as to who will perform spiritual

title vii33 title vii exempts religious organizations generally as well as educational institutions that are either substantially owned by religious organization or directed towards the propagation of particular religion 34 federal courts have interpreted title vii to require an inquiry into whether an entitys purpose and character are primarily religious in order to qualify as religious entity35 most recently in september of 2007 the third circuit identified nine factors other courts have considered when determining if an institution is religious none of which are determinative36 this statutory exemption appears to apply to much broader group of entities than the ministerial exception which only applies to specific positions with close nexus to ritual or worship activities
