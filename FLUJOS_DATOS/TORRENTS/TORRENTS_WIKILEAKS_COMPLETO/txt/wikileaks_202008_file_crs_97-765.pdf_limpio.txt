procurement by the federal government2 essentially it attempts to protect domestic labor by providing preference for american goods in government purchases it was enacted in 19333 and has only been substantively amended four times in the succeeding years4 in determining what are american goods the place of mining production or manufacture is controlling the nationality of the contractor is not considered when determining if product is of domestic origin5 while the act appears to control most procurements of the federal government it should be noted when considering particular procurement that the application of the act may be controlled by other legislation or international agreement for example the trade agreements act of 19796 authorizes the president to waive any otherwise applicable law regulation or procedure regarding government procurement that would ac cord foreign products less favorable treatment than that given to domestic products7 article 1004 of the north american free trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada disallows domestic protection legislation such as the buyamerican act in government procurement other treaties and agreements also place limitations on the application of the act and must be considered when looking at any buy american question

the federal government is required to buy domestic articles materials and supplies when they are acquired for public use unless specific exemption 8 applies9 the act applies to all federal procurements but has separate provisions for supply contracts10 and construction contracts11 most of the rules and definitions used in applying the act are found in the federal acquisition regulation part 25 not in the act itself the rules for determining whether 1 41 usc 10a through 10d 2 there are numerous little buy american provisions which generally govern speci fic types of procurements that are for some reason exempt from the buy american act usually because the procurement is for articles for use outside of the united states these provisions are beyond the scope of this paper but should be considered when researching whether or not domestic preference affects particular procurement these provisions are often attached to the appropriations acts for the agencies making the procurement in question the most well known of these acts is commonly referred to as the berry amendment and applies to certain procurements of the department of defense see crs report rl31236 the berry amendment

of procurements but different terminology is used and the step in the manufacturing or construction process at which the test is applied is different12 the test of origin is applied to supplies delivered to the government13 in contrast under construction contracts the test is applied to articles materials and supplies used by the contractor and subcontractors in constructing altering or repairing the building or work14 in the case of supply contracts the test is applied to end products15 construction contracts are concerned with the origin of construction materials16 the act differentiates between manufactured and unmanufactured articles an unmanufactured article will be deemed domestic end product or construction material if it has been mined or produced in the united states17 manufactured articles are considered domestic if they have been manufactured in the united states from components substantially all of which have been mined produced or manufactured in the united states 18 substantially all means that the cost of foreign components does not exceed 50 of the cost of all components19

applicable to most federal contracts is 6 12 differential is used if the contract involves small business or labor surplus area 50 differential is applied to department of defense procurements 27 the differential is added to the lowest acceptable foreign offer and then compared to the domestic offer the differential is applied only to the bid price for material to be delivered under the contact not the total contract price28 generally the differential is applied on an item by item basis but solicitation may provide that for purposes of the act certain items will be lumped together 29

amendments to the buy american act in its long history the first such amendment was the buy american act of 1988 enacted as part of the trade and competitiveness act of 1988 38 the acts general purpose was to prohibit federal procurement from countries that discriminate against the united states in their procurement practices39 the 1988 act by its terms was to expire if not specifically extended by congress congress did not extend this act and it expired on april 30 1996 the 1988 act did contain one general amendment which applied to the buy american act as whole ie it was not just limited to the pr ohibition on procurement from discriminating countries this amendment provided definition for the buy american act of the term federal agency 40 because congress placed this definition in the 1988 act after the expiration provision one could argue that congress did not intend for this provision to expire with the rest of the amendments however due to the unequivocal nature of the expiration language of the statute the stronger argument appears to be that the definition lapsed as well and that there is definition of federal agency in the current buy american act the second substantive amendment to the buy american act added the micro purchase threshold exception to the act41 under this exception the act does not apply to purchases under 2500 the third amendment to the buy american act was contained in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 199742 it requires the secretary of defense to submit report to congress detailing the amount of purchases from foreign entities each year the report must contain the dollar value of items for which the act was waived in that year the 110th congress extended for fy2007 to fy2011 the requirement of annual reporting of purchases from foreign sources to all federal agencies43 these reports must include the total dollar value of procured nondomestic articles an itemized list of all waivers of the buy 35 far 25104 36 far 25103b2 37 pl 103355 108 stat 33467 103rd congress 2nd session 1994 codified at 41 usc 10a 38 pl 100418 102 stat 1107 100th congress 2nd session 1988 codified at
