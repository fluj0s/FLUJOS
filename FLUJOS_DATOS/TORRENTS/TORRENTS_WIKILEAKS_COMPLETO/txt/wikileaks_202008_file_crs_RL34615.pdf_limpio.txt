record daily edition vol 154 june 10 2008 p s5416traditionally slows in presidential election years and that the senate in the 110th congress has more than kept pace with the judicial confirmation performance of the senate in other recent congresses5 the ranking minority member of the senate judiciary committee senator arlen specter of pennsylvania has faulted the senate majority for declining to allow committee consideration of seve ral court of appeals nominees who he maintains are highly qualified and deserv to be confirmed the reason they have not been approved senator specter c ontended is that there is an interest in holding open these vacancies in the event th ere is president of the other party to fill them with the democrats6 senator patrick j leahy of vermont chairman of the judiciary committee to which circuit court of appeals and district court nominations are referred has rejected minority criticisms of the committees handling of president bushs judicial nominations i have ways said senator leahy stated on the senate floor that we would treat this presidents nominees more fairly than republicans treated president clintons and we have7 this report seeks to inform the current debate by analyzing how the senate processed court of appeals and district court nominations in presidential election years dating back to 1980 in so doing th report addresses the question of whether the senate would be in keeping with past experience if at some point in the current session of this congress it deliberatel slowed down or stopped altogether its consideration of pending wer court nominations in anticipation of the november 4 2008 presidential election it also seeks among other things to determine whether members of the senate have had shared understanding or expectation that there will be decline in senate action on judicial nominations in presidential election years at what point in presidential election years such declines in senate activity on lower court nominations have tended to occur and whether smaller number of lower court nominations are typically processed in presidential election year than in other years of presidential term the report begins its inquiry with an overview of recent senate debate on whether the senate and its judiciary committee customarily observe practicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs3 8 as is discussed in greater detail later in th is report most senators who have cited the thurmond rule have characterized it as an tablished practice according to which at some point in presidential election year the judi ciary committee and the senate longer act on judicial nominations with excepti ons sometimes made for nominees who have bipartisan support from senate committee and party leadersreferred to by some as the thurmond rule8 next to provide historical perspective the report provides separate narratives on each presidential election year from 1980 to 2004 reviewing the actions taken on lowe r court nominations in each of these years the report then compares each of these presidential election years quantitatively examining in each year the number and percent of judicial nominations processed as well as the last dates of committee and senate action taken on the nominations thereafter the report compares the number of judicial nominations processed by the judiciary committee and the senate in each of the presidential election years from 1980 to 2004 with the other years of th presidential terms in question final section reviews range of reasons for nators to oppose or to favor slowdown in processing judicial nominations in pr esidential election years it concludes by noting possible options for the sena during the remainder of the 110th congress that if undertaken might alle viate partisan controversy c oncerning the processing of judicial nominations in presidential election year the report in most sections focuses primarily on senate c onsideration of court of ppeals nominations and to lesser extent on district court nominati ons reflecting the fact that in the 110th and other recent congresses controversies over the judicial confirmation process usually if not always have involved court of appeals nominations various findings can be drawn from th reports aforementioned sections among them the following senators of both parties some closely associated with the judicial confirmation process have at different time s spoken of their expectations of dropoff in nate processing of lower court nominations occurring earlier in presidential election years than in other years usually if not alwa ys they have done so when they were not members of the presidents political party there is written senate or judiciary committee rule concerningjudicial nominations in presidential election year nor during the 19802004 period was an apparent consensus or bipartisan agreement ever reached in the senate regarding how many judicial nominations should be processed in presidential election year or how late in the year th ey should be processed in the presidential election years from 1980 to 2004 there was consistently observed date or point in time after which the senate judiciary committee or the senate ceased processing lower court nominations the last seven presidential election years have varied considerablyin terms of number of lower court nominations that received hearings were reported and we re confirmed by the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs4 the 1996 presidential election year and subsequent presidential election years 2000 and 2004 have seen fewer court of appeals nominees processed on average than the presidential election years from 1980 to 1992 fewer judicial nominations tende d to be processed when the presidency and the senate were controlled by different political parties than when they were under unified partisan control since 1980 fewer nominees to the courts of appeals on average have been reported by the judiciary committee and confirmed by the senate in presidential election years than in other years of presidential term of the four years of presiden tial term the presidential election year on average has been the secondleast productive in terms of number of district court nominati ons processed by the senate the first year of the term being the least productive whether the senate customarily observes the thurmond rule senators have expressed differing views as to whether dropoff in senate processing of lower federal court nominations occurs or should occur in presidential election years some have asserted that in these years the senate judiciary committee and the senate customarily slow down the processing of judicial nominations at earlier points and confirm fewer nominations than in other years others senators however have rejected the notion that such slowdowns are customary or appropriate poi nting to past presidential election years in which the judiciary committee and senate processed relatively large numbers of judicial nominations some relatively late in the year recent debate over thurmond rule thus far in the 110th congress the debate in th senate has revolved largely around the question whether the senate and its judiciary committee customarily observe practice referred to by some as the thurmond rule named after the late senator and former judiciary committ ee chairman strom thurmond of south carolina those who claim the thurmond rule exists allege that its origins can be traced to events that occurred in 1980 when senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts chaired the judiciary committee and senator thurmond was the ranking minority member on the committee adherents of thurmond rule have sometimes differed as to precisely when in the year it takes effect nevertheless almost all senators who have cited it have described it as an established practice according to which at some point in presidential election year the judiciary committee and the senate longer act on judicial nominations with exceptions sometimes made for nominees who have bipartisan support from senate committee and party leaders the senator who most freque ntly has asserted the existence of thurmond rule has been the current chairman of the judiciary committee patrick j leahy inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs5 9 sen patrick

confirmation of judges remarks in the senate congressional record continueddecember 2006 just before assuming the ch airmanship of the committee senator leahy told law school audience the thurmond rule in memory of strom thurmond he put this in when the republicans were in the minority which said in presidential election year after spring judges would go throug h except by the consent of both the republican and democratic leader i want to be bipartisan we will institute the thurmond rule9 subsequently in march 3 2008 senate floor statement senator leahy referred to the history of the thurmond rule by which republicans then in 1980 in the minority insisted that judicial vacancies in the last year of presidents term remain vacant in order to be filled with the nominations of the next president10 again four days later in another floor stat ement senator leahy recalled that when president reagan was running fo r president and senator thurmond then in the republican minority as ranking member of the judiciary committee instituted policy to stall president cart ers nominations that policy known as the thurmond rule was put in when the republicans were in the minority it is rule that we still follow and it will take effect very soon here11 subsequently at june 12 2008 meetin g of the judiciary committee senator leahy indicated that the thurmond rule he had enunciated earlier was now in effect we are now way past the time of thurmond rule named after senator thurmond when he was in the minority and im trying to respect that we are still putting judges through but i must note this point further judges will be moved only by consent of the two leader s of the senate and the two leaders of the committee12 senator harry reid the senate majority leader has expressed agreement with senator leahy about the existence of thurmond rule in april 10 2008 floor remarks senator reid said in presiden tial election year it is always very tough for judges that is the way it has been for long time and that is why we have the thurmond rule and other such rules13 in similar floor remarks five days laterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs6 13 continued daily edition vol 154 apr 10 2008 p s2829 nator reid however indicated that it was not his intention to use his understanding of the thurm ond rule to prevent senate consideration of judicial nominations that had recently been approved by the senate judiciary committee he said that he had i ndicated to the republican leader that we are going to try to move these nominations along we are trying to keep up with the average that has gone on in years past without lot of political bickering ibid 14 sen harry reid highway technical co rrections act of 2007 motion to proceed remarks in the senate congressional record

june we will have to take real close look at judges in presidential election year14 various minority senators however ve disputed the assertion by some majority senators that there is an established judiciary committee or senate practice known as the thurmond rule in an april 1 2008 floor statement senator orrin g hatch former chairman of the judiciary committee 19952001 and 20032005 declared we have already heard about the socalled thurmond rule supposedly justifying grinding the confirmation proce ss to halt in this presidential election year the thurmond rule neither is rule nor can it be attributed to the late senator strom thurmond15 expressing similar sentiments senator jeff sessions in april 16 2008 floor remarks stated i would say there has been talk about invoking the socalled thurmond rule the thurmond rule could sort of be if you wa nt it to be an excuse for slowwalking nominees and not approving the nominees w ho ought to be approved just because there is presidential election on the horizon majority leader harry reid mentioned last night that the so called rule would be invoked in june senator leahy has mentioned before he would invo ke it in the second half of this year let say this about the thurmond rule it is myth it does not exist there is reason for stopping the confirmation of judicial nominees in the second half of year in which there is presidential election16 similar view was expressed earlier at the start of the 110th congress in january 2007 by senator specter ranking minor ity member on the judiciary committee who served as committee chair in the 109th congress in senate floor statement senator specter alluded to what has been called th thurmond rule some he said have suggested that this soca lled rule holds that the senate should dramatically curtail confirmations after the spring of presidential election year review of the historical record suggests that this rule is more myth than reality17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs7

idea of applying thurmond rule to judi cial nominations ma tter which party was in control of the senate or of the white house there is thurmond rule for democrats when republicans are in control and there is democratic president and there is thurmond rule when the situa tion is reversed nator specter said18 events cited as origin of thurmond rule the debate over whether there is or has ever been such rule appears to arise from different meanings attached to ev ents involving senator thurmond in 1980 at that years republican party national c onvention held in detroit on july 1417 senator thurmond reportedly sa id that at his suggestion the partys presidential nominee ronald reagan had agreed to urge senate republi cans to block all presidential nominations by president jimmy carter until after the november 4 elections19 one account without directly quo ting senator thurmond reported him as having said that by withholding their consent senators could prevent appointments that would c ontinue beyond jimmy carters term should he be defeated in the general election20 at this time senator thurmond was the ranking minority member on the judiciary committee to which all circuit and district court nominations were referred the blocking of appointments urged by senator thurmond presumably extended to these judicial nominations in the weeks immediately thereafter however the judiciary committee processed district and circu it court nominations although not all that were referred to the committee this processing occu rred without senator thurmond during this time or during the rest of the year repeating his earlier call for blocking of president carters appointment s as described below in more detailed narrative of judicial nominations activity in the senate during 1980

thurmond rule by capitol hill newspaper referred to it as new concept that has crept into the backandforth between republicans and democrats or at least longdormant one that has been dusted off the article based on contacts made with some senators and senior senate staff reported that even some of the most skillful senators arent quite sure whether the thurmond rule is really rule at all some call it precedent others term it general understanding some have never even heard of it31 sources for the article cited different points in time at which according to their view of the rule the senate woul d stop processing judicial nominations on july 1 or at the beginning of the first national political party convention that summer or during the last few months of pr esidents term in office one of the senators interviewed for the article was senator kennedy longtime member of the judiciary committee and former chairman 19791981 the article reported that senator kennedy said that at the point

some point when and if republican should be elected to the presidency let say with all due respect to my colleagues i am not starting down any new path the tradition of the senate is one of blocking judicial nominees in the final year of an administration37 other senators also without referring to thurmond rule have characterized senate practice in presidential election year not as one of blocking judicial nominations but of slowing down the c onfirmation process in july 2000 for instance the chairman of the senate judiciary committee senator hatch disagreed with assertions of some nority senators that the sena in 2000 had not confirmed sufficient number of court of appeals minations senator hatch maintained that the senates record in considering circuit nominees up to that point in the session compared favorably with the record of the senate in prior presidential election years he added however that in p residential election years the confirmation of appellate court nominees historically has slowed38 few weeks later senator hatch was reported as saying without however being quoted directly that in every election year point is reached when the senate simply ceases anyway to move judicial nominees deciding to leave filling v acancies up to the next president39 senate processing of nominations in presidential election years 19802004 to some degree debate

vacancy for total of 15 months before this committee was in position to act on mr keating because the administration hadnt even come up with mr keatings name for 11 months and after they came up with his name they held him up for four more months in an investigation so it is 15 months before the committee could even act on mr keating and then he became controversial nominee rightly or wrongly84

of utah detailed the volume of committee and senate activity on judicial nominations up to that point in the session this activity he maintained compared favorab ly with that recorded in the senate in the most recent prior presidential election years the federal judiciary is at virtually full employment because the senate has appropriately carried out its advice and consent duties so far this year the judiciary committee has held 7 hearings for 30 judicial nominees in addition we intend to hold hearing next week for several more nominees so far this year we have confirmed 30 nominees in cluding 7 nominees for the us courts of appeals today we have on the age nda four additional district court nominees and one additional circuit court nominee with seven court of appeals nominees already confirmed this year and an additional appeals court nominee likely to be voted out of this committee it is clear that the senate and the judiciary committee have acted fairly with regard to appeals court nominees in presidenti election years the confirmation of appellate court nominees historically has slowed94 referring to the three previous presidential election years senator hatch noted that the senate had conf irmed seven circu it court nominees in 1988 11 circuit nominees in 1992 and in senator hatchs word zero circuit nominees in 1996 in all likelihood our action with respect to judge rawlinson the circuit nominee to be approved by the committee later that day will mean that less than eight appeals court nominees will be confirmed in this election year as history shows we are right on track with regard to circuit nominees95 different perspective on the committees activity was put forward by its ranking minority member nator patrick j leahy of vermont the senator questioned the

electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs36 110 the end of july might serve as useful demarcation point for two reasons first the senate traditionally takes an august recess nd the end of july comes close to marking the end of the legislative work period before that recess in most years second the end of july falls near the time of the presidential conventions from 1980 to 1992 one partys convention was held in july with the other pa rtys national convention held in august from 1996 to 2008 both conventions were held in augu st or september the 2000 republican national convention started on july 31 among other things table 3 reveals for each presidential election year from 1980 to 2004 whether lower court nominations received hearings committee votes or senate floor votes after july 111 the patterns illustrated in tables 2 and 3 above may operate in conjunction with one another in particular in 1980 1984 nd 2004 the judiciary committees reporting of nominees after july 31 might have occurred in some cases because the committee was considering consensus nominees or in other cases because the committee majority as members of the presidents party might have been willing to report out the presidents nominees whether or not they had bipartisan supportyears110 in most presidential election ears since 1980 the senate judiciary committee as table 3 shows has continued its cons ideration of court of appeals nominees past july in 1980 1984 1988 1992 and 2004 the senate judiciary committee held hearings for at least one court of appeals nominee after july 31 and reported at least one nominee after that date as well in 1996 and 2004 however the judiciary committee did not act on court of appeals nominees after july 31 in 1996 the judiciary committees last hearing for court of appeals nominee was on july 31 its last report of court of appeals nominee was on june 27 in 2000 the last hearing date for court of appeals nominee was june 16 its last report of court of appeals nominee was on july 20 the full senate has also confirmed its final court of appeals nominee earlier in the last three presidential election years than in the previous four presidential election years relatively early end to confirmati ons of court of appeals nominees occurred in 2004 even though the senate and the pr esidency were under the control of the same party in 1980 judge stephen breyer was confirmed to the first circuit on december 16 in 1984 1988 and 1992 the sena confirmed c ourt of appeals nominees in october of each year in each case within several days of the senates adjournment sine die in the past three presidential election years however the senate has not conf irmed court of appeals nominees after july in 1996 the senate confirmed court of ppeals nominees in the second session of the 104th congress its last confirmations were on ja nuary 2 1996 the final day of the first session in 2000 the last confirmation of court of appeals nominee occurred on july 21 in 2004 the last confirmation occurred on june 24 although four nominees were considered in late july the senate rejected attempts to invoke cloture on those nominees111 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs37 112 the significant expansion of the federal j udiciary in 1978 offers useful demarcation when deciding which years to compare in 1978 congress enacted legislation that increased the size of the appellate bench to 132 from 97 judgeships subsequent legislation in 1982 1984 and 1990 brought the size of the appella bench to 179 at the end of 2007 given these expansions of the judiciary data from before 1977 the first year of the presidential term in which the above expansion was enacted may not be easily compared with data after 1977 presidential election years compared with other years of presidential term this section presents for each of the four years of presidential term data on the number of vacancies to be filled minations pending nominations receiving hearings reports of nominations and nate confirmations these data may help illustrate if and to what degree presid ential election years represent declines in senate consideration of nominees relative to other years of the presidential term the following findings can be derived from the data below court of appeals nominees in presidential election years between 1977 and 2007 the senate on average held hearings on fewer court of appeals nominees than in the second and third years of the presidential terms and on average reported and c onfirmed fewer nominations than in any other year of the presidential terms district court nominees in presidential election years between 1977 and 2007 the senate on average he ld hearings on fewer district court nominees and reported and c onfirmed fewer nominations than in the second and the third years but not the first year of the presidential terms days in session the senate has on averag been in session fewer days in presidential election years between 1977 and 2007 than in other years of presidential term with this possibly factor in the senates generally re duced consideration of judicial nominees in presidential election years relative to other years of presidential term senate consideration of court of appeals nominees for nominees to the circuit courts of appeals presidential election years the fourth year of each term have on average seen fewer hearings held than any year except the first year of presidential term and have had fewer nominees reported and confirmed than any other year in presidents term table 4 reports the average number of nominees pending and the number of nominees who received hearing were reported by the senate judiciary committee and were confirmed by the senate in each year of fouryear pr esidential term between 1977 and 2007112 specifically the data shown in table 4 indicate that on average the senate has had an average of 171 nominees pending at some point during presidential electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs38 113 one apparent anomaly is that more nominati ons to the courts of appeals were reported by the senate in the first year of presidentia l terms than received hearings this apparent discrepancy may be due to nominees who received hearings in the first term of twoterm presidencies only to be reported in the second term of twoterm presidentyears on average 90 of those nominees received hearings in presidential election years 83 were reported to the full sena by the judiciary committee and 73 were confirmed by the senate in presidential election years113 the average number of confirmed nominees in presid ential election years 73 is 62 of the average number confirmed in the third year of presidential term 118 put differently between 1977 and

various factors might come into play to influence decline in senate processing of judicial nominations in presidential election years two institutional factors especially might have bearing in this regard one is the sser amount of senate time that typically is available for consideration of judicial nominations in presidential election years relative to other years second is the possible inclination on the part of senators whose party is not in control of the white house to seek during presidential election years to slow down the number of judicial nominations confirmed during the year this slowdow n would preserve available judicial vacancies for the candidate they support in the upcoming presidential election table 6 provides the average number of days in session for each

the first year of presidential term is equated with the first session of the overlapping oddnumbered congress the second year of presidential term is equated with the second session of the overlapping oddnumbered congress and so on as the data in table 6 indicate the senate has on average been in session for fewer days in presidential election years than the other years of presidential term in those years the senate typically r ecesses for presidential nominating conventions or the conventions are held during the cu stomary congressional august recess and congress typically adjourns earlier in presidential election years than in those years the first and third years of presidential term when there are national elections in the second and fourth years of presid ential term the senate typically adjourns for period of time or adjourns sine die in october to allow for campaigning in anticipation of the november electi ons in 1984 1988 1992 and 1996 election years the senate adjourned sine die in october in 1980 and 2004 the senate adjourned in october for the elections and returned following the presidential election for lamehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs41 115 the general pattern of adjourning in september or october and occasionally returning for lameduck session also occurs in midterm election years in 1978 1986 1990 and 1998 the senate adjourned sine die before congressional elections in 1982 1994 and 2006 the senate returned for lameduck sessions after the congressional elections in 2002 the senate remained in session until november 22 at which point it adjourned sine die such pattern does not arise in oddnumbered years when there are regular congressional or presidential elections between 1977 and 2007 the ea rliest in the year that the first session of any congress adjourned was november 13 in 1997duck sessions in 2000 the nate remained in sessi on until november 2 and returned on december 5 for lameduck session115 another possible source of the judici nominee slowdown in presidential election years might be desire on the part of some senators to preserve available vacancies on the courts of appeals and to so degree on the district courts for the candidate they support in the upcoming pres idential election the use of this tactic may be more common in years when the senate majority is controlled by party other than the presidents as noted ear lier debate has occasionally referenced presidential election years before 1980 as years in which the senate slowed its consideration of judicial nominations in presidential election years in the three years mentioned 1948 1960 and 1976 different political parties controlled the senate majority and the presidency while these examples suggest that one partys senators may seek to hold open judicial vacancies for their partys presiden tial candidates the historical record for other election years is not always clear in indicating that such tactic has been employed in 1988 and 1992 when the democr ats had majority in the senate and were considering nominations made by republican presidents the senate returned respectively two and ten court of appeals nominations to the president at the end of each session yet the senate in these two years also confirme d 7 and 11 nominations to the courts of appeals respectively th 11 court of appeals nominations confirmed in 1992 are the most ever confirmed by the senate in presidential election year in both of these years there were differences of opinion along party lines as to whether the democratic majority in the senate was seeking to slow down the judicial confirmation process slowdowns it should be noted also may occur in presidential election years when the presidents party has majority in the senate the year 1980 as discussed above was marked by controversy over whet her as some senate democrats alleged the republican minority in the senate was s eeking to block confir mation of president carters lower court nominations in 2004 w ith republican majority in the senate and republican president but with senate democrats unified in opposition to several of the presidents court of appeals nominees th senate confirmed only five of 19 pending nominations 263 to the courts of appeals the secondlowest confirmation percentage for any presid ential election year in the 19802004 period while senators not of the presidents part may if they are so inclined seek to slow consideration of judicial nominations in presidential election year senators of the same party as the president may in turn seek to speed up senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs42 consideration of pending judi cial nominations as any presidential election may bring about change in the party of the presid ent or in the senate majority or both whether to oppose or favor slowdown in senate processing of judicial nominations in presidential election year should the senate act on fewer lower court nominations than it does in other year s or stop processing them earlier in addressing this question senators might wi sh to take various considerations into account one is that in presidential election year the number of lower court nominations confirmed by th senate will affect the num ber of opportunities to make nominations that will be available later for the person elected president in november another consideration is that the extent to which judicial nomin ations are confirmed during the year will affect the federal j udiciarys vacancy rate ie whether the percent of unfilled fede ral judgeship positions increases decreases or stays about the same the following paragraphs first review range of considerations that might support taking position against slowdown in and an earlier end to processing of judicial nominations in presidential election year then discussed are considerations that might support taking pos ition in favor of slowing down the judicial confirmation process reasons for opposing slowdown for some senators one or more of the following considerations might be regarded as sufficient reason to oppose sl owdown in senate pro cessing of judicial nominations in presidential election year acting on nominations seen as inhe rent in senates advice and consent role some senators might be inclined to regard their advice and consent responsibility under the appoin tments clause of the constitution as obligating them to consider presidents judicial nominations whenever possible from this point of view it would not be responsible for senators because of the arrival of presidential election year to deliberately avoid voting on judicial nominations or to not consider judicial nominations despite the availability of time to do this in the senates schedule according to such an argument the imminent arrival of presidential ection which might or might not bring about change in presidential administration doe s not provide sufficient jus tification for the senate to set aside its role in the confirmation pr ocess the senate should still according to this argument conduct its busine ss according to its normal patterns policy concerns for senators gene rally supportive of presidents judicial nominations some senators if they ve generally been supportive of the presidents judicial nominations in the past might in be favor of processing as many lower court nominations as possible and as late in presidential election year as possible these senators from pub lic policy standpoint might regard the incumbent presidents judicial nominees as more suitable for appointment than thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs43 116 the senate confirmed one circuit court nd five district court nominees on oct 8 1992 it confirmed one circuit court and three di strict court nominees

partys presidential candidate might select if he or she were elected in november hence from their standpoint it would be preferab to fill as many vacant judgeships as possible with the presidents nominees rather than leav open the possibility of the judgeships being filled later by the other partys presidential candidate this concern might be particularly pronounced at the end of twoterm presidency as there may be uncertainty as to what criteria new president of either party might use to select judicial nominees patronage concerns for senators of the presidents party senators of the presidents party might also consider patronage as an incentive to fill judgeships in presidential election year by custom senators who are of the presidents party usually play much more influential role in the selection of judicial nominees from their home states than senato rs of the opposition party to the extent that home state senators of the presidents party play decisive role in the selection of judicial nominees which historically has typically been the case in the selection of district court nominees the judicial po sitions affected are often regarded as form of senatorial patronage when judicial vacancies present such patronage opportunities to senators in presiden tial election year the opportunities may encourage senators to oppose slowdown in judicial confirmati ons in their state instead they are likely to want the vacant judgeships to be filled with nominees whom they played major role in selecting slowdown in processing nominations increases the judicial vacancy rate another consideration which mig ht incline senator to oppose decline in the processing of judicial nomin ations is that the slowdown would increase the federal judiciarys vacancy rate the v acancy rate which affects the ability of the judiciary to conduct its business is directly affected by an increase or decrease in the rate of senate consideration of judicial nominees growth in the vacancy rate could impair the ability of the judiciary to hear and decide cases in timely manner the impact of slowing or stopping senate consideration of judicial nominations in presidential election year can be magnified if the election leads to change in presidential administration new presidents often take several months after their inauguration to begin making judicial nomin ations president

during presidential election year it can be argue d might make the process app ear more partisan in nature if its underlying motivation is clearly to reserve judicial nomination opportunities for the presidential candidate of party other than the presidents also slowdown in such cases arguably increases the degree to which judicial appoi ntments are regarded as political appointments another related consideration is the possibility that partisan conflict in the senate over slowdown in processing judici nominations in presidential election year might serve to carry acrimony and contentiousness between the two political parties into the next presidency in recent years some senators have stated the view that much of the contentiousness of the contemporary judicial confirmation process is the result of each political party having sense of grievance against the other from the reagan through the clinton presidencies senators of the presidents party it has been asserted felt aggr ieved when senators of the other party blocked judicial nominations from being confirmed in the final years of each presidency120 this sensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34615crs45 120 continued

the extent that senator would be concerne d about such political grievances in the senate carrying over from one presidency into the next this would be another consideration against slowdown in judi cial appointments during presidential election year slowdown in presidential election years is not strictly observed practice while the data presented above indicate that on average the senate confirms fewer court of appeals nominees in presidential election years it has not always been the case that relative to other years fewer lower court nominations are processed in presidential

regarded as among the last acts of departing administr ation senators holding to this view of course might differ as to the precise point in presidential election year after which judicial appointments should be reserved for the next presidentelect policy concerns about preside nts judicial nominations in recent decades the judicial confirmation process in the senate periodically has been marked by conflict with support for and oppositi on to the presidents judicial nominees generally forming along party lines ofte n in these conflicts opposition to judicial nominees has largely been based on sena tors reservations about the policy or ideological orientations of nominees under c onsideration in situations such as these some senators might be reluctant to confirm judicial nominees believed to have views of the constitution or of the role of the courts incompatible with their own views senators especially might be reluctant to confirm nominees in presidential election year if they believed that their partys presidential candidate if elected were likely to make judicial nominee selections more compatible with their policy preferences senators with these concerns in anticipation of the presidential election also might consider it desirable at some point in the election year to stop confirming judicial nominees in order to minimize the extent to which the federal judiciary would be filled with appointees of the pr esident at the time of his leaving office patronage considerations of opposition party senators as discussed above nators of the presidents party cu stomarily play primary role in recommending candidates for the president to nominate to federal district court judgeships in their states they also play lesser but often significant role in recommending candidates for fe deral court of appeals judgeships associated with their states123 such appointments are often rega rded as form of senatorial patronage given the role of home state nators in nominee selection patronage of this sort however typically is available only to senators of the same party as the president and it reverts to opposition party nators only after their party has regained the white house for opposition pa rty senators the possibility of gaining such patronage provided their partys ca ndidate is elected president could be consideration in favor of an

were not matc hed by the number of judicial nominees confirmed by the senate to the extent that judicial vacancies impair the ability of the judiciary to hear and decide cases in timely manner slowdown in senate activity to fill judicial vacancies it could be argued contributes to that impairment counterargument however is that temporary slowdown in senate processing of judicial nominations will not be harmful if it occurs at time when the existing judicial vacancy rate is relatively low in this vein the chairman of the senate judiciary committee in 2000 view ed the vacancy rate of federal lower court judgeships at that time as virtually synonymous with full employment in the federal judiciary124 at the time the combined vacancy rate for the courts of appeals and district courts was 71125 from such perspective concerns about increasing the judicial vacancy rate would not rule out senate slowdown in processing judicial nominations as long as the rate were at an acceptably low level other judicial vacancy considerations also might be relevant to decision by senator in favor of slowdown in the pr ocessing of judicial nominations in presidential election year one would be wh ether the senate in the years and months immediately preceding contem plated slowdown had significantly reduced the judicial vacancy rate if so that record would put temporary slowdown in broader context showing it to be brief period in longer time frame in which senate confirmations of judicial nominees had significantly reduced the judicial vacancy rate another consideration is comparison of the judici vacancy rate at the time of contemplated slowdown with vacancy rates existing at corresponding times in earlier congresses senator arguably might be more inclined to favor slowdown if the

democrats have asserted that in presidential election year the senate customarily slows the processing of judicial nominations at an earlier point than in other years in s upport of such an asser tion some have cited what has been called the thurmond rule precedent they maintain dates back to events in 1980 and which they say has since 1980 shaped how the senate and the senate judiciary committee have processed judicial nominations in presidential election years conversely some senate republi cans have rejected the existence of thurmond rule in the senate and the inte rpretations of events in 1980 that are the basis for democrats invoking the rule in addressing the above issue it is important to keep in mind that there is written senate or senate judiciary committee rule concerning judicial nominations in presidential election year bipartisan agreement has ever been reached or any judiciary committee or sena vote taken regarding thurmond rule or the practices for which it is said to stand on the other hand it is also important to note that senators of both parties have on diffe rent occasions over the past few decades characterized senate processing of judicial nominations as slower during presidential election years usually if not always sena tors making these characterizations have done so when they were of the opposite part to the presidents in addition the data analyzed above for the 19802004 period dem onstrate that senate consideration of court of appeals nominees in the most recent presidential election years has resulted in fewer confirmations

committee and senate actions taken on court of appeals and district court nominations in each presidential election year from 1980 to 2004 in most of these presidential election years fairly simila r dynamic appeared to take place in the judiciary committee and in the senate over the issue of whether to slow down the judicial confirmation process senators of the presiden ts party supported processing as many judicial nominations as possible in the year and as late in the year as possible and they looked for examples of earlier presidential election years when relatively large numbers of nominations we re processed or when nominations were processed relatively late in the year on the other hand sena tors of the oppos ition party cited other presidential election years when relatively few nominations were processed or when the processing of nomin ations stopped relatively early in the year to put slowdown in the current congress in more favorable perspective examples of

view later129 the debate over the pace of senate confirmations also regularly takes on pattern of senators of the presidents party and the president himself blaming opposition party senators for obstructing nominees viewed as qualified and deserving of senate confir mation in this debate opposition pa rty senators often contend that the presidents choices are controversial minees selected to further the presidents policy agenda and are not th best qualified nominations the president could make one component of the debate over senate considerati on of judicial nominations in presidential election year and of sena consideration of judicial nominations more generally is whether or not th increasing contr oversy over judicial nominations constitutes policy problem for the senate observers and scholars have pointed to the involvement of inte rest groups and the increasingly partisan nature of judicial nominations as r eason for concern not only for the senate but for the ability of the judiciary to fulfill its role adjudicating controversies between litigants130 one indicator of this controversy is the increasing timetoconfirmation for those nominees who secu re

hopes to see its nominee confirmed not only to cons ult with the home state senator but also through process of consultation to select nominee who is acceptable to both the continueddespite the falling vacancy rate th current controve rsy over judicial nominations might still give the senate cause for concern because the senate meets for fewer days in election years than in nonelection years the senate may be concerned that the controversy over judi cial nominations occupies an inordinate amount of the senates time the senate may also be c oncerned that acrimony over the judicial nomination process might spill over into other issues the senate is considering and into the next congress such acerbity might lead potential federal judgeship nominees to view the confirmation process as too timeconsuming and unpleasant thus discouraging qualified indi viduals from allowing themselves to be considered should the senate seek to confirm judi cial nominees more promptly and later in presidential election years one obstacle to overcome or avoid would be partisan conflict over the nominees to that end some senators in the 110th congress have indicated that the senate is more likely to move forward late in presidential election years with what they view as consensus nominees some senators have suggested that nominee could be considered as c onsensus choice if he or she has the support of both home state senators133 others however have st ressed that in addition to having the support of home state senators it is necessary in orde r to be confirmed that nominee

be disagreement as to which nominees are consensus nominees the support of both homestate senato rs particularly if the senators are of the opposition party is an important i ndicator of the

committee and the full senate in presidential election year than if they lacked such support136 however as already suggested such support might not be sufficient to allow the nomination to be considered in committee or on the senate floor if the nomination lacks the bipartisan support of both the chair and ranking nority member of the judiciary committee and of both the senate majority and the senate minority leader two other considerations may ultimately serve to limit the number of judicial nominations that can be considered after certain point in presidential election years first as noted above legislative time is more limited in presidential election year as noted in table 6 above the senate has over at least the last 30 years been in session for fewer days in presidential election years than the other years of presidents term in part due to the time taken for the national conventions and campaigning in advance of the elections judicial nominations therefore compete with other legislative priorities for the attention of the senators the judiciary committee and the full senate second the confirmation pro cess with all its steps can be timeconsuming if nominations are made relatively late in the year there might not be time for the senate to proceed through the steps necessary to hold confirmation votes on nominees137 nominations typically require background
