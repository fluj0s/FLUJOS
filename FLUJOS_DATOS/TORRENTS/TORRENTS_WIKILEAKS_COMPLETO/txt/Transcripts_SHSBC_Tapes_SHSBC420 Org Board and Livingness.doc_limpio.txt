org board and livingness lecture given on 6 april 1965 thank you well now todaytoday is redletter day today is quite day this is about the first day i ever brought notes to lecture so i want you to mark this down and what is the date audience april 6 ad 15 april 6 ad 15 so you want to mark that date down ron brought some notes to the lecture now todayyou have been hearing lot about organization and reorganization and rerereorganization and im about to give you talk on the new org board for all organizations over the world and you will find that your notes on this will probably be fairly scrambled the whole thing will be published in auditor 8the whole org boardand there will be hcob pardon hco policy letter 3 april 65 released which gives the basic organization in detail and theres lot of stuff gone in on this and actually ive been working on practically nothing else for weeks of course ive been working on everything else for weeks too you see but my concentration has been on this and it sort of stopped thenobody will believe this people are somewhat alarmed with the number of policy letters coming out and so forth those are parts of the new hat book and theyre simply being released to get them out so they wont cause randomity because when we send the new hat books off to the printers wellprobably well have them in 681970 and thata bit of missing data between now and then might prove very catastrophic here and there so you notice that around orgs and so forth these things are being released as just general nonremimeo nonremimeo means that theyre cut on stencil and just run off and few copies are sent to each org anyway you will be seeing lot of this org board and im merely pointing out to you about this that there is something about it to understand theres great deal about it to understand and the firstthe first is that the org board does not change regardless of the size of the organization it may get longer at the bottom but it doesnt change in its significant characteristics departments divisions or anything else they remain constant and it doesnt matter if its class zero org consisting of three guys trying to lift their heads up off the pavement as an organization or an organization of 200000 staff members it would be the same org board and i know that startles you but i almost told you the real figure two billion this board isthis board has lot of back history and it is refined board and i may as well tell you the truth here amongst us girls this is refined board that i spoke to you about in an earlier lecture of an old galactic civilization and you say whats that doing amongst us well we applied scientology to it and found out why the civilization eventually failed they lacked couple of departments and that was enough to mess it all up and they only lasted eighty trillion well be going lot longer than that so we want to get something substantial we dont want these temporary flybynight affairs you know matter of fact practically every government of this planet has fallen on its head before it was even heard of they go up and vanish so quick that history is practically unable to keep track of them ill bet youill bet you just yesterday just the other day 1500 bcyou cannot tell the primary civilization which was in exist thats right i thought you couldnt you dont know what government was in power in europe and the middle east in 1500 bc you see just that little tiny tiny span of time what is that thirtyfive hundred years you dont even remember temporary makeshift didnt understand nobody had ever been to school about org boards didnt know anything about it now actually thereve been lots of schools about org boards they didnt have scientology but they did have org boards there have been some of the wildest org boards that have ever been invented dont consider the united states army has any org board it doesnt armies dont have org boards they have command charts hmph you want to see the picture of suppressive person look at an org board of military organization it goes commanding general adjutants officers nobodies everyplace except the mexican army and that has commanding generals and thats all itll be like our city offices using this board for the first time and itll look like the mexican army because everybodyll be top brass two ranks of top brass now our org boardour org board is erected to stay there and therefore has been worked out very carefully against various known philosophic principles so that it is itself philosophic machine and in very short time youre going to see this org board in comm center where the public is able to walk by it become jam spot i cani can assure you its going to become jam spot and youre going to get little despatches from communicators saying cant we put the org board behind door or something so we can get some work done that isnt the thing to do its just make the comm center biggeryou see elementaryand just put duplicate board in there the public can stand in front of say on it dont look at this board look at that one you know so as to get them out of the road because youre not going to be able to keep people off of this board that sounds very funny very funny how come an organization board could suddenly move up into such prominence well youll see before this lecture is over now the main thing to know about these things is command chart is only one tiny twobit little function thats minor function of an organization chart because an organization chart must take care of function and it must take care of the activity and it must take care of what happens and you look on an armys organization board and you dont find anyplace to refer lost battle well thats pretty interesting what do you do with lost battles i can just see an army signalman trying to put lost battle someplace in an army org board hes trying to look for the guys basket where do we send this lost battle now let tell you why they fail this is the principle and this is principle of this universe if the function is not expressed it will be worn unknowingly by everybody and you can write that down in letters of fire right on the frontal structure where it comes to organizationsright on the front of your skull so you can look at it as thetan write it backwards of course so that you can look at it properly the function that isnt expressed is worn by everybody this therefore becomes very important when i say where do you put the lost battle well just that all by itself and thats very minor point would of course eventually defeat the organization with such board because its decay is on automatic but of course mans reactive bank being the way mans reactive bank is of course hed invent such an org board now where you have then one of these org boards you have frailty that goes along which is almost the same order of magnitude as what i just told youthe function which isnt expressed on the org board is worn by everyone unknowingly see and you can make note of that because thats very importantis the other monitoring function which gives us bureaucracies and that is when you put box on an org board it will be filled and that is at war with the other function now lets look at these two contradictory data and they are almost of comparable magnitude if we dont express the function on the org board it will be worn unknowingly by everyone and the other datum if you put box square or function on an org board they will assign people to it inevitably and invariable you will find this to be the case those two things then are at war and have not been solved by organizations of the past so in the effort to stay within the realm of possibility with regard to personneleconomic possibility population possibilities and so forth within that realmthen they drop functions off the org board because they cant have an organization that big because this again is hidden datum that people will fill the box theyll put somebody in that box you got box there it says adjutantsadjutants boot shiner oh youll find an adjutants boot shiner show up he may be totally unnecessary maybe adjutants have ceased to wear boots but hell be there and if theyve neglected to take mules off of the us army charts youre going to find mules and mule helpers and mule holders and mule curriers and ill bet you theres some place in the united states army right now thats just got tons of mules ill just bet you and ill bet you in reforming the cavalry charts when they turned them over to mechanizedpeople who like animals dont like machines so they turned over the cavalry and mechanized it you see on the theory that cavalry goes across countryside or something but they forgot to take the spurs off the officers dont you see so therefore i know definitely that they forgot to take some spots out of their org boards and youre going to find some mighty peculiar things if you went sneaking around cavalry regiment today theyre mechanized theyre in tanks you know and they got motorcycles and armored cars and jeeps and all that sort of thingofficers still wearing spurs they sure raise the devil with tank upholstery too getting in and out of tanks but if youif you looked around there you would see some peculiar things and if you went and look at their org board why it isnt there now if there areno tank repairmen or anything like that were provided for you wouldnt find them there now oddly enough man when he works as team must have policy or he is not team he cannot work as team without policy so all he works as is bunch of individuals even bad policy you see will at least make team out of him do you follow it isnt whether the policy is bad or good its does it exist and is it followed fortunately i dont write policy on the basis any old policy is better than policy but it so happens therell be somebody cursing his head unable to get this through his skull at some time or another probably going to remember this line on the tape and hold it up to you probably better cut it out but thats true any policy is better than policy because that is what makes the team its simply the agreement its the extant agreement and if there isnt an extant agreement then you have individualized action when you get individualized action even though this is occasionally very spectacular and very successfulwhich hangs the auditor in losein win you see and then makes him lose afterwards this very spectacular individualization of action within the rest of the team weirdly enough even though it occasionally wins battle in actual fact does more harm than good because it sets an example of breaking policy which then breaks up the team the worst team you ever wanted to see is one composed of allstars taken at random as the starring players with spectacular individualities from each of the winning teams of country i dont care what game youre playing if you want really stinking team get those boys because theyre running according to the different policies of their different coaches dont you see and they are already by allstar players preselected as doing something that was very noticeable which means they didnt even follow their own team policy so now you group all these fellows together in mess and each oneeach one is magnificent and collective mess and they probably could be licked by any little batch of highschool kids on the same game who were welded together by policy when bill does that i do this thats it thats play sixtyfour whats play sixtyfour well when bill does that i do this and then joe does that thats just policy now you see if they were facing some individuals who were very very good individually and those individuals they were facing had policy do you see that these three guys on the organized team could easily defeat the other team because theyre defeatingthere actually in basketball would be five men against one not team in other words each member of an unorganized teameach member of an unorganized teamis standing naked and alone and so any small group matter how small as long as its more numerous than the one can rather easily defeat one so we in scientology compared to the worlds population are relatively small group we tend to be lot of ruddy individualists which is fine in our private life but our organizational actions must be coordinated and if we knitted together our organizational actions and our functions across the world and we had good similarity of action good duplication from organization to organization and then we grooved this in and put this together very nicely who else on this planet is following policy nobody even the commies who are the closest to organized people have such rifts about policy that nobody knows whether to follow lenins policy or stalins policy or khrushehevs policy or the new coexistence policy see or the old revolutionary policywhatever that was and you probably do not realize that there are aboutwell i knowi know myself of three or four brands of communism and therefore i would say there are probably three or four hundred you see because im not aim not ato use difficult worda buff on the subject you know you ever hear of fire buff or police buff hes the fellow whenever he hears the police sirens goes out and jumps in his car you know and follows the police car or hes the fellow that follows the fire engines to the fire and hesthe railroad buffwhy hes always down looking for old steam engines and so forth and hes asking for ride on the cowcatcher or something like that buff im not communist buff i donti dont follow them up very much because it wont be necessary see i just dont like to become buff to an impermanent fixture theres future in it and theyre really not long for this world why well theres two good reasons why one they themselvesthey themselves arent that good theyre temporary earth civilization one of these temporary things that goes away in what flicker of an eye and theyre gone see up one minute down the next disappeared downthedrain type oftype of operation so they couldnt be going very long and their duration alone doesnt make them very worthy as an opponent see they wouldnt be now you say what do you mean durationthey wouldnt be here long theyd be here long enough well maybe theyd be here long enough for atomic fission but were working on that one too now the point imthe point im trying to make out is that if you were better organized and then organizations were better organized you wouldnt have to do anything spectacular about the other organizations do you follow this will not then engage you in war with the other organization we dont want war with these organizations and oddly enough i have traced every single blowup weve had back to wild departure from policyvery simple primary known policy melbourne blew up on the refund policy they just didnt follow any part of the refund policy thats rather incredible our policy is when somebody somebody isnt satisfied and so forth and wants his money back we promptly give him his money back we also tell him well youre through with scientology but that has nothing more to do with it we dont want to stand around taking his money and giving it back and taking his money and giving it back the devil with that its too hard on the accounts department so we just say all right youve had it theres your money byebye and thats been policy since heck was pup and melbourne didnt give the man his money back nooo and when they did give him his money back they didnt follow the rest of the policy they didnt get quitclaim from him so he turned right around and sued them they gave his money back and he sued them pure idiocy then melbourne is rather expert at departing from policy and you neednt cut that off the tape thats where they come cropper you see they are not part of the team and you will find all the symptoms of individuation present which is they yammer at the other teams see they cuss the other teams out theyre always getting arc broke about the other teams do you see and they just individuate more and more and more and follow policy less and less and less and all of sudden they arent there anymore unless somebody intervenes with heavy cavalry now if were going to make our forward progresswe have lot of good organizations through the world of which melbourne is one of them now i have now acked them the situation is that these are placed in rather strategic areas theyre placed in strategic areas to spread sphere of influence and when those spheres of influence meet on their own borders we dont want them to be different and create ridge we want them just to flow smoothly out and meet you follow its all rigged to do so now therefore if we are good team and if we watch our individual cases and we come right on up the line as people as beings and we also are part of the team then we wont get into all the trouble we got into as roaring screaming individuals way back on the track in other words we can make it all the way because weve kept order all the way right now we could turn people loose it used to dismay meive already faced this problemit used to dismay when i would clean somebody up as case and then hed get into busybusybusy activity of some kind or another and go tearing off in big busyness and not do anything for the forward motion because normally he would go out there and he would go for while and hed be all right but after while why hed sort of cave inloneliness and other things you see this was bum show so obviously then we werent making our way with his case so we find out that case stability depends upon the smooth organization of individuals see sensible as that and then well be able to make it all the way and without an organizational shove back of that then the guy goes up and i dont care whether its thousand yearsi dont care whether its ten years thousand years or ten billion yearswhy there he is in the theta trap or there he is going downhill again or there he is with all this stuff plastered all over his face and he cant figure out what it is and hes now forgotten how to run 8c or touch assists well you see itd be temporary affair and like an earth government wouldnt be worth doing now it isnt that anybody is trying to weld everybody together to the end of time but i should say offhand that every person and being and so on who is going up with scientology ought to take scientology up with him seems only fair and then youll find things will work out fairly smoothly and very easily now what do you fall back on when you come cropper all by yourself out in the far reaches of this particular planet what do you fall back on you fall back on an organization you fall back on how could i be there at all if there wasnt an organization to take care of the action do you see so an organization is not necessary evil or not some reason why and so forth the organization is there to serve scientologists and to handle the thing and the public and spread it out and so forth theres lots of reasons why its there but this isnt lecture on purposes but remember that it is coordinated activity and therefore it must be very close to flawless because once you put one of these things in brass and start ityou know you put it in concrete and you start it rollingif its almost right youve had it because it will become an alldevouring monster and fail by the germs of its own destruction and the thing that destroys almost any organism is its own germs its the things it laid in its the things you did not what were done to you the only way you can come down is for having made mistake yourself there must always be that prior mistake sometimes its very slight sometimes you couldnt possibly have hoped to have predicted the action would go the way it went but it did go in some fantastic tangent to the way you expected it to go from that particular point and you had made mistake and there one starts down you make enough of those things and youre really going down but it takes quite few whats interesting is an organization watching its general income curve go down doesnt realize when i look at it i am not looking for thing that is making it go down im looking for the hundred thousand im looking for the gross errors but the lots of them theyre not really ever composed of one major error one howling major error thatif you go around looking for that you make the same mistake that has been made by every philosopher that i have ever read hes made mistake its contained on this chart and whats contained is this he says what you must have is understanding what you must have is understanding says the old philosopher now please please please please what you must have is understanding boy that is an error that i myself fell into and have carried on for very long time until i was drawing up this org board the other day and recognized the flaw its understandings its plural its sort of trick you look at something and youre trying to understand this thing youre looking for one big thing to understand and it isnt composed of one big thing to understand its got about fifteen or twenty little ones thats the biggestprobably the biggest single bug there is in philosophy anywherethat philosophers looked for understanding they looked for an understanding i can tell you quite frankly theres 265 times 6 separate dynamic urges in manseparate basic principal dynamic urges in man two hundred and sixtyfive times 6 and theres 265 times 6 times 18 separate causations now the big understanding there is that they exist and the other understanding is is it was an effort to make them so numerous that nobody could embrace them well all right lets get to the next point on this org board rather slippily and rapidly i hope ive made my point that there is some necessity for organizational action it must be smooth there must be policy the next point is that it must be comprehensible its got to be knowable if there were system by which it went together it would put everyone who read it on memory basis if it didnt crosscategorize and if it didnt do various things if you werentcouldnt classify various types of communication various types of duties or functions and so on itd just become madhouse itd be chaos itself so the org board must express the functions duties sequences of action and authorities and boy thats lot to express on twodimensional board youre going to express the potential duties well of couple of thousand staff members and bring it down to one staff member and the one staff member is not going to be any different than the two thousand twohundred thousand two million twohundred million two billion staff members see what are we looking at boy thats philosophic conundrum isnt it enough to give you headache to think of it how are you going to take an organization that would accommodate and define and delineate the dutiesthis was thethis was the principle on which i operatedof two billion staff members and reduce it down to one staff member well actually when i first started out it would go up to about hundred staff members you could get it as big as hundred before you needed brandnew org boardand that means the organization would have to be torn apart and thrown awayor you could bring it down to three and thats as low as you could get it you could only get it to three and i was stuck between three and hundred or thereabouts and i said that isnt good enough and i started cracking brains trying to figure outmight as well crack my brains i dont want to get damaged myself so i saidi set myself the artificial problem of making it so that it would go up to two billion this is totally just theoretical just so id have bzzzt figure you know big and down to one person and that was the span of action duty function organization and form well thats why youre going to see people looking at this org board and jamming up things and so forth becausehold your hatit gives the cycle of raw meat to ot it gives the cycle of actions person would undertake from the public so it became public org board too because the public looking at it enters from the left and proceeds straight on through to the right thats all and it must take care of him properly all the way along the way it must therefore be the way it must therefore be the route now following the laws and principles of how you make channel and what you do to keep the channel rolling and keep an impulse on the channel you must of course have an impulse into the channel the edges of the channel must be held firm the barriers in the channel must be removed the noncompliance of forwardings in the channel have to be taken care of and the distractions must be removed from the borders of the channel and there must be some place for something going down the channel to arrive at must be place for it to start from and place for it to arrive at and we have defined life and life without that channel wont exist thats livingness livingness is going along certain course impelled by purpose and with some place to arrive it consists mostly of removing the barriers in the channel holding the edges firm ignoring the distractions and reinforcing and reimpelling ones progress along the channel thats life and thats this org board its dreamed up with malice aforethought to put somebody on it and shove him straight through its riggedits rigged to remove the distractions reinforce the edges pick up the barriers take care of the noncompliance reimpulse any particle on the line with place for it to go it does all these things now not only that it gives you all the levels that will now exist for the gradation program all the levels for the gradation program and this is where clear fell out of the hamper suddenly after all these years suddenly took look at it and found exactly where clear fitted clear is sort of baby ot he hasnt learned to walk yet but frankly theres nothing nothing to erase between clear and ot except the physical universe his next bank of course is the physical universe and i dont think hes going to go around and erase that in hurry but he could go before it or go after it couldnt he he wouldnt have to erase it but thats clear clear is baby ot so that occurs on the board well you take baby hes in beautiful condition but he sure as hell cant walk did you ever notice you follow he clear as bell you know i mean you could ring him and hed gong for hours beautiful condition hes got lots of experience if he could only call on it i ran into this headon myself i dont know if youve read the bulletin yet or not is it in your hands audience yes yeah all right i dont know what you thought about that gave you terrible shock i imagine but release weve been looking at release for long time its very funny ive never been able to get anybody to check out release or clear they have big argumentsbig arguments about release theres only one question they had to ask but theyd never seem to be able to say that anybody was really release and big arguments ensued about clear well of course i had to be within shooting range of this exact position on the forward travel and so forth before i could suddenly say ah for gods sakes ah what the devil you know i got all the right answers and we got the right answers all the way to the top thats whats so funny you know nineteen fiftyfiftytwo philadelphia lectures you know this is very funny they tell you all about an ot creation of human ability published here in england ages ago got the steps in it which you now undertake of course you cant take those steps with reactive bank in your road because it reactivates the bank and the bank shoves you back down again its wild business you see so there it was and i looked it right so i decided well ronnie i said the only thing you can do is just confess just fess up to it all right thats the way it is because well leave it to the universities to make popularity with data and we ourselves fare best when we simply tell what we know when we know it and this is case in point thats one of these new jet fighters theyre practicing well we havent got any ots in the class to go up and give him the idea how to land so well go on so these points have to show up on this board they have to be taken care of on this board because this board isnt taking care of one kind of being it isnt taking care of thetanwogclass spunin x2 see ill be of gun if the board isnt taking care of all of these types of beings and theyre different types of beings as they go on up the line dont you see theyll act differently and theyll behave differently so therefore we had to move up in the direction of accommodating this fact and so the easiest way to do that and so forth was simply to express the various stages on the org board itself and match them to the departments of the org board so you find each department of the org board expresses one of these conditions now i knew nobody else would want to take the original basic point on the horizontal line so i did and thats the first organization that we ever had in scientology and that was the office of l ron hubbard and thats department one you see thats the office of l ron hubbard thats the old phoenix arizona office i first put together and it eventually became hasi well whats more elementary than that and i tried and figure out what else would go on this because i knew there was something bit odd here and so on and i suddenly realized we had forgotten piece of our own trackin scientology track and that was the first organization of scientology and strangely enough it is still functioning it functions just exactly like that and when we tried to straighten out saint hill here the other day we found out that the only things wrongi found out the only things going wrong here in my perimeter is that the lines which are always in on the office of l ron hubbard never had been connected at saint hill but they were trying to go in all the time but nobody had connected them up theres always an lrh communicator and he normallyhe has lots of multitudinous duties of one kind or another and thesuch personsuch person has lot of things to do and this person haswell he handles signatures for one thing and authorities and signatures and youll see these things coming in and theyre typed up in various parts of the organization theyre scattered all over the organization people wonder well how long am i going to have this line you know it doesnt seem to belong well it belongs in the office of l ron hubbard of course its letter written up for my signature or its certificate for my signature or its something else for my signature thats just one of these many functions see there are whole bunch of these little things there is where is my file of policy letters dont you see theres that kind of function theres all kinds of little functions of this particular character that doing without them and scattering them around the organization elsewhere winds everybody kind of up in the soup now therefore that stuff is all corralled and thats under the first department but the main thing to know about the first department is that it is an issuance of conditions we have some conditions now which are hung around peoples heads becausefor this excellent reason that if they exceed condition if they try to be in one condition when theyre in another condition ill give you an idea they try to be in condition of emergency when theyre in condition let us say of affluenceyou know they got lots of money and they try to act like theyre in condition of emergency they will very shortly be in condition of emergency do you see and reversely weirdly enough if they aretry to be in condition of affluence while theyre in condition of emergency boy will they be in condition of emergency i found whole bunch of formulas here of one kind or another which regulate the steps which should be takenthese are basic policythey regulate the steps that should be taken for any given condition of an organization or its department so the name of that area is conditions and thats the point of conditions and that announces conditions but of course if you hobsonjobson this around when somebody comes in what does he tell you about he tells you about conditions he tells you about his conditions or he tells you about the conditions of the world hes always got condition in mind and thats what lies from there off the board into raw meat you see you havethe first cognition is that there is condition thats the first thing person has got to learn that there is condition the world is drifting around they think there are lots of people who take care of the mind and they think there are lots of doctors around that heal everything you know and they think there are governments that are taking care of their citizens theyre in some happy little theetieweetie dream you know and theyve never really looked at the conditions you see this guy is going around and he isnt the least bit aware of his own condition not even the least bit aware of his own condition you know whats going to happen to him do you realize that very shortly hell be dead thats the condition hes in hes going to die and do you know that you could look somebody right straight between the eyes and tell that with the greatest of truth hes going to die it seems so ordinary to human being that he should die that it doesnt ever occur to him as condition its condition of his daytoday life hes getting older so hes going to die when you say this to somebody it puts him into little bit of state of shock you say youre going to die thats the condition youre in youre going to die and do you know the whole medical profession and all insurance companies have built all of their business on that one statement youre going to die thats the condition thats the condition of the human race so it actually goes from death see into the first part of our board which is we say at this point of the board its not necessarily true that youre going to die yes well if you keep on going the way you are youre going to die but its not necessarily true at this part of the board you dont have to die and thats condition of scientology see you dont have to get sick and these things dont have to happen to you in other words conditions can be bettered you get somebody to realize his condition and so forth so we get whole new battery of processes by the way that come out underneath this thing that weve always taken for granted and which has made it difficult for us to sell the individual scientology and by applying those various processes you becoming accomplished in these things will be able to walk out on the street and tag somebody and it doesnt matter whether you tag him or he tags you why in short order if you handle this thing right youre just looking at scientologist right there because what have you done youve put him into the first condition which is realization that such thing as scientology exists and thats the first condition youre trying to establish in being and it gives you the drill of exactly how you do this to anybody whether hes paranoid or nut and the only person you wouldnt convince and so forth would be somebody who was utterly unconscious like psychiatrist nowthe fellow is too far gone you cant talk to dead man about it because he isnt there now this isnt matter of death these conditions can be very high and the funny part of it is that all processing from that point there on always contains condition this is then in common to the remainder of the chart so as you move in from left to right this one always carries along slightly with it but after youve had condition what have you got to do well an oldtime auditor like you ought to know youd better communicate with it so that is our next department and we have the department of communications and the name of the level is communications thats all now that weve got the guy so he knows condition and he can communicate he can now find out some more by perceiving so the next point is perception the next department must be perception and that is the department of inspections and reports elementary if you think it over for moment youll find out that communication must precede perception very very delicate little point here now the next line after this is orientation after youve perceived you know where you are so you have something known as orientation you can orient yourself if youre ever having nightmare all youve got to do is open one eye and find out where you are and you cease to have the nightmare most elementary process i know of and so it is in life this fellow comes along and hes been having nightmares up to this point that he calls life and he then being aware that conditions can exist and being able to communicate with those conditions perceives and so orients himself and finds out that he has been living in thing called nightmare you see he would just like that so that these earlier stages now are walking along with us see we havent met this next one yet but there it is in the next step after one has achieved orientation is of course understandings but orientation weirdly enough is the department of compilation after you see where you are you note it down after you put few of these notes together and so forth they add up to compilation of orientation and you can hand them to people and they can orient themselves dont you see but you cant hand them to people without understandings youve got to compile them into understandings do you see organizationally were tracking you getim subtly shifting from case to organization dont you see understandings of course is what else but the department of publications they would of course publish whats to be understood do you follow but preclearhe had run into condition he communicated with it perceived what it was oriented himself in it now he would understand it so his level at this point would be understandings he would be able to attain understandings and not for gods sakes any moreplease weve had the error too longhe doesnt attain at that point understanding he undershe gets understandings and his understandings of course have been compiled under orientation he took notes and he put them all together and they became understandings well of course they can become published he can now say look what i understood he can now tell people what he understood he can now tell himself what he understood and i think thats all understanding is is telling yourself so we now run into the next department which is really the department of promotion called department of promregpromotion and registration and thats promreg but what do you guess its under its under purposes thats all promreg ever handles by the way theyre handling peoples purposes if they ever handle anything else but their purposes theyre in trouble if they dont alter change shift or enforce purposes they dont ever get anybody to appear anyplace on course or in an organization as far as the pc is concerned why he has arrived at purposes and if you count these very carefully conditions is one communications two perception is three orientation four understandings is five and purposes is six which puts our pe and has off the chart where it belongs and reorients by taking advantage of the missing five that we had without changing anything but few class numbers gives us our same certificate scale and holds stability on r6 which everybody knows most they dont pay much attention to the rest of the numbers but r6 they do pay attention to and department of promreg is the sixth department and it also happens to be the sixth level and its also the sixth grade whichthats the sixth pc grade and thats the sixth auditor grade dont you see and what has he achieved at that point well hes gotten rid of all the false purposes and he knows what his purposes are and hes achieved state of clear now thats all hco we have got further now than hco and hco is doublebarreleddepartment division and its the only one there is ill track back there are numerous other of these things but ill have to cut you in on what this is all about here and the numerous othernesses of all this is that hco has always had post called hco dissem sechco dissemination secretary and the hco secretary takes care of the conditions communications and perception in other words takes care of the office of l ron hubbard the department of communicationsthats everybody in the orgs communications not just hcoand the department of inspection and reports which includes of course oic and cable data and justice and committees of evidence and lawyers andanything that you would inspect and report on see is contained in that area so its very easy to understand what is grouped under that youll see somebody studying this board wondering where something goes and then all of sudden he goes clink well of course it couldnt go anyplace but there and sure enough it goes there in other words its board that lends itself to understandings so the dissem see takes over at the department of orientation the hco dissem sec takes over at the department of orientation and has the remaining three departments which are of course compilation publications and promotion now frankly you could say well why do we call all that hco well actually it cant work by itself because the original formula which led us into scientology was having known the conditions i found it was necessary to communicate with them in order to perceive orient myself in them and with the resulting understandings find out what my purpose really was and so that was formula and it was the original formula by which we moved in but i have put the thing in order not as it was expressed at that timeit was expressed nearly like thatbut i put the thing in order so that it is clarified so if it led to this much technology it must have been whale of purpose must have been quite purpose in itself and to knock it out at this particular time would probably be to knock the whole basis out from underneath everything so we keep that as hco and we say thats all hco but hco now has two secretaries but one is not the hco secretary shes still top dog youve got the hco dissem secretary taking care over department of compilations and having three departments under her now the three departments the first three departments under the hco secretary are division one thats division one and that simply means communications thats their speciality because its the center action of it and thats the communications division but you would call it the hco division merely because we know it as that over long periods of time now the next one division two which takes care of the department of compilation publications and promotion would be the dissemination divisiondivision dissemination division the division has three departments now youll see the purpose for these very shortly now there are six of these divisions thats lot of them and were going to find something very weird that they missed way back on the trackspace operaesque i will explain to you what it is its staggerer and that is all youve got to do is cross two divisions on hat and from that point on you have jammed the ability of the organization to expand and that is the secret to the degree that you then cross hats on this chartthat is to say somebody tries to wear hat of division two and hat of division fourif you carefully in actual experience look over the thing very carefully and wonder why in the name of god everything is going to pieces and everybody seems to be very upset and so forth you look over the org board very fast and youll see that josie ann is on hco dissemination and also on field activities and that seemed logical to somebody but somehow or another it is absolutely jammed into horrible mess and you go in and look at her basket their comm station and you will find out that it is stacked so you just cant see over it the lines lock at these points and six is irreducible actually the six is irreducible you cant call it really an organization until it has six people in it one for each division and the degree that it wont expand is the degree that you cross those divisional hats and when an organization gets just so big you cross departmental hats at your peril when its very small you can cross departmental hats but when it gets very big or just mediumly big you start crossing departmental hats youll find out that all the traffic is piling up at that point theyre just making horrible logjam in other words what im talking about here is weve got six separate activities and these separate activitiesas you look into themthese separate activities go on basis of your first one is communication now if you dont havesee thats division one we call it hcoyou dont have communication why youre in pretty bad trouble have you ever noticed anybody who was out of communication i think that you very possibly have used the word occasionally well hes in pretty bad shape but if somebody doesnt disseminate at all they never put out they could be in communication but they never give out anything they would talk to you but they never give anything out one way or the other youd find that was pretty bad and theyd be pretty sick so thats actually one and thats two dissemination then would be two and then if we look this over very carefully if somebody isnt neating the organization together if there isnt an organization division theres nobody looking after the organization well the organization then wouldnt be there itd just be these other divisions floating out into the air you see so youve got to have an organization division and thats three andi want to write it big enough so that you can see it or id string them all out in one line the way they should be and you then come in here and youve got to have ayouve got to have technical division because thats what were in thats the knowhow and even if you were making beans or spaghetti youd still have to have technical division why because this is thethis is what you do it isnt what you know thats clear back up in the other line see but its what you do thats the technical activity and were particularly in technical so therefore its the doingness of the technical not the technical sitting there all by itself dont you see and that of course is four and your next lineup immediately after your technical is the point that has been missed in all org charts on this planet and back to eighty trillion years ago you cant make productjust make product that is not possible times change things alter you cant just say its product and nobody does oddly enough but they dont have it on their org boards and sooner or later they neglect it theyve got to qualify the product got to qualify it theyve got to say this is how it behaves and this is what it does and then they got to go back and straighten up in the manufacture of the product anything that went wrong in making the product that made it fall down in qualification so that it couldnt meet the conditions which it was going to be used under do you see so this was an absolutely vital step and factory actually does miss this when they do miss this theyve had it they keep pouring out automobiles i think i think once in while the lincoln the lincoln car ofi think it was about the 58 model or the 59 modelthis was missing and they sold those things madly to important people too because it took that much to buy it and just gave themselves the worst name you ever heard of because out that thing went and its electrical connections promptly started failing all over the place it had never had any inspection on puttogether and the distributors hadnt got this step on their org board in their garages and so on out through the country so they filled up their service bays and showrooms with nonrunning lincolns you couldnt repair any lincoln because all the lincolns theyd sold had come back nothing could move on the line because the qualification step having been missing you now had the whole product unmoving even if it did go out it was rejected so they left this up to the public so the public was doing this step you see somebody had to wear the hat you follow that and inevitably somebody has to wear the hat if its missing on these things its very very amusing so thats your qualifications division and itill go into what composes it but thats the outfit that takes care of that little step and then youve got here your distribution division which is six and its very funny that we would have distribution division that sounds very weird because you have to make up your mind what were distributing and its very amusing you go over this lineupi mean the stuff ive been over here the last few weeksi say it cracked my brain i didnt want to get in the road of it spare myself just fantastic numbers of small points that would keep coming up and have to be answered like what do we as scientologists make what do we produce are weis an organization marketing scientologists and you know its not its not even vaguely an organization is simply selling scientology and you say well wait minute wait minute then what is scientology scientology is the ability to change conditions pretty interesting isnt it you got that scientology is the ability to change conditions the technology of how you change conditions thats it and weve been wearing that by changing scientology now i hate to put it into this kind of category and so forth but if we were selling soap powder and somebody said well whats this do lets say that he was bogwog out from the wogbogs andbogwalker from the middle of bogtownand he said whats this stuff do its pretty its kind of sticky to the hand and whats it do and so forth and you say it is marvelous preparation yeah he says whats it do and so forth and you say its beautiful its very beneficial he says whats it do we have to tell him eventually that it is something that changes shirts from dirty shirts to clean shirts and we would only miss if he didnt know that clean shirt was desirable and out in the public were dealing with bunch of very dirty wogs they dont know that clean shirt is desirable before something can be sold it has to be able to do something well we know lot of things scientology can do but lumpsum statement of what it can do comes back from the beginning of this channel that we go through here it can change conditions its pretty interesting because anything that could change any conditions anywhere would have to be very very well regulated group because itd tend to fly to pieces with the greatest of ease wed have to be able to be group so that we could decide amongst us what conditions were to be changed eventually and if we ourselves didnt decide this but we all went off individually changing conditions it would look pretty chaotic because the weird part of it is is weve got in our hands the universal solvent itll dissolve anything well what do we put it in well wed better put it into an organizational form and decide what were going to dissolve with it because we are the only things that could hold it nothing else could were the only things that could carry it hold it handle it or do anything else with it whats very hard for people to see then is they havent got the flakes of soap but it could be described to them very easily but youd first have to in the department of condition indicate to them that clean shirts were desirable todays man wears clean shirts you got that and do you know you have numerous agencies propagandizing just the reverse in the field of the mind be glad you have dirty mind all artistic impulses come from your dirty mind buy our dirty minds its quite remarkable but its true theres books right out there on the stands at smiths thatyou can at least order them through smithsselling you the idea of how marvelous it is to be nuts mans halfway bought the idea so weve got long way to start i remember some scientologist that was working down in the middle of africa the main point is to know where you start when you know where you start you can promptly start you get the idea some scientologist working down in the middle of africa in soil conservation so forth finally found out what was wrong with the soil conservation programis the natives to which the government was seeking to teach soil conservation didnt know that soil conservation had any value of any kind soil conservationthe preservation of their landhad to be sold to them because they were nomad tribe and they had already had solution to it every time the soil unconserved you moved and they didnt recognize they were running out of africa to move into so that had to be taught to them but that couldnt be taught to them because they were out of communication so you had to play the condition against the communication against the condition against the communication and you all of sudden got somewhere and they were able to move up the program but it was basically conditioncondition had not been seen viewed indicated felt experienced but at that level it sort of has to be by osmosis you see you havent got much communication thats what takes genius you see you havent got much communication you havent got much perception involved with the thing and yet somehow or anotherthis is what you are up against you seesomehow or another youve got to get through to the bloke that clean shirts are desirable do you follow that well its very funny to very very amusing if you come right down to it to compare scientology to box of soap but let tell you something if you were trying to sell the kohinoor diamond you had certainly better get into the marts of trade and find out how theyre purveyed just how would somebody go about selling anything do you see how would you disseminate anything how would you handle anything you would have to figure out what the lines were not in the marts of trade but just what existed amongst man youd have to be quite real otherwise youd be sitting in little island completely divorced from the rest of existencea very undesirable condition how many auditors are sitting around the world right now in little islands totally enclosed and barricaded against the world one way or the other for not being able to communicate see all youve got to do is show them how to indicateto the wog or anyonehow to indicate that condition of clean shirts is desirable see and then show them org board clean shirtpzoom and they say heyyy and you wait somebody will be rushing in to tell you i just had the damnedest idea do you know what ive just found out huh you know when you talk to people it makes difference big fourstar and now youll know what youve been trying to process see its worse than this ill tell you more about it very rapidly here but these are your divisions these are your six divisions and those six divisions add up in this particular direction if you cross any of these lines if you cross two of these lines if youve got communicationdissemination crossing i assure you that your dissemination out is going to block your communication in if you had all of your mailings for instance running only on your org despatch lines youre not going tonot going to hear from anybody so your dissemination would have been in vain now when it comes to organization if there isnt somebody holding the organization there financially mestwise its buildings and that sort of thing youre going to be in trouble thats for sure because theres going to be place to sit now that doesnt bother an ot but this organization also contains at its lefthand end raw meat and they sit down now if you dont produce anythingif you dont produce anythingand theres activity going on this thing you never wind up with anything to distribute thats obvious but here if you dont look over the qualifications of what youre distributing and so forth youll wind up with distribution either but the funny part of it is that every time you let person who trains students examine them something goes wrong one of the oldest policies we have so we cant cross those two divisions once more in this lets suppose this fellow this fellow was crossed entirely with technical you know the distribution division made up all of the product i dont think theyd distribute anything furthermore if this fellow wasnt actually distribution division and so forth he would change the product do you see so actually over here hes got to hold that product just as it is thats what he is distributing thats whats coming off the assembly line and thats what hes distributing do you see and so thats got to be held standard and distributed action now this oddly enough you couldif you understood this thing from to izzardyou could probably walk into gestetners or standard oil or something and start explaining this to some executive and thered be further executives and the vicepresidents and general managers and you would stand about eighteen ranks deep in their top officers before you stood up because they look at this stuff and they say oh my god you know oh my god yes oh yes well now whats all this oh yes you can take your own life on this org boardyou can take your own life all the this isnt completed org boardyou can take your own life and you can find out what one of your divisions is missing you personally see what one of your divisions is missing is it your dissemination division well what does dissemination add up to with you i dont know but you can reinterpret it into your own actions your organization division maybe thats missing you know everything is all chaotic or maybe your technical division your service or action or production or what youre producing maybe youre not making anything maybe youre distributing nothing that you have made dont you see your production division orwhich is about the same as your technical here this is just hobsonjobsoned over into the scientology organization dont you see but this is activity now your next one over here maybe youre not qualifying what you make maybe you dont say or maybe you dont pick it up as it comes off the line say that rings thats good one you know that rings thats good one maybe you arent qualifying anything you are doing dont you see maybe as it comes down the line you say that rings and it doesnt ring at all and you dont have any place to put it you wind up wearing nothing but bum things that dont ring and then after youve got productafter youve got productdo you know that some people dont distribute it you know they leave it right there if you ever want to see somebody get stacked up its somebody whose distribution division is out and thats pretty catastrophic now just to go over this very rapidlyand this probably really is several lectureswe got herewe got up as far as purposes and that was the level six but the rest of the lineup i will just read rapidly there is the department of the organization it takes care of financial planning it takes care of papers and that sort of thing and balance sheets and records and inventories and all that sort of thing and then youve got your department of finance our old department of accounts and so on but what is this thing department of the organization now what part of existence does it occupy well it occupies direction of course after youbut by level after youve got purposes all cared for boy can you have direction interesting isnt it and then when weve got the direction cared for why direction going in any direction requires energy or makes energy and so energy is your department of finance in an organization here and then the funny part of it is that do you know you have to apply energy to body to make the body work something in order to get activity some way or another youve got to apply your energy to something so the body of the organization is the department of materiel elementary but that holds all the buildings and places and repairs them and cleans them and cares for things and of course personnel as body is materiel not as thetan but as body theyre materiel so you have to feed them and house them and do various things like that now we get into theres missing point here which has got to be drawn inthis is estimation and do you know that anybody who engages in activity which is the next step without estimation is in hell of time did you ever try to engage in an activity without estimating just try it sometime reach for doorknobs that arent there step for step landings which are one step up from where you thought they were youre going to have an awful time very shortly so youve got to have body estimation activity and by getting body estimation activity production you determine result you dont determine product in other words after the body has actedyou see after youve estimated and its actedwhat are you going to get youre going to get result why are you going to get result youwhy dont you get product well thats the mistake people make they think that they get product they dont get product at that stage they get result you see so heres your result and now weve got to haveand this title here hobsonjobsons aroundweve got perfection or correction it could be either way but correction isnt quite it we actually have at this point review weve got to review this thing and after weve gotten through with reviewing it we then have product now weve got product and what do we do with product well you know you could have product and not do anything with it as i said before so we have to clear it and that is the wildest pun that is on this board because of course clearing really belongs clear down here thats ot but we have to have it there because that action is case because at that point we had better start clearing somebody else and thats what starts the whole thing over again so its selffeeding circular machine not flat one you follow we get our field staff member system and so forth so clearing the product we get more to clear so that of course is the department of clearing now any function which we have ever had fits rather neatly in this structure we can put it almost down with the greatest of ease theres more can be said about this it can be written up more precisely probably be able to read it for long time but the funny part of it is you can take this level this conditions communication perception orientation understandings purpose direction energy body activity production result review product clearing you can take that one brrrrrt and you can analyze whether youre doing good or bad you can take that and you can say howwhere are my activities falling down where are my activities falling down and you just take that brrrrrr and youll spot one and youll be very happy with it until the following day when you find out you hadnt paid any attention to that one and the next thing you know it has done complete analysis for you of the life you are living and what youre doing and its just as neat and if youre holding post or something of that sortdo you see that would straighten up your life if and even on life on job but if you were holding down post you weirdly enough would have to have here the departmental functions you an individual would have to have each one of the departmental functions in order to get rolling so the figure on this is six sixteen six sixteen there are six divisions there are sixteen departments and so each department then has primarily six sections with sixteen subsections each one of which now may have six divisions with sixteen subdivisions but it doesnt matter whether you have staff member department section division little unit detached out to take care of the swami bami hospital that the medical profession has just surrendered there are still stethoscopes and uncoiled bandages lying down on the front lawn from the battle that was fought there and theyve surrendered and you send little unit over to take care of this place you see youre going to be able to barely get away with it if you detach somebody from divisions one and two another somebody from divisions three and four and another somebody from divisions five and six their lines are going to jam very shortly but you could just get away with it its good temporary hitandmiss proposition but the funny part of it is you reallyto hold the placeyoure going to have to have six people there youre going to have to have division one division two division three division four division five and division six represented you will see how that works out but if youre going to hold it any length of time and so forth and if youre actually going to have going concern then youre going to have to have their proper departments underneath those divisions otherwise you start going mad and then if youre going to hold it for long time and its going to expand well then by george youre going to have to have the six subsections under each department and then if youre really going to go for broke youre going to have to add the sixteen factor underneath that in other words the whole board goes crisscross its always the same board it always expands in exactly the same direction and you have actually six divisional hats you have six divisional hats and each divisional hat knows all the departmental hats you can train anybody in on this and you can train people in with little bit on the other divisions and great deal on his own division it only gives us six hats with of course one staff member hat and that is the organization thats going to carry us along the line now itsyou say it hadnt been released well its been released weve been working on it for fifteen years and we had ball in putting this thing together and we know more about organization than we can shake stick at weve tried practically every form known to man and in putting this thing together ways we have jammed the mistakes we have made are just suddenly coming into view as exactly why they were made and so on this is going to be put together and will be released as an actual org board in the near very near future and wed put it out like this its going to have classes of orgs and that merely dependswe have solved the thing we say there are two admin members for every tech member and that is how big the organization can be you can put two admin on for every tech you put on and if you just keep that up then it gets upa certain number of people gives you certain class of org dont you seebut then you just say everybody below you and every function below you isyoure responsible for we dont say there are missing hats in this organization we say every hat below you youre responsible for every empty hat below you youre responsible for at any given time so it wouldnt matter how big the board got every hat below them dont you see weve only got one hco secretary shes got three departments under her god knows how many other things and you say see all those functions theyre yours she eventually will get somebody to handle one and the functions below that person dont you see and the functions below that so its very simple to work out who what is where and its functional board and it crisscrosses and it should work out rather smoothly be posted here by the way in matter of about thirty days in most organizations but you will see the public around taking look at it and may i recommend to you this org board may i recommend to youlook over its sixteen departmental significances with regard to your own life and look over the sixteen departments with regard to what you are doing in life and i think you are ready for lot of cognitions now you say what happens above clear well actually an ot goes through all those upper stages thank you very much
