available at httpwwwhatcheryreformus and http wwwfwsgovpacificfisherieshatcheryreviewindexhtml columbia basin salmon popula tions have declined due to number of human actions other than those of the fcrps in cluding fishing water pollution and water withdrawals for irrigation6 however the construction and operation of the fcrps has been visible cause of salmon and st eelhead mortality and population decline for decades currently 13 evolutionarily significant units esus7 of salmon and steelhead 8 in the columbia basin are listed as threatened or endangered under the esa9 actions intended to aid the recovery of these stocks generally fall into one of four categories habitat harvest hatchery and hydrosystem10 collectively these four categories are referred to as the allh strategy habitat actions focus on access to and improvement of habitat suitable for rearing of juvenile salmon nd spawning by returning dults habitat actions may provide access to previously blocked areas or create new areas suitable for rearing or spawning harvest actions focus on limiting harvest or harm to listed species through such approaches as the use of selective fishing gear and timing harvest periods to focus fishing on hatchery stocks hatchery efforts are intended to increase the number of fish through artificial propagation some assert that hatchery production reduces predator and harvest pr essures on wild fish while others are concerned that hatchery fish compete w ith wild salmon and steelhead for food and habitat hatcheries also may alter the genetic diversity of specific stocks hatchery efforts are controversial nd are currently under review11 finally hydrosystem actions are aimed at improving the survival of juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead as they migrate past dams and throug h the reservoirs they create hydrosystem actions include structural and operational changes at the dams such as the addition of juvenile bypass sy stems and surfaceoriented passage routes the collection and transportation of juveniles in barges past the dams the installationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34453crs4 12 see httpwwwnwcouncilorg

era of action ag ency salmon recovery planning biops and litigation that continues to the present the configuration and ope ration of the fcrps dams is particularly galvanizing issue between proponents of hydropower development irrigation and river navigation and those supporting commercia l sport and tribal fishing as well as environmental conser vation some actions to benef it salmon such as spilling water to help juveniles pass safely come at cost in terms of energy production such actions may affect power rates in the region14 creating an economic incentive for some consumers and hydropower supporters to oppose an increase in fish protection operations as an alternative to altering dam operations to make them more favorable to salmon some parties advocate partially or entirely removi ng four dams on the lower snake river in washington they believe this is the only way to ensure survival of the snake river salmon and steelhead us dam removal could also result in economic benefits to various fishing nd recreation interest s proponents of dam removal argue that the four lower snak river dams do not produce significant amount of power but do cause significant harm to listed species they further indicate that removal of the snake river dams would reduce federal expenditures and revitalize local economies15 opponents of dam remova l note that dam removal would only benefit 4 of th 13 listed salmon and steelhead esus in the columbia basin and the federal agencies must focu s efforts on all of the basins esus the action agencies and nmfs have stated

disputes biop litigation biop decisions and actions have been contentious since the first salmon esu was listed in 1991 after species is liste d as threatened or endangered fcrps operations that may affect it require consultation under 7 of the to determine if the listed species would be put in jeopard by those operations history of major actions and litigation is presented in table 1 less than year after nmfs issued its 1993 biop for the fcrps federa l district court invalidated it finding it arbitrary and capricious the court decisi on of may 1994 was the first in an ongoing series of court challenges most nmfs biops for the columbia and snake rivers were nullified by the courts the heart of biological opinion is the finding of jeopardy or nojeopardy that is whether an agency action will jeopardize the continued existence of species in 1994 the district court found nmfs had used misleading data when determining the baseline numbers of fish18 the number of fish harmed by the agency action could then appear to be smaller when compared to the low baseline numbers nmfs had calculated the future success of the sp ecies based on fish counts from 1984 to1990 the years between 1986 and 1990 were drought years leading to atypically low numbers of fish that according to the court skewed the data on which nmfs relied by comparison the 1992 biop had used the years 1975 to 1990 litigation based on the subsequent 1994 to 1998 biop issued in march 1994 claimed that the nmfs nojeopardy conc lusion was flawed the environmental plaintiffs argued that nmfs incorrectly relied on the program to transport juvenile salmon downstream around the dams on the co lumbia river releasing them below the bonneville dam as the basis for the species not being in jeopardy however instead of determining whether nmfs was justified in its actions the court ruled that the issuance of 1995 biop rendered the action moot19 the 1995 biop stands out for several reasons first it included jeopardy opinion second the plainti ffs were customers of th hydroelectric dams not environmentalists and third the biop wa s upheld by the court the plaintiffs claimed that the rpas found necessary by nmfs as part of the consultation process were based on inappr opriate data and failed to balance salmon protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34453crs6 20 aluminum co of america v bonneville

arbitrarily or capriciously the next biop the 2000 biop included nojeopardy opinion to reach this conclusion nmfs had first found that eight salmon esus were likely to be jeopardized by the hydroelectric plants along the columbia river and proposed rpas that would mitigate the harm thus nmfs was able to issue nojeopardy conclusion environmental plaintiffs took issue with the mitigation measures claiming that the biop was based on futu re federal actions that had not undergone 7 consultations and also on future nonf ederal offsite actions that were not reasonably certain to occur21 the 2000 biop was invalidated by the court but allowed to remain in place while nmfs prepared new one similarly the 2004 biop was remanded to nmfs but also allowed to remain in place while the agency prepared new one the litigation over the 2004 biop began in 2005 and did not conclude until 2008 in may 2005 district court granted preliminary injunction requiring certain dams to allow water to flow past spill gates rather than through turbines during the summer22 the decision also found that nmfs used the wrong method for making the nojeopardy deter mination the ninth circuit affirmed the lower court decision but remanded the action to have the district court see if the injunction c ould be more narrowly tailored23 on remand the district court again held that nmfs had incorrectly performed its biop and directed the agency to produce new one within year keeping the 2004 biop in place until the new one was developed24 the last word regarding the 2004 biop appeared to have been in april 2007 when the ninth circuit ffirmed the district courts decision that the nmfs biop violated the esa25 the court criticized the agency for not considering the aggregate effects on the species when making its jeopardy determination instead of assessing whether the listed fishes would be jeopardized by the aggregate of the proposed agency action the environmental baseline cumulative effects and current status of the spec ies nmfs segregated its analysis first evaluating whether the proposed agency action consisting of only the proposed discretionary operation of the f crps would have an appreciable net effect on species it considered additional context only if it found such an effect26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34453crs7 27 nwf v nmfs 481 f3d 1224 1235 9th cir 2007 28 nwf v nmfs 481

if the agency actions effect on fish was appreciably worse compared to recent baseline would allow the fishs environment to become incrementally worse with each agency action without finding jeopardy acco rding to the court thwarting the purpose of the esa27 where the species environmental baseline already jeopardizes species the ninth circuit held that an agency may not take action that deepens the jeopardy by causing additional harm28 the court also found fault with nmfss failure to consider the recovery needs of the species within this biop unlike earlier biops in april 2008 the ninth circuit amended its decision it did not change its holding but clarified that recent us supreme court ruling did not alter its conclusion29 the 2005 upper snake river biop was criticized for using comparative analysis rather than an aggregate anal ysis just as was done in th 2004 fcrps biop30 like the 2004 biop the 2005 snake ri ver biop was also remanded by the courts but allowed to remain in place while nmfs prepared new one as result the biops that are currently in place for both the upper snake river and the fcrps were ruled invalid under the while the biops were being finalized the

steelhead protection literally cries out for major overhaul38 the action agencies say they have made significant changes and will continue this trend thr ough 2017 with the new biop39 the action agencies suggested an rpa to nmfs which they say was developed in collaboration with state and tribal entities with stake in the outcome of the biop the agencies cite regulation40 requiring nmfs to

lawsuit claims the biop ignores the data gathered by the interior columbia basin technical recovery team multi displinary science team assembled by nmfs an environmental group released the following statement about the 2008 biop42 based on what were seeing today the agencies didnt get the message or chose to ignore it once you get past the bells and whistles its clear this plan is about little more than protecting the status quo regardless of the harm the dams do to salmon and the communities that depend upon them when biops are compared to each other chronologically the level of protective measures such as spill for juvenile passage increases over time and this holds true for the 2008 biop43 it is unclear how much of this increase is due to the series of court orders requiring add itional protective measures ve rsus increased understanding of the best management practices for salmon and steelhead recovery bpa has negotiated two moranda of agreement moa with four regional tribes to garner their support for the new biop in exchange for the bpas funding habitat and hatchery project s to benefit salmon steelhea d and other fish over the next ten years44 the new york times reports that 900 million was offered with 50 million to be paid by the army corps of engineers45 there is indication that the states environmental groups or fishing inte rests who have acted as plaintiffs were part of the settlement judge redden stated in december 2007 lette r to biop litigants that if the final biop is legally flawed he is unlikely to remand the document again but rather would vacate it46 this could leave operators of the fcrps in violation of for unauthorized take of listed species further the court also indicated that an unsatisfactory biop may result in permanent
