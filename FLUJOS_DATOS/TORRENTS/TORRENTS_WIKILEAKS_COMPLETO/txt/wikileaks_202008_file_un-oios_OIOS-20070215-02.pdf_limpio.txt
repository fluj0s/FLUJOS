executive summary in june to november 2006 oios conducted an audit f unhcrs regional support hubs rsh in ghana and kenya as well as headquarters role in monitoring and managing the rshs the audit covered the functioning of the rshs the natu re and quality of services provided the procedures and practices of the functional units at headquarters and the bureau for africa in assessing and planning the use of regional resource s the bureau has accepted most of the recommendations made and are in the process of impl ementing them overall assessment oios established that there was overall satisfactio n with the work undertaken by rshs and the regional global officers although the functioning f the rshs could be improved to ensure they are more effective and efficient in achieving their objectives as unhcr is considering outposting in the near future it is essential that the rsh lessons are learned and that clearer objectives and expectations for outposting function s be defined from the outset to allow for the measurement and evaluation of the benefits obtained oios findings and recommendations the rshs have been established in ghana and kenya while the rsh in kenya met most of the criteria for determining the location of the rs h oios found that the position of the hub in accra was less than ideal in terms of logistics nguage spoken locally as opposed to that in the region covered and presence in oios view the cost and logistics aspects may not have received proper consideration prior to determining the establishment of an rsh in accra the bureau for africa and most functional units at unhcr headquarters foresaw benefits for the rshs in terms of proximity to the operations an d the ability to react quickly in addressing areas of concern and the provision of assistance m ost functional units found tangible benefits emerging from the regional global posts although t hese could not be measured the creation of new posts at the rshs had not been preceded by needs assessment based on clear criteria of the expected added value also c onsidering changing strategic objectives and operational priorities postbypost review had n ot been regularly and systematically performed in reviewing the country coverage of each regional function there did not appear to be any consistency in given rsh nor was the coverage in line with that of the desks considering the number of countries in both regions the bureau for africa and functional units should agree on more realistic coverage based on predefined cr iteria and fully documented needs assessment involving field operations work procedures and reporting varied from one rsh t the other and interaction between the two had been limited more interaction would ensure synergies are achieved by the sharing of best practices and experiences resulting in efficie ncies and reducing the duplication of work the bureau stated that more interaction between the hubs has taken place and will continue the regional global posts should serve the bureaus strategy in their own specific field of expertise it was indicated that sometimes strategi as implemented by the regional officers conflicted with those of the bureau or that the age nda of functional units prevailed the desks identified as the principal bureau interlocutors dmitted having little input in the planning or feedback for regional functions strategic plannin g meetings with all stakeholders of respective rshs would allow for better global planning and arb itration on the rshs operational plans the bureau for africa agreed to oios recommendatio n and stated it would be taken into consideration as part of the overall strategic plan ning exercise an improved consultation process was necessary for the development of the regional global officers workplans improvements as to the develop ment of workplans by the kenya rsh were evident in 2006 an effective consultation pro cess would ensure that country operations needs were properly reflected as well as achieving buyin to the plan from the representations in response to the draft report the kenya rsh also stated that they had developed standard operating procedures which ensured that flexible w orkplans were developed in consultation with functional units desksbureau and representat ions oios suggests that the standard operating procedures be reviewed and if approved be finalised for use by both rshs for assessing the performance of regional global of ficers oios ascertained that due to multiple reporting lines there was lack of clarit and understanding regarding the chain of supervision and command some units have almost ent irely delegated the responsibility of the performance appraisal report to the hub manager on the grounds that they are not in position to judge the performance of the regional i ncumbents oios recommended that process be established to ensure there is systemati c feedback on the quality of services provided as well as clearer reporting lines for re gional global officers the kenya rsh was of the opinion that these were clear and that function units assessed function competencies with the hub manager
