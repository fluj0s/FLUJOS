fr wikileaks entame publication câbles diplomatiques us confidentiels ru wikileaks приступил к публикации секретных писем американских посольств wikileaks empieza publicar cables diplomáticos embajada unidos ar موقع ويكيليكس يبدأ باطلاق مخاطبات سرية للسفارات الامريكية more articles groups to contact for comment wikileaks began on sunday november 28th publishing 251287 leaked united states embassy cables the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain the documents will give people around the world an unprecedented insight into us government foreign activities the cables which date from 1966 up until the end of february this year contain confidential communications between 274 embassies in countries throughout the world and the state department in washington dc 15652 of the cables are classified secret the embassy cables will be released in stages over the next few months the subject matter of these cables is of such importance and the geographical spread so broad that to do otherwise would not do this material justice the cables show the extent of us spying on its allies and the turning blind eye to corruption and human rights abuse in client states backroom deals with supposedly neutral countries lobbying for us corporations and the measures us diplomats take to advance those who have access to them this document release reveals the contradictions between the uss public persona and what it says behind closed doors and shows that if citizens in democracy want their governments to reflect their wishes they should ask to see whats going on behind the scenes every american schoolchild is taught that george washington the countrys first president could not tell lie if the administrations of his successors lived up to the same principle todays document flood would be mere embarrassment instead the us government has been warning governments even the most corrupt around the world about the coming leaks and is bracing itself for the exposures the full set consists of 251287 documents comprising 261276536 words seven times the size of the iraq war logs the worlds previously largest classified information release the cables cover from 28th december 1966 to 28th february 2010 and originate from 274 embassies consulates and diplomatic missions how to explore the data search for events that you remember that happened
