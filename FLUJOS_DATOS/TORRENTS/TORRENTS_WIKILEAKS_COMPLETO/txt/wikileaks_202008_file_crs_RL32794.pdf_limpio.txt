reports an omnibus biennial primary expense resolution to cover the expenses of each standing and select committee except the appropriations committee1 the resolution is based in part on committee requests for funds to cover their necessary expenses for the two years of congress the budgetary requests include estimated salary needs for staff costs of consulting services printing costs office equipment and supply costs and travel costs for committee members and staff some costs such as pension and insurance contributions for committee employees are paid from other appropriated funds and are excluded from committee budgets some committees discuss and approve their proposed budgets at committee organization meetings some committees do not prepare or approve their draft budgets this way committee chairs normally introduce house resolutions to provide their committees with the requisite funds for the two years of the congress these individual resolutions are then referred to the house administration committee which holds public hearings on each committees request the chair and the ranking minority member from each committee normally testify at these hearings 2 the chair of the house administration committee then typically introduces an omnibus funding resolution which after its referral to the house administration committee typically serves as the legislative vehicle for full committee markup since 1995 the committee funding resolution has been considered by the house 1 as privileged matter3 2 subject to an order adopted by the house by unanimous consent4 3 under suspension of the rules5 or 4 by rule from the rules committee6 each approach to authorizing consideration has provided one hour of debate equally divided between the majority and minority at the end of the debate the majority party manager moves the previous question and if agreed to the house votes on final passage of the resolution due to bipartisan consensus on committee funding resolutions the house minority has not offered motion to recommit 7 since the 106th congress tables 1 through 7 provide committee funding requests and authorizations in nominal dollars for house committees in the
