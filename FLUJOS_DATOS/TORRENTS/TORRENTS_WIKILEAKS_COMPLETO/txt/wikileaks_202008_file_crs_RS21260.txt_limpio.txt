requirements this report will be revised as congressional action requires background previous to the current focus on homeland security congressional policymakers have frequently expressed strong interest in government reform and improved management of public resources and they have acted to improve several areas of government management some examples of congressional action over the last several years include the chief financial officers cfo act of 1990 the government performance and results act gpra of 19931 the federal acquisition streamlining act fasa of 1994 1 see also crs report

the federal acquisition reform act fara of 1996 and the information management and reform act itmra of 19962 year after passage fara and itmra were renamed the clingercohen act of 1996 in the fy1997 omnibus consolidated appropriations act pl 104208 since 1997 the provisions of the clingercohen act have served as the primary statutory basis for federal information technology management issues among the major provisions of the clingercohen act are the establishment of departmentlevel chief information officers the elimination of the general service administrations primary role in setting policy and regulation for federal information technology procurementacquisition the deployment of information security practices and the establishment of two pilot programs to test alternative acquisition approaches sharein savings and solutionsbased contracting3 the ongoing interest in homeland security issues has brought further attention to government information technology management information technology has been cited not only as means to more efficiently manage an agencys internal operations but also to facilitate activities such as information sharing among departments as well as between httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21260 federal state and local government4 consequently some provisions were included in the homeland security act of 2002 that position information technology management practices as means to achieve homeland security goals department of homeland security in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress passed legislation to create department for homeland security while pl 107296 contains many provisions the overall intent of the law is to provide for the consolidation and coordination of federal government programs and activities to combat terrorism the role of information technology figures prominently in the homeland security act of 2002 however most of the references to information technology in pl 107296 are used to delineate the departments role as facilitator of standards leader in establishing priorities for research and procurement and provider of advice and information to other departments in the area of homeland security applications for example section 301 includes provisions for directorate of science and technology generally these provisions call for developing system for sharing key homeland 2 fara and itmra were passed as sections d and respectively of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 pl 104106 3 for additional information regarding the clingercohen

emergency preparedness and response directs the department to develop comprehensive programs for developing interoperative communications technology and helping to ensure that emergency response providers acquire such technology following from the departments mission to coordinate and lead efforts to reduce the vulnerability of the united state to terrorism these provisions are primarily focused on external information management ie the departments interactions with other departments and agencies rather than explicitly describing or defining the departments management of its own information technology resources however significant challenge for the department at its outset was to absorb the programs personnel and objectives then residing in other agencies to that end some provisions regarding departmentlevel internal information technology management were included and are discussed in relation to the clingercohen act below the clingercohen act and homeland security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21260 the clingercohen act currently serves as the primary legislative guidance for most executive departments and agencies regarding information technology management where the homeland security act is silent it is anticipated that the relevant provisions of the clingercohen act will apply to the department of homeland security however there are some provisions in the homeland security act that explicitly outline information technology management practices for the new department which are in contrast to those followed by most other departments these differences could be relevant to oversight efforts as congress continues to evaluate the implementation of the homeland security act chief information officer section 5125 subtitle title li of the clinger cohen act mandates the creation of cio in each federal agency the duties of the cio as described in the act are to provide information management advice and policy to the agency head develop maintain and facilitate information systems and evaluate assess and report to the agency head on the progress made developing agency information technology systems appointment and reporting requirements of the chief information officer pl 107296 includes provision for the establishment of departmentlevel chief information officer section 103 stipulates that the cio will be appointed by the president this contrasts with the clingercohen act under which departmentlevel cios are appointed by their respective department secretaries the cio of department is an executive level iv position the office of management and budget omb memorandum m9620 implementation of the information technology management act of 1996 the omb guidelines for implementation of the clingercohen act states that each agency head is expected to select and position cio to ensure the effective acquisition and use of it and to carry out the agencys information resources management responsibilities5 however omb memorandum m9620 has been superceded by omb circular a130 which is silent on this issue 5 see httpwwwwhitehousegovombmemorandam9620html crs4 section 703 also states that the departmentlevel cio is to report to the secretary of homeland security or some other official the secretary designates the clingercohen act stipulates that departmentlevel cios are to report directly to their respective department secretaries overlapping information technology management responsibilities although section 703 establishes departmentlevel cio for the new department section 701 also includes provisions making the under secretary for management responsible for management and administration of the new departments information technology and communications systems it is unclear how the overlapping responsibilities for information technology systems between the departmentlevel cio and the under secretary are mediated in practice however both the dhs inspector general ig and the government accountability office gao have released reports critical of dhs it management structures and practices among the problems they identified both organizations highlighted the lack of centralized authority over it assets and personnel as significant weakness of the dhs cio position6 congress may choose to address this issue in part by approving fy2006 budget for dhs that emphasizes initiatives and management structures that centralize control over it resources within the office of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21260 dhs cio7 national security exemptions subtitle national security systems of the clingercohen act states that most of the provisions of the law do not apply to national security systems8 national security systems are defined as those which involve intelligence activities cryptography command and control weapon systems or other information systems used in carrying out the defense of the nation generally this provision in the act was included to give those agencies that handle classified and sensitive information greater flexibility in how they acquire and procure information technology the department of homeland security includes some of the activities described in subtitle to that end the homeland security act does provide some exemptions similar to those provided in the clingercohen act section 3533 exempts national security systems from oversight by the director of omb for the development and implementation of information security standards section 3538 goes on to state that nothing in this act including any amendment made by this act shall supersede any authority of the secretary of defense the director of central intelligence or other agency head as authorized by law and as directed by the president with regard to the operation control or management of national security systems as defined by section 35323 of title 44 united states code at this time it is still unclear whether the departments evolving 6 department of homeland security office of the inspector
