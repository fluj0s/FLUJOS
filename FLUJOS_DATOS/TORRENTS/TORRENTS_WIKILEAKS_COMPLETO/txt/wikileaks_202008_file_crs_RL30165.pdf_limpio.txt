lower federal court decision which had held the free exercise clause of the first amendment to be violated by provision in state constitution barring state scholarship from being used for theological major at religious college such religious use provisions exist in number of state constitutions and have become the focus of number of suits in the wa ke of the supreme courts 2002 decision in zelman v simmonsharris i n zelman the court by 54 margin upheld the constitutionality under the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment of school voucher program that gave ition assistance to poor children in failing public schools in cleveland to enable th em to attend private schools in the city notwithstanding that most of the schools were religious in nature in so doing the court substantially loosened the constrai nts that previously applied to voucher programs under the establishment clause and shifted the ttention of voucher advocates and opponents to state constitutiona l provisions that have been or might be construed to prohi bit such programs supreme court decisions prior to zelman had evaluated the constitutionality of voucher programs primarily on the basis of whether the recipients of the vouchers had genuine choice among secular and relig ious options about where to use them if the available educational choices were predominantly religious in nature the court held the program to violate the establishment clause if there were number of secular as well as religious options available the court held the programs to meet constitutional requirements in zelman the court substantially loosened this genuine choice criterion by holding that the availa ble universe of choice includes not only the private schools where the vouchers themselv can be redeemed but also the full range of public school options available to parents following zelman legal questions remained with respect to the effect of the more strict churchstate provisions of some state constitutions and whether those state limitations are consistent with either the free exercise or equal protection clauses of the us constitution as noted the supreme court addressed this issue in locke v davey and found that washington states exclusion of the pursuit of devotional theology degree from its otherwis inclusive scholarship aid program did not violate the free exercise clause

provide assistance in the form of education vouchers or tax assistance to help some or all parents send their children to private schools including sectarian institutions s been recurring and politically charged issue at both the federal and state levels for at least the past two decades key issue in the deba tes on educational vouchers1 has been whether the inclusion of sectarian schools in the unive rse of schools which students might attend violates the part of the first amendment to the constitution providing that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion 2 in number of decisions between 1973 and 1993 addressi ng the constitutionality of programs indirectly aiding religious schools committee for public education v nyquist sloan v lemon mueller v allen witters v washington department of social services for the blind and zobrest v catalina foothills public schools the supreme court had seemed to suggest that voucher program would pass constitutional muster only if its benefits were made available on religionneutral basis and if the initial beneficiaries had genuine choice between secular and religious schools about where to use the assi stance however these criteria were not wholly transparent and as consequen ce state and lower federal courts that subsequently wrestled with the issue often reached contradictory results in the past decade for instance conflicting judicial decisions were handed down on the constitutionality of partic ular voucher and voucherrela ted programs under the establishment clause in the states of wisconsin arizona maine and ohio the us supreme court repeatedly bypa ssed opportunities to review these state and lower court decisions bu t on june 27 2002 the court in zelman v simmons harris3 resolved most

us 756 780 1973the voucher children 96 attended thos schools in so doing the court substantially loosened the strictures the establishment clause had previously been construed to place on public aid to religious institutions as consequence attention has now sh ifted to the provisions of number of state constitutions which have been c onstrued to prohibit voucher programs sometimes called little blaine amendments see infra n 51 these state constitutional provisions are worded in various ways and are seemingly more strict than the establishment of religion clause indeed voucher programs in florida vermont and washington have been held to violate such provisions but voucher advocates contend that these provisions violate the free exer cise of religion and equal protection clauses of the us constitution the supreme court addressed the issue of these types of state constitutional provisions during the october 2003 term ea rlier us court of appeals for the ninth circuit had held the free exercise clau to be violated by provision of the washington constitution which had been construed to bar student from using state scholarship to pursue degree in theology at religious school4 on february 25 2004 the supreme court reversed the lower courts decision holding that washington states exclusion of the pursu it of devotional theology degree from its otherwise inclusive scholarship aid progra m did not violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment5 the following sections summarize the standards articulated by the supreme court under the establishment of religion cl ause for public aid programs that provide assistance directly to sectarian schools and other religious entities and in greater detail and with special attention to zelman for programs that provide assistance to sectarian schools indirectly ie by means of voucher and tax bene fit programs the report also summarizes locke v davey and other selected cases involving the constitutionality of state restrictions on voucher programs this report will be updated as events warrant direct aid basic tenet of the supreme courts interpretation of the establishment clause is that the clause absolutely prohibit s governmentfinanced or government sponsored indoctrination into the belie fs of particular religious faith6 thus the court has held that public assistance which flows directly to religious institutions in the form of grants or cooperative agreemen ts must be limited to aid that is secular neutral and nonideological7 that is under the establishment clause government can provide direct support to secular prog rams and services sponsored or provided by religious entities but it ca nnot directly subsidize such organizations religioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs3 8 in most of the cases involving aid to religious institutions the court has used what is known as the lemon test to determine whether particular aid program violates the establishment clause first the statute must have secular legislative purpose second its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion finally the statute must not foster an excessive enta nglement with religion lemon v kurtzman 403 us 602 61213 1971 the secular purpose prong of this test has rarely posed an obstacle to public aid programs benefiting priv ate sectarian schools but the primary effect and entanglement prongs have operated in ch ief justice rehnquists term as catch22 for such programs under the primary effect test direct aid program benefiting religious schools which is not limited to secular use has generally been held unconstitutional because the aid can be used for the schools religious activities and proselytizing but if direct program is limited to secular use it has often still foundered on the excessive entanglement test because the court has held the government s monitoring of the secular use restriction to intrude it too much into the affairs of th religious schools see lemon v kurtzman supra the court has for some time been shar ply divided on the utility and applicability of the tripartite test and particularly of the tanglement prong nonetheless the court still uses the lemon test and although it is longer the only test the court uses in establishment clause cases the court reaffirm ed its applicability in its most recent school aid cases the court has however made both th primary effect and entanglement tests less stringent the primary requirements now are that the aid itself be secular in nature that it be distributed on religiously neutral basis th at it not subsidize religious indoctrination and that it not lead to excessive entanglement see agostini v felton 521 us 203 1997 and mitchell v helms 530 us 793 2000 9 mitchell v helms 530 us 793

unconstitutional and wolman v walter 433 us 229 public subsidy of field trip transportation fo r children attending sectarian schools held unconstitutionalactivities or proselytizing8 direct assistance the cour t has held cannot be used for religious indoctrination9 thus religious schools and other entities are not automatically disqualified from participating in direct p ublic aid programs but th noreligiousindoctrination restriction on such aid means that relig ious organizations secular functions and activities must be separable from its religious functions and activities as consequence of that requirement the cour t until recently had held that pervasively sectarian entities ie entities so permeated by religious purpose and character that their secular functions and religious func tions are inextricably intertwined were generally ineligible to receive direct government assistance10 that construction of the establishment clause was particular obstacle for direct aid to religious elementary and secondary schools because the court generally deemed such schools to fall within the pervasively sectarian category11 for other entities such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs4 12 see eg bradfield v roberts 175 us 291 1899 public grant to catholic hospital to provide medical care to the poor upheld t ilton v richardson 403 us 672 1971

affiliated agencies to provide pregnancy prevention and care services to adolescents upheld 13 agostini v felton supra and mitchell v helms supra 14 in both agostini v felton supra and mitchell v helms supra the court upheld the aid programs in question as constitutional on the basis not only that the aid was secular in nature made available on religionneutral basis and barred from use for purposes of religious indoctrination but also that it wa s subject to other statutory and regulatory restrictions in agostini the court noted that the aid program did not result in any government funds actually reaching religious schools coffers and that it supplemented rather than supplanted school expenditures similarly in mitchell the concurring and decisive opinion of justice connor noted that the aid prog ram had not only the foregoing characteristics but also that there was evid ence that aid had actually been diverted to religious use and that there were number of state and local monitoring activities to guard against that possibility it also seemed importa nt in mitchell that the direct aid in question was of an inkind nature educational mate rials and equipment there was majority opinion in that case but the three opinions filed all expressed doubt about the constitutionality of direct money grants to perv asively sectarian institutions in any event both agostini and mitchell held such additional factors as those cited along with the nature of the aid its mode of distribution and the pr ohibition on its use for religious indoctrination to be sufficient to render the program constitutional alt hough it specifically refrained from saying the additional factors were constitutionally necessaryreligiously affiliated hospitals social welfare agencies and colleges the court presumed to the contrary nd consequently allowed gr eater degree of direct aid12 but the court has recently abandoned th at presumption regarding sectarian elementary and secondary schools13 pervasive sectarianism in other words is longer constitutionally preclusive criterion for direct aid to such entities the basic constitutional standards gove rning direct public assist ance to religious entities including schools now appear to be that the aid must be secular neutral and nonideological in nature distributed on religionneutral basis not be used for religious indoctrination nd not precipitate excessi ve entanglement between government and the in stitution bene fitted alt hough the court has left open the possibility that other asyetunspecified constitutional require ments may exist as well14 indirect aid public aid that is received only indirectly by sectarian institutions ie assistance that is received initially by pa rty other than the religious entity itself in such forms as tax benefits or vouchers has on the other hand been given greater leeway by the court such programs still must be religiously neutral in their design and have been held unconstitutional by the court where their structure has virtually guaranteed that the assistance flows largel to pervasively sectarian elementary and secondary schools however where the sign of the programs has not dictated where the assistance is channeled but has given genuine private choice betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs5 15 413 us 825 1973 16 committee for public education v nyquist supra at 783 17

held the prog rams to be constitutional even though pervasively sectarian institutions have be nefited moreover in the recent decision of zelman v simmonsharris supra the court legitimate d most school voucher programs by holding that for constitutional purposes the universe of choices available to voucher recipients is not limited to the entities where the vouchers can be used but includes the full range of edu cational choices available to them ie voucher program can be constitu tional even if most of the private schools where they can be redeemed are religious in nature 1 precursors to zelman v simmonsharris prior to its decision on june 27 2002 in zelman v simmonsharris supra the court had handed down seven decisions relevant to the question of the constitutional parameters governing indirect assistance in two decisions par ticular programs of i ndirect assistance were struck down in five others pa rticular progra ms were upheld in committee for public education v nyquist supra and sloan v lemon15 in 1973 the court found tax benef it and tuition grant programs that were available only to children attending private elementary and secondary school s to have primary effect of advancing religi on and thus to violate the establishment clause in nyquist state tuition grant program provided sp ecified amounts of tuition reimbursement to lowincome parents of children who incurred tuition costs in sending their children to private elementary or secondary school while in sloan tuition reimbursements were provided to all parents who incurred tuition cost s in sending their children to such schools in additi on related program in nyquist permitted higherincome parents of children attending such schools to take an amount specified in the statute as tax deduction for each attendee wit hout regard to the parents actual expenditures the specified deduction gradually declined as income increased in both cases the court found that most of the private schools attended were religiously affiliate d 8590 that those schools were pervasively sectarian in nature and that the aid was not limited to secular use either by its nature or by statutory restriction as consequence it concluded that the effect of the aid is unmistakably to provide desired financial support for nonpublic sectarian institutions16 in both instances it said in nyquist the money involved represents charge made upon the state for th purposes of religious education17 rather than providing per immunity from constitutional challenge the court said the fact that the aid is disbursed to parents rather than to the schools is only one among many factors to be considered18 in these cases the tuition grant and tax subsidy programs the court asserted were bot h an encouragement to parents to send their children to nonpublic mostly religious schools and rewa rd for doing so moreover it said to allow the factor that the aid was disbursed to the parents rather

case involving some form of public assistance eg scholarships made ava ilable generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian or pub licnonpublic nature of th institution benefited20 several subsequent cases presented the court with precisely that kind of public assistance and in each instance the c ourt found the program in question to be constitutional in the process it refined the criteria governing the constitutionality of indirect aid programs mueller v allen21 concerned minnesota tax duction given to the parents of all elementary and secondary schoolchildren both public and private for variety of educational expenses incl uding private school ition witters v washington department of services for the blind22 involved vocational rehabilitation grant by washington to blind

education act24 for deaf student atte nding sectarian secondary school similar assistance was available to disabled st udents in public schools and nonsectarian private schools the court he ld all three forms of assistance not to violate the establishment clause the court differentiated the tax benefit program in mueller from the one it had held unconstitutional in nyquist by emphasizing that it was genuine tax deduction and that the deduction is available for educational expenses incurred by all parents including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private school s or sectarian private schools25 the court further stressed that any aid received by sectarian schools in minnesota became available only as result of numerous private choices of individual parentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs7 26 id at 399 27 id at 401 28 witters v washington department of services for the blind supra at 487 29 id at 488 30 id 31 id notwithstanding the unanimity of the decisi on five of the justices authored or joined in concurring opinions that disclaimed the constitutional significance of the amount of aid that ended up in the coffers of religious sc hools justice marshall who wrote the opinion of the court in this case cited the absence of any evidence that any significant portion of the aid expended will end up flowing to religious institutions as an additional factor supporting the programs constitutionality but all of the concurring opinions stressed instead that this case was controlled by the courts decision in mueller v allen supra for the reason that state programs that are wholly neutral in offering educational assistance to class defined without reference to religion do not violate the second prong of the lemon v kurtzman test because any aid to religion results from the private choices of individual beneficiaries witters supra at 491 powell j concurring they placed reliance on the factor of the substantiality of the aid fl owing to religious institutions cited by justice marshall justice marshall it might be noted had been one of the dissenters in mueller and made virtually reference to that case in his opinion for the court in witters of schoolage children26 moreover it rejected the argument that the tax deduction was unconstitutional because it disproportionately benefited religi ous institutions parents of children attending private schools most of which were religious could deduct tuition while parents of public school children c ould not and thus it was contended the tax deduction served primarily to subsidize attendance at such schools the court said that it would be loath to adopt rule grounding the constitutiona lity of facially neutral law on nnual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law27 the decision was 54 in witters unanimous decision the court again emphasized that in the vocational rehabilitation program any ai d provided is made available without regard to the sectariannonsectarian or public nonpublic nature of the institution benefited and that any aid provided that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients28 the program the court stated di d not have the purpose of providing support for nonpublic sectarian institutions created financial incentive for students to undertake religious education and gave recipients full opportunity to expend vocational rehabilitation ai d on wholly secular education29 in this case the court found the fact that the aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual not by the state30 finally the court concluded there was evidence that any significant portion of the aid expended under the washington program as whole will end up flowing to religious education31 finally in zobrest it underscored that the program at issue was general government program that distributes bene fits neutrally to any child qualifying as handicapped under the idea without re gard to the

governmentpaid interpreter will be present in sectaria n school only as result of the private decisions of individual parents32 the idea the court said creates financial incentive for parents to choose sectar ian school and as consequence it concluded an interpreters presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking33 as in mueller the courts decision was 54 in addition to these full decisions subsequent to nyquist and sloan the court also summarily affirmed two lower federa l court rulings upholding education grants to college students including those attendi ng religious colleges that helped them defray the cost of attendance both smith v board of governors of the university of north carolina34 and americans united for the separation of church and state v blanton35 involved the federal state student incen tive grant program36 under that program the federal government makes matching grants to the states to subsidize scholarship grants to underg raduate students on the basi s of substan tial financial need both north carolina and tennessee allowed the grants to be used at public and private colleges including religiously affiliated colleges in addition north carolina but not tennessee barred the grants from being used to train for religious vocation in both instances the programs we re held not to violate the establishment clause by threejudge federal district courts and the s upreme court summarily affirmed the district cour ts reasoned that the scholarship grant programs did not directly aid the sectarian purposes and activities of the religiously affiliated colleges attended by some of the students but did so only incidentally as the result of the choices of the students and their parents in summarily affirming these decisions of course the supreme court adopted only the lower courts conclusions regarding the constitutionality of the programs and not their reasoning thus prior to zelman the critical elements distinguishing indirect assistance programs that were held constituti onal from those struck down under the establishment clause appear to have been that the purpose of the programs was not to provide aid to sectarian schools that th initial recipients of the vouchers or other benefits were not selected on religious basis and that they had genuine choice about whether to apply the vouchers or othe r assistance to education at religious or secular schools in other words if th government designed voucher program so that the initial beneficiaries were selected on the basis of religious criterion or related proxy such as enro llment in private elementary or secondary schools most of which were sectarian or if the uni verse of choices available to the initial beneficiaries was dominated by sectarian schools the court would hold the program unconstitutional on the grounds it had primary effect of advancin g religion but if the class of initial benefici aries included public as well as private schoolchildren andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs9 37 the court gave little discussion and apparent reliance to the entanglement aspect of the lemon test in these cases it addressed the issue only in mueller and there it found the tax benefit program not to precipitate any ex cessive entanglement between the government and the religious institutions that ultimately benefited from the program in general the court has not found excessive entanglement to exist except where secular use restriction on direct public aid program has required the government to engage in comprehensive discriminating and continuingsurveillance of publicly funded activities on the premises of pervasively sectarian institutions see eg lemon v kurtzman supra and meek v pittenger 421 us 349 1975 but the court has held such secular use restrictions and the consequent close monitoring not to be cons titutionally necessary in indirect assistance programs in addition even in direct aid pr ograms the court has recently deemphasized the risk that religious institutions receiving public aid will use the aid for religious purposes and as consequence has deemphasized the need for intrusive government monitoring of the institutions use of the aid see mitchell v helms supra 38 witters v washington department of services for the blind supra at 49091 powell j concurring 39 536 us 639 2002their parents and if they had genuine choice among religious and secular schools about where to use the assistance the court would hold the program not to have an unconstitutional primary effect of advancing religion ev though religious schools benefited and sometimes dispr oportionately37 justice powell seemed to capture the critical factors governing the constitutionality of indirect aid programs prior to zelman in his concurring opinion in witters mueller makes the answer clear state programs that are wholly neutral in offering educational assistance to cla ss defined without reference to religion do not violate the second part of the lemon v kurtzman test because any aid to religion results from the private choices of individual beneficiaries thus in mueller we sustained tax deduction for certain educational expenses even though the great majority of beneficiaries were parents of children attending sectarian schools we noted the states traditional broad taxing authority but the decision rested principally on two ot her factors first the deduction was equally available to parents of public school children and parents of children attending private schools second any benefit to religion resulted from the numerous private choices of indivi dual parents of schoolage children38 2 zelman v simmonsharris39 in zelman v simmonsharris as noted above the court upheld as c onstitutional the ohio pilot scholarship program that program had been enacted in partial respons to 1995 federal district court decision directing the state to take control of cl evelands failing public schools the program had two components the main compone nt provided scholarsh ips to families with children in grades k8 in clevelands public schools to enable those who chose to do so to send

court both the federal district court and on appeal the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit held the program to violate the establishment clause41 the sixth circuit said nyquist governs our result although the program invited public schools outside of cleveland to participate the court stated none had chosen to do so moreover it said that the low level of the scholarship amount 2500 limited the ability of nonsectarian sc hools to participate in the program but encouraged sectarian schools to do so because the latter often had lower tuition needs as consequence it said the choice afforded the public and private school participants in the program was illus ory and the program clearly has the impermissible effect of pr omoting sectarian schools we find that when as here the

circuit and upheld the scholarship program as constitutional 5442 chief justice rehnquist writing for the court said that there was dispute that the pilot scholarship program served the valid secular purpose of providing edu cational assistance to poor children in demonstrably failing public school system the key question he stated was whether it had the forbidden effect of dvancing or inhibiting religion and the pertinent criteria for that stion he said had been established in three prior cases involving indirect assistan ce to sectarian schools mueller v allen witters v washington department of services for the blind and zobrest v catalina foothills school district in each of these cases he asserted the court had asked whether the aid was distributed to the initial recipients on religionneutral basis and whether those beneficiaries had true private choice about whether to use the aid at religious or secular schools mueller witters and zobrest make clear that where government aid program is neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance directly to broad class of citizens who in turn direct go vernment aid to religious schools wholly as result of their own genuine and i ndependent private choice the program is not readily subject to challenge under the establishment clause43 applying these criteria to the cleveland program the court held the pilot scholarship program to provi educational assistance di rectly to broad class of individuals defined w ithout reference to re ligion ie any parent of schoolage child who resides in the cleveland school dist rict with preference given lowincome families44 it held as well that the program challenged here is program of true private choice45 the latter ruling was the most controversial aspect of the decision and major reason for the dissent by four justices in all of its prior cases concerning indirect assistance the court had analyzed the choice issue within the context of the challenged program ie it had asked whether the initial recipients of the aid had broad and unfettered choice among number of religious and secular options about where to use the aid in zelman the court broadened its analysis of the options available to include not only where the schol arships themselves could be used ie private schools in cleveland most of which were religious but all of the educational alternatives available to parents the chief justice statedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs12 46 id at 651 47 id 48 id at 665 souter j dissentingthere is evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for cleveland parents to select secula r educational options for their schoolage children cleveland schoolchildren enjoy range of educational choices they may remain in public school as before remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid obtain scholarship and choose religious sc hool obtain scholarship and choose nonreligious private school enroll in community school or enroll in magnet school that 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as violation of the establishment clause the establishment clause question is whether ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools and that question must be answered by evaluating all of the options ohio provides cleveland schoolchildren only one of which is to obtain program scholarship and then choose religious school46 consequently the chief jus tice concluded for the court the ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion it provides benefits directly to wide spectrum of individuals defined only by financial need and residence in particular school district it permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options pub lic and private secular and religious the program is therefore program of true private choice in keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs we hold that the program does not offend the establishment clause47 in dissent justice souter joined by justices stevens ginsburg and breyer termed the courts decision dramatic departure from basic establishment clause principles that reduced th criteria for evaluating the constitutionality of voucher program to verbal forma lism and undermined every objective supposed to be served by the establishment clause in particular he charged the courts analysis of the choice issue ignores the reason for having privat choice enquiry in the first place that enquiry properly asks he sa id whether the parent or student that initially receives the public aid is free to ch annel it in either secular or religious direction but the majority eliminated th utility of that enquiry he claimed by bringing into the equation public spendi ng on public magnet and community schools that goes through private hands and could never reach religious school under any circumstance if choice is present whenever there is any educational alternative to the religious school to which vouchers can be endorsed then there will always be choice and the voucher can always be constitutional even in system in which there is not single private secular school as an alternative to the religious school48 justice souter further asse rted that by allowing substantial amounts of tax money to be used to systematically unde rwrite religious prac tice and indoctrination the courts decision undermined the thr ee major purposes of the establishmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs13 49 id at 670 50 id at 652clause he claimed such aid violates respect for freedom of conscience by compelling individuals to subsidize religious instruction contrary to their own beliefs compromises the integrity and independence of religious institutions by inevitably bringing government regulation in its wake and threatens social conflict along religious lines as religious sects begin to compete for public subsidies and religious differences become the subject of public debate the reality justice souter concluded is that in the matter of educational aid the establishment clause has largely been read away49 3 current standards in sum then the supreme court now interprets the establishment of religion clause to pl ace only limited restraints on voucher programs that indirectly benefit sectarian schools since nyquist it has consistently asked whether such programs serve secular purpose and whether they have primary effect of advancing religi on and under the latter test it has consistently asked whether the aid is distributed to its initial beneficiaries on religiously neutral basis and whether the initial beneficiaries have genuine choice among religious and secular options in using the aid but zelman makes clear that the court longer examines the choice issue in terms of the range of options where the voucher aid itself can be used instead the court now analyzes whether the initial beneficiaries have genuine noncoerced choice among re ligious and secular options by looking at all of the educational options available given that universe of choice justice souters charge that zelman legitimates voucher pr ograms even in systems in which there is not single private secular school as an alternative to religious school may well be true moreover to the extent that any doubt still existed zelman makes clear that the amount of aid that finds its way to relig ious schools in voucher program is of constitutional relevance that conclusion seemed first to be adopted by the court in mueller and was then affirmed by five ju stices in concurring opinions in witters the majority in zelman reiterated the point the constitutiona lity of neutral educational aid program simp ly does not turn on whether and why most recipients choose to use the aid at religious school50 voucher programs that are adopted fo r the purpose of providing financial assistance to private religious schools or that confine their benefits exclusively to the parents of children already in pr ivate religious schools as in nyquist may still be unconstitutional under the courts current standards but zelman seems to make clear that few other establishment clause inhibitions now apply to such programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs14 51 in 1875 rep james blaine rme proposed an amendment to the us constitution to make the religion clauses of the first amendmen t applicable to the states and to bar public funds from being made available to private sectarian schools as follows state shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof nd money raised by taxation in any state for the support of public schools or derived from any public fund therefor nor any public lands devoted thereto shall ever be under the control of any religious sect nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations the proposal occurred at time of heated deba about the conduct of religious exercises in the public schools and demands for the public funding of private catholic schools and in political atmosphere which was often virulently anticatholic modified version of the blaine amendment was adopted by the house but different version failed to receive the necessary twothirds majority in the senate in 1876 nonetheless similar noaid provisions were added to or were already part of the constitutions of several states and congress also subsequently required number of territories newly admitted as states to include such provisions in their constitutions as cond ition of statehood it is these little

devotional theology degree from its otherwise inclusive scholarship aid progra m did not violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment the court rejected daveys argument that the program was presumptively unconstitutional because it is not facially neutral with respect to religion60 daveys claim was based on the courts decision in church of lukumi babalu aye inc v hiaheah where the court determined that city ordinance making it crime to engage in certain types of animal slaughter violated the free exercise rights of those who practice the santeria religion61 the court distinguished the present case from lukumi and others in that line of cases by noting that the state law in question imposed civil or criminal penalties on any type of religious service or rite nor did it require the st udent to choose between their religious beliefs and receipt of government benefit62 the court went on to note that the pr omise scholarship program went long way toward including religion in its benefits by allowing students to attend pervasively religious schools so long as they are accredited and allowing students to take devotional theology courses63 without any evidence to suggest animus towards religion there existed presumption of unconstitutionality64 the court found that since the states interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional

directly or indirectly in ai d of any church sect or relig ious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution66 the osp enacted in 1999 makes students in public schools graded by the state as failing eligible for vouchers to pay for their enrollment in private schools including sectarian schools or other higherrated public schools for the initial three year s of the program only two elementary schools in excambia county we re deemed to be failing and only 57 students opted to accept vouchers fiftythree of the st udents enrolled in four sectarian private schools while the other four enrolled in nonsectarian private school for the 2002 2003 school year ten public sc hools have been rated as failing and several hundred students have reportedl applied for vouchers soon after the osp was first enacted in 1999 two suits were filed challenging the constitutionality of the program under both the state and federal constitutions on march 14 2000 the circuit court for on county after consolidating the cases and addressing only one of the constitutional claims held the osp to violate art ix 1 of the florida constitution67 which states that it is the paramount duty of the stat to make adequate provision for the education of all children residing within its borders adequate provision shall be made by law for uniform efficient safe secure and high quality system of free public schools that allows students to obtain high quality education and for the establishment maintenance and opera tion of institutions of higher learning and other public education programs that the needs of the people may require the trial court said that this section prescribes both the objective of making adequate provision for the education of all children within the state and the exclusive manner in which that duty is to be accomplished namely by means of uniform efficient safe secure and high quality system of free public schools httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30165crs18 68 bush v

alternative article ix 1 it said mandates that the state make ad equate provision for the education of all children in florida but the appellate court held that it does not prescribe an exclusive means section 1 does not lterably hitch the requirement to make adequate provision for education to sing specified engine that being the public school system in support of that conc lusion the court emphasized that art ix 1 did not explicitly bar tuition subsidies or explicitly direct that its mandate could be carried out only by means of public school s it further noted that prior judicial decisions had held findings of implicit prohibitions in the constitution to be generally disfavored and that the legislature had in the past provided subsidies for certain exceptional students to attend private sc hools when the public schools lacked the necessary facilities or personne l consequently the appe llate court overturned the trial courts decision on this issue and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the additional constitutional cl aims that had been raised against the program under other provisions of the fl orida constitution and the establishment clause on april 24 2001 the florida supreme court refused to hear an appeal of this decision69 on remand and after the us supreme court decision in zelman the plaintiffs in the suit abandoned their establishmen t clause claim and concentrated their arguments on article i 3 of the florid constitution as noted above that clause bars public revenue from ever being used dir ectly or indirectly in aid of any church sect or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution on august 5 2002 the circuit court held the osp to viol ate that clause although empathizing with the purpose of the legislation judge davey said that he could not abandon the clear mandate of the people as enunciated in the constitu tion the directive he stated was clear and unambiguous pub lic aid may be pr ovided to religious institutions to accept the argument that the state did not provide any funds to sectarian schools under the osp because pa rents made the choice of what schools their children would attend he asserted would represent colossal triumph of form over substance in november of 2004 the court of appeal of florida affirmed holding that the osp violated the noaid provision of the fl orida constitution because osp used state revenues to aid sectarian schools70 using the supreme courts reasoning in locke the court also determined that the noai d provision did not violate the

amended in 1980 to bar aid to st udents majoring in theology divinity or religious education the am endment was base d on article v iii 2 of the michigan constitution which provides as follows public
