sophisticated understanding of us imagery collection capabilities and is steadily taking steps to evade both western intelligence and commercial satellite and aerial reconnaissance while chinese military units for the past several years have carried out counterreconnaissance drills during major exercises this year reconnaissance and surveillance evasion emerged as major training theme in chinese military media and top level training guidance thus far evasion methods are primarily passive emphasizing camouflage and deception but prc commercial military magazine suggests that some experts in the field are advocating an ambitious future goal of developing active countermeasures that may include telemetry jamming and signals hacking the chinese military leadership has elevated detection evasion as one of the main topics for future military training suggesting growing awareness of and commitment to countering us intelligence and commercial imagery satellites see box in the
