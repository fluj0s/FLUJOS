introduction trends in us foreign assistance to latin america generally reflect the trends and rationales for us foreign aid programs globally us assistance spiked in the 1960s during president kennedys alliance for progress reflecting an interest in preventing the spread of soviet and cuban influence in the region and recognizing poverty as one possible root cause of popular discord in the 1980s the us focus shifted to the central american isthmus where leftist insurgencies were challenging friendly governments and where leftist movement in nicaragua had taken control of government through armed combat substantial amounts of us assistance were provided to support central american governments and the usbacked contras seeking to overthrow the sandinista government in nicaragua in the aftermath of the 1989 us military intervention in panama and the 1990 electoral defeat of the sandinista government in nicaragua us assistance to these two countries increased substantially central america resolved many of its political problems since the 1980s although it is still one of the least developed areas in the hemisphere with the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 us concerns about spreading communist influence lessened and so too did levels of us assistance since 2000 us assistance has focused on support for counternarcotics activities largely in the andean region figure 1 indicates trends in us assistance since 1960 in 2007 constant us dollars us assistance has not reached levels attained during the alliance for progress the annual average since 1990 is approximately half of what it was in the 1960s the amounts requested for fy2007 represent the lowest level in more than four decades some countries are benefitting from two new presidential foreign aid initiatives haiti and guyana identified as focus countries by the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar have received increased assistance for hivaids programs nicaragua and honduras have signed millennium challenge compacts us support for development is identified by president bush as one of the three pillars with defense and diplomacy of the national security strategy developed after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the us agency for international development usaid identifies five challenges to which us assistance programs are designed to respond promoting transformational development1 strengthening 1 usaid defines transformational development as development that does more than raise continued crs2 fragile states providing humanitarian relief supporting us geostrategic interests and mitigating global and transnational ills usaid identifies the main security threats to the united states as the confluence of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and global criminal networks the focus has shifted to strengthening the institutions of weak states rather than on just economic growth because weak states are seen as permissive

mexico became the united states second largest trading partner in 1999 burgeoning trade ties coincided with the election of new administrations in both countries in 2000 and promises of greater usmexico cooperation in the areas of counternarcotics immigration law enforcement and trade foreign aid allocations to mexico totaled only 31 million in fy2001 but rose to high of nearly 74 million in fy2005 total aid to mexico decreased slightly in fy2006 to 69 million and the administration has requested 63 million for fy2007 the higher total assistance figures have been primarily the result of large increases in counternarcotics inl funding used since 2001 to improve mexicos interdiction capacity surveillance and intelligence capabilities inl funding rose from only 12 million in fy2003 to close to 40 million in fy2005 and have remained level since that time mexico usually receives small amount of international military education and training imet funds for military training as well as

of state congressional budget justification summary tables fiscal year 2007 table updated by crs february 28 2006 additional issues for congress effectiveness of programs congressional debate on foreign aid issues has often focused on whether it is effective in reducing poverty and promoting us interests abroad critics argue that aid is often wasted on countries that do not responsibly use the assistance to promote the welfare of their citizens others argue that programs are often illdesigned in relation to their goals proponents of foreign aid argue that development is long term process that must be consistently implemented to see results recent studies have noted marked lack of progress in reducing global poverty and question the correlation between levels of development assistance and program success4 others argue that us assistance as currently structured does not contribute as much to sustainable economic growth as does trade5 one of the reasons suggested to explain this perceived lack of success is that aid programs often have objectives other than pure development such as national security environmental or human rights considerations another reason often pointed to is the nature and extent of corruption in societies that have little history of transparency the newly created millennium challenge account mca seeks to address some of these concerns in the view of the bush administration the mca links assistance to recipients performance on number of good governance and sound economic policy criteria see discussion below proponents of the mca view it as way to reform foreign aid programs by rewarding good performers and by focusing on the objectives of poverty reduction with limited consideration of strategic or political objectives critics raise concerns that by creating new aid programs including the hivaids initiative which coexist with traditional aid programs there is fragmentation of resources and potentially lack of coordination among the various entities administering the programs6 secretary rices announcement of newly created position director of foreign assistance that will be held concurrently by the usaid

could have implications for the future of assistance programs in general first funding is linked to performance and results second the conceptualization of development projects rests with the countries themselves and their national development strategies with the united states playing an advisory role third mca funds are intended to center exclusively on development goals without regard for other us foreign policy and geostrategic objectives while the international community and ngos have been generally supportive of the initiative some concerns have been expressed that funding for traditional assistance programs da and csh could end up being cut to accommodate the increased funding for mca the administration has stated that it does not intend for the mca to negatively affect its other development programs despite that assertion funding for da and some health programs under csh have declined development assistance in latin america is proposed for fy2007 at 28 less than in
