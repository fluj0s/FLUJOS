opportunities fo r public participation in the management of the federal lands managed by the forest service fs and the bureau of land management blm increased over the years as the statutes and regulations governing the lands were modernized and the remaining federal lands became increasingly important to the public public participation in the management of fs and blm lands derives prima rily from four sources 1 the relevant management laws regulations and agency guidance especi ally as to planning procedures 2 the national environmental policy act envir onmental review processes 3 the administrative procedure act and 4 administrative and judicial appeals recently administrative changes have been made to the planning environmental review and administrative appeals procedures to streamline them and make them more efficient in addition the healthy forests re storation act of 2003 pl 108148 also seeks to promote efficiency in the context of hazardous fuels reduction projects by limiting the scope of environmen tal reviews and expediting administrative and judicial review the act also allows other authorities to be used including new agencydeveloped categorical exclusions agency procedures that eliminate formal environmental evaluations and new approach to considering extraordinary circumstances that could reduce the number of environmental analyses and the associated opportunities for public input the fs may also place more of its management direction below the level of regulations arguably making it more difficult for the public to obtain information particip ate in management decisions and perform oversig ht or seek enforcement both the fs and blm have changed their systems of administrative appeals the fs has eliminated appeals of plans revisions and amendments unless the amendment is made as part of project d ecision instead the fs has instituted pre decisional opportunity to object to propos ed plan blm has made firerelated project decisions effectiv immediately this c ould result in eliminating administrative appeals in favor of more cos tly judicial review and drop in appeals numbers may result similar stance is proposed by blm for grazing decisions some applaud these change s as producing longoverdue efficiency and economy in agency processes others assert that the changes are closing the public out of management decisions for the publicly owned lands and question whether the breadth and effects of some of the change s comport with the spirit and letter of the governing laws the extent to which recent changes in agency procedures allow or preclude meaningful public participation in the management of these federal lands may raise questions of compliance with curre nt statutory requireme nts and may raise policy

participation in the management of forest service and bureau of land management lands overview and recent changes introduction the bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture together manage 454 million acres of land which is approximately two thirds of the land owned by the federal government and one fifth of the total land area of the united states1 these lands continue to be im portant in our national life serving economic security social scenic habitat wa tershed recreational and othe r purposes historically opportunities for public partic ipation in the management of these federal lands increased over the years and came to play greater role as the statutes and regulations governing the lands were modernized and as other open space lands became scarce and the remaining federal lands became increasingly important to the surrounding communities and to the public at large public participation in the management of fs and blm lands derives primarily from four sources 1 the relevant manageme nt laws regulations and other agency management guidance especially as to planning procedures 2 the national environmental policy act nepa2 environmental review processes 3 the administrative procedure act apa3 and 4 administrative and judicial appeals recently administrative changes have been made to the planning and appeals procedures of the agencies in an effort to streamline them and make them more efficient the planning and appeal processes of the agencies had been criticized

1213 discusses among other things how the modern management and environmental laws moved management to new era marked by ecosyst em management across boundaries at the same time that administrative rules made forest ma nagement more complex and cumbersome and costly procedural quagmire where single project can take years to move forward and planning costs can exceed 1 million some have referred to this situation as paralysis by analysis 5 see 325 of pub l 108108 6 in commenting on the extraordinary million and half comments received on the rule to manage roadless forest areas most of which fa vored the greater restrictions that the rule provided fs spokesperson stat ed that the final details of the proposed policy wont be decided by popularity contest stat ement of cindy chojnacky quoted in the oregonian at b01 tuesday august 29 2000 the weight to be given public input as factor in forest management planning and decisi ons is an important issue some as cumbersome expensive and timeconsuming4 and the changes were applauded as producing longove rdue efficiency others ssert that the changes are closing the public out of management d ecisions for the publiclyowned lands and question whether the changes comport with the spirit and letter of the governing laws the extent to which the public is allowed to participate meaningfully in the management of these federa l lands may raise questions of compliance with current statutory requirements and ma raise policy issues of either legislative or oversight interest to the congress in addition to these administrative changes several recent laws have changed or affected public participa tion through provisions that address the planning nepa and appeals processes chief among these is the healthy forest restoration act of 2003 which modifies nepa administrative ppeals and judicial review procedures for hazardous fuel reduction projects on fs or blm lands in addition congress has at times legislated to address specific nepa issues and how agencies may approach certain time constraints see for example provisions extending the terms and conditions of expiring grazing permits and leases pending completion of nepa reviews5 current legislative proposals addre ss only particular aspects of federal land management such as management of old growth etc there are current bills that would amend the major federal land laws generally whether as to public participation or otherwise the principal statutes that provide for modern management for the fs and blm lands are nearly thirty years old they provide most clearly for public participation at the macrolevel of area planning but lack detailed requirements as to public participation below th at level whether the statutes should be amended to increase or decrease public participation invol ves important policy issues on which viewpoints differ6 this report discusses the ma nagement of federal lands by the fs and blm and how public participation ente rs into

fs have similar multiple usesustained yield management responsibilities for their lands and many key issues affect both agencies however historically the two agencies have veloped differently and each agency has particular emphases and func tions for instance most blm lands are rangelands and the blm also administers mineral velopment on federal lands throughout the nation blm also manages significant timber resources in oregon and northern california7 blm manages the surface of pproximately 2615 million acres of land predominantly in the west principa lly under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma8 title iii of flpma is some times called blms organic act because it consolidated and modernized the agencys responsibilities flpma establishes the mana gement principles of multiple use and sustained yield provides that the federal g overnment must receive fair market value for the use of public lands and resources establishes general national policy that the public lands be retained in federa l ownership and expressly requires and encourages public partic ipation in the manageme nt of the public lands most federal forests are managed by the fs which administers 1925 million acres of federal land with mo st concentrated in the west management direction for the national forests first enacted in 1897 and expanded in 1960 and 1976 directs harmonious and coordinated management to provide multiple uses and sustained yields of resources congress enacted the national forest management act nfma9 in 1976 to revise timber sale author ities and to establis h requirements for land and resource management plans nd for public involvement in their development nfma planning has been criticized by some as expensive time consuming and ineffective for making d ecisions and informing the public and there have been various proposals for changes the first postnfma regulations were adopted in 1979 and revised in 1982 the 1982 regulations remained in effect until new regulations were finalized under the clinton administration in november of 2000 because compliance with the 2000 re gulations has been postponed the 1982 regulations continue to gove rn management of most na tional forest system lands new planning regulations again were pr oposed in 2002 by the bush administration and final regulations may be issued soon each set of regulations addresses and affects public participation in vari ous ways and is discussed below sources of public participation despite differences in the lands each agency manages and in agency history and emphases the principal statutes governing both agencies direct that public participation be part of planning and management th requirements of the landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32436crs4 10 5 usc 552 11 5 usc 553 12 5 usc 702 704management statutes and their accompanying regulations are one source of authority and guidance on public participation the national environmental policy ac t nepa provides another important opportunity for public particip ation through required pro cedures for environmental reviews the nepa processes are separate from but are integrated into the land management planning pro cesses and provide impor tant opportunities for public participation in agency activities in some instances agencies may not provide for public participation aside from the nepa context the administrative procedure act requires that the public be given access to certain agency information10 and afforded notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed regulatory changes11 the apa requirements for public notice and opportunity to comment apply to rulemaking not to public partic ipation in projects and activities of the fs and blm the act also provides for judicial review of agency actions12 and this aspect of the act applies to agency actions in carrying out projects and activities too various opportunities to administratively appeal agency decisions provide fourth avenue for public input into agency decision making by providing opportunities to change agency decision s review opportunities include pre decisional administrative protests or objections postdecisional administrative appeals and judicial review all of these aspects are intertwined in the management activities of the two agencies and will be discussed in this report under headings for each agency nepa overview because nepa and its requirements for public involvement as part of environmental reviews play significant role in agency planning and decision making more extensive background on nepa is provided in this section unless congress provides otherwise nepa applies to all actions of federal agencies it establishes national environmental policies and prescribes certain procedural requirements for all federal agency actions including those that intersect with private activities for example through federal permits or funding nepa requires the preparation of full environmental impact statement eis for any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in practice and as articulated in nepa regulations pr omulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq agencies typically prepare an environmental assessment ea if an action might have significant effects on the nvironment if an ea indicates that proposed action would not have significant environmental effects the agency issues finding of significant impact fons i and formal nepa procedures arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32436crs5 13 40 cfr 15084 14 id 15 40 cfr

have been found either separately or cumulatively to have minor or environmental effects13 an agency is excused from preparing any formal nepa environmen tal analyses at all with respect these categories of actions and hence they are known as categor ical exclusions in addition to describing types of actions that may be categorical exclusions agencies are required to provide for extraordinary circumstances in which normally excluded action may have significant environmental effect14 and be removed from categorical exclusion stat us and once again be subject to the requirements for environmental analyses recent source of controversy involves what approach should be taken when extraordinary circum stances such as wetlands or an endangered species are pr esent in the area of proposed action that would otherwise be regarded as categor ical exclusion recen t expansion of the circumstances regarded as categorical ex clusions and recent changes in handling extraordinary circumstances have generated controversy because nepa analyses are not being prepared for broader range of activities and thus nepaassociated opportunities for public participa tion have been eliminated agencies have other nepa duties asid from preparation of environmental documents and these duties may play more important role in light of the expanded use of categorical exclusi ons an agency must study develop and describe alternatives to recommende d courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concer ning alternative uses of available resources15 and must initiate and use ecological information in the planning and development of resource oriented projects16 the ceqnepa regulations emphasize public involvement beginning early in the planning process an agency is to provide public tice of neparelated hearings public meetings and the availability of environmental documents notice of an action of national concern is to be published in the federal register and other notice provisions are sp ecified in the regulations17 public hearings or meetings are to be held if there is substantial environmental controversy concerning the proposed action or substantial interest in holding the hearing and agencies are to solicit appropriate information from the public18 how some of these requirements may be applied to fs nd blm actions is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32436crs6 19 40 cfr 15017 20 40 cfr 15066a and b 21 40 cfr 15066c 22 40 cfr 15031 23 40 cfr 15002c 24 40 cfr 15073 25 even the scoping process may not be required department of the interior guidance in the departmental manual at 516 dm 33b states th at scoping may be done in connection with preparation of an ea if scoping is discreti onary at the level of an ea it is likely to be discretionary or eliminated with respect to categorical exclusionsthe nepa processes are to begin w ith an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be ddressed and for identifying the significant issues related to proposed action19 this scoping process affords the public an opportunity for predecisional input an extensive nepa regulation requires public involvement and requires agencies to make diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa pr ocedures and to provide notice of all neparelated hearings m eetings and documents20 public hearings or public meetings are to be held whenever appropriate or in accordance with statutory requirements applicable to the agency considering such things as whether there is substantial environmental c ontroversy concerning the pr oposed action or substantial interest in holding the hearing21 in addition the public is to be given an opportunity to comment on draft eiss22 there is express requirement for comment period on eas in the nepa regulations the most detailed and express nepa requirements regarding opportunities for public pa rticipation occur in the contex t of eis preparation and the agencies planning processes also af ford the greatest opportunities for public involvement in connection w ith actions involving preparation of an eis nepa procedures are to be integrated into the other studies and processes an agency would otherwise be following23 each department and each agency within department may elaborate on the ceqnepa processes w ith their own requirements and guidance24 each agency also may be subject to requi rements for public participation that derive from other statutes and each may voluntarily require or allow additional public participation aside from the nepa context one result of the integration of nepa pr ocesses with the pl anning process has been that agency regulations may not expressly provide specific opportunities for public participation aside from the nepa context for example if proposed activity is categorically excluded from nepa documentation and reviews there may be an absence of other administrative re quirements for public involvement in the project decision making process this issue has been highlighted by the recent expansion of categorical exclusions by th fs and blm it is possible that the public participation in categorically exclude d projects may consist only of the general scoping process25 but it is possible that some dditional public i nvolvement may be required for controversial proj ects or those with unresolve d alternatives for resource management required unde r nepa regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32436crs7 26 act of june 4 1897 ch2 30 stat 35 27 pub l 86517 74 stat

involved in the development review and revision of these plans the secretary shall provide for public par ticipation in the development review and revision of land management plans in cluding but not limited to making the plans or revisions available to the public at convenient locations in the vicinity of the affected unit for period of at least three months before final adoption during which

continued eligibility of actions for categorical exclusion status38 fs administrative appeals another significant aspect of public i nvolvement in fs pl anning and activities has been administrative appeals of agency decisions although until recently there was express statutory requi rement to do so the fs s provided for some version of administrative appeals since 190639 basically appeals of decisions of one forest officer were taken to superior officer before the enactment of nepa appeals were the primary mechanism for challenging management decisions of the fs40 as public involvement in federa l land management increased over time and especially after the first round of plans required by nfma were completed the number of appeals grew some asserted that appeals were crippling management others disputed that the problems were as bad as was sometimes asserted41 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32436crs9 41 continued february 26 1997 42 53 fed reg 1731217313 1988 43 id 44 54 fed reg

you i am the god of the forest speaker thomas foley asserted that eliminating appeals would violate the legal gu arantees of full and open public participation and weaken public confidence however ot her senators supported the proposed changes continuedin may 1988 the fs proposed changes to its appeals system that were premised in part on the view that if the public was involved earlier in the decision making process through nepa and some of the provisions of nfma on planning administrative appeals were redundant42 according to the fs the public participation aspects of nepa had legislated administrative appeals into obsolescence43 the fs finalized new appeal regulations in 198944 streamlining appeals of actions documented under nepa and nfma including plans and project decisions reiterating that appeals were simply another type of public participation and were less important than predecisional public partic ipation we believe that public participation and involvement in planning and decisionmaking is more effective prior to making the actual decision than afterwards45 on march 19 1992 secretary of agriculture edward madigan announced that the appeals regulations would again be revised to eliminate appeals of timber sales and other projectlevel decisions46 instead notice of projects for whic h an ea had been prepared would be published and comments taken before final decision w ould be made this pre decisional process combined with the elimination of right to appeal again reflects the agency thinking that administrative appeals have become redundant form of public participation predecisional public input can be beneficial in that proposed agency action can more readily be modified before decision is finalized to take into account matters and preferences presented by the public on the other hand absent any form of administrative postdecisional appeal nd with only the more expensive option of judicial review of agency decisions ther could be tendency on the part of agency decisionmakers to disregard the pr edecisional public input arguably administrative appeals can complement pre decisional input by providing check on actual agency action the 1992 fs proposal to eliminate appeals elicited controvers and debate and resulted in congress enacting the appeal s reform act ara 322 of the fy1993 department of the interior and re lated

acting through the chief of the fs to establish processes both for notice and comment regardin g proposed projects and activities implementing plans and for administrative appeals of such projects and activities ara added to the nfma language rega rding public particip ation in planning processes by specifically requiring notice and an opportunity for comment with respect to projects and activ ities implementing plans before proposing an action concerning projects and activities implementing plans the secretary is required to mail notice about the proposed action to an person who has requested it in writing and to persons who are known to have par ticipated in the decision making process newspaper publication is also generally required and federal register notice is required for actions taken by the chief 30 day comment period then must follow therefor although an opportunity for public comment is not expressly required by the ceq regulations with respect to proj ect eas comment period is required by ara under ara persons who are involved in the public comment process through written or oral comments or by otherwise tifying the fs of their interest in the proposed action have right to appeal w ithin 45 days from the time of decision the statute provides for inform or formal disposition of administrative appeals and establishes time periods unless the chief of the fs determines that an emergency exists decision normally is to be stayed during the appeal filing period or until 15 days after the date of th disposition of an appeal ara effectively rejected the fs position that postdecisional administrative appeals are redundant if an opportunity fo r predecisional public input is provided however as will be seen in the discussion of r ecent regulatory changes and proposals that fs approach is still eviden t as to fs actions not covered by ara notably the amendment or revision of plans where the fs has eliminated appeals for some actions if an opportunity for pre decisional public invol vement is provided until the recent changes to the appeal regulations there were three types of appeals set out in 36 cfr part 217 fo r appeals of plans and significant plan amendments part 215 for appeals of proj ects and activities implementing plans and part 251 for appeals by permittees there was predecisional process for objecting to or protesting proposed fs decision pr ovisions relating to notice of actions and opportunities for public comment appeared in the planning and appeals regulations and varied depending of the level of th action despite the breadth of the ara language notice and an opportunity to co mment were not provi ded for all proposed actions implementing forest plans new fs postara appeal regulations will be discussed

with activities below the planning level because the land and resource management planning process determines how the lands of the national forest system are to be managed the public is encouraged to participate throughout the planning process the intent of public participation is to 1 broaden the information base upon whic h land and resource management planning decisions are made 2 ensure that

oversight of fs policy and asserted that appeals are citizens right and provide means to resolve conflicts other than through litigation the fs responded that part 217 appeals forced th expenditure of

notice and comment procedures depending on the scope of the directive involved national proposals normally require notice published in the federal register followed by minimum of 60 days for public review and comment at the forest or district level the responsib official determines the appropriate means of notifying the public of manual changes which may include notice published in newspaper of general circulation or press release and minimum of 30 calendar days for review and comment83 however these procedures may be waived for good cause that an exigency exists in which case an interim manual directive may be put in place before any opportunity is afforded for public comment84 however the requirements of part 216 do not apply to material in handbooks or to certain types of manual directives85 and it appears likely that white papers are not covered either if not public input is not required w ith respect to those forms of directives and any management direction they contain could be accomplished without public notice or involvement in addition there is some question whether and when manual nd ndbook materials are even binding on the agencies court may conclude in some cases that manual and handbook provisions are binding on an agency depending on whether the manual or handbook provisi ons were adopted with publication and other formalities associated with full rulemaking but in contrast to agency regulations provisions contained in agency manuals and handbooks have gene rally been held to lack the force and effect of law to be nonbinding on agencies to be

will result from going forward with the proposed agency action indeed unde r the new directive circumstance is extraordinary only if the responsible offi cial determines it is such because the

environment an ea is to be prepared however the official is free to conclude an action will have significant effect despite the presence of circumstances such as listed sp ecies or inventoried roadless areas such circumstances were previously consid ered under one inte rpretation of the regulations to be extraordinary circumstances per but now are merely resource conditions that must be

ninth circuit has held that an agency may issue categorical exclusion even where certain resource condition such as the presence of threat ened or endangered species is found108 however the case cited for this propos ition involved salvage sale under 2001 of the emergency supplemental appr opriations and rescission act109 statute that addressed particular situa tion provided the secretary w ith very broad discretion to determine the adequacy of any environmen tal reviews and set out very narrow scope of judicial review of environmental decisions in contrast the seventh circuit concluded that

permitted under the thencurrent fs categorical exclusion provisions and that preparation of an ea was the proper means to make that determination110 the court also noted that the ea process allows for

rehabilitation projects and activities these exclusions are especially relevant to the management of the significant timber resources by blm in oregon and northern california but also apply to projects on the rangelands in addition there are doi departmental categorical exclusions and blmwide categorical exclusions as discussed in connection with the fs to the extent activities are conducted as categorical ex clusions there are form environmental documents for the public to review and tice and comment are not required appendix 1 of the interior departmental manual lists departmental categorical exclusions many of which relate to admin istrative and personnel matters exclusion 19 is for policies directives regulations nd guidelines that are of an administrative nature

whether an ea must be prepared when evaluating the presence of extraordinary circumstances in situation that otherwise would be categorical exclusion is another important factor that bears directly on the extent of public participation available the position of blm on extraordinary circumstances appears to parallel the new position of the fs in that agency personnel will make cr ucial dete

that trigger need to prepare an ea but rather appears to call for the action officer s to decide whether the proposed action in particular circumstances may have sign ificant effect function intended to be fulfilled by the preparation of an ea many of the paragraphs in appendix 2 take similar stance an extraordinary circumstance only exists if the acting official concludes without prepara tion of an ea that the action may have significant effect yet 516 dm 32a states that the pur pose of an ea is to allow the responsible official to determine whether to prepare an eis ie the ea indicates whether proposed action may have significant effect or to otherwise assist in planning and decision making emphasis added s imilarly 516 dm 74b states that eas are prepared either to provide information in order to make finding that there are significant impacts or that an eis should be prepared empha sis added this is the function of an ea under the ceq re gulations previously the section on categorical exclusions contained list of circumstances that required an ea to be prepared to determine the like lihood of significant effects the new final doi appeals regulations include brief description of the environmental review that is completed for categorical exclusion categorical exclusion doe s not exempt an agency action from environmental review rather it requires the agency to scrutinize the proposed action to see whether it meets the criteria for categorical exclusion that is whether it is the type of action that the agency has deci ded through its procedures

could aff ect public participation on december 8 2003 blm proposed amendments to the grazing regulations137 one proposal is to reduce the instances in which blm is required to solicit public comment on pending grazing management decisions on the grounds that public participation processes were consuming too much scarce staff time138 the explanatory materials state that blm proposes retaining the requi rement that blm provide the interested public with copies of proposed and fi nal grazing decisions and allowing them respectively to protest and appeal them blm also proposes retaining consultation with the interested public for 1 appor tioning additional forage on blm managed lands 2 developing or modifying graz ing activity plan and other blm land use plans 3 planning rang development or improvement program and 4 reviewing and commenting on grazing management evaluation reports blm proposes eliminating requiring public consultation on 1 adjusting allotment boundaries 2 changing grazing preference 3 issuing emergency closures 4 renewing or issuing grazing permit or lease 5 modifying permits and leases or 6 issuing temporary and nonrenewable grazing per mits arguably many of these topics for which public consultation would be eliminated could be important to the condition of the rangelands and their ability to serve non grazing multiple uses blm also may consult with permittees and lessees state nd local officials and the interested public on other matters if the authorized officer finds consultation would facilitate management of grazing on the public lands at several points the proposed grazing regulations appear to give permittees and grazing operators greater role in ma nagement decisions than other segments of the public as discussed bove consultations are conducte d with the permittees and operators and with the state and local officials but the public will be consulted only with respect to certain topics139 the materials explain that the public will be consulted where such input would be of the grea test value such as when deciding vegetation management objectives in an allotment management plan or preparing reports evaluating range cond itions blm in cooperation with the grazing operator would retain the disc retion to determine and implement the most appropriate ontheground manageme nt actions blm values productive

local or county established grazing boards in review ing range improveme nts and allotment management plans on public nds federal grazing advisory boards authorized by flpma expired under that act on december 31 1985 and have not been reinstated the consultations with the nonfederal grazingfocused boards mentioned in the proposed regulations would be in add ition to interactions with the federally constituted resource advisory councils which are required to have balanced membership141 proposed grazing appeals the proposed grazing regulations would clarify how appeals of blm grazing decisions and petitions for stays of decisions pending appeal would affect the timing of implementation of grazingrelated deci sion and the continuity of ongoing grazing operations as discussed in the explanatory materials basically if an agency decision can be and is stayed an appellant must exhaust administrative remedies before going to court if decision or action is effective immediately and not stayed claimant may proceed to court in developing th proposed regulations blm asserts that it balanced its duties under various statutes by allowing grazing to continue under existing permit terms and c onditions if decision changing those terms and conditions is stayed the agency asserts that this outcome is valid under the apa 5 usc 558 which requires that license with reference to an activity of continuing nature does not expire until an agency makes new determination142 in instances where there is not an existing permit blm would allow grazing in accordance with decision even in the case of stay if the decision favored grazing in several enumerated circumstances and affected parties could proceed to court without exhausting administrative re medies under current and proposed regulations the authorized officer may provide that grazing decision is effective upon issuance unless stay is granted by the office of hearing and appeals in sum it appears that under the current and proposed rules existing grazing usually would be allowed to continue and anyone challenging change decision could be required to pursue more expensive judicial ppeals which could reduce the number of

safeguard public and firefighter h ealth and safety protect property and improve environmental baseline conditions in the wildlandurban interface and other priority areas144 other comments objected to the regulation asserting that the rule change would undermine the value of public comment by allowing citizen concerns to be effectively ignored further eroding the trust c itizens have in public land management agency decisions comments fu rther asserted that 1 the proposed rule would allow project to begin before d ecision is made on the appeal effectively discounting public opinion 2 decision on ppeal to reject proposed project has less effect if the project has already commenced and any negative effects of the action have already occurred 3 the public is less likely to participate in the decision making process when it can have real or immediate effect on proposed project and 4 such policy contradicts the spirit of flpma which encourages public comment on proposed actions and participation in th appeal process for management decision145 in response doi stated that the ppeal process is not part of the public participation required by sec tion 309e of flpma this approach contrasts to the position taken by the forest service that appeals are part of public participation but are redundant if predecisional i nput is available doi also asserted that making fire management decisions effective imme diately actually encourages public participation by making it more essential at the project designenvironmental review state it is at this stage that blm gathers evidence and public input upon which to base its fire management plansprojects and decisions146 some comments pointed out that there was existing authority to make decisions effective immediately on casebycase basis but blm responded that it views its ability to carry out fire management practices as matter of great urgency and that t hese fire management decisions need to be effective immediately147

petiti on for stay filed under 43 cfr 421b the action being appealed could be stayed from going into effect for the time the stay is in place several aspects of stays and effectivene ss of decisions

apa plaintiff can file in cour t once an agency deci sion is final unless further administrative review is re quired by the agencys regulations and those regulations also provide that the decisi on for which review is sought is made inoperative during the time of review if hazardous fuels management project decision is made effective immediately and the decision is not automatically made inoperative during the time app eals if any are taken149 it appears that judicial review of such decision would be available similarly if stay is sought before the ibla and denied an injunction could be sought at the judicial level although part of the project in question could be underw ay 43 cfr 421c states decision which at the time of its renditi on is subject to appeal to the director or an

notice and comment arguably the elimination of many environmental studies together with their associated notice and comment periods the expansion of pr ojects conducted as categorical exclusions and the new approach to extraordinary circumstances may signifi cantly reduce opportunities for public input access to administrative appeals has also been reduced in the past the fs has viewed appeals as type of public par ticipation and recently has substituted pre decisional objection process fo r redundant pub lic appeals of forest plans the ara requires administrative appeals of projects and activities implementing plans but does not require appeals of plans themse lves in contrast the blm asserts that appeals are not form of public particip ation and can be limite d without violating the letter or spirit of flpma by making many decisions effective immediately with recourse likely to be only to the cour ts both agencies have effectively skipped administrative appeals in those instances
