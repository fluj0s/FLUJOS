scenesetter for special representative ambassador holbrookes february 1516 visit to riyadh ref kabul 500 riyadh 00000182 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador james b smith for reasons 14 b and d 1 c ambassador holbrooke embassy riyadh warmly welcomes you to saudi arabia which by virtue of its historical and cultural ties to central asia personal relationships between saudi afghani and pakistani leaders financial power and leadership of the muslim world can play central role in implementing the presidents strategy for afghanistan and pakistan your visit comes at time of great potential but great uncertainty the saudiafghan relationship appears to be warming up while the traditionally close saudipakistani relationship has grown increasingly strained the saudis are broadly supportive of our approach to afghanistan and pakistan but occasionally express skepticism about our timing or our approach your visit provides an opportunity to mine the saudis wealth of experience in dealing with afghanistan pakistan and extremism and further explore ways to translate our shared goals into action in the unique saudi context we have requested meetings with gip director prince muqrin bin abdulaziz assistant interior minister prince mohammed bin nayif and prince turki alfaisal during your visit 2 c saudiafghan relations warming president karzais february 23 visit to the kingdom although richer in symbolism than substance was sign that lukewarm saudiafghan relations may finally be warming up in his official statement at the london conference fm saud announced 150 million pledge of additional financial support for afghan reconstruction he expressed broad saudi support for reconciliation adding that they would be willing to assist at the request of president karzai on the condition that the taliban sever its relationship with alqaeda and cease providing refuge to its leaders while not as forward leaning as we may have liked fm sauds statement put the saudis on the record and created an opportunity to put reconciliation talks back in motioneventually saudi participation at the turkishled regional conference on afghanistan on january 26 was further evidence of the saudi commitment to engagement karzais visit showed that the king was ready to deal with karzai as legitimate muslim head of state however the saudis continue to have concerns about afghan corruption and believe greater political incorporation of the pashtun community is essential their apparent wish to downplay karzais visitas compared to the afghans reftelmay also indicate the kings desire to keep some distance and maintain his credibility as potential reconciliation mediator 3 snf but mediation not ready for prime time privately the saudis tell us its still too soon to be publicly discussing technical and financial aspects of reintegration efforts gip director prince muqrin has made clear that his marching orders are to work through intelligence channels only until progress becomes sustainable at which point foreign ministries will be brought in in recent meeting with the ambassador prince muqrin hinted at but did not provide details about what appears to be significant movement on the saudi mediation effort with visits by highlevel taliban and afghan officials since the hajj we surmise that muqrin is reluctant to share information because the talks remain delicate and he fears us involvement could derail progress he has also voiced concern about how to address unscr 1267 prohibitions on dealing with various taliban members 4 c zardari still the problem in pakistan the saudis generally agree that there is need to deny terrorists safehavens in pakistan but question whether the methods we have outlined will be effective despite tense relations with the zardari government close military and intelligence cooperation continues between saudi arabia and pakistan the saudis believe opposition leader nawaz sharif can play great role in working with tribal chiefs and that money is better than bullets in the fight against the taliban they have started to fulfill their pledge from the tokyo donors conference over half of the 700 million pledged has been disbursed and have expressed willingness to continue with financial support for stable pakistan saudi interlocutors stress the importance of remembering that pakistan remains riyadh 00000182 0022 of 003 preoccupied with issues on its indian border coloring its ability to deal with the taliban 5 c in the army we trust the tumultuous democratic process in pakistan makes the saudis nervous and they appear to be looking for another musharraf strong forceful leader they know they can trust in his january meeting with general jones the king cited president zardari as an impediment to denying terrorist safehavens calling him an obstacle and rotten head that was infecting the whole body he maintained that the pakistani army was capable of being strong partner for the us and opined that us development assistance would rebuild trust he asserted that that the army was staying out of pakistani politics in deference to us wishes rather than doing what it should fm saud told general jones that we must reach out to tribal leaders and separate those we could work with from those we must fight he believed that using the military to fight extremists posed certain dangers and that the credibility of the army must be maintained the saudis were pushing pakistans civilian leaders to work together but compromise seemed alien to pakistani politicians 6 c turkis take during recent meeting with ambassador former gip director prince turki alfaisal called afghanistan puzzle where establishing trust with afghan leaders and recognizing the links between pakistan and the taliban were keys to success all financial aid to the afghan government should be conditional benchmarks must be set for the leadership and aid must be withheld until these are met recent saudi efforts to assist in taliban mediation had failed he said when both sides fell short he described the taliban leadership as fractured and suggested the us and nato needed to target criminal elements more vociferously and refocus our attention on capturing osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri he suggested saudi arabia the us china russia afghanistan and pakistan could join forces and share assets in order to capture or kill bin laden and alzawahiri this would break the terrorists aura of invincibility and allow the us to declare victory and move on 7 snf terrorism finance terrorist funding emanating from saudi arabia remains serious concern over the last year however saudi arabia has made important progress in combating alqaida financing emanating from the country sensitive reporting indicates that alqaidas ability to raise funds has deteriorated substantially and that it is now in its weakest state since 911 the kingdom is also cooperating more actively than at any previous point to respond to terrorist financing concerns raised by the united states and to investigate and detain financial facilitators of concern nonetheless sustained engagement is required to maintain the current momentum particularly in providing the saudis with specific details and actionable information your visit provides another opportunity to welcome the progress saudi arabia has made and reiterate the importance that president obama and the usg place on curtailing fundraising activity by global terrorist groups in saudi arabia particularly those that undermine the stability of afghanistan and pakistan 8 snf terrorism finance continued while in the past the ksa stood reluctant to pursue saudi donors who backed groups that did not directly threaten the kingdom the saudi ministry of interior moi has now demonstrated willingness to take action and has begun to detain individuals involved in funding networks for groups such as lashkar etayyiba let the taliban and in some cases even hamas xxxxxxxxxxxx as donors in saudi arabia continue to constitute source of funding to sunni extremist groups worldwide available intelligence reflects that the kingdom remains an important fundraising localeespecially during the hajj and ramadanfor the taliban let and other terrorist groups based in afghanistan and pakistan the moi remains almost completely dependent on the cia to provide analytic support and direction for its counterterrorism operations as such our success against terrorist financing in the kingdom remains directly tied to our ability to provide actionable intelligence to our saudi counterparts in order to enhance the usgs ability to influence and direct saudi efforts to riyadh 00000182 0032 of 003 disrupt terrorist financing in 2008 we stood up treasury attach office in embassy riyadh this office actively contributes to the daily intelligence sharing process that is led by cia 9 snf terrorism finance continued saudi arabia has taken increasingly aggressive efforts to disrupt alqaidas access to funding from saudi sources an example of recent progress by the ksa is the conviction of over 300 people for involvement in terrorism including some for providing financial support news reports suggest that appeals may be opened to the media in order to enhance the deterrent effects of such prosecutions in addition assistant interior minister for security affairs mohammed bin nayif stated that the ministry of the interior moi deliberately timed its august 19 2009 press release regarding the arrest of 44 terrorist supporters to deter potential donors from giving money to suspected terrorist groups during ramadan although great deal of work remains to be done mohammed bin nayif has given his commitment to work with the united states on taliban finance and has said that the moi will arrest individuals involved in saudibased taliban fundraising activities even if involved in the reconciliation process when provided with actionable intelligence 10 snf identifying opportunities the saudis have expressed broad support for the presidents strategy on afghanistan and pakistan but often balk when asked to designate an srap to coordinate policy with the usg and others in part this reflects the centralized saudi decisionmaking process and the reality that issues related to afghanistan and pakistan policy are not delegated but rather dealt with directly by the king and members of the intelligence community while the saudis are hesitant to delegate authority and tend to make only broadbased commitments to highprofile multilateral initiatives they appear ready willing and eager to share their experiences with us and identify greater opportunities for cooperation on bilateral basis your visit provides an opportunity to further explore how we can best translate our shared goals into action in the unique saudi context smith
