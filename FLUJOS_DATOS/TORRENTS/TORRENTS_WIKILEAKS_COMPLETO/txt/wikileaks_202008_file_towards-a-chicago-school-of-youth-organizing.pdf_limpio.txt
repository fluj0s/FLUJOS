the symbolic capitol of middle america chicago has served as test ing ground for ideas that have influence d fields as varied as sociology architecture and economics the city also has rich history of

youth organizin g groups operate is also major factor element s of this include funders intermediar organizations training institutes net works publications conferences and shared methods all of which support the developmen t and expansion of the field this paper describes the current state of youth organizin g in chicago it reflects the ideas and perspective s shared during series of youth organizer convening s sponsored by the woods fund that asked is there chicago school of youthorganizing preliminar feedback from youth organizer s and funders who reviewed an advance draft of this paper is also included while this paper pro vides broad strokes describin g character istics of chicago s youth organizin g efforts these characterization s do not imply that the youth organizin g field is monochromatic indeed for each of these characteristics there are importan t exception s that underscore if not prove the rule the chicago factorth environment neighborhoods race income and politics the role of youth organizin g in chicago cannot be separated from the environ ment in which youth organizin g work is carried out chicago is city of diverse and segregate d neighborhoods

youth organizin g groups generaily fail to deal with institutiona i racism and dont promote muitiracia l coaiitionsi t appears many communit organization s within african american neighborhood s in chicago ionger engage in youth organizin g workwith strong local authority for example land use and housing decisions are made at the ward level not at the city level every public school has local school council with some budgetary and admin istrative control typically youth organ izing work in chicago focuses on partic ular neighborhoods although at least one youth organizin g group has success fully leveraged improvement s in citywide school policy by collaboratin g with other groups across the city it remains difficult for youth organizin g groups to consis tently organize youth around broader sys temic change as with other cities across the country many of chicago s neighborhood s are becoming gentrified neighborhood s that once had some of the highest crime rates and lacked basic necessitie s including stores safe and affordabl housing and jobs now are characterize d by high priced condominiums boutique stores and increased law enforcemen t presence youth organizer s typically fighting for the needs of lowincome underserve d residents find the original characteristic s of some neighborhood s changing as low income residents move to other city neighborhood s and surroundin g suburbs while lowincom residents still live in many neighborhoods their voices are becoming noticeabl muffled how has this affected youth organizin g efforts the changing dynamics of chicago s neighborhood s has resulted in different prioritizatio n of needs and decreased involvemen t of new residents making the work of youth organizin g more challenging some believe chicago s political system intentionall or unintentionall helps pro mote the segregatio n of neighborhoods by many accounts chicago continues to be one of the most racially segregate dcities in the country youth organizin g in chicago has facto concentratio n on addressing the needs of lowincom youth of color unfortunately chicago s youth organizin g groups generally fail to deal with institutiona l racism and dont promote multiracia l coalitions interestingly while most of the youth organizing groups in chicago focus on lowincom neighborhood s comprise d of people of color the pool of youth organ izing groups in chicago leans heavily toward latino and immigran t youth recognizin g that much of the organizin g movemen t in chicago was born out of the civil rights movement establishe d african american groups engaged in youth organizin g are almost nonexistent additionally it appears many communit organization s within african america n neighborhood s in chicago longer engage in youth organizin g work while numerous youth organizin g groups do exist significan t pockets of chicago s neighborhood s appear void of african american youth organizin g efforts thorough analysis is needed to explore whether politics racism or other factors have contribute d to the limited number of african american youth organizin g groups cultural barriers also affect youth organizing work in chicago s neighbor hoods several immigran t cultures exist in chicago and for many immigran t neighborhoods addressin g inequalitie s such as race or privilege is sensitive issue youth organizer s with immigran t parents indicated lack of parental support for their organizin g efforts parents may not support their youth participatin g in activities that might cause attention to or go counter to their customs and beliefs diversity in culture is another factor that further 76 special feature organizing youthsocial policywinter 2003 vol 34 2 spring 2004 vol 34 3 influences the field of youth

infrastructur in chicago continue s to be recognize d by practitioner s across the world today chicago serves home to four major com munity organizin g training institutes and dozens of local organization s establishe d in the 197os several foundation s unabashedl support communit organiz ing projects such as the chicago communit organizin g capacity building initiative and the communit organizin g award are funders collabora tives designed to help the communit organizing field clearly chicago youth organizing has been nurtured in the cradle of communit organizing significan t number of youth organizin g groups in chicago develope d as the youth arm of adultfocuse d communit organizations often these projects began at the request of adult leaders who believed youth should have voice regarding youth issues as the adult voice developed relative to other communit issues these projects generally hire youth organizer s with money from chicago organizin g funders send them to conventiona l communit organizin g training and live in the context of organ izations that have welldefine d under standing of what communit organizin g is and isnt as result youth organizin g in chicago looks lot like other local communit organizing this is different than other parts of the country where youth organizin g groups may have another salient factor such as politicaleducation and arts engagement some convenin g participant s indicated that leaders in their adultled organiza tions have learned from youth and now recognize the importanc of having youth leadership integrate d into all aspects of the organization s including the board of directors one youth leader testified before i joined youth organizing i did nt know my alderman it is not some thing you learn in the classroom it is amazing that i have learned so much in two years i am now member of the board and i make the same decisions and have the same amount of power as peo ple 20 years older it is awesome today more leaders of communit organization s recogniz that youth lead ers are capable of handling increasin g responsibility communit organization s supporting youth organizin g provide youth with highleve l opportunitie s for leadership chicago also nurtures youthled organi zations one organizer from the conven ings offered definition buildin g youthled organizatio n is building an institutiona l voice for youth and having it run by youth this structure has proven to be the most difficult to sustain as youthled groups constantl struggle to convince area funders of the legitimac of their work and ability to affect change without the direct influence of adults almost all the youth organizin g groups in chicago operate with limited staff if organization s supportin g youth organiz ing experienc reduction s in funding the youth organizer positions are typically the first to be eliminated or the staff reassigned to other projects within the organization it is amazing that i have learned so much in two years i am now member of the board and i make the same decisions and have the same amount of power as people 20 years older it is awesome special feature organizing youth

projects they also recognize the respon sibility to work with youth to uphold commitment s to school and family monitorin g the degree of influence they have over youth remains one of the tinuing challenge s for youth organizer s who may possess different economi c and educationa l background s than the youth in the neighborhoods one organizer questioned how do you make sure you are not manipulatin g the young people in response to these concerns chicago s youth organizin g groups have develope d innovative strategies for integratin g youth developmen t elements into their respective organizin g models youth organizers readily acknowledg that their focus promotes positive changes in youth as individual s and the communitie s in which they live one organizer stated we have

youth organizing is not separately identified funding category for most chicago area foundations it is part of other funding categories communit organization s that have used general operating grants to develop their youth organizing have been the most successfu l at sustainin g their work their reputatio nfor creating change primarily with adults on variety of issues gives them relative financial freedom to develop youth organizing program by trial and error over period of years independen t youth organizations especiall startup organizations have had much more diffi culty in funding their work funder activism to legitimiz youth organizing in chicago has been sporadic over the last decade although high atten dance at recent meetings of funders on the subject is positive sign many of the recent participant s in these conversa tions fund other youth developmen t strategies and are attracted by the poten tial of youth organizin g to positively affect adolescen t development these participant s are creating shift in the funder dialogue around youth organizing while the expectatio n that youth organiz ing should have the rigor of communit organizing will not go away there is an additional expectatio n that youth organiz ing have the rigor of conventiona l youth development the field will necessaril move to respond to this expectation where do we go from here new direction s for youth organizin g in chicago after several convenings the question is there chicago school of youth organizing is still unresolved althoug h the trends in chicago youth organizin g dont yet have the intention or the coher ence that characteriz school there is an unmistakabl momentu m among fun ders and practitioner s of youth organiz ing that makes chicago place to watch for new ideas and methods of practice up to this point the state of practice in chicago has been an unconsciou s series of response s to particular set of local circumstances the dialogues uncovere dcontinued from page 78 thats different then they would come to at the adults conventio n and demand support peggy knoepfel how did the adults feel tg see theyre organized theres mob thats the whoie pointthe difference between mob and an organization they had to ask approval to get into the convention credentials they had to have place to sit we purposely put them in certain place they could get up to the micro phone and speak just like anybody else just like adults and they loved it because they had power when the people all approved whatever it was they wanted just like adults they cried we had people with us what hap pened all of sudden here we go we respect each other to that was exciting special feature organizing youth 79examinin g how groups in the west have worked to address issues such as race
