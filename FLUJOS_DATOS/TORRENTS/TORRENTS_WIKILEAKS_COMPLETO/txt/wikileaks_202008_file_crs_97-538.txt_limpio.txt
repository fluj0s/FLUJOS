disarmament agency acda and the us information agency usia into the department of state it would require that the us agency for international development usaid be reorganized and would come under the authority of the secretary of state this report provides background on the foreign policy agency consolidation issue discusses foreign policy implications and tracks legislation it will be updated as related activities occur foreign policy agency reorganization in the 105th congress summary on april 18 1997 the clinton administration announced plan to reorganize the foreign policy agencies the twoyear plan would require significant internal restructuring of the state department and eliminate two other agenciesthe arms control and disarmament agency acda and the us information agency usia whose functions and personnel would be absorbed by state it would integrate acda into state within the first year and usia into state by the end of 1999 the implementation process would begin after 120day planning period the us agency for international development usaid would remain separate agency with its own appropriation but would be brought under the direct authority of the secretary of state administration interagency task forces reviewed and analyzed the possible options for consolidating and restructuring the potentially affected agencies reportedly draft reorganization plan including some major unresolved issues was submitted to the office of the secretary in mid1997 selected elements of the proposal have been implemented in the period since although complete consolidation had to await enactment of explicit authorization congress debated reorganization of the foreign affairs agencies in the context of foreign relations authorizing legislation for fy199899 consideration that spanned most of the 105th congress although the house and senate approved bills in june 1997 hr 1757 and s 903 conference negotiations continued for over nine months during this time the reorganization issue which conferees had resolved in november became entwined with other foreign policy controversies in dispute between congress and the president including international family planning policy and abortion restrictions reform and arrears payment authorization and us contributions to the international monetary fund as approved by the house march 26 1998 voice vote and by the senate april 28 5149 the conference report on hr 1757 directed the president to 1 abolish acda and usia and merge them into the state department 2 establish the broadcasting board of governors as an independent agency and 3 maintain usaid as separate agency but require the administrator to report directly to the secretary of state after president clinton said he would veto the bill primarily because of the abortion provision congressional leaders held hr 1757 until the end of the 105th congress on the eve of adjournment congress lifted the foreign affairs agency consolidation authorization from hr 1757 and attached slightly revised version to the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1999 president clinton signed the omnibus measure on october 21 1998 pl 105277 congress also sent to the white house hr 1757 legislation that the president vetoed on october 21 contents introduction 1 background and political context 2 context for

1997 the clinton administration announced plan to reorganize the foreign policy agencies the twoyear plan would require significant internal restructuring of the state department and eliminate two other agencies the arms control and disarmament agency acda and the us information agency usia whose functions and personnel would be absorbed by state it would integrate acda into state within the first year and usia into state by the end of 1999 the implementation process would begin after 120day planning period the us agency for international development usaid would remain separate agency with its own appropriation but would be brought under the direct authority of the secretary of state the house passed its version of the foreign relations authorization act hr 1757 introduced june 3 1997 on june 11 division of hr 1757 consisted of provisions for the consolidation of the foreign affairs agencies as reported the legislation included somewhat different reorganization plan crafted largely by house international relations committee chairman gilman than proposed by the president during floor debate the house rejected an amendment by congressman hamilton that would have provided fewer requirements and greater presidential flexibility than the gilman plan prior to final passage and in the face of possible veto the house approved compromise reorganization language worked out between congressmen gilman and hamilton that was acceptable to the administration the senate foreign relations committee marked up and ordered reported its version of the foreign relations authorization act s 903 on june 13 producing consolidation plan that also diverged in several key ways from the presidents initiative provisions that would move more of usaid into the state department and require the budget for development assistance programs to pass through the secretary of state were elements especially opposed by the administration senate floor debate on s 903 produced significant changes to the committeeendorsed consolidation plan house and senate conferees met in late july to work out differences between the bills but did not come to final agreement mainly because of contentions disagreement over an international family planning provision in the house version of the bill without further movement on hr 1757 efforts were made near the end of the first session to attach modified agency consolidation authority to other legislation including the district of columbia appropriations bill hr 2607 which passed the senate on november 9 the revised text reflected resolution of housesenate disagreements between the two reorganization proposals worked out crs2 during conference meetings on hr 1757 in particular the modified language accommodated to some extent administration concerns regarding senate provisions moving usaid closer to the state department nevertheless final legislative attempt collapsed on november 13 when house leaders proposed to combine three top administration priorities foreign affairs agency consolidation international monetary fund appropriations and arrearage payments in new legislative package with international family planning abortionrelated restrictions the white house said it would veto any legislation containing the family planning conditions and house leaders abandoned plans to vote on the measure during the final two days of the session on march 10 1998 conference report for hr 1757 was filed in addition to the reorganization provisions that were agreed to in november 1997 the conference report included among other provisions authorization of appropriations for the state department and related agencies reform and payment of us arrears to the united nations and international population funding restrictions the legislation passed by voice vote in the house on march 26 the senate passed the legislation on april 28 1998 with vote of 51 to 49 the president stated he would veto the bill primarily because of the abortion funding language because of the threatened veto congress held the legislation until the end of the 105th congress at which time it was sent to the white house and vetoed by president clinton on october 21 1998 expecting the presidents veto however congress lifted major portions from hr 1757 including slightly revised foreign affairs agency consolidation authorization and attached it to the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1999 hr 4328 under the terms of the omnibus measure which the president signed on october 21 1998 pl 105277 acda will merge into the state department by april 1 1999 and usia by october 1 1999 usaid must be reorganized and its press office and some administrative offices merged into state by april 1 1999 background and political context context for debate in the 105th congress on reorganization following contentious debate in the 104th congress capped by president clintons veto of legislation requiring the termination of one of three foreign policy agencies the context surrounding congressional consideration of the executives most recent reorganization proposal has changed significantly not only is the current plan presidential initiative rather than one imposed by congress but it has also been key element in complex interrelated set of broader foreign policy issues the chemical weapons convention reform and arrearage payments and international affairs budget levels discussed by congress and the executive branch during 1997 crs3 shaping the presidents 1997 initiative since late 1996 many close foreign policy observers had anticipated white house initiative to consolidate us foreign affairs agencies although the administration rejected congressional proposals in 1995 to reorganize these bureaucracies key executive officials primarily in the state department continued to believe that the merger of acda usia and usaid with the department would make for more coherent us foreign policy decisionmaking and make better use of scarce resources moreover many believed that in the absence of white house plan congress would once again target the foreign policy agencies for reorganization possibly in ways that even consolidation proponents within the administration would oppose some argued that in order to protect presidential prerogatives to structure the executive branch the white house should construct plan in advance of proposals that might emerge early in the 105th congress indication that agency consolidation issues were under consideration came during the january 8 1997 confirmation hearing of secretary of statenominee madeleine albright in response to several questions she told the senate foreign relations committee how important it is for us to have an effective and efficient foreign policy mechanism the secretarydesignate stated that she had an open mind on the question of consolidation and pledged to discuss the issue further with the committee in the ensuing weeks however the reorganization issue reportedly became embedded in broader agenda of state department and white house national security priorities that required congressional attention in early 1997 at the top of the administrations list was gaining quick senate approval of the chemical weapons convention cwc before the pact went into force with or without us ratification on april 29 1997 the cwc was strongly opposed by chairman helms and had been bottled up in the senate foreign relations committee for months the state department had also begun vigorous campaign in late 1996 to raise concerns about the adequacy of us foreign policy and diplomatic funding resources strategy setting the stage for an fy1998 1945 billion up 63 international affairs budget request submitted on february 6 third highpriority item on the white houses early 1997 foreign policy agenda was congressional approval of about 1 billion to clear us arrears at the united nations and for peacekeeping contributions an initiative many in congress wanted tied to management organizational and financial reforms although none of these issues were explicitly linked with one another it was the view of many close congressional and white house observers that if the president expected congress to consider his priority proposals especially cwc the administration must be prepared to work with lawmakers on advancing key congressional issues such as reform submission of certain arms control treaties to the senate and foreign affairs agency consolidation labeled as coincidence movement on the cwc and reorganization issues began almost simultaneously on april 17 while the senate leadership announced that it would schedule debate on cwc for the following week the white house was preparing its statement made the next day that it would merge usia and acda into the state department and bring usaid directly under the guidance of the secretary of state crs4 agency consolidation debate in the 104th congress throughout 1995 and into 1996 both the administration and congress considered options to reorganize the structure of us government foreign policy agencies at issue was how best to tighten the foreign policy budget while maximizing the effectiveness of interagency coordination in working toward common foreign policy goals in an everchanging postcold war world critics of us foreign policy management practices charged that these agencies at times maintained conflicting agendas housed duplicative functions and bureaus and often did not give proper emphasis to national priorities such as promoting us economic trade and economic interests abroad after the white house rejected the outlines of state department plan to consolidate the agencies proposal strongly opposed by usaid acda and usia senate foreign relations committee chairman helms announced his own initiative on march 15 1995 the original helms plan would have eliminated all three agencies and created what senator helms characterized as new more effective state department with some of the functions of the eliminated agencies merged into it an america desk would have been established in the state department to ensure that all us foreign policy contributed to american national interests with continued white house opposition senate democrats successfully blocked debate on foreign relations committeereported legislation s 908 that followed chairman helms plan following several months of negotiations senate leaders reached agreement which was adopted by the full senate on december 14 1995 on compromise proposal to consolidate us foreign affairs agencies the agreement however did not require the administration to abolish agencies but mandated 17 billion budget savings in program and operating expenses house reorganization bill hr 1561 that like the initial helms proposal also abolished usaid usia and acda folding their functions into state with newlycreated under secretary positions had already passed on june 8 1995 ultimately house and senate negotiators agreed on plan to abolish one agency to be selected by the president but widely assumed to be acda the president also had to certify 1 that his own foreign policy consolidation plans would save 17 billion over four years and 2 that the preservation of the remaining two agencies was important to us national interests president clinton however vetoed the bill hr 1561 in early april 1996 for number of reasons including agency consolidation requirements that he said jeopardized the presidents ability to manage his own executive agencies the house could not override the veto and the issue did not resurface in the 104th congress role of congress in agency consolidation procedural issues at the outset of the white house initiative to consolidate the agencies it was clear that congress would have some degree of influence over the shape of the plan as well as the power to approve or reject it with several options available to crs5 congress and the executive branch in the approval and implementation procedure for agency reorganizations it was unclear exactly how the process would unfold because the plan included the creation of new state department positions such as under secretaries for arms control and international security and for public diplomacy at minimum congress must amend the state department basic authorities act pl 84885 as amended to enact these and other organizational changes for the broader details of reorganization several scenarios and options were available to the president and lawmakers congressional consideration under presidential reorganization authority an early option preferred by the white house was the reinstatement of currently dormant presidential authority to reorganize the executive branch although such authority ultimately requires congress to approve the presidents plan it provides for far less direct congressional involvement than through the normal legislative process with the objective of achieving greater efficiency in government congress since the 1930s has granted the chief executive authority to issue executive orders and since 1939 plans proposing reorganizations within the executive branch this authority has been issued for temporary periods of time and renewed by congress periodically the most recent reorganization authority expired in 1984 and presidents reagan bush and clinton did not ask for its reinstatement at the time of its expiration in 1984 the reorganization authority see 5 usc 901912 provided that once the president submitted his plan congress must adopt joint resolution within 90 calendar days of continuous session for it to become effective although the president could modify his own proposal within the first 60 calendar days of continuous session after its submission congress could not amend the chief executives plan lawmakers could only vote up or down on the recommendation one potential problem with this approach was that it largely took the issue out of the hands of the most active proponents for consolidation in the 104th congress under the statute that expired in 1984 such reorganization plans were not referred to the committees of policy jurisdiction in this case the house international relations and senate foreign relations committees but to the house government reform and oversight and senate governmental affairs panels implementation through normal legislative process without reorganization authority the proposed foreign affairs agency consolidation would proceed through normal legislative process in recent years the departments of energy education and veterans affairs were created in this fashion under one possible scenario that appeared plausible in may 1997 following the administrations 120day review process the president would draft the necessary legislation to implement the reorganization and submit it to congress for consideration probably in september or october 1997 congress could then choose to deal with the legislative proposal as either separate bill or incorporate it into omnibus foreign policy legislation as it did in the 104th congress hr 1561 timing for the latter option however was awkward since the house and senate foreign relations committees were about to act on omnibus foreign affairs authorization bills action that would come well in advance of the anticipated submission by the president of his formal plan crs6 legislative status of reorganization authority legislative authority enacted on october 21 1998 in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1999 pl 105277 combines elements of both approaches outlined above the statute grants the president authority to draft and submit to congress by december 20 1998 foreign affairs reorganization plan at the same time pl 105277 legislates certain mandatory elements that must be contained in presidential plan including the abolishment of acda usia and idca1 and the streamlining of usaid once submitted the president may amend his plan at any time prior to its effective date for acda idca and usaid the required steps must take place by april 1 1999 while usia must be abolished and consolidated by october 1 1999 the authority does not require congress to vote on the proposal prior to its implementation but should lawmakers attempt to reject or make significant modifications to the presidents plan through regular legislation they would most likely have to overcome veto mandatory elements of congressional plans although legislation approved by both the house and senate permitted the president to shape much of the reorganization proposal according to plans developed by executive branch working groups lawmakers established series of items that must be included in any consolidation scheme drafted and submitted to congress by the president several of the senatepassed mandatory reorganization elements closely followed the house plan but with the addition of few key directives especially those affecting us international broadcasting activities and usaid the revised reorganization act passed by congress on october 20 1998 and signed into law pl 105277 by the president on october 21 1998 requires the president to submit final report by january 1 2001 providing final accounting of the finances and operations of the agencies abolished by the act other details follow acda the house and senate plans passed in hr 1757 and s 903 would have required that acda be abolished by october 1 1998 that its functions be transferred to the secretary of state and that the department of state create an under secretary for arms control and international security pl 105277 adopts this same approach but sets april 1 1999 as the date for abolishing acda usia hr 1757 passed by the house would have required that usia be abolished by october 1 1999 its functions transferred to the secretary of state that the international broadcasting bureau maintain degree of independence and that the department of state create an under secretary for public diplomacy the senate measure also would have required that usia be abolished by october 1 1999 its functions transferred to the secretary of state and the department of state create an under secretary for public diplomacy 1 the international development cooperation agency idca was created in 1979 to be the overall coordinator of us development assistance policy although the agency continues to exist it has functioned in an extremely minimal capacity for the past 18 years and has frequently been target for elimination crs7 the senate differed from the house however by establishing the broadcasting board of governors as an independent entity by october 1 1999 as enacted in pl 105277 usia must be consolidated into the department of state by october 1 1999 international broadcasting functions are not transferred to the secretary of state but are maintained as separate entity in the executive branch the statute further includes the zorinsky amendment and smithmundt language prohibiting public diplomacy programs unique to the usia from operating domestically idca the house proposal would have required that idca be abolished by october 1 1998 and its functions transferred to another agency or agencies the senate version would have required that idca be abolished by october 1 1998 and its functions including the allocation of economic assistance funds to usaid be transferred to the secretary of state idca functions regarding opic were to be transferred to usaid other idca functions and those of usaid would be transferred to another agency or agencies as specified by the presidents reorganization plan the enacted legislation sets the deadline at april 1 1999 but otherwise generally follows provisions of the senatepassed bill usaid the house would have required that usaid be reorganized by october 1 1999 that it report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state and at minimum the functions of its press office and certain administrative functions be transferred to the department of state the senate would have required that usaid be reorganized by october 1 1998 the usaid administrator serve under the direct authority of the secretary of state the secretary of state assume responsibility for coordinating including the design of overall aid and economic cooperation strategy all us economic assistance programs and at minimum the functions of usaids offices of legislative affairs and press and public affairs be transferred to the department of state2 pl 105277 mandates usaid reorganization by april 1 1999 requires the usaid administrator to report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state establishes the secretary of state as the coordinator of all us economic aid programs including approving but not designing as in the senate bill overall aid strategy and transfers usaids press office and certain administrative functions to state as proposed by the house the administrations proposal and actions while congress debated legislation concerning certain aspects of consolidation of us foreign affairs agencies the clinton administration was in the process of developing details of comprehensive plan to what it considers will adapt cold war policy structures to the postcold war policy agenda 2 the senate bill further includes nonbinding sense of the senate that omb should apportion all funds for us foreign assistance programs including those administered by usaid directly to the secretary of state instead of to the head of other federal agencies crs8 description the administration states that sustainable development nonproliferation and public diplomacy are more central than ever to american foreign policy the foreign policy apparatus should reflect that pulling the best people and practices from each agency to carry out us foreign policy through the coming era after 120day planning period which concluded in late august 1997 the administration proposed to phase in over twoyear time period the integration of acda and usia and partial integration of usaid into state the administration proposed completion of its reform plan by the end of 1999 with the promise of streamlined and more effective foreign policy structure before the 21st century within the first year acda would be fully integrated into the state departments politicalmilitary bureau pm the new under secretary for this bureau would also carry the title of senior adviser to the president and the secretary of state for arms control nonproliferation and disarmament this official would attend and participate in all relevant meetings of the national security council and the principals committee or its equivalent the new under secretary would communicate with the president and members of the nsc on issues of arms control nonproliferation and disarmament through the secretary of state this official would lead the interagency process on nonproliferation issues and work closely with the nsc staff in managing the arms control policy process also within the first year usias legislative and public affairs offices would be fully merged into state until the completion of the reorganization the administrator of usia would also function as the under secretary of state for public diplomacy usaid would be placed under direct authority of the secretary of state its appropriations however would remain separate during the second year of implementation of the administration proposal usias administrative functions the information bureau broadcasting and educational and cultural exchanges would become integrated into the state department usaids press office would be integrated into state later in the process the two agencies would seek to improve coordination of the regional bureaus beyond that the usaid administrator and secretary of state would attempt to further reform both agencies to eliminate duplication between usaids and states functional bureaus actions in mid1997 the administration formed number of committees to evaluate various options for implementation of the reorganization plan overseeing the entire operation was the reorganization steering committee it consisted of the deputy secretary of state mr strobe talbott administrator of usaid mr brian j brian atwood director of usia dr joseph d duffey and acda director mr john d holum and was chaired by the secretary of state the main work was carried out by core team and specialized task forces the core team included senior level representatives from the affected agencies and was chaired by patrick kennedy acting under secretary of state for management this crs9 committee reported to the steering committee synthesizing options and making policy recommendations eight specialized task forces were formed which included representatives from each of the agencies involved as well as labor union representatives the eight task forces were 1 arms control and nonproliferation 2 public diplomacy 3 press operations 4 legal operations 5 legislative operations 6 development coordination 7 management and administrative functions 8 state department reinvention the task forces analyzed the issues and built plan with options full time planning committee was established to focus and bring together the work done by eight task forces the planning committee relayed the information to the core team reportedly the task forces transmitted their conclusions to the planning team in midaugust 1997 draft of the administrations official reorganization plan was reviewed by the core team and the heads of all the organizations involved by october 1997 detailed but unreleased implementing plan was at the secretarys desk the administration stated they were seeking ways to keep up the reorganization momentum in view of the fact that the 105th congress did not provide reorganization authority during the first session on december 19 1997 secretary albright announced that acda director john holum would be doublehatted as acting under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs implications for us foreign policy one of the primary goals of reorganizing the foreign policy agencies is to eliminate duplication frequent source of criticism from congress currently each agency maintains parallel duplicative operations such as legislative affairs administrative bureaus and press offices additionally some agencies have similarly structured regional or functional bureaus by eliminating the duplication it is argued more effective streamlined us foreign policy mechanism would result eliminating duplication and merging similar functions into one agency also would likely improve the coordination among foreign policy regional and functional bureaus thereby improving the efficiency in us decision making and response to world events budget savings was primary force driving foreign policy agency consolidation during the 104th congress the congressional budget office had estimated that 3 billion could be saved over fiveyear period with the congressional reorganizing proposal the administration asserted that the vice presidents national performance review npr initiative would save as much while keeping the agencies independent while budget savings are expected to eventually result from reorganization of agencies the clinton administration did not expect savings to be significant in the early years of plan implementation some in the executive branch claimed that budget savings were not viewed as the top priority in implementing the white house plan reorganizing to achieve more effective foreign policy apparatus was the key objective they stated merging most foreign policy activities under the state department was expected to give the secretary access to wider array of foreign policy tools such as international broadcasting economic assistance international exchanges and international speakers programs the needs and costs of u s overseas posts and embassies were likely to crs10 be more transparent after reorganization the secretary would be able to respond more quickly to moving resources and skilled staff to posts where most needed further consolidating agencies would reduce the number of voices simplify the message advising the president on any given issue allowing the president to determine and better execute foreign policy that is in americas best interest some foreign policy experts however were concerned that the reorganization of the foreign policy agencies into the department of state would further encumber an agency already burdened with too many layers of management and where too many decisions end up on the secretarys desk integrating the acda and usia would further hamper the conduct of foreign policy they argued because the secretary of state would have too many issues to manage also many who follow specific foreign policy activities such as international broadcasting international exchange programs and foreign aid were concerned that those functions would become less efficiently and effectively managed because politicalmilitaryfocused managers would be making decisions about priorities resource distribution and program funding to some this raised the question of whether the programs would be able to maintain the level of credibility they currently enjoy they wondered whether the state department could be reformed adequately and quickly enough to administer the many new programs merged into it3 few issues were not addressed in the administrations reorganization plan for example the state departments role in coordination of us government agencies that administer trade and economic issues international exchange programs that are managed by us government agencies outside of the foreign policy agencies and refugee issues were not raised implications for agencies and their functions arguments for reorganizing the foreign policy bureaucracy suffer from seeming contradiction on the one hand the state department is heavily criticized for management weaknesses on the other hand reorganization proposals would likely require the department and the secretary to deal with wide span of control and additional responsibilities nevertheless many believe that state department reform would only occur when driven by the integration of other agencies and their functions into state 3 on august 8 1997 secretary of state albright sent memorandum to all employees of acda state usia and usaid stating that as first step in the reorganization process under secretaries and assistant secretaries would take on greater responsibility in an effort to decentralize the demands of the secretary of state crs11 state department and foreign the state department established policy management proponents of foreign in 1789 has mission to advance and policy agency reorganization including protect the worldwide interests of the senator helms former secretary of state united states and its citizens currently eagleburger former national security the state department represents advisor scowcroft and others have american interests on behalf of 50 us raised long list of perceived government agencies and organizations shortcomings in the department of state operating 249 posts in over 180 countries and the foreign policy organizational around the world the department structure criticisms of the state employs an estimated 18869 full time department include 1 poor staff down from 19110 in fy1996 the management structures with too many fy1999 budget for state is about 44 layers that impede efficient policymaking billion up from 4 billion enacted for 2 too many disputes funneling directly to fy1998 the secretary of state creating decision making overload at the top 3 too much energy devoted to diplomatic reporting 4 an elitist attitude among many staff particularly in the foreign service 5 an archaic information system that is not compatible with those at acda usia or usaid and 6 lack of coordination in regional and functional bureaus that undermines consistent policy direction many on both sides of the consolidation issue agree that the department has suffered from weak management and has been unable to divest itself of cold war operational standards and adopt revised set of mission priorities while the state department has made some foreign policy downsizing efforts in response to recent budgetary pressures the changes have been mostly quantitative with little noticeable change in states policy or management structure and according to the general accounting office gao it has strategy for future downsizing efforts4 on their face many of these views of state department management deficiencies appear to weigh against merging other agencies with the department critics of merging other agencies into the department have argue that wellfunctioning organizations should not be moved into what they view as dysfunctional agency that only after the state department fully implements reforms and integrates new policy priorities should the idea of super state department be given serious consideration proponents of consolidation however countered that the goals of reducing the duplication of functions and achieving better policy coordination can only be achieved by merging currently independent agencies with the state department and bringing their missions more directly under the authority of the secretary of state they asserted that the continuing independence of key foreign affairs agencies contributes to the fractured decision making process and weakens the position of the secretary of state and ambassadors around the world supporters also contended that management reforms within the state department would be pursued in conjunction with the agency consolidation and would be integral to the success of the effort moreover they stated that the consolidation of external agency responsibilities into the department will force 4 state department options for addressing possible budget reductions general accounting office august 1996 crs12 state to incorporate nontraditional yet important foreign policy initiatives into its priorities clinton administration officials acknowledge that the departments restructuring is critical to the broader reorganization process at white house briefing the national performance review senior policy advisor stated that reinvention at the state department is an priori qualification for doing any other consolidations of other agenciesweve got reinvigorated state department that will hopefully start dealing with its core problems5 officials maintain that states reform effort will be phased in simultaneously as agencies are integrated into state it is believed that state department reform will continue to evolve long after the implementation period of the overall reorganization plan while details of the administrations proposal are lacking integrating acda and usia into state will expand the agency horizontally increasing the number of bureaus and under secretaries new bureau for arms control and international security covering acdas activities and new bureau for public diplomacy covering usias operations would be established states regional and functional bureaus would remain but would need better mechanisms for coordinating their activities within state and with usaid thus the secretary of state it is argued would acquire the ability to coordinate to establish accountability and to have direct access to officials working on all aspects of foreign policy although consolidating agencies is expected to result in some positions being eliminated reductions in force rifs at the department are not being discussed at this time on august 8 1997 secretary albright outlined in memo to staff in all four agencies the first step in the reorganization processto diffuse demands placed at the top in the department of state by increasing the responsibilities of the under secretaries and assistant secretaries at state according to the august 8th memo and followup explanatory memo the under secretaries will serve as the main policy advisers to the secretary and will function as corporate board on longterm resource and strategic planning matters assistant secretaries are to be the main policy makers implementers and issue leaders the reorganization law pl 105277 as passed by congress and signed by the president on october 21 1998 creates new under secretary of state for arms control and international security and new under secretary of state for public diplomacy it requires the secretary of state to submit report with its congressional presentation document of the budget for fy2000 and fy2001 describing estimated and achieved costs related to the consolidation effort 5 white house briefing on foreign policy reorganization by dr elaine kamarck national performance review senior policy advisor and mr michael mccurry white house press secretary april 18 1997 crs13 usia and public diplomacy the us information agency was most public diplomacy experts agree that established in 1953 to help present the broadcasting and international exchange american culture and us government programs are comparatively inexpensive policy to foreign publics in 1978 and safe ways to promote us interests congress merged the state and democratic values around the world departments bureau of education and supporters of the reorganization cultural affairs into the usia which proposal believe that putting international primarily focused on international broadcasting in the state department broadcasting its current estimated would strengthen the link between these staff size is 68283336 domestic activities and us foreign policy positions 739 americans overseas and objectives 2753 foreign nationals its fy1999 appropriation is 11 billion number of concerns were raised comparable to the enacted fy1998 regarding proposals to integrate the us level information agency into the department of state one issue addressed was usias mandate required by the smithmundt act of 1948 and zorinsky amendment that bar the usia from operating domestically and propagandizing us audiences on grounds that such activities might influence local politics about 80 percent of usias employees come under this law this restriction is in conflict with many department of state activities states activities currently involve providing domestic press and audiences with foreign policy information as well as sponsoring forums and town meetings on behalf of the state department pl 105277 addressed this issue by establishing new under secretary for public diplomacy furthermore the act includes language which would continue to apply smithmundt and zorinsky laws to usia programs after consolidated into state another concern was whether international broadcastings credibility with foreign publics in promoting democracy and the us perspective would be weakened if it were administered by the state department some question whether the selection of news stories to be aired and editing of reports would be affected by ongoing state department activities such as the secretarys travel plans to particular region imminent trade agreements or us government actions to gain cooperation from foreign government some observers believe state department management of us international broadcasting could invite foreign governments to blame the secretary of state for airing broadcasts viewed by them to be unfavorable the act addressed broadcasting credibility by establishing the broadcasting broad of governors as an independent entity within the executive branch

relations authorization act of fy199495 pl 103236 as well as assess continued government funding of rferl in fy2000 similarly some had questioned whether international exchange programs such as the fulbright program would continue to emphasize crosscultural understanding or whether they would be diverted to promote politicalmilitary goals of us foreign policy some have contended that particularly the longterm nature of international crs14 exchanges in building relationships could be compromised if resources that might have been devoted to exchanges get diverted to shorterterm crises furthermore many nongovernmental organizations ngos support international exchange activities of the us government ngos may not have the trust or be as welcome at state as they were by usia some fear pl 105277 did not specifically address this concern another issue that needed to be addressed was the differing communication systems and operations of each agency since usias mission is to provide information it maintains an open information system available to foreign publics the state department on the other hand keeps secure communication system some experts claimed that keeping both public and secure aspects within one computer system would weaken the secure part two separate computer systems may be necessary if the agencies are fully integrated responding to the view that consolidation would reduce expensive duplication usia had already agreed that consolidating travel offices security systems personnel support and overseas warehouses with state would make sense however usia asserted it has already undergone more than any other foreign policy agency massive restructuring and streamlining effort beginning in 1994 usia consolidated the international broadcasting activities generating savings of 400 million since 1994 during those same years usia dismantled its bureau of policy and programs and created the bureau of information 30 percent smaller and more customeroriented additionally usia has restructured the bureau of educational and cultural affairs delayering it and consolidating offices that manage international exchange programs acda and international acda was established as small security for the past thirtyfive years agency in 1961 to be an independent acdas mandate was to serve as the advocate for arms control with direct central organization charged by statute access to the president over the past with primary responsibility for arms several years acda and state have control under the direction of the worked closely to eliminate president and secretary of state pl unnecessary duplication acda 87297 75 stat 631 acda was employs about 250 people this number envisioned as quasiindependent has been declining for several years its advocate for arms control and its fy 1999 appropriation is 415 million director designated the principal adviser comparable to the level enacted in fy to the president the secretary of state 1998 and the national security council nsc on arms control issues acdas role has now been modified although the implications of these changes are not likely to be profound the primacy of arms control will longer be codified in law to the degree it has been in the past acdas supporters credited the small agency with key arms control victories and contributions to us national security since its creation since 1961 acda was charged with carrying out the following primary functions crs15 the conduct support and coordination of research for arms control and disarmament policy formulation the preparation for and management of us participation in international negotiations in the arms control and disarmament field the dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control and disarmament and the preparation for operation of or as appropriate direction of us participation in such control systems onsite and remote monitoring activities as may become part of us arms control and disarmament activities pl 87297 arms control and disarmament act september 26 1961 as amended acda pursued these goals with mixed success under democratic and republican administrations small agency acda contended with much the larger bureaucracies and priorities of the departments of state defense commerce energy and the intelligence community nonetheless the agency credited itself with such arms control victories as continued reductions of strategic nuclear arms negotiating an end to producing fissile material for nuclear weapons strengthening the nuclear non proliferation treaty and its safeguards ratifying and implementing the comprehensive test ban treaty implementing the chemical weapons convention enhancing compliance with the biological weapons convention and negotiating global ban on antipersonnel land mines6 many of the concerns raised over acdas integration into the department of state likely have been mitigated however first the current head of acda also serves as the acting under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs closer integration of arms control objectives with other foreign policy and national security priorities has been underway for some time in addition the transition likely will be relatively smooth second the administration remains committed to retaining acdas technical and policy expertise as well as its verification compliance and legal functions reorganization critics were alarmed at the prospect of losing such capabilities widely seen as indispensable to effective arms control to larger state department culture that did not favor such expertise 6 statement of the hon john d holum director acda subcommittee on international operations and human rights committee on international relations march 5 1997 crs16 usaid and us development established in 1961 the mission of assistance policy with usaid remaining usaid is to promote longterm an independent agency but placed under sustainable development abroad the direct authority of the secretary of helping countries grow economically state it is anticipated that initially there strengthen democratic institutions will be very little change in the way the protect the environment stabilize agency operates and how it implements population growth and deal with us development assistance policy at disasters and other humanitarian present only usaids press office is requirements currently usaid has slated to be consolidated with state programs in about 100 countries although the white house says that state although the agency has announced and usaid will explore further options plans to reduce that number to 75 by for coordinating or merging other the year 2000 agency staff totals administrative and program services about 7800 down from over 10700 in 1993 the current level includes usaid currently exists under the roughly 2240 american direct hires authority of executive order 12163 about 750 of which work overseas in administration of foreign assistance and addition usaid has about 5500 related functions and through american and foreign national international development cooperation contractors agency idca delegation of authority 1 of october 1 1979 idca was created in 1979 as small agency intended to serve as the overall coordinator of us development aid policies and programs usaid which had been established in 1961 within the state department continued in existence after 1979 within idca in practical terms however idca functioned to very limited extent after the idca director appointed by president carter left in 1981 one has been named to fill the position instead usaid administrators have served in dual capacities as agency head and acting idca director the presidents consolidation plan called for abolishing idca but reconstituting usaid as an independent agency although usaid has remained independent of the state department since 1979 the two have maintained somewhat ambiguous association with the usaid administrator always operating under the foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state in practice it appears that usaids relationship with the state department both in washington and in the field has rested less on organizational lines of authority than on informal personal relationships between the secretary and the administrator their chief deputies in charge of regional and functional bureaus and us ambassadors and usaid mission directors posted around the world most observers believe that having usaid fall under the direct authority of the secretary of state will have little or effect on how the agencies interact and that coordination will continue to be driven more by the personal relationships of senior officials what remains to be seen is whether the white house proposes to continue usaid as an independent agency through law as usaid anticipates or through delegation of authority by way of the secretary of state during 199596 usaid and its administrator brian atwood vigorously opposed merging the agency into the state department based largely on two grounds the unique nature of usaids mission as development agency and the achievements of agency management reforms since 1994 that have not been matched by state department crs17 administrative improvements in defending their position usaid officials have emphasized the different nature of missions and problems dealt with by the state department and usaid state more often focuses on resolving shortterm crises through diplomacy and political governmenttogovernment relations while usaid in pursuing its development strategies requires longterm sustained effort to achieve results that might be compromised by state department needs to divert resources for crisis management usaid officials have further noted that for nearly three years the agency has been heavily engaged in organizational reforms and participating as an experimental laboratory in the vice presidents national performance review usaid has closed 26 overseas aid missions terminated relations with governments that were uncooperative development partners and attempted to create results oriented accountability system against which the agency and congress can measure results while still defending usaids position as an independent agency during the more recent round of interagency negotiations over consolidation plans administrator atwood reportedly argued that whatever the outcome on the merger question three elements of usaid operations must be protected 1 usaid must continue to receive its development assistance funding directly and control its own budget rather than having the appropriations passed through the state department 2 usaid procurement and other administrative systems must continue for aid projects instead of using states processes and 3 the stature of the senior official heading us aid programs and the development aid mission itself whether it be within or outside the state department must not be downgraded based on the consolidation outlines released thus far by the white house it appears that not only will usaid remain independent but that administrator atwoods three requirements have been accommodated nevertheless the outcome of the administrations final plan and the requirement enacted in pl 105 277 for development aid funding to be allocated to the secretary of state could alter the preliminary arrangements reached in early 1997 regarding usaids relationship with the state department according to current plans there will be only one minor change for usaid during the initial stage of the consolidation proposal some portions of its small press office of about 10 staff with an annual budget of roughly 670000 will merge with states press bureau but in subsequent phases of the reorganization the white house says that other issues will be considered that could possibly have more significant impact on usaid programs and operations among the most important issues for future consideration would be efforts to better coordinate usaid and state department regional and functional bureaus the creation in 1993 of states global affairs bureau unit that oversees the departments policy formulation of among other things international environment population and democracy building issues established parallel and somewhat overlapping office with usaids global bureau the usaid global unit sets aid policy on these same issues and administers large amounts development assistance resources reportedly there have been continuing disagreements between state and usaid on policy prioritization and aid funding allocations especially in the areas of the environment and population whether to consolidate and where to locate state departments refugee and usaids crs18 disaster offices has also been an issue in the past7 on regional issues usaid administers us aid programs in eastern europe and the former soviet union but special advisor to the secretary of state plays the lead role in policy formulation and exercises extensive guidance for implementing aid programs in the region these are some of the most likely areas administration officials may examine over the next year in search of further ways to eliminate duplication between the two agencies the reorganization text in hr 1757 as passed by the house was generally in line with the white houses april proposal for usaid the bill abolished idca immediately and permitted the president to determine how idca responsibilities would be redelegated consistent with white house intentions the legislation required usaid to transfer its press office and certain unspecified administrative functions to the state department and come under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state bipartisan agreement on the final reorganization provision in hr 1757 came after an earlier contentious debate over text that appeared to move usaid more closely under control of the state department as introduced hr 1757 transferred idca functions directly to the secretary of state and moved several other usaid functions including nonspecialized procurement travel and transportation facilities management and security operations to the state department the house early in the debate of hr 1757 had defeated 202224 an amendment by representative hamilton to remove these and other reorganization provisions opposed by the administration later in the debate however the house under gilmanhamilton bipartisan agreement revised the usaid provisions accommodating administration concerns unlike the house provision and the white house plan legislation passed by the senate placed the state department in much more direct control of usaid policy making funding allocation decisions and personnel management specifically the bill transferred idca functions to the secretary of state except for those relating to the overseas private investment corporation which remained with usaid allocated aid funds previously apportioned to idca to the secretary of state required the reorganization of usaid to occur later than october 1 1998 one year earlier than planned by the administration transfered to the state department press affairs functions as proposed by the white house as well those of public affairs and legislative affairs granted the secretary of state direct authority to coordinate all us economic aid programs projects and activities including the design of broad assistance 7 usaid contends that transfer of refugee programs from state to its own office of foreign disaster assistance would result in staff reduction of 25 and savings of about 20 million similar arguments could be made for shifting usaids disaster office to states refugee bureau crs19 strategy and the arbiter for resolving policy program and funding disputes among us government agencies required usaid to detail its personnel upon request on nonreimbursable basis to the department of state the revised reorganization legislation that passed congress on october 21 1998 generally follows the senate proposal regarding usaid but accommodates few key administration concerns only the press office and certain administrative functions as proposed by the white house would transfer to the state department while the secretary of state would still coordinate us economic assistance policy as the senate recommended the secretary would approve but not design overall aid and cooperation strategy nevertheless the enacted bill directs that aid funds currently allocated directly to usaid by way of idca be apportioned to the secretary of state crs20 reorganization chronology 041296 president clinton vetoed hr
