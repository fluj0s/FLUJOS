of armenia azerbaijan and georgia are generally considered as comprising the south caucasus region which borders russia turkey and iran1 this isthmus between the black and caspian seas is an ageold northsouth and eastwest trade and transport crossroads the region has been invaded many times quashing periods of selfrule these invasions and other contacts have resulted in many and diverse historical cultural ethnic religious and linguistic links with neighboring peoples russian and soviet tutelage over the region lasted nearly unbroken from the early nineteenth century until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 deeply affecting economic and social development borders and nationality relations soviet control in particular resulted in the isolation of the crossroads region from the rest of the world after gaining independence all the states spiraled into economic depression and conflicts began or intensified that threatened their existence though in recent years the states have appeared more stable the regional states remain weak in comparison to neighboring powers in terms of populations economies armed forces and other capabilities this report discusses the internal and external security concerns of the south caucasus states and us interests and policy toward the region the ambitions of neighboring powers particularly russia have appeared to pose the greatest threat to the stability and sovereignty of the south caucasus states it is also possible that internal security problems are greater threats the states are less able to ameliorate external threats because of internal weaknesses such as political and economic instability ethnic and regional conflicts and crime and corruption

according to deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza were not embarrassed to say that energy is strategic interest we also have traditional security interestsmeaning fighting terrorism fighting proliferation avoiding military conflict and restoring or preserving in some cases the territorial integrity of the states of the region and then we have third set of interests in democratic and market economic reform based on our belief that stability only comes from legitimacy and legitimacy requires democracy on the political side and prosperity on the economic side 2 the united states provided some security assistance to the region prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states particularly to georgia this aid and the establishment of militarytomilitary ties

on energy supplies from the caspian region in the late 1990s the clinton administration backed the building of eastwest oil and gas pipelines not controlled by iran or russia the bush administrations

not only benefit the economies of the region but also help mitigate possible world supply disruptions the bush administrations 2003 and 2006 national security strategy of the usa also emphasized these themes stating that us energy security and global prosperity would be strengthened by expanding the numbers of suppliers including those in the caspian region 4 most in congress have supported us

august 2008 russiageorgia conflict these contrasting arguments were at the forefront of debate over future us militarytomilitary assistance to georgia advocates of boosted us security assistance to georgia argued that the us military training provided to georgian troops was designed for counterterrorism including to support coalition actions in iraq rather than for conventional military operations they suggested that more robust us security assistance along with assistance that would have been in the works if nato had offered map to georgia in april 2008 might have deterred russia from its disproportionate m ilitary actions in georgia some critics of this view asserted that us and nato assistance to georgias military emboldened the countrys leadership to launch an action in south ossetia whether or not the action was provoked by russia they also pointed to russian president medvedevs opposition to na to map for georgia as destabilizing and threat to russia and his assertion that he would have ordered russian troops to invade georgia even if georgia had been granted map the usgeorgia charter on strategic partnership signed in january 2009 appears to support the

some observers argue that the major security problems faced by the south caucasus states are largely the result of inadequate or fragile democratization the illegitimacy of the governments in the eyes of significant numbers of citizens endangers civil and ethnic peace and sustainable development and invites foreign meddling in this view some observers recommend greater us and western attention to bolstering social programs so that public demands that are unleashed by liberalization do not destabilize fragile democratic institutions157 after the rose revolution in georgia and relatively free and fair presidential election in early 2004 political instability increased in 2007 resulting in president saakashvilis resignation in order to hold snap presidential election which he won his stated intention in holding the snap election was to restore stability by pledging more open and responsive political system that will better address quality of life concerns the united states has provided most assistance for democratization to armenia and somewhat less for georgia us aid for democratization in azerbaijan was explicitly permitted by congress in fy1998 and thereafter the 2003 armenian presidential and legislative elections did not mark substantive further democratization according to some observers more positively armenias may 2007 legislative elections demonstrated improvement and were conducted largely in accordance with international standards for democratic elections according to the conclusions made by observers from the osce coe and the eu however these observers still raised some concerns over progovernment party domination of electoral commissions the low number of candidates in constituency races and inaccurate campaign finance disclosures 158 election observers from the osce coe and the eu stat ed that armenias february 2008 presidential election mostly met osce commitments in the preelection period and during voting hours but that serious challenges to some commitments did emerge especially after election day this displayed an insufficient regard for standards ssential to democratic elections and devalued the overall election process in particular the vote count demonstrated deficiencies of accountability and transparency159 in the case of azerbaijan irregularities during the 1998 presidential election municipal elections in 1999 the 2000 legislative race and the 2003 presidential contest were viewed as evidence of halting pluralism by many observers although osce monitors reported largescale irregularities during the 2005 legislative election particularly in votecounting the us administration viewed the race as indicating the azerbaijani governments commitment to democratization 160 election observers from the osce coe and the eu

security and independence of the south caucasian states russia has appeared to place greater strategic importance on maintaining influence in the south caucasus region than in much of central asia except kazakhstan it s early determination to remain closely involved in the region included its pressure on azerbaijan and georgia in 1993 to get them to join the cis and sign the collective security treaty and on georgia to acquiesce to russian military bases on its soil 163 the elevation of vladimir putin to russias presidency marked more coordinated and activist russian stance toward the region thenacting president putin approved national security concept in january 2000 that termed foreign efforts to weaken russias position in the south caucasus or to thwart integrative processes in the cis as security threats it also calls for protecting russias economic interests in routes for energy flows from the caspian and elsewhere new military doctrine approved by putin also stressed these threats including warnings that nato might intervene in conflicts in the cis such as the nk or abkhaz conflicts as it did in the kosovo region of yugoslavia 164 russias 19992005 chechnya campaign in this view demonstrated putins determination to grasp for regional influence over the south caucasus other observers argue that such russian intentions however may in fact be unattainable because of russias strategic weakness165 putin launched new regional initiatives including an agreement in july 2000 to hold regular biannual caucasus four summits focusing on deepening russias influence through dispute mediation and security cooperation only few ever were held another agreement in september 2000 between russia iran and india called for creating northsouth international transport corridor nstc 166 according to russian media major reasons for pursuing russianoriented nstc included counteracting the regional development of routes bypassing russia such as the btc oil pipeline and scp and

company and azerbaijani and iranian railway officials to form consortium to build 250mile railway from azerbaijans town of astara to irans towns of resht and kazvin this proposed railway if built would link with others to the north and south permitting landbased transport of cargo from europe to the persian gulf and would supplement existing transport by ferry from russian and iranian caspian sea ports 168 armenia has urged russia to refurbish railway through abkhazia and has hoped that georgia would permit transport via this railway169 the presidents of turkey azerbaijan and georgia signed declaration of intent in may 2005 to build railway linking kars in turkey to baku in azerbaijan financing of the railway was agreed upon by the parties in january 2007 and construction began in

democratization and could play stabilizing role in the south caucasus but these hopes largely lapsed in recent years as russia became more authoritarian congressional concerns over russias motives in the eurasian states have been reflected in provisions in ev ery foreign operations appropriations act since fy1994 prohibiting aid to any eurasian state that violates the territorial integrity or

peacekeepers and border troopswas significant during most of the 1990s but temporarily declined in recent years in georgia the first st ep by russia in maintaining military presence in the region was the signing of the cis collective security treaty by armenia russia and others in 1992 which calls for mutual defense consultations russia prevailed on georgia and azerbaijan to join the cis and also sign the tr eaty but they withdrew from the treaty in early 1999 russia secured permission for two military bases in armenia and four in georgia and russian forces help guard the armenianturkish border in 1993 azerbaijan was the first eurasian state to pressure russia to withdraw its troops except at the gabala radar site in northern azerbaijan giving up on closing the site in january 2002 azerbaijan signed 10year lease with russia to permit up to 1500 personnel to man the radar in 1999 georgia assumed full control over guarding its land and sea borders except for some liaison officers at the november 1999 osce summit the south caucasus states joined 27 others in agreeing to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty the treaty adaptation process gave georgia forum to push for reduced russian military presence in georgia and when fully implemented also will provide for reduced russian military presence in the north caucasus to comply with new weapons limits under the treaty russia agreed to reduce weaponry at its bases in georgia to close its bases at gudauta and vaziani by july 2001 and to complete negotiations during 2000 on the status of the other two bases at batumi and akhalkalaki the treaty remained unratified by nato signatories until russia satisfied these and other conditions russia moved some weaponry from the bases in georgia to bases in armenia raising objections from azerbaijan on july 1 2001 georgia reported that the vaziani base and airfield had been turned over by russia to georgia the russian government reported in june 2002 that it had closed its gudauta base but announced that 320 troops would remain to guard facilities and support peacekeepers who would relax at the base at its december 2002 ministerial meeting the osce hailed the gudauta closureover georgias objections that the base was not under its controland appeared unwilling to press russia on terminating the other bases at the meeting the united states voiced hope that russia would make progress in meeting its cfe commitments more determined stance was taken by the osce in subsequent fora russia asserted that it needed 300 million to 1 billion and three to ten years to close the other two bases russian defense minister sergey ivanov stated in june 2005 that about 2500 russian troops were at the bases putting pressure on russia to abide by its commitments the georgian legislature in march 2005 passed resolution calling for russia to come to an agreement by midmay on closing the bases by january 2006 or face various restrictions on base operations this

cold war era bases were not of strategic importance to russia on june 27 2007 russia formally handed over the akhalkalaki base to georgias control on november 21 2007 the russian foreign ministry proclaimed that the batumi base had been closed and that russia had fully accomplished its obligations to georgia on the withdrawal of military facilities georgia continued to protest that the gudauta base retained some russian forces and equipment and had not been handed over to georgias control it also continued to call for either the removal of russian peacekeepers from abkhazia and south ossetia or their incorporation into larger international peacekeeping force russias military force withdrawals from georgia temporarily made its presence in armenia more significant in terms of regional influence armenia has argued that the russian bases provide for regional stability by protecting it from attack the total number of russian troops in armenia has been estimated at about 3500 russia has supplied many weapons to armeniaincluding s300 missiles mig29 fighters and some of the equipment relocated from georgia as part of the base closure processwhich azerbaijan views as destabiliz ing in addition to this military influence in the region russia has about 90000 troops in the north caucasus area that it can use to intimidate the region other russian forces along the regions borders include the black sea fleet and the caspian flotilla the latter has been expanded in recent years while the former faced dwindling funding until 2003 armenia is the base for regional air defense system russian military forces from the north caucasus and the black sea fleet invaded georgia in august 2008 after the conflict russia substantially enlarged its military presence in the south caucasus with its establishment of military bases in abkhazia and south ossetia each containing about 3500 troops until late 2006 it appeared that russia was trying to develop closer security ties with azerbaijan to counter us influence russia was concerned about possible us plans to seek greater security presence and feared that us assistance would permit azerbaijan to bolster its caspian sea navy challenging russian naval predominance in february 2003 framework agreement on azerbaijanrussia military cooperation accord was signed opening the possibility of russian military training and arms sales to azerbaijani forces however such cooperation has appeared minor perhaps because azerbaijans aim in signing the agreement was to persuade the united states to offer more security assistance among other russiaazerbaijan security cooperation in may 2005 the interior police ministers of the two countries signed an accord to cooperate on antiterrorism and announced that

cooperation but aliyev reportedly would not agree to support the creation of russialed caspian sea naval security alliance or commit to greater azerbaijani use of russian oil export pipelines after
