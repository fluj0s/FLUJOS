postal service the act funds the accounts at 2799 billion including mandatories before scorekeeping by the congressional budget office cbo the consolidated fy2000 funding measure pl 106113 signed november 29 1999 requires cut by 038 in all accounts the administrations budget to be submitted in early february will contain report on the exact amounts of cuts for each of the accounts the senatepassed version of hr 2490 would have funded the accounts at 2777 billion and the house at 278 billion the presidents fy2000 budget submitted february 1 1999 requested funding level of 27997 billion for the mandatory and discretionary accounts this is an increase over the fy1999 level enacted at just under 27 billion in regular appropriations with additional emergency funding cbo scores the total for the fy2000 funding at 282 billion the mandatories are 145 billion and the discretionary funding are 137 billion in summary pl 10658 prior to the acrosst heboard cut funds the department

more than the senate passed for fy2000 one principle point of difference is the funding for the internal revenue service irs both the house and senate would have substantially cut funding in several of the irs accounts see table 4 for specifics although the total appropriation for the us postal service equals the request by the administration only 29 million of the 934 million is available in

senatepassed versions would have funded the office of national drug control policy ondcp at about 10 million over the request the major differences between the chamber action and the act are in the funds appropriated to the president which are funds the ondcp transfers to other entities for drug control efforts the independent agencies are funded at 149 billion that is 91 million less than requested 166 million more than houseenacted and 25 million more than senateenacted funding for the general services administration and the national archives and records administration represent the

not reflect scorekeeping by the congressional budget office see the glossary for definitions of discretionary and mandatory spending in some instances the mandatory levels drive up the percent of

funding levels provided in the text unless otherwise noted reflect the mandatory and discretionary funding combinedomb provided guidance regarding general principles the agencies should use to identify cuts the 038 cut must not be imposed across the board but targeted to reflect areas of higher and lower priority reductions need to come from least critical funding reductions should be considered from funding that congress enacted above the presidents request wherever possible reductions in force from personnel according to omb the law also imposed the condition that reduction in any single program could exceed 15 of its total in other words the law did not permit an entire program to be eliminated in order to count toward the savings necessary for given department at least 85

tobacco firearms and explosives while these laws prohibit certain illegal activities they also regulate legal activities related to these commodities atf also enforces federal laws related to arson in enforcing federal law atf officers often work closely with other federal state and local law enforcement officers atfs mission is focused on three goals 1 reducing crime 2 collecting revenue and 3 protecting the public for fy2000 pl 10658 provides atf with 605879000 in total funding an amount that includes direct appropriation of 565959000 for the salaries and expenses account and an additional appropriation of 40920000 from the violent crime reduction trust fund in conference report language conferees directed the department of treasury to allocate another 34947000 from the treasury asset forfeiture fund for atf the atf direct appropriation of 565959000 is 110000 0 less than the amount proposed by the house and 4386000 less than the amount proposed by the senate also the amount is 2

in total funding this funding will allow atf to expand this program from 27 to 37 cities in fy2000 of this amount 39000000 is earmarked in atfs direct appropriation the additional 12320000 is earmarked for atf from the violent crime reduction trust fund also included in this trust fund is an earmark of 13000000 for atfs gang resistance education and assistance training grant program and another 3000000 for atf to administer this program in addition the conferees earmarked 500000 0 to expand the integrated ballistic identification system as earmarked in the house report language the

examine commercial enterprises that re import us cigarettes in an attempt to bypass taxes and licensing fees among atfs activities the regulation and enforcement of laws related to firearms commerce and possession appear to be the most controversial consistent with language included in atf appropriations in previous years the agencys appropriations bill language specifies that agency funding cannot be used to consolidate or centralize the records or any portion of the records of the acquisition and disposition of firearms that are maintained by federal firearm licensees in addition the

requirements for child care facilities operated by federal agencies including legislative and judicial branch agencies for their employees the provision would require that executive facilities meet state or local licensing standards within six months of the legislations enactment and comply with or have made substantial progress towards complying with standards set by state or nationally recognized accreditation entity within three years of enactment the senate bill also would have required regulations set by the administrator of general services establishing health and safety standards for federal agency child care programs legislative agency facilities would be required to meet state or nationally recognized accreditation entitys standards within one year of the bills enactment if the legislative facility does not maintain accreditation it must follow regulations less stringent than those of executive agency facilities judicial branch facilities would also be required to meet regulatio ns issued by the administrative office of the united states courts pertaining to licensing and accreditation that are less stringent than those of executive branch agencies executive branch agencies would be authorized to use agency funds to provide child care for employees and to improve the affordability of such care for lowincome employees the amendment would also

federal agencies not including the general accounting office to use agency funds to provide child care services in facility owned or leased by the agency for employees of the agency provided these

has some significant pay provisions and is gaining good deal of attention by provisions that are absent specific rates for all affected pay systems will be promulgated in late december or early january through an executive order presidents pay section 644 provides that effective noon january 20 2001 the pay of the president will be increased to 400000 per annum it has been 200000 since january 1969 there is constitutional proscription on increasing or decreasing the pay of president during the term for which he was elected therefore mr clinton will not benefit from this increase the president must pay federal income tax on his salary there is an official expense allowance of 50000 that allowance which has been the same rate since 1949 can be used for official purposes only is not subject to income tax any unused portion reverts to the us treasury members of congress and other federal officials under the provisions of the ethics reform act of 198931 members and other officials of congress the vice president executive branch officials and federal judges are to receive an annual adjustment in pay adjustments are based on the percent of change in the private sector wages and salaries element of the employment cost index eci minus 05 they are to go into effect at the same time as and at rate greater than the rate adjustments for the general schedule the rate of change in the private sector december 1997 to december 1998 was 39 therefore the rate of pay adjustment effective january 2000 for federal officials will be 34 the significance of this bill to the pay adjustment for federal officials is that since 1995 with the exception of the adjustment in january 1998 congress has acted legislatively to deny themselves and other federal officials the annual adjustment the legislative vehicle for that denial has been the treasury appropriations bill federal judges salary adjustments are subject to further legislative activity while the ethics reform act includes those adjustments in the automatic mechanism there is further statutory restriction32 congress has required that they specifically authorize any such adjustment traditionally that authorization has come through the commerce state justice and judiciary appropriations the fy2000 appropriations bill for those accounts hr 2670 as it passed the senate contains

has been an increase for other federal officials federal employees general schedule federal employees under the general schedule gs and related pay systems will receive 48 pay adjustment effective the first pay period beginning on or after january 1 2000 section under the provisions of 5 usc 5303 the national gs base pay adjustment is to be 38 it is assumed that since the president did not present an alternative plan to congress that rate will go into effect the remaining 1 is to be used for localitybased payments 5 usc 5304 the explanatory language for section 646 of the bill as found in the conference report states the conferees have not made the language more specific so that the president may exercise his discretion to distribute any amount allocated for comparability based locality payments in the most appropriate fashion among the pay localities established by the presidents pay agent33 the president would generally have until the end of november to submit an alternate plan relating to localitybased comparability payments however since the statute specifies the total pay adjustment and in effect limits it to percenta ge rate lower than would be effective under 5 usc 5304 it may not be necessary for the president to submit such plan both the house and senatepassed versions of the treasury bill had assumed federal civilian pay increase of 44 in january 2000 the senate committee report stated that in order to stay within its 302b allocations both budget authority and outlays had to be reduced without harming essential programs therefore the committee said that it was forced to deny all requests for additional funding to cover the remaining months of the calendar year 1999 statutory annual pay adjustment employees whose salaries are administratively determined and who do not receive the governmentwide adjustm ents were the only exception to this acrosstheboard reduction34 the housepassed but not the senatepassed treasury bill included statement relating to the sense of the congress on the federal civilian pay adjustment president clinton had proposed 44 pay adjustment for federal employees in his fy 2000 budget this amount was the overall average

throughout the united states those surveys are conducted but the pay adjustments have been limited through language in the treasury bill for several years other the senior executive service ses and
