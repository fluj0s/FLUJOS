talk on tv demo finding rrs lecture given on 20 february 1963 and well have rundown now on these demonstrations well now the first session you saw there wasthere was lot of noise and confusion and upset right there at the start that was very messy session start the proper sequence of session start does not include upsetting the pc if you want to get rocket read keep the pc calm show him pictures of pretty girls smooth him out but dont start banging cans around and so forth what you do is you adjust the pcs chair you clear the room with the pc you say its all right to audit in this room you dont meter that and then you get can squeeze and then you put in the wellknown rfactor and then you start the session and that sequence is never varied now as far as the meter reading is concerned here you called clean on an equivocal read auditor did that couple of times and of course the next time you call it its very often wrong now i notice that youre doing something here which is quite interesting to and which i myself abandoned some long time ago it runs like this you say on this list has anything been suppressed bang you see on this list has anything been suppressed finally the pc says and you say all right i will check that on the meter and you check it on the meter if you get read you ask the pc again now the way youre doing it is way thati know you havent been told this so its not your faultfor once its not your fault i mean you want to mark this day down as thea golden day in the history of the briefing course because today we have found something that wasnt your fault it was my fault of course im getting clear now you see and already first goal clear practically secondgoal clear so you see i can afford the tremendous majesty of being wrong you cant afford that yet see so this wasnt your fault but the actual right way to do this so as not to upset the pc is simply to repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive until he says and then say all right i will check it on the meter take it over to the meter and stay on the meter dont go off on to repetitive again you see youve got repetitive rudiments mixed up with prepchecking now you ordinarily can expect over long period of time in problems intensive something like thatyou can expect great deal of this kind of nonsense you see you can expect the pc to have brandnew stream of answers and so forth so when you prepcheck as you would be doing in the unit why for sure go back and say all right anything been suppressed been suppressed been suppressed been suppressed ill check that on the meter check it on the meter still dirty all right come off of it been suppressed been suppressed been suppressed check it on the meter and so forth because youve got tons of answers back of this kind of thing but notnot when youre running him on rudiments when you say been suppressed and he said you say all right ill check that on the meter and just ride it with the meter from there on out from there on out its fast check you see that will make life much simpler to you and itll save you lot of auditing time and itll save you all of this nonsense about reads and not reads and youll stay with the meter and itll upset you less and i think youll find out thats very good way to handle it now this auditor i hope you dont mind my mentioning this actually you look like bundle of nerves onon there your presence smooth it out man smooth it out get those overts off or something like that because an auditor should look smooth and calm and inspire great calm in the pc do you see thats much to be desired and work on your auditor presence there little bit and get your overts off on this that and the other thing and youll be doing better okay offense meant im just trying to help you be good auditor now the reason the item didnt fire here probably was because the goal wasnt firing now theif goal isnt firing the item fires rather poorly and while it is true that if goal is firing badly or not at all you get reads on the list and can check out ris and that sort of thing actually when the goal is not firing at all the read is vastly inhibited and that doesnt say that if the goal isnt firing you wont get read on an ri you understand because you could actually have read on an ri with goal not firing but if you want to speed up this fire on the ri and have your list fire better and so forth keep your goal cleaned up now in actual fact in 3m the goal starts in fires very sporadically at first and then starts firing beautifully oh gorgeously big stuff and then goes into one rocket read and two rock slams and three rock slams and two rocket reads and one rock slam you understand rock slam gets mixed up in this you tiger drill it bit put in your big mid ruds actually on it which is much better to make goal read and youll find out those rock slams turn back into rocket reads again now you go little bit further and the goal will start rocket reading again pow pow pow its reading fine providing your listing is all right and not backwards and upside down and the setup here in brief is that goal goes from very very hard to make it firea lot of prepchecking and so forth and it reads and then itspc sneezes and it doesnt read and so forthinto bad read on the list but reading bit better reading more consistently youre not paying attention to the goal dont you see but keep listing items not wrong way to items and so forth but right way to items your goal will fire better and better and better and then finally turns into rock slam and inversus rock slam one time rocket readthats in the same callyou see to be catfishrock slam to be catfish rocket read to be catfishrock slam that goes from that phase the chrysalis phase of the goalit goes from there on down to fires well and then it begins to fire early and late you say to be rocket read catfish you see to be catfish rocket read you see it starts firing way offbeat thats by the time youve gotten threequarters of its items off of it and then when youve finally moved down to the line your goal starts firing automatically and youll find some item sometime and that goal particularly the first goal starts going pow pow pow pow and your tone arm is coming down and youre not even saying it justthe meter is just rocket reading itself on down very interesting phenomenon and it goes from there into read at all and that doesnt mean all the items are off of it you find one more item and the goal rocket reads and then doesnt rocket read and youll find maybe one more item or patching up the line plot and for moment the goal rocket reads and then after that it is dead you cant get anything out of it with whip theres nothing nothing there and speaking about getting something out of goal with whip lets take up this next session now may isyoure much better these days i your auditor presence is much better and fine id cure myself of this glasses trick if i were you you cant hypnotize him with those shiny lenses you know i know youre probablygot some kind of glass that you cant see the pc well but its mannerism you can do without all right now this goal that was being checked out on dick has rocket read couple of times and is actually just being in the process of being prepchecked and checked out and goal in that queasy condition probably is in state to be shown on tv so once more we didnt get rocket read now i wont say the goal is it or isnt it but i notice with some horror looking over this pcs 212 history that the dance that was being played was to find anwrite list and abandon it and write list and abandon it and write list and abandon it i dont know how many of this times this has been done but itd been done almost something ridiculous like about twenty times something like that and then they finally found an item finally found an item who would oppose being clear something like that and it did beautifully lets see whats that item give that list over there female voice its person who wants to do the right thing yeah the item was person who wants to do the right thing and i think after they listed 8765 pages they decided the pc was turning black so they didnt do anything about it well thats an exaggeration they only listed 20 or 30 pages you see pure idiocy i mean youd get the last rs you see on the list and you go 50 items beyond it and if your tone arm is flat during that period or if it isnt flat just thatthats it take it now that actually should be completed on this pc that thing isshould be packaged up now if you cant find the rs the item on that oppose list to this or this opposing well do it the otherother way to and find the item which opposes it because i see very peculiarly that the goal is being checked is to be right and the item here is person who wants to do the right thing i think theyre so mixed up that youre going to have an awful time trying to check the thing out so i think you ought to get fourway package on that pc and then check out the goal thats the easy way to do it now if you can get thean oppterm proper and correct oppterm you can actually list goals against this oppterm the way we were doing it with 3ga criss cross if that were if you were the oppterm why what goal couldnt you have and youll come up with that pcs goal like that those are trick ways of finding goals however you still apparently could keep on listing this goals list is only about thousand long and you could go right on listing this goals list from there on watching your meter very carefully and you would see that some goal would fire on the thing there have been rrs on the goals list in spite of all that now what i was getting around to is you cant make rocket read read better by shouting the goal to the pc this must be in calm even tone of voice you dont wanthonest the meter doesnt respond better the louder as matter of fact quite the contrary look over your effect scale and if you say the item in normal tone of voice youre much more likely to get read so dont say it in conversational tone of voice say it in crisp tone of voice like to be catfish to be catfish now this is something that auditors do that id better call to your attention they say to be catfish didnt read you see so then they saythey say to be catfish and that didnt read either to be catfish you know i caught myself doing it once and i thought id better warn you i didnt do it again so you dont have to either but there is point in calling the goal louder it wont make the read come on better so on well i think may is doing fine there i think the pc i think the pc with all those listshow do you survive them but anyway theyve got fine item there and all it needs is to be opposed and fourway package run on the thing and the pc will feel fine as far as rocket reads are concerned as i say you could go right on with the list and list the things out now we come to this last session and aside from missed suppressed read and couple of other things like that peters auditors presence there is very good he has very good control of it and so forth i think he did fine i have actually comment to make beyond couple of fluky reads on the auditors auditing but i do have great deal to say about how he didnt get rocket read on this one now he didnt get rocket read on this one becausewell the pc is listening to this so i ill ask the rest of you to listen and ill only talk over on the right side of the room all right yourthe right side of your room there im only going to talk over there and then the pc he can listen over on your left all right now this pc has done sales talk apparently and everything that comes uphe was even bringing it up in the lecture tonighti mean in the demonstration he has whole stream of oppterms here which are all the baddies there isnt single creditable oppterm from the top to the bottom and all of his terminals here are all creditable you mean that pcs goal never deteriorated is that what were trying to say here and of course that goal wont read theres at least two or three of these itemsone two three four five six seven eight nine tenten items perhaps as many as five of them been listed backwards and thats very very certain to knock the goal out now the waythe way you straighten up line plot like this youve got over here on the original line plot the oppterms baddie the terminal good bad oppterm terminal good bad oppterm you get the idea now the pc of course wants to keep up his social caste and so naturally he will try to give you an offbeat on that kind of thing but in actual fact hes doing himself in you dont care really about the significance of things but you can take one of these line plots you can take one of these things and look it over and find out why the case is blowing up and its blowing up because at the top of your line plot on the terminal you have at the beginning of one of these things at the top it comes right on down the line from discreditable halfway down the plot sort of neutral and all the way down at the bottom very germane to the goal very germane quite opposite at the top of the terminals list you see not germane to the goal and thats the way it goes thats the cycle it starts in from degraded some fellow the other day picked up the hightoned one and said well it was really degraded the auditor bought it auditor evidently doesnt believe in the mechanical test that you make mechanical tests are whats important this is what you do as an instructor when youre looking these things over you just make your mechanical tests each time and youll be there your mechanical tests consist of reading the line question one way oppose and then the other way oppose read it one way three times read it the other way three times see which one turns on the most mass or so forth the one that turned on the most upset isnt it now on the oppterm side you get the exact reverse cycle you get hightoned oppterm as your first oppterm and then that dwindles down halfway down the list to maybe ten oppterms later or something like that that is turned into very opposite thing to the goal its now completely opposite to the goal so and in the middle ground there why maybe five six oppterms from the top of the plot and you will find that its neutral thing so you have sort of neutral versus neutral there in the middle of the graph and then it goes down and it becomes very opposite to the goal not necessarily degraded one shouldnt use the idea of degraded terminal if you dont understand it it isit is the idea of counterbutton really its counter to the goals sense and meaning thats what we get now thats whats wrong with that pc and thats why you didnt see that but of course he was reading an item that had already been listed just take up this last item here this thing will have to be straightened out and this auditor has only one fault and some of you dont tell him i said this dont tell him i said this because ill leave that up to somebody screaming it in his ear with foghorn one of these days he just wont list twentyfive items beyond the last rs or rr and also hes having an awful hard time telling whether something rocket read or not and looky here now now im going to show you something right here now looky here were going to take piece of paper here dont you see and were going to lay it along side of the emeter you understand you can pretend this is an meter and youre looking at the back of it and heres the auditor and heres the piece of paper now do you see that piece of papers closer to you and here it is back here on my side you understand and as your meter sits there you can go ahead and monitor the tone arm here and you can also bring this hand across and you can slide that up dont you see you slide that up but right close to this meter you understand close to the meter dont pull this one this really is not proper because your face gets so far awaygets so far away from the meter face that you cant see it now here is what the hpa aspirant in the course in darwinthis is the way he does it he comes over here and hes got the emeter over here see so he looks over here and he looks over here and he lists over here and he looks back here and so forth in other wordstoo far apart the way you want that is that paperbang see you understand right there up against that meter you see that and slide it up as you go and youll find your eye you 3ee your eye course here is looking right straight across that meter face right across the meter face and youreyoure always writing with the meter faceyou understand your paper moves up not your pencil down you understand you move your paper up and in that way you get yourself sight across the meter face now you try that the next time youre auditing and youll beyoull be much better off i know you cant see something like that you cantyou cant see anything better than this you cant see anything with that meter downstairs because of course the meters way out in front of somebody and person is listing this way its perfectly all right the meter has to be placed that way so that you can see the meter and the only way you could do that is get the meter propped up and slide this paper underneath the corner of it and keep it going forward you could do something like that but look at look at the point as long as you have meter face over here and your list over here see here you are on your list and you say lawp dwa raw wy daw zawwell i missed that one so heres question mark rr and is it something happened there and i cant quite see it and so forth so question mark question mark oh youre not going to get anyplace man keep that together and this is wrong in front of the meter here thats wrong dont bother with that get it right over here at the side ive been watching an expert do it that way so i know it works i myself have been doing it that way and by the way by the way just to give you another good point here you have some trouble with this colliding with this corner because thats flat on the table and you know these rubber feet that come on the bottom of the meterif youll screw one of those rubber feet down here at the lower edge of the meter the meter tips up and leaves gapsee theres little bitgap left in there and your paper can shove up through the gap you got the idea pretty good youve got to keep your eye in line with that meter face while youre writing if you dont you have all of these other difficulties and youve got to go fifty beyond your last rs i dont care if the tone arm is what you call flat or not ityouve got to go at least fifty youve got to go twentyfive beyond those rrs and fifty beyond the last rr or rs on the source list and youve just got to do that youll continue to lay eggs if you dont do that i notice onthat two rrs gave tiny read now please what does that tell you it tells you the list is incomplete all right he comes back later and tries to complete the list but in actual fact there is question mark rr here question mark rr on this list which is female voice twenty only twenty items from the end where the pcwhere the auditor stopped listing and then he continued the list and of course the tone arm now is high on continued list and that sort of thing i dont believe the pcs very much insession i should think the pc would be getting his head knocked off with all of these things backwards you know as pc you ought to any one of you as pc where it comes to these items dont get so socially conscious and go out on big sell its what the auditor says it is and you just answer up to the tests and youll do much much better we got two auditors as pcs out in the z unit who always march forward to the hard sell the second an item comes up weve got hard sell going they hire batten barton durstine and osborn to sell this item and so forth we got another pc out there that it doesnt matter where it occurs and if it rrs why apparently its some other thing on the list well the auditor of course sensibly takes the read and carries on and hell probably find out that theres an item which is doing this thats beside the point now we didnt see any rrs tonight why well youre just not going by the rules the middle one we cant expect that because the middle sessionmiddle demonstration because the goal had not been found the goal was being interfered with with the item perhaps if that item were tiger drilled it might rocket read and shed be away without goal you understand if shes getting an occasional rocket read out of this all she might have to do is just tiger drill that rs that was found and it will subside to rocket read and she is away and she can do two or three she can do two or three items there and then ask the pc what his goal is and shell get it but the point im making herethe point im making here is your rrs arent coming on not because your rudiments are out but because youre not following close enough in on the laws of routine 3m thats all there is to it well let tell you if after youve got half dozen items you havent got rocket read oh man if you havent got rocket read two or three inches long after youve got two or three packages off of one of these goals u ought to quit the best way in the world to make goal read is to get three right way to listed packages all going off according to the clock and then go back and read your goal youll be surprised you havent done ittiger drilled it at allyou call it and it goes bang well ive taken look here and none of you have seen rocket read i meant to demonstrate one so i said to suzie i said would you like to go down and put there in the pcs chair and read my last item up of course youre not going to get ayoure not going to get rocket read on something thats been listed down but the last item i had doesnt happen to have been listed and its about that long and its one of these pow rocket reads most of my rocket reads on the second goal look like something that should be sent down to cape canaveral so that they can get their rocket program off the launching pad because your meter really starts functioning when you come out of the first goal area all right well i thought your auditing was pretty good and nothing detrimental can be said about the auditing that has been done by this auditor on this pc but the other two are simply suffering from just not being steered in the right direction with 3mnot going according to the rules now it took about 150 hours so i could run something that vaguely looked like thisincluded all of the pilot work on routine 2 and i really wasnt feeling comfortable about knowing how to run it until id done that much auditing on it now i allow you certain leeway i allow you certain amount of fumble but what i want to see is less fumble day by day and more accuracy day by day and if i dont see some improvement ill come to the conclusion that youre your own best oppterm all i want to see is an improvement in what youre doing and i think we can see that if you dont understand 3m better on wednesday than you did on monday and if you dont look and sound like better auditor on friday than you did on wednesday or getting more done then id say you were wound up in some hopeless confusion back on the line someplace and you didnt know what you were doing in the first place and you better get your checksheets passed because your progress as an auditor ought to be fairly rapid and youre not going to have anything shifting under your feet now so there isnt much reason to do other than have good progress as an auditor now youll run into problems as an auditor problems of getting on an rs which has disappeared now thats tough problem im fighting that problem all rs to rs you know that kind of aof aof an action and you have to get back and settle it and square it up but it can be done and i expect that youll hit these difficulties and carry on but where you have pcs goal and where you are finding items honest its the most easy certain mechanical job you can do and you just should be going on pocketapocketapocketa and tonight i should have seen in two of those sessions all kinds of rocket reads so i know that your routine 3 is being done with big fumble now get on the ball learn how to do it straighten it out and youll have pcs firing off as though theyre being sent to the moon as far as the quality of the auditing is concerned as can be expected in z unit the quality of the auditing is very good i have fault to find with it all right there is your demonstration and thank you very very much and lets give the auditors big hand thank you now lets give the pcs big hand thank you all right so here we are thats the end of our wednesday night demonstration and good night and see you tomorrow
