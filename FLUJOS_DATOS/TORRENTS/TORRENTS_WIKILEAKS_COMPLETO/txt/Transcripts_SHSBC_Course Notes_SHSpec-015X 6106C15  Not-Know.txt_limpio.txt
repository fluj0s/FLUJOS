6106c15 shspec15x notknow theres mechanical side and thought side of boiloff one is prone to worry when the pc boils off but it is only matter of concern if the auditor ceases to audit because of it the mechanical definition of boiloff is stuck flow lot of stuck flows got parked on the track and when the pc hits them he boils off most of the time when the pc goes unconscious if you kept giving the auditing command the pc would keep on doing it at about the same speed or bit slower as when he was awake because the pc isnt really unconscious if he didnt hear you theres harm done it s not an implant situation he comes right through it the thought definition of boil off is that it is the accumulated notknow the pc has run on everybody unconsciousness is merely the intensification of notknowingness you could even run notknow in the course of being kind by not telling people that theyre upsetting or bugging people they will make enemies who eventually hit them surprising them because one told them they were messing people up immanuel kant introduced notknow into philosophy with his transcendentalism this killed philosophy until scientology came around the greek philosophies amounted to this if you couldnt lick them confuse them with entertainment and philosophy this outcreation with philosophy and entertainment was very effective means of conquest many philosophies have been mere dramatizations of prehav levels relying for their force on bank agreement by observing what people underline in books you can see that what people go for is what agrees with their banks one gets into this frame of mind as result of thinking truth is merely subjective there is broad truth this is the philosophy of the only one solipsism also general semantics then theres dale carnegies 11ism which tries to communicate with an unreality they run notknow on people by being nice and the people sense it too where reality is not present notknow is substituted for it an unreality is created whenever you substitute an unknown for known communism does this well with the iron curtain or take someone who always says im fine when you ask how are you theyre substituting nonfact for an observable fact giving you an unreality that eventually makes then disappear curious phenomena will occur around someone who is doing this they eventually do disappear but if theres terrific notknow about someone he persists like mad for instance the monk dharma who lived 10000 years ago in india formed the basis for most indian religions but nothing is known about him or what he said the leastknown philosopher is someone whose name we dont even know hes influential in the background of laotse confucius and buddha he is held in place by the notknow this is dharma who is not even thought of now as person but as fate on personal level notknow shows up as boiloff an extreme manifestation is unconsciousness at lesser level its death notknow at its most extreme is when person cannot go unconscious we call that insanity death is state of beingness not an action unconsciousness is lower well below death one can get knocked off and go on knowing what is happening insanity is where person cannot notknow the fifteenth substitute for reality delusory state they worry about these things laying in wait for them theyre in state of combat with the unknowable this can go on the tone scale on level of notknow from serenity about the unknowable on down they may seem fairly sane at the top but they dont know what it is they dont know about and are looking for they get down to grief about not having found out what it is they dont know about the guy will also be utterly fixed on the track if you know what you are unhappy or bugged about you are not insane merely wondering the fact that you can wonder why demonstrates that you are not insane knowing this one wont be baffled about insanity for bafflement is just q and with notknowingness the reason one gets worried about the insane case is q and of trying to find out what the case doesnt know what he doesnt know is notknow if you can speculate about what you dont know you will be ok you can introduce some sanity into someone who is spinning by getting him to think of one person who doesnt think he is insane because you have introduced knowingness into his unknowingness or you could use one command look around here and find something which is really real to you
