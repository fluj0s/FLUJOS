affecting inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs summary medicare spending on postacute care either those services provided in facility after an acute hospitalization or home health services provided to eligible beneficiaries in the community has elicited increasing attention as program spending on these services has grown beneficiar ies can receive postacute care in multiple settings elevating the importance of identif ying the most appropriate costeffective setting to provide necessary care recen t implementation of prospective payment systems for the different settings has amplified concerns that postacute providers are making decisions about bene ficiaries rehabilitative care in response to financial incentives rather than deciding on the basis of which setting is the most appropriate for the care needs of the patient inpatient rehabilitation fac ilities irfs are on postacute provide r participating in medicare irfs either freestanding hosp itals or distinct units

medicare beneficiaries were treated for one or more specified conditions during its most recently completed 12month cost reporting period by january 1984 the 10 qualif ying conditions were established

monary disorders and cardiac disorders be included were not accepted 4 the temporary suspension did not appear to increase the number of nonqualifying patients treated by irfs from 1996 to 2002 there has been steady substantial downward trend in the percentage of medicare cases counted in one of the ten conditions however the decline was steeper from 1996 to 1999 than from 1999 to 2002 in 1996 594

75 rule due to concerns that the regulations had not been cons istently applied among the di fferent contractors the contractors were directed to continue their verification activities for existing irfs but not change any facilitys status until systematic assessment of the different review procedures was completed and further guidance was issued4 in addition to this review of fi admin istrative procedures cms analyzed irf claims data from the first eight mont hs of 2002 submitted under the new payment system to estimate the overall compliance with the existing 75 rule5 subject to certain caveats cms estimated that only 1335 of the 1170 irfs would meet the 75 threshold the percentage in co mpliance would increase to 2517 if the threshold was lowered to 656 the percentage of irfs in compliance varied significantly by region and by certain facility characteristics7 cms indicated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32640crs4 7 continued 16 2003 8 according to the may 2003 pr oposed rule nationally less than 25 of medicare beneficiaries with joint replacements are admitted to irfs after surgery 9 the detailed description indicates that thre or more major joints would need to be significantly affected these conditions shoul d not have improved after an appropriate aggressive sustained course of outpatient th erapy preceding the admission also joint replaced by prosthesis is considered to l onger have arthritis even though that condition was the reason for the joint replacement 10 the secondary condition or comorbidity must cause significant decline in the patients functioning that even in the absence of the admitting condition the patient would require intensive treatment unique to an irf rather than in another settingpatients with lower extr emity joint replacements specifically knee and hip replacements are the largest gr oup treated by ir fs that do not count toward compliance with the 75 rule8 modifications to the 75 rule cms publis hed proposed regulations to change the classification criteria for irfs in the september 9 2003 federal register under this proposal absent further regulatory actions the compliance threshold would be lowered to 65 until january 1 2007 when it would revert to its origin 75 standard also among other changes cms proposed to replace the condition of polyarthritis with three other arthritisrelated c onditions which would bring the to tal number of qualifying primary conditions to 129 cms proposed two alternatives where patients with secondary medical conditions in those 12 categories would also count toward the compliance threshold until january 1 200710 one alternative was limited to counting secondary conditions only for patients with joint re placements the other would count secondary conditions for any admission cms declin ed the requests to add cancer cardiac pulmonary and pain conditions as qualifying criteria in part because of lack of studies that demonstrate an improvement in patients outcomes when cared for in irfs as compared to other settings cms issued the final rule on may 7 2004 w ith an effective date of july 1 2004 in the final rule cms adopted several policy changes first it replaced polyarthritis with four arthritisrelate d conditions for total of 13 qualifying conditions specifically patient with vere or advanced osteoart hritis involving two or more major joints not including joint that has been replaced will count toward facilitys compliance threshold second cer tain beneficiaries w ith bilateral joint replacements who are extremely obese or 85 years and older will count toward facilitys compliance third cms adopted its more expansive proposal to consider secondary conditions for ll patients not just t hose who have had joint replacements this provision expires for costreporting periods on or after july 1 2007 fourth cms adopted threeyear transition period for the compliance threshold as follows at 50 from july 1 2004 and before july 1

pleased by the lowe ring of the compliance standards the temporary relief is not seen as addressing overriding concerns with the regulation particularly need to modernize the comp liance standards in the long run they perceive that facilities will be compelled to revise admission policies which will result in large scale denial of access to irf care12 also industry advocates have raised concerns with respect to the implementing instructions issued to the medicare contractors by cms among other issues the standard for pr oviding appropriate aggressive and sustained therapy in another less intensive setting prior to an irf admission is seen as burdensome for providers and costly to beneficiaries other objections about the recordkeeping nd documentation requirements have been expressed

and by th iom differed on whether additional conditions should be added to the irf compliance list but agreed that condition alone does not provide sufficient criteri to identify the types of patients appropriately treated at an irf functional status shoul d also be considered in addition certain experts sugge sted that facility characteristics be used to classify irfs gao recommended that medicare contract ors routinely review irf admissions for medical necessity that cms encourage re search on the effectiveness of intensive inpatient rehabilitation nd that cms use the research and other information to refine the rule to describe more thoroughly the subgroups of patients with given condition that are appr opriately treated in an irf in responding to the gao report cms has generally concu rred with these recommendations but stated that implementing other criteria to identify subg roups of appropriate ly treated patients could result in more restrictive policy than currently implemented and thus would have to be carefu lly considered in the course of its mandated ir f study gao interviewed 10 officials representing medicare fis and reported that over half were not conducting reviews of patients admitted to irfs those who were doing reviews used different approaches for selecting records or facilitie s to assess cms estimated that less than 1 of admissions in

evaluated cms intends to collaborate with nih to determine how to best promote research into the effectiveness of rehabilitation34 in its press release accompanying the above announcement cms stated that its monitoring efforts had detected significant beneficiary problems in accessing irf services it found that the number of ir f cases increased 12 when comparing utilization in cy2003 to that in

most affected by enforcement of the compliance thresholds however this study based on data representing 77 of the irf facilities and 66 of the medicare discharges shows 13 decline in medi care cases when comparing utilization in cy2003 to that in cy2004 the decline is not supported by cms analysis of its claims data which as indicated earlier shows an 12 increase still industry advocate remain

section will provide general overview of rehabilitation services and postacute care that may be provided by various medicare entities medicare beneficiaries can receive postacute care fro m different types of providers in both inpatient and outpatient settings the availability of care from multiple sites introduces concerns that medicare may be paying different amounts for the different types of postacute care providers for patients with essentially similar needs for care after presenting that basic framework the report will then discuss different medicare payment policies that are unique to irfs the remainder of this section will describe medicare conditions of partic ipation for irfs and discuss the effect of the former costbased reimbursement on irfs the last section of the report will discuss legislative developments shaping the direction of the irfpps it will present payment adjustments within the irfpps and conclude with example showing calculation for fy2006 overview of rehabilitation services and postacute care rehabilitation services consist of physical therapy occupational therapy and speech and language services these services are often furnished to patients following hospital stay or an ambulator surgical procedure and can be provided by number of different medicarecertified pr oviders in either i npatient or outpatient settings the dive rsity in postacute care providers that furnish reha bilitation services provides for considerable variation and flexibility in the duration and intensity of beneficiaries use of rehabilitation services and providers alt hough the range of possible service settings permits patients and their physicians some choice in where beneficiaries receive the most appropri ate care it may also make rehabilitation providers more sensitive to changes in medicares payment policies and procedures36 the term postacute care is commonly used to refer to continuum of service settings where rehabilitation nur sing and other services can be provided to persons following treatment for an acute illness or injury eligible beneficiaries who are referred from the community and use hom health services without

from acute care hospitals used postacute care with snf care being the most common single care setting until the implementation of medicares acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system ipps in 1984 however followup care after hospital st ays accounted for only small part of medicare spending following implementation of ipps and other policy changes affecting snfs and hhas in the late 1980s medicare spending for postacute care began to grow rapidly total program spending for postacute care increased an average of about 21 per year from 1992 to 1997 from 14 billion to 357 billion of this total irf program spending increased from 28 billion in 1992 to 38 billion in 1997 an average increase of 6 per year37 the change in medicares spending trends for postacute care services was attributed to advances in technology combined with the incentives provided by the fixed price payments under ipps for shortterm general hospitals to discharge patients as quickly as possible to other settings for continuing care together with clarifications of coverage policies for certain postacute care settings in response to the rapid expenditure gr owth the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 and subsequent gislation mandated velopment and use of prospective payment systems for all postacute care settings these new payment systems have been implemented gradually

heightened concerns that providers are shifting benefici aries care in response to changing financial incentives provided by the reimbursement methods rather than basi ng the decision for care on the patients medical condition similarly some view medicares varying coverage rules and eligibility criteria as well as the different requirements that postacute providers must meet in order to par ticipate in the program as subject to manipulation39 for example threeday prior hospitalization is required to trigger coverage for inpatient skilled nursing facility care but is not required for other types of inpatient postacute care under medicare in addition the beneficiary must require daily skilled nursing or rehabilitation care beneficiaries who qualify for care in an irf must be medically capable of undergoing at least three hours of rehabilitation per day that is expected to result in signifi cant practical improvement within reasonable period of time medicare beneficiaries have special eligibility requirements in order to receive care in ltch these facilities must only maintain an average inpatient length of stay of at least 25 days medicares requirements for physician involvement in the care provided in the di fferent inpatient settings also varies specifically physicians must be integrally involved in care provided in irfs and ltchs but are required to visit snf pa tient only once every 30 days for the first 90 days and every 60 days thereafter between 1992 and 2005 the supply of all major types of medicare inpatient postacute care providers as well as dicare spending for these providers experienced significant growth as well the number of snfs increased from 12303 to 15632 the number of irfs increased from 907 to 1232 the number of longterm hospitals increased from 97 to 365 ownersh ip of postacute care providers has also been shifting with forprofit status becoming more common within these overall trends the regional distribution of differe nt types of postacute care providers has remained uneven the pattern of postacute care provider us is determined in large part by the supply of partic ular provider types in gi ven area because of wide geographic variation in supply of provide r types utilization patterns even for patients with similar needs may vary widely by geography the difference in the use of postacute care services also likely reflects variations in practice standards as well as availability in this case practice standards are thought to include the inclinations of individual practitioners as affected by regulation and the policies of medicare contractors such as fiscal intermediaries who influence the use of postacute care services under medicare see earlier discussion of the use of lcds40 moreover admissions to postacute care are guided by hospital discharge planner who in rn may be affected by the knowledge of which patients providers are willing to accept41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32640crs15 42 korbin

in 1999 study sponsored by the assistant secretary of planning and evaluation aspe certain hospital characteristics appear to be associated with the type of postacute care to which patients are discharged larger or teaching hospitals for example are more likely than other acute hospitals to discharge patients to irfs proprietary hospitals are more likely than nonprofit hospitals to discharge patients to home health care the study found that there were some interactions between types of postacute care that were used by medicare beneficiaries for example irf bed supply was positively asso ciated with the rate of medicare home health care use which indicated that these two types of care are used in sequence for significant numbers of beneficiaries42 certain personal and health characteristics in combination with some basic differences between the types of post acute care providers have been found to influence either the use of postacute car or the propensity to use one type of provider relative to others the characteris tics include the health or functional status of the patient as well as the patients acce ss to informal care nonpaid care provided by family or friends for example frail beneficiaries may not be able to withstand the intensive therapy regimen the minimum of three hours of daily therapy required in an irf alternatively severely disabled beneficiaries may be more easily cared for in snfs than in community settings with home health services on the other hand availability of informal care increases the likelihood that postacute care could be provided in the community or in institutional settings where the goal is to return to the community rather than in institutional settings explicitly designed to provide longterm care43 the availability of multiple sites of postacute care has led to concerns that the care provided to beneficiaries is influenced by the different levels of payment offered for similar services in the various settings however there is little definitive information on the extent of patient ove rlap differences in medicares relative payment levels in different settings for the same quality of care and the appropriate resource levels for the desired outcome s for patients with particular needs44 these shortcomings can be attribut ed in part to the fact that the existing administrative data used for medicares payment purposes including patient assessment instruments used to classify patients into the releva nt payment groups in the different postacute care settings do not contain information needed to measure the quality of care within and across postacute settings althoug h the different data systems include information on patients functional status generally measured in terms of activities of

if so whether the outcomes of care are comparable46 furthermore patient assessment data are collected only as long as patient is treated in any particular postacute care setting but the outcome of the care rendered may not be apparent until after the patient is discharged47 interestingly policy makers and legislator s have returned to discussion of the importance of using common patient assessment tools across postacute settings the house ways and means subcommittee on health held hearing on this and related topics on june 16 200548 recent medpac analysis indicates that the information

separately identified admission and discharge records from those of the hospital and policies that specify that necessary clinical information is sent to the unit upon transfer of hospitals patient to the unit56 effect of medicares prio r payment system for irfs prior to implementation of the irfpps these facilities had been paid on cost related basis subject to per discharge limits as originally established by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 tefra generally speaking under tefra those facilities with operating costs below its payment ceiling received costs plus an incentive payment those with costs above their target were paid the ceiling plus relief payment each facility d separate paymen t limit or target amount established using its cost per discharge in its base year subject to cap the target amounts were subject to annual increases or updates capital co sts were paid on passthrough basis subject to certain limitations new providers were exempt from payment ceilings for the first three years of operation this payment system encouraged new exempt facilities to maximize their costs in their base year to establish high facility specific cost limits once subject to the tefra constraints recent entrant could fairly readily reduce its costs below its limit and receive medicare payment for full costs older rehabilitation facilities could not inflate their target amounts in this fashion were more likely to incur costs above their limits and receive pa yments less than their costs because of payment disparities between new and old irfs bba 97 mandated changes to medicares existing irf payment system and imposed national cost limits or national target amounts on payments to specific irfs accordingly an irf would receive payments based on its costs per discharge subject to the lower of facility specific tefra limits or the nationa l target amounts established by bba 97 the national target amount was set at the 75th percentile of the 1996 facilityspecific target amounts updated for inflation prio r to bba 97 payments to new irfs were based on their full medicare allowable cost s while their facility specific amount was determined with bba 97 medicares payments to ne w providers were limited to the lesser of the providers costs or 110 of the wage adjusted national median target amount of established irfs so bba 97 permitted longestablished irfshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32640crs19 57 bba 97 also expanded medicares transfer policy beyond discharges from one acute hospital to another to include certain transfer s from acute hospitals to postacute providers this change reduced payments to acute hospita ls for certain types of patients discharged to postacute settings 58 medpac report to congress medicare payment policy

update their facilityspecific target amount using averaged costs from certain of their three most recent cost reporting periods among other payment changes including reduction in capital payments the legislation blished providersp ecific update formula in order to reduce existing payment disparitie s facilities with cost s above their target amount received larger update than those below their target amounts which could be update the amount and type of bonus and relief payments to irfs were modified as well57 the tefra system was intended to be temporary measure to control medicare hospital spending until prospective payment systems for the nonacute hospitals could be implemente d it remained in effect longer than expected in part because of the difficulties in accounting fo r the variation in resource use across patients in exempt facilities58 arguably part of this une xplained cost variation may have stemmed from providers responses to payment incentives within the tefra system irf prospective payment system issues the following section will provide background on the legislative provisions shaping the implementation of the irfpps then present information on the irf pps payment adjustments and conclude with an example of fy2006 payment calculation legislative overview as well as the other provisions m odifying the tefra payment system discussed earlier bba 97 provided for the establishment of pps for irfs with twoyear transition period beginning by october 2000 and before october 2002 59 in that legislation congress did not sp ecify the unit of payment or the patient classification system to be used with the irfpps instead the secretary was given discretion to establish classes of irf patients called case mix groups based on appropriate factors such as impairmen t age related prior hospitalization comorbidities and functional capacity of the patient the secretary was required to establish weighting factors for each casemix group that would be

provisions in the balanced budg et refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 10633 that mandated certain characteristics of the irfpps61 specifically the secretary was directed to use discharges as the unit of payment the legislation also mandated use of specific and different patient assessment and classification system than being considered by hcfa the legislation directed the irfpps to use casemix groups

updated for fy2006 using the same methodology and data after the irfpps was implemented although updated for fy2006 unlike those used in ipps these relative weights are not updated annually the relative weights account for patients resource needs for each of the cmgs and payment tiers 353 relative weights are used to determine medicare payment rates within any given cmg the cost weight for patient with high comorbidity is greater than the cost weights for those patients with low or comorbidities cms did apply budget neutrality factor to sure that the estimated aggregate payments due to fy2006 changes in the relative weights and other changes to the cmgs did not increase this cost weight is multiplied by standard payment conversion factor formerly known as the budget neutral conve rsion factor to calculate the payment for given patient65 the standard payment amount wa s originally c onstructed using the facilityspecific information from 508 facilities including cost reports from fy1995 fy1996 and fy1997 applicable targ et amounts as well as medicare claims including corresponding uds mr data from cy1996 and cy1997 cms reduced the standard payment amount by 19 in fy2006 to account for coding changes that do not reflect real changes in case mix or increases in the intensity of the illness of patients who are treated an analysis of cy2002 data indicated that payments to irfs were about 140 million mo re than expected because of changes in patient classification66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32640crs23 67 the labor related share in irfpps will change from 72024 in fy

payment amount is increased based on the modified market basket m b for excluded hospitals those not paid under ipps this mb is based on cost report data from medicare participating inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities as well as longterm childrens and cancer hospitals which were subject to tefra payment limitations the tefra mb only includes operating costs so the irfpps

rehabilitation psychiat ric and longterm f acilities refe rred to as the rpl mb cms revised and rebase d the rpl mb to incorporate 2002 cost report data starting in fy2006 the change in market basket and use of the 2002 cost data will increase the labor related share or effect of the irfs wage index and increase the relative influence of the capital to operating costs67 irfpps incorporates an adjustment to reflect the relative area wage levels of facilitys labor market generally speaking an irfs labor market is defined using standards established by the office of ma nagement and budget omb counties that are not included as part of metropolitan area by virtue of commuting patterns and population density are consid ered to be rural an irf is not required to submit wage index data to medicare this adjustment uses data submitted by acute care hospitals and is compiled for the labor market area where they are located without taking into account any geographic reclassi fications of those hospitals also irf wage index values are not subject to the rural floor applied to ipps hospitals where the wage index value in any urban area cannot be lower than the rural wage index in that state the irf wage data is commonl referred to as prereclassification pre floor data in fy2006 cms adopted revised omb labor market definitions using the core based statistical area cbsa classifications to determine urban and rural areas these labor market definitions were adopted in ipps in fy2005 the change is implemented with budget neutral oneyear transition period the wage index of all irfs not just those that are disadvantaged by the new labor market definitions will have half of their wage index based on the old labor market definitions and half based on the new definitions irfs that d previously been in rural areas who are now considered to be in urban areas will have their rural payment adjustment phased out over threeyear period generally these irfs w ill receive twothirds of the fy2005 rural adjustment of 1914 or 1276 with blended wage index in fy2006 onethird of the adjustment 638 with cbsa wage index in fy2007 and cbsa wage index in fy2008 th is transition

source crs calculation based on information in fy2006 irfpps regulation published in the federal register on august 15 2005 and september 30 2005 in addition to facilitylevel adjustments an irf may receive additional or reduced medicare payment for any gi ven case depending upon the medicare patients circumstances additional payments are made for cases that are high cost outliers patient will be considered to be an outlier if the estimated cost of the case exceeds an adjusted threshold amount this cost is calculated by multiplying the charge by the facilitys overall costtocharge ratio obtained from the latest settled or tentatively settled cost report70 an irf will receive 80 of the difference between the estimated cost of the case and the outlier threshold modified by facilitylevel adjustments for fy2006 the unadjuste d threshold amount is 5129 down from 11211 in 2005 which cms estimates will result in total estimated outlier payments of approximately 3 of total irfpps payments concluding observations the magnitude of medicares spending on postacute care as well as the variety of postacute providers underscores the importance of devel oping policies that ensure beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care and service intensity policymakers remain concerned that payment incentives in the medicare program may influence the type of postacute care provided and unnecessarily increase program spending however there is little definitive information on medicares relative payment levels in different settings for the same quality of care and desired outcomes for patients with pa rticular needs with respect to irfs the medicare statute gives the secretary of hhs discretion to establish the criteria that these facilities must meet in order to be exempt from the ipps used to pay acute hospitals recent administrative actions by cms and its contractors to develop and enforce these criteria have prompted congressiona l actions to delay enforcement of the criteria at this point absent furthe r action cms will enforce the 60 compliance threshold starting july 1 2005 however the deficit reduction act of 2005 includes provision that would extend the existing 60 compliance threshold for two yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32640crs27 until june 30 2006 establish 65 thre shold for 12month period starting july 1 2007 and establish the
