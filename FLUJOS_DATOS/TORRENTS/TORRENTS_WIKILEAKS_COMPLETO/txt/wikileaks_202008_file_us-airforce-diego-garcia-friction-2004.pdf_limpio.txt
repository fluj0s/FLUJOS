2 pavement surface transverse and longitudinal slopes were measured every 500 ft along the entire length of the runway transverse slopes were measured at 10 ft and 20 ft from the centerline on both sides of the centerline single longitudinal slope was measured at the runway centerline good slopes promote drainage and reduce the hydroplaning potential afjman 32 1013 volume 1 requires transverse slopes between 1 and 15 to promote good drainage b surface texture measurements 1 grease smear test was used to measure the texture depth of the pavement surface the test equipment consists of 0915 cubic inch 15 cc of grease and 4 in 1016 cm wide template in which the grease is evenly spread on the pavement surface the volume of grease is then divided by the area of the smear to calculate the textur depth the sum of the individual tests divided by the total number of tests yields the average texture depth atd federal aviation administration advisory circular faa ac 1505320 12c 2 texture depth measurements were made at several locations to obtain representative sampling of the pavement macrotexture macrotexture provides channels for bulk water drainage and is an important component in the overall friction properties of pavement surface research has shown strong potential for hydroplaning exists when the average texture depth atd is less than 0016 in 04 mm additional testing is required to determine the hydroplaning potential of surfaces with average texture depths between 0016 and 0036 inches atds greater than 0036 inches generally have low potential for hydroplaning williams 1975 complete analysis of surface texture would ideally include an assessment of the surface microtexture the fine asperities that pierce the remaining thin film of water and grip the aircraft tire however there is accurate method to measure this characteristic c friction measurements 1 grip tester was used to measure the runway surface friction the grip tester is three wheel trailer which measures friction by the braked wheel fixed slip principle its single measuring wheel fitted with special smooth tread tire is mounted on an axle instrumented to measure both the horizontal drag force and the vertical load force from these measurements the dynamic friction reading is automatically calculated and transmitted to the data collection computer carried in the cab of the towing vehicle this computer also calculates and stores the survey speed for each reading an onboard self wetting system regulates flow from 150 gallon tank to nozzles that distribute 004 in 1 mm film of water beneath the smooth tire at testing speeds of 40 and 60 mph faa ac 1505320 12c the majority of the grip testers weight is distributed over two drive wheels which are fitted w ith patterned tread tires and mounted on solid stainless steel drive axle this drive axle carries sprocket of 27 teeth and the cantilever axle on which the measuring wheel is mounted carries sprocket of 32 teeth transmission chain links the tw axles this transmission system continuously brakes the measuring wheel forcing it to slip this slipping wheel and the weight of the grip tester cause minute bending movements in the cantilever axle that are measured by two pairs of strain gauges 4 mounted on its vertical and horizontal faces the signals from these strain gauges are processed by the signal processing unit mounted on the top of the grip tester and are then transmitted to the data collection computer distance and speed are calculated from proximity sensor activated by wheel with 20 square teeth mounted on the drive axle 2 testing modes selfwetting friction measurements were made along the entire runway length employing the grip tester self wetting system test runs were conducted 5 ft from both sides of the runway centerline at 40 and 60 mph separate 40 mph test was also conducted on the less trafficked pavement along the right edge of the runway 60 mph test was conducted on the less trafficked pavement alon g the left edge of the runway these measurements help to identify those areas of the runway pavement that are smooth due to poor texture excessive traffic wear aggregate polishing andor surface contaminants such as rubber deposits and oilfuel spills the measured friction values are compared to federal aviation administration faa guidelines to determine if corrective action is required these standards are adopted from faa ac 1505320 12c measurement construction and maintenance of skid resis tant airport pavement surfaces the guidelines apply only to wet runway surfaces they do not apply to ice or snow covered surfaces see appendix c for additional test result interpretation guidelines friction level classification grip tester 4 0 mph grip tester 60 mph action 043 024 planning 053 036 b runway flooding runways may have different feature characteristics on the pavement such as depressed areas or texture changes which may pond or hold excess water during periods f moderate to heavy rainfall because of this water may exceed the depth used by the self wetting system and the actual traction capacity of the pavement in these areas may be less than that determined by the self wetting system whereas the self wettin g test uses only enough water to evaluate the requirement for maintenance of the surface texture the flooding test oversaturates the texture to evaluate the runways ability to drain excess water therefore specific 1000 ft test section on the runway was selected for further study of the drainage properties using the following procedures i dry grip tester run was conducted to establish the maximum friction available for aircraft braking performance ii water tanker discharged water on t he test section iii continuous grip tester runs were initiated immediately following the pass of the water truck and continued until the friction values exceeded the planning level or the time exceeded 30 minutes the test section runs were conducte d at speed of 40 mph in one direction and at 60 mph in the opposite direction iv an average mu value for the 1000 ft section was determined for each test run and plotted versus time this plot forms friction recovery curve and clearly illustrat the flood recovery characteristics of the runway surface 5 c ground vehicle friction correlation the following chart provides correlation

texture allowing the water to escape beneath the tire then friction values will be less affected by speed conversely poorly textured surface will produce larger drop in friction with an increase in speed friction characteristics can be further reduced by poor drainage due to inadequate slopes or depressions in the runway surface 6 iv test results slope measurements 1 slope measurement results are illustrated in appendix positive transverse slope indicates that water will drain away from the runway centerline positive longitudinal slope indicates that water will drain toward the secondary runway approach end runway 1331 the runway is 200 feet wide the runway is crowned from the center to the outer edges with slopes ranging from 03 to 19 and 85 of the transverse slopes are greater than or equal to the 1 recommended minimum the longitudina l slopes range from 05 to 03 b parallel taxiway the taxiway is 175 feet wide the taxiway is crowned from the center to the outer edges with slopes ranging from 17 to 17 and 55 of the transverse slopes are greater than the 1 recommended minimu m the longitudinal slopes range from 07 to 06 b texture depth the average texture depth atd measurements and rainfall flooding rates for the runway surfaces are contained in appendix b 1 texture depths were measured at several locations on the pavement surface usually near the centerline in the heavily trafficked area and also along the edge to make comparison between high and low traffic pavement average texture depths greater than 0016 inches are considered acceptable on runwa 1331 the measured texture depths are shown on page b 1 and the parallel taxiway is shown on page b 2 runway 1331 atd ranged from 00032 to 00199 inches with an overall average of 00092 inches the parallel taxiway atd ranged from 00052 to 00195 inches with an overall average of 00073 inches the atd for the runway and primary taxiway are approximately 50 of the accepted minimum 2 mathematical model was used to determine the rainfall intensity necessary to cause flooding on the runways keep in mind that the model does not consider weather effects like temperature wind and evaporation rates which can significantly change drainage characteristics the predicted rainfall rate required to flood the runway macrotexture is listed on pag b3 and b 4 for runway 1331 and the parallel taxiway respectively this model indicates that rainfall rates between about 004 to 023 inches per hour could flood runway 1331 and rainfall rates between about 003 to 016 inches per hour could flood the parallel taxiway c grip tester friction data 1 the measured friction values are contained in appendix c the parameters set by faa ac 1505320 12c for action and planning friction levels are listed on page c 1 pages c 3 and c 5 are simil ar to c 2 and c 4 however these charts compare just the test data from left and right of centerline the edge section was removed to make the charts easier to read runway 1331 the measured friction values for the runway are illustrated on page c 2 and c 3 unless otherwise stated distance remaining values are referenced from the 31 end the values at the 40 mph testing speed at most locations hover between the planning and action levels or below the action level the measured values on the left and right of centerline show that the runway surface exhibits significant potential 7 for hydroplaning both touchdown areas and most of the runway interior display friction levels below the action level on the right left or both testing sides the highest friction levels were at 8000 to 5000 distance remaining where values oscillated between the planning and action level the 60 mph test data shows that either one or both sides of the centerline are below the planning level for the entire length of t he runway at all but four points on the chart either one or both 60 mph tests show that the data falls beneath the action level for more than 80 of the runway surface the edge testing stays above the planning level for the majority of the runway but h overs between the planning and action level in several areas the edge testing suggests that significant polishing has occurred due to aircraft traffic rubber removal operations and soft aggregate in the concrete the analysis shows that corrective act ion should be taken immediately parallel taxiway since the parallel taxiway does not have overruns testing started at 11500 feet and ended at 500 feet from the north end the measured friction values for the parallel taxiway are illustrated on page c4 and c 5 the values at the 40 mph testing speed are significantly low and range from 02 to the action value of 043 few sections actually reach the zone between the planning and action level 60mph tests show the same trend and only reach above the action level during the last 1000 feet attributed to the operator slowing the vehicle not because the pavement had better friction characteristics the edge testing for both testing speeds mimic the centerline tests showing degradation of surface f riction has not occurred the parallel taxiway has poorer friction characteristics than the runway and should not be used when the surface is wet except under emergency conditions if used as runway notam should be issued to restrict use during wet conditions 2 the friction recovery curves for the flooded test section are contained in appendix d three tests were done for runway 1331 and two for the parallel taxiway the average mu value for the section was plotted versus time to produce the curves at the time of testing the ambient temperature was 80 f and the weather was partly cloudy to sunny skies flood test for runway 1331 was located 1500 to 2500 feet from the 31 end of the runway the results are illustrated on page d 1 th test section recovered to above the action level in 13 minutes at 40 mph and 6 minutes at 60 mph flood test b was located 5000 to 6000 feet from the 31 end of the runway the results are illustrated on page d 2 and the test section recovered to abov the action level in 5 minutes at 40 mph and 3 minutes at 60 mph flood test c was located 10000 to 11000 feet from the 31 end of the runway the results are illustrated on page d 3 the test section recovered to above the action level in 15 minutes at 40 mph and 14 minutes at 60 mph flood test c governs the minimum requirement for this runway aircraft should not operate on the runway surface for at least 15 minutes following highintensity rainfall event more conservative value comes from fl ood test where the section recovers to the planning level in 23 minutes 8 flood test for the parallel taxiway was located 8000 to 9000 feet from the 31 end and the results are shown on d 4 the test section recovered to above the action level in 7 minutes at 40 mph and 3 minutes at 60 mph flood test b for the parallel taxiway was located 3000 to 4000 feet from the 31 end and the results are shown on d5 the test section recovered to above the action level in 6 minutes at 40 mph and almost i mmediately at 60 mph the minimum amount of time for aircraft operations on the parallel taxiway is 7 minutes though more conservative value comes from flood test showing the surface recovers to the planning level in 11 minutes 9 v conclusions and recommendations conclusions 1 runway 1331 the surface friction is below the minimum threshold for the majority of the runway both touchdown areas and much of the interior section of the runway have poor friction characteristics the only section that showed fair friction performance was the section 4000 to 6000 feet from the 31 end the lowest 500 foot average was at 1000 to 1500 from the 31 end with mu value equal to 019 this correlates to rcr of 7 2 parallel taxiway this surface h as lower average texture depth and displays poorer friction characteristics than the runway it should not be used in wet weather conditions the lowest 500 foot average was at 3000 to 3500 feet from the 31 end with mu value equal to 025 this co rrelates to rcr of 9 b recommendations 1 runway 1331 saw transverse grooves along the full length of the runway standard faa groove configuration is ¼ inch in depth ¼ inch in width with 1½ inch center tocenter spacing the grooves should be terminated within 10 feet of the runway edge and the grooves shall not be closer than 3 inches or more than 9 inches from transverse joints and not closer than 3 inches from longitudinal joints this spacing will eliminate damage to joint sealant and pre vent premature joint spalling 2 runway 1331 at minimum grind the first 3000 feet of the runway ends grinding will improve the overall surface texture and increase the average texture depth of the runway 3 following grooving and grinding operations reseal all joints high joint seal distress is the most widespread distress on the runway 4 runway 1331 until grooving is accomplished recommend runway operations are restricted to emergency operations for at least 23 minutes following rainfall event 5 parallel taxiway if used as runway notam should be issued restricting use under wet conditions 10 references afjman 32 1013

readings indicate that the pavement friction is deteriorating but the situation is not within an unacceptable overall condition the area in question should be monitored closely by conducting friction surveys to establish the rate and the extent of friction deterioration b friction deterioration below the planning friction level for 1000 feet when the average friction value is 53 at 40 mph and 36 at 60 mph for distance of 1000 feet or more conduct an extensive evaluation into the causes and extent of the friction deterioration and take appropriate corrective action c friction deterioration
