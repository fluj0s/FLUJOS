research would replace some formula funding this report will not be updated1 farm commodity support usda administers farm price and income support programs as authorized by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 for commodities such as grains cotton oilseeds dairy peanuts and sugar these support programs as well as certain conservation and trade programs do not require an annual appropr iation but instead are funded through the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc has 30 billion line of credit with the us treas ury and receives an annual appr opriation to reimburse it for previous years losses so th at it does not exhaust its borrowing authority for farm commodity programs in fy2006 the administration estimates that spending will be 164 billion down from 179 billion estimated for fy2005 but up sharply from 80 billion in fy2004 due to lowe r market prices the estimate for fy2006 does not include the administr ations legislative proposals described below or any spending for disaster assistance for the farm service agency fsa the usda agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22071crs2 that administers the farm commodity programs the administration requests an appropriation of 137 billion for sala ries and expenses up about 5 the administration proposes broad p ackage of deficit reduction measures including legislative changes to redu ce farm program spending by 587 million in fy2006 36 cut and 57 billion over 10 year s 38 cut further action depends on whether the fy2006 budget resolution will c ontain reconciliation instructions for the agriculture committees and how the committees carry out the instructions the house committee on agriculture contends that the 2002 farm bill should not be reopened the administrations plan and its estimated savings include revising the marketing loan program instead of 100 of actual production being eligible for the marketing loan program 85 of the historical program yield multiplied by reported acres would qualify crs report rs21779 describes the subsidy programs the reduction would come from the percentage change in the formula and because program yields are typically less than expected actual yields administration officials say that about 6065 of production would rema in eligible the administrations estimated reduction 432 million in fy 2006 11 b illion over 10 years 5

request contains legislative proposals affecting the crop insurance program that it says would save 140 million annually beginning in fy2007 these proposals include 1 requirement th at farmers purchase crop insurance as prerequisite for receiving farm commodity payments 2 two to five percentage point reduction in the portion of the premium that is paid by the government with larger reductions at lower levels of coverage 3 requirement that producers pay 25 of the premium up to 5000 for catastrophic c at coverage instead of the current requirement that producer pay 100 adminis trative fee and premium and 4 twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22071crs3 percentage point reduction in the reimbursement rate to private crop insurance companies for administrative and operating expenses usda contends that these proposals would encourage farmers to buy higher levels of coverage and preclude the need for adhoc disaster payments which ve been made on regular basis over the past 20 years conservation proposed conservation spending for fy2006 includes numerous reductions from fy2005 for discretionary programs and chan ges to fy2005 levels or authorized fy2006 levels for most mandatory
