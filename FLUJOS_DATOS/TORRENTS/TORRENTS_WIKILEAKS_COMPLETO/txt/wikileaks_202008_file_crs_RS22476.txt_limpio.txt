and jean hearne domestic social policy division summary hr 4460 the health care choice act is intended to harmonize the state insurance laws that multistate insurance carriers and other providers of individual httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 health coverage would be subject to by harmonizing insurance laws across state lines the bills supporters anticipate an increase in the number of health plan choices and reduction of the cost of plans opponents raise concerns that the consequences of reducing states regulatory authority over insurance products in each state could include loss of important patient protections and complicate the enforcement of rules designed to protect consumer interests this report will be updated periodically the 110th congress as well as earlier congresses has grappled with issues raised by insurance carriers and other providers of health insurance that offer coverage across state lines carriers and health plan providers have appealed to congress for relief from complicated array of 50 states and the district of columbias health insurance laws states are the primary regulators of the business of health insurance right clarified by the 1945 mccarranferguson act and all states have large body of laws that apply to health insurance states insurance requirements number in the thousands there are more than 1900 laws on benefits alone and can be complicated even the laws of two states addressing the same matter can differ on many dimensions in addition to the benefits that comprise health insurance products state laws and regulations require patient protections address how insurance carriers develop the rates charged for their products and describe procedures for approval of those rates state laws and regulations address how entities in the business of selling health insurance fund their enterprises and prepare against the risk of insolvency they are subject to fair marketing practice laws requirements related to the filing of grievances against the plans and appealing plan decisions entities selling health insurance may also be subject to state taxes in addition state laws form the basis for lawsuits against providers of health care for malpractice and professional negligence sometimes significant financial judgements have extended from individual medical providers to health plans under which those providers are contractually related crs2 in general different set of state laws applies to the employer group market1 than to the individual market for insurance further different laws generally apply to insurance products sold to small employers than to certain products offered to workers of very large employers when large employers selfinsure or selffund their coverage state insurance laws are preempted from applying by federal law2 table 1 the markets for health insurance market for characteristics of health regulationb insurance insurancea individual purchased by individuals separate some benefit mandates apply 17 from employer groups states with rate regulation almost 7 million people small group sponsored by small employers more than 1900 benefit mandates most state regulation applies to firms 47 states with rate regulation with 50 or fewer employees about 21 million privately insured people in plans sponsored by firms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 with 50 or fewer employees large group sponsored by larger employers when health plans are selffunded can be traditional insurance or state laws are preempted from employers can selffund plans many applying when health plans include employers offer choice of plans traditional insurance products those around 83 million people in plans products would be subject to all state sponsored by firms with more than laws that apply to the business of 50 employees insurance source crs unpublished data from the medical expenditure panel survey household component at the time of first interview in 2005 includes civilian noninstitutionalized individuals under age 65 b from georgetown health policy institute at httpwwwstatehealthfactsorg and council for affordable health insurance at httpwwwcahiorgcahi_contentsresourcespdfhealthinsurance mandates2008pdf selfinsured plans offered by large employers are exempt from state laws sometimes large employers choose to forego purchasing traditional health insurance for their employees instead the employer collects the premium contributions from all employees combines those collections with its own contributions and from those funds pays for health care for workers under such selffunded plan provider networks may be organized by inhouse health benefits administrators or more likely employers will engage in an administrative servicesonly aso contract with traditional insurance 1 the employer group market sometimes just called the group market is composed of health plans generally offered by an employer to workers as part of package of employmentrelated benefits along with such other things as retirement benefits vacation days sick leave etc 2 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa preempts state laws from applying to selffunded health plans for more information about how this preemption applies see crs report rs20315 erisa regulation of health plans fact sheet by hinda chaikind crs3 carrier or hmo the major difference between traditional health plans purchased from indemnity insurance companies and the selffunded coverage offered by large employers besides the preemption of state law is that under selffunded plans the employer retains the risk that one or more of its workers will be in need of costly medical care under traditional health plans that risk is transferred to the insurance carrier or the hmo very large employers are able to selfinsure their employees because the group for which premiums are being collected is sufficiently large to make the risk of having to pay for few expensive people relatively small in addition because these firms tend to be large they have the more considerable assets of the firm to fall back upon should the health plan costs exceed premiums collected small employers rarely selfinsure because they do not have the large number of employees across which to collect premiums and spread risk nor do they have considerable assets to back up the premium collections the goals of harmonization advocates of bills intended to rationalize the body of insurance laws applying across state lines cite selffunded plans as examples of the way the small or individual markets for insurance could flourish if regulatory authority of the states were reduced large self httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 funded employer plans tend to have comprehensive and generous benefit offerings offer choice of plans and employees tend to be happy with these plans by reducing the states laws that apply to multistate plans advocates hope that more plan choices would become available to small employers and individuals bills that would allow insurers to forego all or all but one primary states laws could eliminate some state benefit mandates potentially allowing for less costly limited benefit plans to be offered in addition if primary state is one without rate regulations laws that require premium rates to be averaged across both healthy and less healthy populations lowerpriced plans for healthier subscribers could become available finally advocates hope that by making these changes in the individual market for insurance new covered lives will be drawn into it encouraging new options and higher enrollment and thus improve the overall functioning of the individual market for insurance the health care choice act of 2007 hr 4460 one approach to reducing the number of state laws and regulations that apply to insurance products sold across state lines is advanced in hr 4460 the health care choice act of 2007 the stated purpose of the bill when referred to the committee on energy and commerce on december 12 2007 is to provide for cooperative governing of individual health insurance coverage offered in interstate commerce the bill would allow insurance carriers and other issuers of health insurance sold to individuals hr 4460 would not apply to health plans bought or sold in the employer group market for insurance to designate state in which it is licensed and qualified to sell health insurance as its primary state the laws of the primary state would govern the sale of individual health insurance policies in that state as well as in any other secondary state this would allow the issuer to sell its products in one or more secondary states without complying with most of the insurance laws of those secondary states thereby simplifying the business of offering health plans across state lines primary state would have the sole jurisdiction to enforce its laws in its state as well as in any secondary states crs4 under hr 4460 the only provisions of secondary state that would be retained would be those laws rules regulations or agreements governing the use of care or cost management techniques provider contracting network access or adequacy health care data collection or quality assurance secondary states however could require issuers to pay premium and other taxes such as high risk pool assessments register with the secondary states insurance commissioner submit to examinations of their financial condition if the primary states insurance commissioner has not already done so comply with lawful order issued in delinquency proceeding or an injunction if they have been found to be financially impaired participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association and comply with certain state laws regarding fraud and abuse unfair claims settlement practices and independent review health insurance issuers would be required to give notice in any coverage offered and at renewal that identifies which state is its primary state and explains that the policy is not subject to the laws and regulations of the secondary state in which the policy is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 being issued in addition the bill includes provision that would require any policy sold in secondary state to also be offered for sale in primary state provision that appears to be intended to establish that all plans be subject to the enforcement authority of regulators of primary state finally the bill establishes federal floor for coverage offered in secondary states in order for those plans to qualify for the exemption of state insurance laws the floor consists of requirements related to plan solvency for states to become secondary states they must use riskbased capital formula for determining capital and surplus requirements and an external review requirement for state to be designated as either primary or secondary state it must provide for independent external review issues raised by the harmonization provisions of hr 4460 hr 4460 addresses insurance harmonization on considerably smaller scale than other proposals because it focuses only on those plans offered for sale in the individual market for insurance in the individual market there are relatively few states that regulate plan pricing see table 1 in addition under current law sometimes benefit mandates do not apply to plans sold in the individual market for example requirements that plans cover prenatal care and newborn deliveries often are not applicable in the individual market for insurance3 nonetheless some consumer advocates and state insurance commissioners raise concerns about the potential negative consequences of removing all but one states authority over such plans opponents raise the concern that insurance issuers will be motivated to designate those states that do little to exercise their regulatory authority as primary states effectively eliminating all or much of the regulation over the business of insurance specifically the loss of some of the states required benefits and many of the consumer protections is 3 personal communication with mila kofman health policy institute at georgetown university june 29 2006 crs5 raised as concern even though hr 4460 does not preempt the laws of all states from applying to these plans there are some states that impose very few requirements on insurers selling policies the bills supporters on the other hand see this as measure of the bills success minimizing the intrusion of state governments in the market for individual health insurance advocates of the bill hope that the removal of states benefit mandates and rating rules will allow for more and betterpriced plans for the majority of the population that is relatively healthy this approach however may result in loss of coverage for some individuals who are less healthy or who are struck by an unexpected illness without rating rules insurers can reduce prices for healthy people encouraging more coverage but raise rates for those who are not potentially resulting in loss of coverage for those most in need of it enforcement of primary states laws in secondary state is seen as potential problem with this bill under hr 4460 if secondary state resident finds that the laws of the primary state are being misapplied he or she would be required to seek the assistance of the insurance commissioner of the primary state for correction of this httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 situation concerns have been raised by the national association of insurance commissioners that state regulators would be unable to assist their own constituents in the real world of tight state budgets it will be virtually impossible to assist nonresident consumer in distant state4 enforcement can become more challenging because of the incentive for insurers to migrate to the one or two states that have the least regulatory body framework and staff potentially increasing the opportunities for fraud and abuse goal of the bill is to create level playing field with respect to state laws for insurers offering coverage across state lines the bill does not however create level playing field between insurers or among consumers or providers within state by harmonizing the laws for multistate carriers smaller local carriers could be put at disadvantage their plans would continue to be subject to state mandates rate regulation and patient protections in each state potentially making those products more appealing to those in poorer health consumers in one state could find their plans are regulated by another state making it confusing and possibly difficult to seek enforcement of rights described by geographically distant primary state finally providers could be required to meet multiple different procedural laws for the multiple primary states that are designated by the carriers with which the providers contract other approaches to harmonizing health insurance regulation in addition to hr 4460 number of legislative proposals have been introduced in recent sessions whose common purpose is to promote uniformity of insurance rules across state lines the approaches typically involve either exempting insurers from state health insurance laws or federalizing such laws at least in part the expectation is that these 4 us congress house committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on health the health care choice act hearing on hr 2335 sic 109th cong 1st sess june 28 2005 washington gpo 2005 crs6 approaches either separately or collectively would reduce insurers regulatory burden which in turn would lead to lower health insurance costs5 broadly the federal approach redesignates all or part of state insurance regulation as under federal jurisdiction for example s 334 the healthy americans act specifies benefit standards that would apply to the new plans established under this bill in addition s 334 would impose new rating rules both the benefit standards and rating rules would supercede existing state laws in these regulatory areas similarly s 1783 the ten steps to transform health care in america act would among other reforms establish new federal rating rules in the small group market and new federal benefit standards in both the individual and group markets under s 1783 insurers in the small group health insurance market and individual states would have the choice of complying with current state rating laws or the new federal rating rules similarly all insurers would have the choice of providing benefits in accordance with current state law or the new federal standards the bill would authorize the hhs secretary to establish board for the purpose of developing recommendations to harmonize inconsistent state laws in four insurance oversight areas form and rate filing rules market conduct prompt payment of claims and internal review of disputed claims httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22476 proposals that attempt to federalize all health insurance regulation typically have the goal of universal coverage often such bills propose to establish new federal health insurance program an example of such proposals is hr 2034 the medicare for all act this act would establish new federal program to provide health benefits to everyone who is currently not eligible for benefits under medicare modeled after the medicare program the federal government would contract with private health insurance carriers to offer health benefits under the new program however the federal government would specify the rules and standards relating to the operation of the new program including benefits costsharing requirements and payments to health care providers moreover the federal government would establish trust fund financed by personal income and employer taxes to pay for program costs under the exemption approach the obverse of the federal approach insurers would not be required to comply with specified insurance rules often exemption is targeted to new entities that pool individuals or groups together bill that incorporates features of both exemption and federal approaches is hr 241 the small business health fairness act of 2007 business or trade associations would be certified to offer health benefits in the small group market through association health plans ahps ahps would be exempt from large body of state health insurance law including benefits consumer protections grievance and appeals procedures premium taxation prohibitions on discrimination and fair marketing practices the bill does however maintain state regulatory authority regarding solvency standards and prompt payment laws the bill would place enforcement authority with respect to ahps with the federal government in consultation with the states 5 for comprehensive discussion about general approaches to health insurance reform and relevant bills introduced in the 110th congress see crs report rl34389 health insurance reform
