status the projected resolution time prt is the time elapsed between irt and providing solution priorities of messages are defined as follows very high or priority 1 message with priority very high is justified when critical restrictions in daytoday operations are encountered critical tasks especially timecritical jobs cannot be performed due to total system shutdown or malfunction in main function of the production sap system this message requires immediate processing as the malfunction can result in serious losses high or priority 2 message with priority high is justified when serious restrictions in daytoday operations are encountered necessary tasks cannot be performed due to malfunction or failed function in the software that is urgently required in the current situation the message requires rapid processing because the continuing malfunction could cause serious interruption in the entire production system medium or priority 3 message with priority medium is justified when restrictions in daytoday operations are encountered this is caused by malfunction or failed functionality in the system low or priority 4 message with priority low is justified when daytoday operations are not affected or only affected in minor fashion this is caused by malfunction or failed functionality in the system that is not used daily or is only used rarely problem situations in test systems will normally result in priority that is one level lower than the identical problem in production system 62 telkom contract 076c01 on the anniversary of this agreement the parties shall

impact upon the sla are customer message recording preliminary checking search for relevant error notes known problem solution and problem analysis life cycle of customer message sap customer message support customer problem correctioncustomer service systemsdev request note consulting w workaround solution design implementation test telkom customers can access the saps frontend or sapnetweb frontend and create their own requests and messages customer requests and messages that are received in writing via fax 27 11 2356004 are first processed by the support facility of the local support centre and then recorded for further processing in saps internal customer support system request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the sap support organization local support and regional support for the software based on the components assigned to it performing preliminary checks searching for troubleshooting information the processor first checks whether the problem report is complete and whether an entry has already been made in the system containing solution to the reported problem this search is conducted semiautomatically in saps support system if an entry is found containing solution to the problem then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in writing via sapnet and the problem is closed for sap problem analysis if following preliminary analysis the local support level decides that the problem must be handled by an expert in the respective component the problem is passed on to the regional 64 telkom contract 076c01 support level if the problem involves program error or if the processor cannot find solution despite intensive analysis he or she transfers it to the development support level the responsibility for development support lies with the user departments of the development areas if relevant error note known solution exists the customer shall provide sap with sufficient test time and support as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem and to determine whether it is problem with the software at sap or in the customers system provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customers operations if this reproduction of the problem is not possible the next time the problem occurs additional analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem in the meantime the problem receives the status of customer action in the support system if special handling by an expert is required then it is relayed to development support escalation management in the event of saps support management deciding that the standard support processes are insufficient to solve critical customer situation problems as described in point 2 above formal escalation process is invoked during this process sap will assign the required sap personnel to the customer remotely via remote connection andor on site as appropriate these resources will be under the direct supervision of saps management and the customer will not incur any costs formal deescalation process involving an assigned customer services manager will take place once the critical issue has been resolved during the implementation phase prior to the software being installed sap africa and telkom will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed escalation process for the maintenance services that sap africa and its licensors will provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the golive stage the parties shall also determine an escalation process that is
