us agricultural ex ports and increase farm incomes us agricultural exports to china were valu ed at nearly 15 billion in fy2000 making it the eighth largest market for us farm products another 13 billion of us farm products were shipped to hong kong in fy2000 in the long run if economic growth is strong as many economists expect chinas 12 billion population and its growing middle class suggest its significant potential as market for us agricultural products the uschina negotiations on terms for the latters accession to the wto were concluded in november 1999 the ag ricultural components of this agreement appear identical to those of an earlie r agreement negotiated in april 1999 but not finalized due to us problems with it and subsequently to diplomatic fallout from the accidental us bombing of chin as embassy in yugoslavia on may 8 1999 negotiations resumed in september 1999 the november 15 1999 agreement provides that china if it becomes memb er of the wto will make substantial reductions in agricultural tariffs and establish market access quotas that s hould expand trade for several important us agricultural products including soybean products wheat corn rice and cotton virtually all other wto members have concluded bilateral agreements with china ultimately chinas application for membership must be agreed to by other members of the wto uschina wto negotiations in apr il 1999 were accompanied by bilateral agreements to end chinas sanitary and phytosanitary sps barriers to us wheat meat and citrus exports when accession negotiations were suspended however chinas implementation of the bilateral agreements came to standstill since the november 1999 agreement china has begun to implement the bilateral agreements with reported purchases of wheat citrus and meats including beef and pork occurring in 2000 the wto requires that members extend mostfavorednation mfn treatment also known as normal trading relations ntr to all other members such status means that products enter the united states at the same low tariff rates that apply to virtually all other nations to help ensu re that the united states can take better advantage of the full range of concessi

expand markets for ag ricultural products and further ease trade barriers export subsidies and tradedist orting domestic support the operations of state trading enterprises stes like the canadian wheat board and trade in genetically engineered food products also are at issue trade ministers at the seattle meeting were unable to agree on an agenda for comprehensive new round which would ve included not only agriculture but services intellectual property industria l tariffs and perhaps broader issues of competition investment and the relationshi p of trade agreements to labor and environmental considerations howeve r article 20 of the ur agreement on agriculture mandates negotia tions in agriculture to begin in early 2000 these negotiations were launche d march 2324 2000 at special session of the wtos committee on agriculture various countries have since sub mitted more detailed negotiating proposals during this process on june 29 2000 the administration announ ced its negotiating proposal to the wto it includes elimination of agricultural export subsidies by fixed date substantial reductions in current tariffs and increas in tariffrate quotas on agricultural imports discipline of state trading enterprises and new reductions in domestic farm supports based on the same fixed percentage of each countrys total agricultural production value with the objective of eventually making all countries domestic support levels comp arable the negotiations have been proceeding slowly many agricultural interests support us participation in comprehensive round rather than sectoral negotiation because they believe the tradeoffs possible in larger negotiation would result in improved market prospects for us agriculturalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30789crs7 exports some agricultural groups who feel that they have been disadvantaged by previous trade agreements oppose us pa rticipation in new round in congress the senate agriculture committee held hearings on wto

amendments of direct interest to agriculture the primary purpose of the measure is to increase trade opportunities with africa and the ca ribbean basin among the agricultural provisions added by the sena in november 1999 and reta ined by conferees is the socalled carousel retaliation provision that requires the administration periodically to rotate or change the type s of products targeted for trade retaliation against foreign country its immediate obj ective was to seek to intensify pressure on the eu to permit imports of beef produced with hormones and to resolve long running dispute over banana imports see below by penalizing wider range of foreign industries and regions as the 106th congress adjourned the administration had not yet released revised lists of imports subject to retaliation other agriculturerelated provisions in this measure include the creation of chief agricultural negotiator in the office of the us trade representative and the detailing of explicit us objectives for agriculture in wto negotiations the latter include calls for an end to export subsidie s and reduction of foreign trade barriers senate provision permitting farmers to apply for trade adjustment assistance benefits was dropped from the final conference version hrept 106606 economic sanctions and agricultural exports falling agricultural exports and declining commodity prices led farm groups and agribusiness firms to urge the 106th congress to pass legislation exempting the export of food and agricultural commodities from u s unilateral economic sanctions policy against certain countries in the course of debate on pl 106387 the fy2001 appropriations bill for the us department of agriculture usda congress adopted provision to lift sanctions on commercial sales of food agricultural commodities and medical products to ira n libya north korea and sudan and to allow such sales to cuba subject to financing and other restrictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30789crs8 with the exception of the cubaspecifi c provisions title ix of pl 106387 largely codifies rules that the clint on administration formalized in july 1999 allowing licensed commercial sales of food and medical products to three countries currently subject to us unilateral econo mic sanctions ira n libya and sudan title ix also codifies june 2000 admin istration decision to allow unlicensed agricultural sales to north korea agricu ltural sales to cuba under separate policy announced in may 1999 have been restrict ed only to private and nongovernmental entities the inclusion of cuba in the proposal generated considerab controversy and delayed enactment of the usda spending bill until late in the session supporters of the proposed changes argued that sanc tions were rarely effective and that maintaining them against cuba which many see as sizable potential market for us agricultural sales harms the us agricultural sector they argued that opening up trade with cuba which has been subject to comprehensive us embargo since 1962 would be way to pursue constr uctive engagement policy with that country opponents countered that an exemption would undercut us policy designed to keep maximum pressure on the castro government until political and economic reforms were attain ed strong differences of opinion on this issue twice delayed house movement of its measure until both sides reached compromise in late september the house compromise differed from senate language passed without change on july 20 in specifica lly prohibiting private financing of us agricultural sales to cuba placing more restrictions on sales on that country compared to the other sanctioned countries and codifying rules on travel to cuba in conference action members adopted th house position after some debate the clinton administration in princi ple has favored exempting food and medicine for humanitarian reasons from broa d sanctions measures it did express concern though that the final language unduly limits the presidents flexibility in conducting future foreign policy reduces th prospect of food sales to cuba and constrains peopletopeople tr avel to cuba for more information see crs issue brief ib10061 exempting food and agriculture products from us economic sanctions current issues and proposals and economic sancti ons and agricultural exports in the crs electronic briefing book on trade useu issues biotechnology issues disputes over genetically engineered crops and foods which contain them threaten to disrupt useuropean agricultural trade generally referred to as genetically modified organisms or gmos in trade discussions such crops and products are focus of disputes over di fferences in approva l procedures and on whether there is need to label gmo products underlying the disputes are pronounced useu disagreements over the nvironmental effects of gmos and the safety of gm foodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30789crs9 crops produced from gmos are rapidly be ing introduced into us agriculture especially crops for export such as cor n soybeans and cotton acceptance of gmos in the eu and other markets for us agri cultural products is thus critical for us producers and exporters us consumers generally have not questioned the health or safety of gm foods alt hough some us consumer gr oups have called for labeling the us national academy of sciences nvironmentalists and others have called for paying more attention to the environm ental effects of gm crops conversely in the eu broad coalition of environmentalists consumer groups and some scientists argue that the longterm effects of gmos on health and the environment are unknown and not scientifically established these interest groups argue that caution should be exercised in approving and re gulating gm crops and foods until their effects are known with certainty the us approval process for gmos s facilitated their in troduction into the us food system the us position has b een that gm foods are different from nongm foods thus existing regulations for approving them are appropriate and adequate the eu however ma intains separate and longer regulatory system for approving gmos and also re quires mandatory labels for products containing gmos labeling is not required in the united states except when there is significant difference between the conve ntional and the gm product or if the gm product poses health risk in may 2000 the presiden t announced that fda would be developing guidelines for voluntary beling of gm products the eu council of ministers instituted on june 2425 1999 facto moratorium on any new approvals of gmo crops while new approval and regulatory framework is established this new process will become effective in 2001 in 2000 the eu commission proposed to accelerate the implementation of new approval procedures but met resistance from some eu member countries the prospect of an effective approval proce ss is attractive to ma ny proponents of gmo crops because under the present system new gmo crops are being approved however some harbor doubts about the ability of the eu to overcome apparent strong consumer and environm ental resistance to gmos even with more effective and scientifically based system such doubts ma have contributed to recent decisions by major us agribusiness firms to ask suppliers to begin separating gmo and nongmo corn and soybean products the 106th congress played major role in the domestic debate on regulation and labeling of gm foods as constituencies fo r competing viewpoints sought legislative support s 2080 and hr 3377 were introdu ced to require that food that contains genetically engineered material or that is produced with genetically engineered material be labeled accordingly also introduced were hr 3883

needed to ensure that these foods are safe s 3184 was proposed to require velopers of gm foods to consult with fda increase fdas authority to review these foods and monitor more closely imported foods it also calls for registry of gm foods that have been approved and for information about restrictions if any applied to their use several bills introduced in the 106th c ongress reflected the views of opponents of stricter regulation and beling and of those concerned that regulations in other countries may become trade barriers hr 817 s 19 s 101 and s 566 would have required us trade negotiators to

panel has ruled that the eus preferential regime for importing bananas violates wto rules and that the united states has the right to retaliate against the eu by imposing prohibitive duties on almost 200 million in eu imports the eu indicated its acceptance of the wto ruling but the united states and other complainant countri have rejected eu propos als for altering the banana import regime the united states criticized eu proposals for continuing to discriminate against latin american bananas regarding license allocations and tariff preferences but has not reinstituted wto dispute settlement pr oceedings attention in both the united states and the eu has focused on finding solution to this longrunning dispute and the effects of the ruling on banana exporters in developing countries is factor complicating matters has been internal disagreement among eu members themselves on how to resolve the issue while many in the 106th congress supported the us approach to the banana issue in the wto because of its implicati ons for dispute settlement some members indicated that the banana decision would harm developi ng countries that depend on bananas for export earnings legislation reflecting this point of view hr 1361 was introduced but not passed in the 106th congress it would have barred the united states from retaliating against the eu because of its failure to comply with the wtos decision on the other hand the frican growth and opportunity act pl 106200 see bove require s the administration to increase pressure on the eu to comply with the wto decisions on bananas and

have ruled that an eu ban in place since 1989 on imports of meat derived from animals treated with growth hormones is inconsistent with the uruguay round agreem ent on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures the sps agreement the wto panels agreed with the us argument that the ban lacks scientific justification left open the option for the eu to conduct risk assessment of hormonetreated meat nd gave the eu until may 13 1999 to bring its hormone measure into co mpliance with sps rules the eu did not meet this deadline citing studies that it contends raise human health questions about the use of such hormones the eu said it would maintain the ban while continuing risk assessment in respons the united states in may 1999 stated that it would seek to impose economic sancti ons on eu products valued at 202 million wto panel agreed that sanctions were warranted but in july 1999 set the value subject to sanctions at 1168 million the united states then announced the list of agricultural goods on which the 100 tariffs would be imposed effective july 29 1999 the commission of the european union has proposed continuing the eu ban on imports of beef produced with horm ones the commission made its proposal following recommendation by an eu scientific committee that concluded that one of the growth hormones in use 17 betaoestrodiaol is carcinogenic and should be banned completely while five others were determined to have possible but unproven health risks and should be provisionally ba nned some expect that the eu will use these scientific conclusions to reintroduce the issue in wto dispute settlement us officials claim however that much of the evidence in the eu study has already been considered and rejected by the wto the eu did lift threat to ban the import of all us meats as result of inadequate residue testing and standards for ensuring that meat is hormone free the eu has indicated that this decision which clears the way for hormonefree meat exports would facilitate negotiations to reduce th 117 million retaliation list imposed for the eus refusal to accept imports of hormonetreated meat the eu would presumably offer increased market access for hormonefree meat as compensation for not importing hormonetreated meat some in the us meat industry have been cool to the idea argu ing that imports of hormonefree meat would not be adequate to compensate for losse s incurred due to the eus ban on hormone treated meat as 2000 was coming to clos discussions were ongoing between the united states and the eu over possible resolu

labelinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30789crs13 requirements on meats and on several other agricultural products however none were passed such proposals have attract ed attention for number of reasons one is that they are viewed by some advocates as way to help us producers dealing with low farm prices also some perceive that food products from certain countries might pose greater risks than those from the united states proponents of the bills contended that additional c ountry labeling requirements would enable consumers to know the source of retail food offerings and employ that knowledge in selecting their purchases opponents countered that count ryoforigin labeling bears relation to food safety and would not raise us commod ity prices they argued that it would impose excessive and costly regulatory burdens on retailers and others in the marketing system and on consumers be di fficult to enforce and by imposing new nontariff trade barriers undermine ongoing us efforts to reduce
