assessments of pupil achievement required under the esea and should these requirements be expanded further to include additional subjects andor grade levels especially for senior high school pupils the current generation of pupil assessment requirements under esea title ia began with the improving americas schools act iasa of 1994 pl 103382 that required participating states to develop or adopt curriculum content standards pupil performance standards and assessments linked to these at least in the subjects of mathematics and readingenglish language arts and for at least one grade in each of three grade ranges grades 35 69 and 1012 1 the nclb substantially expanded these requirements to provide that all participating states are to implement assessments linked to state content and academic achievement standards for all 1 for additional information on this topic see crs report rl31407 educational testing implementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by

mathematics by the end of the 2005 2006 school year participating states were also required to develop and implement assessments at three grade levels in science by the 20072008 school year2 assessment results must be provided to leas schools and teachers before the beginning of the subsequent school year so that they might be available in timely manner to make adequate yearly progress determinations for schools and leas see the following section of this report the primary rationale for requiring annual administration of standardsbased tests in each of grades 38 is that the provision of timely information on the performance of pupils schools and leas throughout most of the elementary and middle school grades is of value for both diagnostic and accountability purposes arguably such assessment results will improve the quality of the ayp determinations that are based primarily on the assessments and help determine whether title ia is meeting its primary goals such as reducing achievement gaps between disadvantaged and other pupils achievement standards associated with the required assessments must establish at least three performance levels for all pupilsadvanced proficient and basic or partially proficient state educational agencies seas must provide evidence from test publisher or other relevant source that their assessments are of adequate technical quality for the purposes required under title ia 3 the esea authorizes in title via1 annual grants to the states to help pay the costs of meeting the title ia standard and assessment requirements states and leas participating in title ia must report assessment results and certain other data to parents and the public through report cards states are to publish report cards for the state overall and leas are to publish report cards for the lea overall and for individual schools the report cards must generally include information on pupils academic performance disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender as well as disability migrant english proficiency and economic disadvantage status in addition to these state assessment requirements the nclb requires all states participating in title ia to participate in national assessmen t of educational progress naep tests in 4 th and 8th grade reading and mathematics which are administered every two years before enactment of the nclb participation in naep was voluntary for states naep is administered by the national center for education statistics nces with over sight and several aspects of policy established by the national assessment governing board nagb the main naep assessment reports pupil scores in relation to performance levels based on determinations by nagb of what pupils should know and be able to do at basic proficient and advanced levels with respect to challenging subject matter naep tests are administered to only representative sample of pupils enrolled in public and private k12 schools and the tests are designed so that pupil takes an entire naep test while 2 if agency or entity in state has authority to establish statewide standards or assessme nts as is apparently the case for iowa and possibly nebraska then the state may adopt either statewide standards and assessments applicable only to title ia pupils and programs or b policy providing that each lea receiving title ia grants will dopt standards and assessments that meet the requirements of title ia and are applicable to all pupils served by each such lea 3 several statutory constraints have been placed on the authority of the us secretary of education to enforce these standard and assessment requirements including provision th at nothing in title i of the esea shall be construed to authorize any federal official or agency to mandate direct or control state local educational agency or schools specific instructional content academic achievement standards and assessments curriculum or program of instruction sections 1905 9526 and

pupils schools or most leas naep conducts assessments in 4th and 8th grade mathematics reading and science at the state level as well as for selected major cities under state naep the sample of pupils tested is increased in order to provide reliable estimates of achievement scores for pupils in each participating state an implicit purpose of this requirement is to confirm trends in pupil achievement as measured by stateselected assessments although such confirmation is limited and indirect usually limited to comparisons of the percentage of pupils at various achievement levels on naep and state tests

issues regarding the expanded esea title ia pupil assessment requirements include the following when will states implement math and reading assessments in each of grades 38 what will be the consequences for states that did not meet the deadline of the end of the 20052006 school year most states did not meet this deadline as of the publication date of this report the assessment programs of only 27 states have been fully approved in recent years number of states have experienced the loss of portion of their title ia state administration grants for failure to implement required assessments on schedule should requirements for standardsbased assessments in states participating in esea title ia be expanded for senior high school students as discussed above the current assessment requirements are focused primarily although not solely on the elementary and middle school grades proposals have been offered to expand required assessments for pupils in grades 1012 including required state participation in 12 th grade naep assessment in part to strengthen the process of determining adequate yearly progress for senior high schools however the substantial variation in senior high school instructional programs raises many issues including the following might the required assessments include high school exit or graduation tests given the relatively high degree of curriculum differentiation at the senior high school level eg career and technical education programs college preparation programs and so forth might states be allowed to meet these requirements by adopting different types of tests for pupils in different types of academic programs is it appropriate to allow states to meet current or future high school assessment requirements through endofcourse tests that are different for students taking different courses might advanced placement or international baccalaureate tests be used to meet the new assessment requirements for pupils participating in those programs has the emphasis on reading and mathematics in the title ia assessment and adequate yearly progress requirements see below begun to crowd out the amount of time and attention devoted to other subjects such as writing science history civics or foreign languages concern has been expressed by some and 4 for additional information on possible reauthorization

mathematics and to much more limited degree science through the title ia assessment and adequate yearly progress requirements has reduced time and energy devoted to other subject areas for many students this might lead to proposals to either deemphasize the current requirements or to expand the assessment requirements to include more subjects in more grades should national standards of pupil performance be incorporated in some fashion into the assessment process as way of addressing substantial differences in state performance standards curriculum content and pupil performance standards are determined at the discretion of the states and there appear to be very substantial differences in the degree of challenge embodied particularly in the pupil performance standards some have called for more explicit role for national standards either as embodied in naep or in some other fashion in the nclb outcome accountability process to more directly address national concerns about educational quality and establish greater consistency in outcome accountability policies across the nation 6 others believe that in our federal system where state and local governments pay very large majority of educational costs and have more explicit constitutional authority to set educational standards such basic matters of education policy should continue to be left to state discretion they further argue that states can continue to successfully implement the detailed and challenging federal requirements regarding adequate yearly progress see below only if allowed to establish their own standards for pupil performance g3g141g142g154g158g138g157g142g561g27g142g138g155g149g162g561g18g155g152g144g155g142g156g156g561g507g3g27g18g508g561 are adequate yearly progress ayp requirements appropriately focused on improving education for disadvantaged pupil groups and identifying lowperforming schools key concept embodied in the outcome accountability requirements of the esea is that of adequate yearly progress ayp for schools leas and with much less emphasis states overall 7 the primary purpose of ayp requirements is to serve as the basis for identifying schools and leas where performance is inadequate so that these inadequacies may be addressed first through provision of increased support and opportunities for families to exercise choice to transfer to another school or obtain supplemental educational services from thirdparty provider and ultimately through series of more substantial consequences described in later section of this report these actions are to be taken with respect to schools or leas that fail to meet ayp for two consecutive years or more 5 center on education policy choices changes and challenges curriculum and instruction in the nclb era july 2007

leas and to states overall if state chooses to receive title ia grants however consequences for failing to meet ayp standards for two consecutive years or more as discussed later in this report need only be applied to schools and leas participating in title ia8 and there are sanctions for states overall beyond potential identification and the provision of technical assistance under the nclb ayp is defined primarily on the ba sis of multiple aggregations of pupil scores on required state assessments of academic achievement in mathematics and reading9 with specific focus on the percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level based on state determined achievement standards state ayp standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator in the case of high schools this additional indicator must be the graduation rate for elementary and middle schools the attendance rate is often selected by states to be the additional indicator the additional indicators may not be employed in way that would reduce the number of schools or leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards in addition ayp calculations based on assessment scores must be disaggregated that is they must be determined separately and specifically not only for all pupils but also for several demographic groups of pupils within each school lea and state the specified demographic groups often referred to as subgroups in addition to the all pupils group are economically disadvantaged pupils limited english proficient lep pupils pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial and ethnic groups however there are three major constraints on the consideration of these pupil groups in ayp calculations first pupil groups need not be considered in cases where their number is so relatively small that achievement results would not be statistically significant or the identity of individual pupils might be divulged the selection of the minimum number n of pupils in group for the group to be considered in ayp determinations has been left largely to state discretion and state policies regarding n have varied widely since the same minimum group size policies are applied to schools and to leas overall groups that are too small to be separately considered for individual schools often meet the minimum group size threshold at the lea level second it has been left to the states to define the major racial and ethnic groups on the basis of which ayp must be calculated and third pupils who have not attended the same school for full year need not be considered in determining ayp at the school level although they are still to be included in lea and state ayp determinations if they attended schools in the same lea or state for the full academic year number of special rules which have evolved over time apply to two of the disaggregated pupil groups lep pupils and pupils with disabilities 10 many states have used the statistical technique of confidence intervals in an attempt to improve the validity and reliability of ayp determinations with an effect of substantially reducing the 8 states are encouraged to apply these consequences to all public schools and leas but are not required to do so state practices vary on this point 9 as noted earlier the nclb requires states participating in title ia to administer standardsbased assessments in science at 3 grade levels by the end of the 20072008 school year although statutory provisions are somewhat ambiguous on this point states are not required under current department of education policy to incorporate results from these science assessments into their ayp determinations 10 for detailed discussion of these see crs report rl32495 adequate yearly progress ayp implementation of the child

standards use of this statistical technique is not explicitly authorized by the nclb but its inclusion in state accountability plans has been approved by ed this concept is base d on the assumption that any test administration represents sample survey of pupils educational achievement level as well as the schools or leas performance over time as with all sample surveys there is degree of uncertainty regarding how well the sample resultsaverage test scores for the pupil groupreflect pupils actual level of achievement in practice conf idence intervals may be seen as windows surrounding threshold test score level ie the percentage of pupils at the proficient or higher level required under the states ayp standards the size of the window varies with respect to the number of pupils in the relevant group who are tested and with the desired degree of probability that the groups average score represents their true level of achievement if all other relevant factors are equal the smaller the pupil group and the higher the desired degree of probability eg 99 as opposed to 95 the larger is the window surrounding the threshold percentage school would fail to make ayp with respect to pupil group only if the average score for the group is below the lowest score in the window state ayp standards must incorporate concrete movement toward meeting an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or higher level of achievement by the end of the 20132014 school year this was adopted in response to prenclb ayp requirements in most states that required little or net improvement in pupil performance over time the nclb ayp provisions include an assessment participation rate requirementat least 95 of all pupils as well as at least 95 of each of the demographic groups of pupils considered for ayp determinations for the school or lea must participate in each of the assessments that serve as the basis for ayp calculations the participation rate requirement was adopted in part to minimize opportunities for schools or leas to raise their test scores by discouraging pupils from participating in the tests the primary basic structure for ayp determinations under the nclb is specified in the authorizing statute as group status model with required threshold level of achievement that is the same for all pupil groups schools and leas statewide in given subject and grade level 11 uniform bar approach is employed states are to set threshold percentage of pupils at proficient or higher levels each year that is applicable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determinations in addi tion the nclb statute includes safe harbor provision under which school that does not meet the standard ayp requirements may still be deemed to meet ayp if it experiences 10 reduction in the gap between 100 and the percent proficient or above in the preceding year for the specific pupil groups that fail to meet the uniform bar and those pupil groups make progress on at least one other academic indicator included in the states ayp standards another basic type of ayp model the individualcohort growth model in which the achievement of the same pupils is tracked from yeartoyear is not explicitly mentioned in the nclb statute however under an ed initiative all states may be allowed to use growth models to date eleven states alaska arizona arkansas delaware flor ida iowa michigan missouri north carolina ohio and tennessee have been approved to use growth models 11 for discussion of the models of ayp see crs report rl33032

the all pupils group available data on the impact of the nclbs ayp provisions during the latest year for which complete data are available school year 20062007 may be summarized as follows the percentage of all public schools failing to meet ayp standards for one or more years was approximately 28 of all public schools the percentage of public schools failing to make adequate yearly progress for 20062007 varied widely among the states from 4 for wisconsin and 9 for louisiana to 86 for the district of columbia and 71 for florida these variations appear to be based at least in part not only on underlying differences in achievement levels but also on differences in the degree of rigor or challenge in state pupil performance standards and on variations in statedetermined policies on minimum group size ed in its national assessment of title i final report published in october 2007 reported that 11648 public schools including 9808 title ia schools were identified for improvement during the 20052006 school year on the basis of assessment results through the 20042005 school year these constituted 12 of all public schools or 18 of all title ia schools schools most likely to be identified were those in large urban leas schools with high pupil poverty rates and schools with large minority enrollment the percentage of both all and of title ia schools identified varied widely among the states from less than 1 of all1 of title ia schools in nebraska to more than 40 of all schools in hawaii new mexico and puerto rico or more than 50 of all title ia schools in florida new mexico and puerto rico approximately 30 of all leas failed to meet ayp standards for one or more years among the states there was even greater variation for leas than for schools two statesalabama and michiganreported that none of their leas failed to make adequate yearly progress and wisconsin reported that only two of the states 426 leas failed to make ayp while 100 of the leas in florida and south carolina plus the single statewide lea in hawaii failed to meet ayp standards the percentage of all leas failing to meet ayp standards for 2 consecutive years or more resulting in their being

many schools and leas are failing to meet them especially those with diverse pupil populations substantial percentages of public schools and leas overall have already failed to meet state ayp standards morever future increases in performance thresholds as the ultimate goal of having all pupils at the proficient or higher level of achievement is approached may result in higher percentages of schools and leas failing to make ayp ed officials have emphasized the importance of taking action to identify and improve underperforming schools matter how numerous without specific requirements for achievement gains by each of the major pupil groups it is possible that insufficient attention would be paid to the performance of the disadvantaged pupil groups among whom improvements are most needed and for whose benefit the title ia program was established others have consistently expressed concern about the accuracy efficacy and complexity of an accountability system under which such relatively high percentage of schools is identified as failing to make adequate progress with consequent strain on resources to provide technical assistance and implement program improvement corrective actions and restructuring further number of studies have concluded that when comparing otherwise similar public schools those with wider variety of demographic groups are substantially less likely to meet ayp standards should states be allowed greater flexibility in the models of ayp they implement to meet the nclb requirements although ed has lifted the limit on use of growth models for ayp the conditions established by ed are somewhat restrictive and almost all of the growth models initially approved are relatively limited essentially adding projected achievement level option to the standard ayp model of the nclb the esea might be modified to allow states to use wider range of growth and other models of ayp should ayp determinations retain their current passfail structure or should states be allowed to use more varied graduated rating scale under current law and policy schools leas and states simply do or do not meet ayp standards and there is generally distinction between those that fail to meet only one or two required performance or participation thresholds to marginal degree versus those that fail to meet numerous thresholds to substantial extent several analysts have suggested that more nuanced grading scale be allowed eg division of schools or leas failing to make ayp into higher versus lower priority categories or grades ranging from to f as is used in several state accountability systems major complication is determining at what point on such scale the current automatic consequences eg school choice or supplemental services discussed below are invoked is the flexibility allowed to states and leas with respect to minimum group sizes and use of confidence intervals making it too easy for many schools and leas to meet ayp standards and resulting in the achievement of too many disadvantaged pupils not being specifically considered especially at the school level extensive use by states of these forms of flexibility could make the title i ayp requirements substantially less challenging and significantly reduce their focus on disadvantaged pupil groups consideration might be given to setting maximum levels for state group size and confidence interval policies

multiple indicators placing less emphasis on reading and math assessment scores many educators object to the almost exclusive use of reading and math test scores to determine whether schools or leas make ayp while acknowledging that such scores are basic facet of school system effectiveness they argue that such other important criteria as scores on assessments in additional subjects the percentage of pupils scoring at levels above proficient ie advanced or the share of pupils taking and passing advanced courses should also be taken into consideration opponents of such proposals argue that multiple indicators concepts are sometimes ambiguous or complex and that the dominant focus should remain on math and reading test scores do ayp requirements embody appropriately challengingor unrealistic expectations that all pupils will perform at proficient or higher level by 2014 without an ultimate goal of having all pupils reach proficient or higher level of achievement by specific date states might establish relative goals that require little or net improvement over time demanding goal might maximize efforts toward improvement by state public school systems even if the goal is not met nevertheless goal of having all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement within any specified period of time may be criticized as being unrealistic if one assumes that proficiency has been established at challenging level it is likely that many states schools and leas will not meet the nclbs 2014 ayp goal unless state standards of proficient performance are significantly lowered or states are allowed by ed to aggressively pursue the use of statistical techniques such as setting high minimum group sizes and confidence intervals

leas that receive title ia grants and fail to meet ayp requirements while states are encouraged to implement unitary accountability systems applicable to all pupils and schools states may choose to base decisions regarding lea status and corrective actions only on the title ia schools in each lea further as noted earlier identification as needing improvement and corrective actions need be taken only with respect to leas that receive title ia grants although this includes over 90 of all leas leas that fail to meet state ayp standards for two consecutive years are to be identified as needing improvement technical assistance based on scientifically based research section 1116c9b is to be provided to the lea by the sea and parents of pupils served by the lea are to be notified that it has been identified as needing improvement seas are to take corrective action with respect to leas that fail to meet state standards for fourth year two years of failing to meet ayp standards after having been identified for improvement without in the meantime meeting ayp standards for two consecutive years such corrective action is to include at least one of the following at sea discretion reducing administrative funds or deferring program funds implementing new curriculum replacing relevant lea staff removing specific schools from the jurisdiction of the lea appointing receiver or trustee to administer the lea abolishing or restructuring the lea or authorizing pupils to transfer to higherperforming schools in another lea and providing transportation in conjunction with at least one of these actions finally ed is required to establish peer review process to evaluate whether states overall have met their statewide ayp goals beginning after the third year of implementation of the nclb states that fail to meet their goals are to be listed in an annual report to congress and technical assistance is to be provided to states that fail to meet their goals for two consecutive years or more as noted in the previous section of this report based on the latest available complete data the percentage of public schools failing to meet ayp standards for 2 consecutive years or more resulting at least in the case of title ia particip ating schools in their being identified as in need of improvement is approximately 12 of all public schools or 20 of title ia participating schools while approximately 12 of all leas have been identified for improvement as result of failing to meet ayp standards for two consecutive years or more as implementation of the nclb requirements continues increasing percentages of schools and leas will likely face the prescribed consequences of failing to meet ayp standards for three four five six or more cumulative years finally the nclb has limited provisions regarding performancebased rewards for high performing schools and leas that participate in the title ia program states are to establish academic achievement awards for schools that significantly reduce achievement gaps between pupil groups or exceed ayp requirements for two or more consecutive years and to leas that

consequences to schools with the lowest performance levels on july 1 2008 the secretary of education announced that an initial group of six states had been approved to participate in the differentiated accountability pilot program the accountability plans for the six statesflorida georgia illinois indiana maryland and ohiohave three characteristics in common these are 1 identification of highest priority group of schools identified for improvement focusing the most substantial consequences and improvement resources on these schools 2 some adjustment of the order or severity of

because the nclbs performancebased sanctions generally apply only to schools that receive title ia grants and few senior high schools participate in title ia should new mechanisms be adopted to increase accountability among senior high schools concerns have been expressed that the assessment accountability and performancebased sanctions of the nclb have limited impact on senior high schools without increased participation by high schools in the title ia grant program the application of performancebased sanctions to high schools would not expand with substantial numbers of public schools and leas identified as needing improvement and increasing numbers likely to be identified for corrective action or restructuring as the 20132014 goal of all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement approaches will the ability of states and leas to provide technical assistance school choice and supplemental services options and other resources necessary for effective corrective action

this may not be sufficient to address the needs of the growing number of schools and leas identified for improvement and subsequent sanctions an additional 125 million was separately appropriated for this purpose for fy2007 and 4913 million was provided for fy2008 whatever the level of these grants almost all of the funds must be spent at local level and there are concerns regarding the capacity of many state educational agencies to provide necessary guidance and technical assistance for turning around lowperforming schools why are relatively small percentages of eligible pupils taking advantage of the supplemental services and especially the school choice options required under the nclb are the low levels of participation primarily the result of lack of meaningful options in many localities of inadequate information dissemination and promotion activities by schools and leas funding limitations lack of parental interest or other causes whatever the cause how should this situation be addressed have supplemental services provided by third parties been more effective than conventional public school instruction available information on the effectiveness of instruction by supplemental services providers either individually or in the aggregate is highly limited while some advocates appear to believe that competition and choice will be sufficient assurances of quality others question how the impact of these services can be appropriately measured and evaluated should there be more emphasis on rewards and other positive performance incentives for leas and schools while performancebased rewards are authorized under the nclb they are apparently little used and the current focus is very much on variety of sanctions

qualified teacher hqt requirement in july 23 2007 letter to chief state school officers the secretary of education stated that the plans for meeting the highly qualified teacher requirements of all states except one had been approved30 however the secretary also noted that on the basis of data submitted by states in their consolidated state performance reports for the 20052006 school year state yet met the goal of having 100 of teachers highly qualified the criteria that teachers must meet in order to be deemed to be highly qualified include some elements that are applicable to all public school teachers and others that apply only to teachers who either are or are not new to the profession the criteria applicable to all public school teachers are that they must hold at least bachelors degree must have obtained full state certification or passed the state teacher licensing examination and must hold license to teach without any certification or licensure requirements having been waived for them an exception is made for teachers in public charter schools who must meet the requirements established in the states charter school law program regulations also provide that individuals participating in alternate certification programs meeting certain requirements would be considered highly qualified on provisional basis and given three years to obtain the necessary credentials the additional criteria applicable to teachers who are new to the profession are that they must demonstrate by passing rigorous state test subject area knowledge and teaching skills in basic elementary curricula if teaching at the elementary level or b demonstrate high level of competency by passing rigorous state academic test or completing an academic major or equivalent course work graduate degree or advanced certification in each subject taught if teaching at the middle or high school level finally public school teacher at any elementary or secondary level who is not new to the profession may be deemed to be highly qualified by either meeting the preceding criteria for teacher who is new to the profession or by dem onstrating competence in all subjects taught based on high objective uniform state standa rd of evaluation housse which is not based primarily on the amount of time spent teaching each subject special flexibility has been granted by ed to teachers in certain circumstances for example teachers in small rural leas who teach multiple subjects and are highly qualified in at least one of those subjects were given an additional three years to meet the highly qualified requirements in all core subjects they teach in addition science teachers may not need to be highly qualified in each field of science they teach eg biology chemistry depending on state certification policies for such teachers 31 states have also been granted degree of flexibility in treating middle school teachers the same as other secondary school teachers as provided under

schools and multisubject teachers justified and are there other circumstances that warrant special flexibility current flexibility has been focused on teachers in small rural leas and it may be questioned whether this flexibility should be expanded to other school settings one general area of concern is middle schools the nclb currently treats middle school teachers the same as those in high schools in several respects although many middle school teachers work in settings that are more comparable to elementary schools while ed has allowed degree of flexibility to states with respect to middle school teachers the special role of teachers at this level might be more explicitly recognized in reauthorization proposals are these minimum qualification requirements reliable indicators of teacher quality and effectiveness the nclbs hqt requirements are closely linked to state teacher certification requirements and in the case of secondary school teachers attainment of baccalaureate or higher degrees with major in the subjects taught while widely accepted as minimum qualifications these are not the only attributes closely associated with teacher effectiveness in improving student achievement 35 nor do they address issues of instructional methods used by teachers in the classroom further there is evidence that very large majority of teachers already met the hqt requirements when the nclb was enacted36 however the characteristics often identified in research on teacher effectiveness are much more difficult to measure and evaluate than the current hqt requirements does the current statute give the us department of education sufficient authority to ensure an equitable distribution of teacher quality across schools and leas one issue regarding these nclb staff qualification requirements is whether highpoverty leas and schools will be able to meet the teacher qualification requirements schools and leas disadvantaged by high pupil poverty rates have generally had particular difficulty attracting highly qualified staff 37 have the nclbs paraprofessional qualification requirements significantly affected either the quality of these staff or the extent to which esea title ia funds are used to employ them the nclbs qualification requirements for paraprofessionals performing instructional duties in title ia programs have received much less attention from ed than the hqt requirements states and leas are responding to these requirements in widely varying ways while concern has been expressed that substantial numbers of paraprofessionals previously employed in title ia programs would be unable to meet these requirements and might lose their jobs there is not yet any systematic evidence that this has occurred 35 for example several studies have found such characteristics as the selectivity of the institution of higher education attended by teacher or hisher cognitive level as measured by achievement test scores to be closely associated with achievement test score gains by their pupils see for example teacher quality understanding the effectiveness of teacher attributes by jennifer king rice economic policy institute 2003 36 for details

should esea programs be funded at leve ls closer to the maximum authorized amounts and at what levels if any should authorizations be set for years beyond fy2008 both during its consideration and especially after enactment great deal of the debate surrounding the nclb has been focused on th level of funding appropriated for esea programs particularly on funding trends over time and on differences between amounts authorized and appropriated over the decades since enactment of the original esea in 1965 the typical pattern of esea authorizing statutes has been to specify an authorized level of appropriations only for the first year of the authorization period if at all for most esea programs and to simply authorize such sums as may be necessary for the remaining years 38 the nclb broke with this pattern but only with respect to five of the 45 separately authorized esea programs plus approximately 20 specified subprograms however one of the five programs is the largest federal k12 education program for which approximately onehalf of all esea funding is appropriated and to which most of the major esea requirements are linked education for the disadvantaged under esea title i part thus the following discussion will focus on 1 the esea overall 2 the group of esea programs with specified authorization levels and 3 title ia in particular table 1 below provides appropriations for fy2001fy2008 compared to authorization levels where available for three groups of esea programs 1 title ia only 2 all esea programs for which an authorization level is specified in the esea for that year ie programs for the prenclb year of fy2001 almost all esea pr ograms for fy2002 and five programs only for fy2003fy2008 including title ia and 3 all esea programs appropriations only for fy2001fy2008 because there is recent year for which authorization levels are specified for every esea program under the automatic extension provisions for the general education provisions act esea authorization levels for fy2008 are the same as the fy2007 levels the fy2008 appropriations levels in table 1 are the amounts provided under pl 110161 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 fo r fy2009 funding is currently being provided under continuing resolution at the same level as for fy2008 as noted above the only year for which authorization amounts were specified under the nclb for almost all esea programs was the first year of the current authorization period fy2002 for that year as indicated in table 1 the total amount authorized for all esea programs with specified authorization levels was 26347 million and the appropriation for these programs was 20003 million the grand total esea appropriation for fy2002 was 21954 million for esea title ia specifically the authorization was 13500 million and the appropriation was 10350 million these fy2002 appropriation levels represented substantial increases over the fy2001 level for the esea overall 190 and for title ia 170 appropriations also increased 38 for the largest esea programtitle i part amany program advocates have argued that the full funding level should be based on maximum payment calculations under the basic grant allocation formula even in years when authorization level was explicitly specified the title ia basic grant formula establishes maximum payment based on poor and other formula children

and leas of meeting the expanded programmatic requirements included in the nclb it is likely that definitive answer to this question will ever be available but brief evaluation of the issue is worthwhile if only to enhance ones understanding of the meaning of the question there are varying contexts in which both the costs and the benefits of nclb participation by states and leas may be evaluated first are the costs to be defined relatively narrowlythat is including only the direct costs of meeting such specific requirements as the development and administration of standardsbased assessments of reading and mathematics achievement to public school pupils in each of grades 38 plus science assessments at 3 grade levels alternatively are the costs to be defined more broadly to include for example all estimated costs associated with helping lowperforming schools to meet ayp standards especially as the ultimate goal

some aspects of this issue as narrowly defined for example the government accountability office gao conducted study of the costs to each state of developing and administering the assessments required under title i a39 according to the gao the level of state costs for assessment development and administration as well as whether those costs could be met with funding provided by the assessment development grants that are specifically provided under the nclb depends primarily on the kinds of test questions states choose to utilize in contrast it is almost impossible to systematically estimate the broader costs of improving pupil performance sufficiently for all schools to meet ayp requirements and to meet all of the performancebased sanctions that the nclb requires states and leas to implement if it were possible to estimate these costs they would likely exceed total esea appropriations however it may be questio ned whether the federal government should be responsible for all of the costs associated with identifying and improving low performing schools and there is agreement on what are the most costeffective ways to improve school performance second should the costs associated with nc lb implementation be compared to the total funding level for title ia and other esea programs or only with the increases adopted since fy2001 both the requirements associated with nd the appropriations provided for the nclb built upon body of previous esea requirements and funding it may be questioned whether any costbenefit focus should be on marginal changes or on the entirety third should costs and benefits be evaluated separately for states vs leas vs individual schools costs and benefits of esea participation may differ substantially for state governments vs varying types of leas for example seas are responsible for developing implementing and reporting to ed and the public on policies embodying many of the nclbs distinctive requirements such as assessments ayp or highly qualified teachers however with very few exceptions eg assessment development grants seas have experienced increases in federal funding to help meet these costs that are simply proportional to total program funding levels at the lea level somewhat increased targeting of esea title ia funds on leas with relatively high numbers or percentages of pupils from lowincome families 40 combined with flat or slowly rising total funding levels has resulted in declin ing funding levels for thousands of leas at the same time that they must implement number of expanded esea requirements at the same time many leas most of them large or high poverty or both have experienced comparatively large increases in esea funding in recent years finally should costs and benefits be evaluated purely in financial terms or should they include broader concepts such as changes in pupil achievement level or shifts in control over education policy by different levels of government beyond finances the benefits of the expanded nclb requirements may include increased attention to the educational status of disadvantaged pupils and the schools they attend heightened emphasis on applying high achievement expectations to all pupils and wider range of assessment data for pupils schools leas and states non financial costs may include limited yet substantial increase in federal influence on basic policies 39 government accountability office title i characteristics of tests will influence expenses information sharing may help states realize efficiencies gao03389 40 see crs

least some esea programs continue to be specified after fy2008 and if so at what levels congressional intent regarding anticipated funding levels could be clarified by explicitly stating appropriation authorization levels for each program and each year of the authorization period at the same time this would generate debates over the level at which authorizations should be set further given that the appropriation for the largest esea program title ia has been below the authorized amount each year it may be questioned whether the specification of authorization levels has significant impact beyond generating debate at the same time specified authorizations do provide goal for those seeking increased funding and express the judgement of those involved in the authorizing process of an appropriate level of funding should the implementation of existing or additional requirements be linked to the provision of specified minimum trigger levels of funding in the nclb implementation of certain new pupil assessment requirements was made contingent upon the provision of specified minimum levels of funding for assessment development grants to the states this policy might become model for possible expanded assessment or other requirements in reauthorized esea to address ongoing funding level debates as well as concerns about the costs vs benefits of esea participation for states and leas do the costs to states and leas of meeting the eseas requirements that were initiated under the child left behind act exceed the benefit of federal aid increases since 2001 especially in period of relatively tight federal budgets this question will likely be raised but it will be exceptionally difficult to resolve key issue is whether accountability provisions such as those initiated under the nclb are seen as appropriate mechanisms for assuring effective use of all federal state and local funds rather th an just tradeoff for marginal increases in federal funds

by giving some credit toward meeting ayp require ments in return for increases in the number or percentage of students scoring at an advanced level of achievement should states and leas be explicitly

particular could be significantly expanded by increasing the number of grades in which science assessments must be administered by participating states and explicitly requiring the inclusion of science assessment results in ayp determinations opponents would likely argue that the eseas assessment and ayp provisions are already extensive and complex and should not be expanded should programmatic aid under the esea be targeted more specifically on science mathematics and foreign languages major options here include focusing teacher recruitment and professional development programs

of most federal k12 education program requirements was limited to specific programs or activities supported by federal grant programs 47 although steps in the direction of broader scope for some federal program requirements began with the improving americas schools act of 1994 iasa48 the nclb represented major expansion of the scope of federal requirements as discussed above provisions

scope and detailed in nature but in the view of many observers during the bush administration they have been administered by ed in comparatively active and strict manner as ed staff and designated peer reviewers have examined initial and revised state policies regarding assessments ayp performancebased sanctions and teacher qualifications several observers have expressed concerns about lack of transparency in the review procedures and criteria inconsistencies especially over time in the types of changes that ed officials have approved whether the net effect of the changes is to make the accountability requirements more strict or more flexible whether the changes may make an already complicated accountability system even more complex and whether decisions on proposed changes are being made in timely manner by ed 49 in addition especially during the stalemate over esea reauthorization proposals in the 110th congress the bush administration took the opportunity to expand federal regulation of esea programs as well as allow selected substantial forms of flexibility through the expansive use of waiver authority provided under title ix of the esea for example new regulations published in october 2008 substantially expanded esea title ia requirements dealing with high school graduation rates as used in ayp determinations as well as school choice and supplemental educational services for pupils in schools identified for improvement at the same time these regulations codify previouslyinitiated waiver program allowing use of growth models of ayp and new waiver pilot allows limited number of states to implement differentiated consequences for schools that fail to make ayp see page 15 these actions reflected trend toward not only increased federal influence but more specifically increased control over the federal influence by administration initiatives as opposed to statutes although the nclb substantially increased fe deral involvement and direction in the k12 education policies of participating states debates during the 2001 reauthorization of the esea also featured numerous proposals to increase state and lea flexibility in the use of federal aid and some of these proposals were included in th nclb for example the eligibility threshold for schools to be allowed to use their esea title ia funds on schoolwide basis was reduced to 40 level that is approximately the national average percentage of pupils from lowincome families 50 the statute allows the use of funds under most federal aid programs not just title ia on schoolwide basis if basic program objectives and fiscal accountability requirements are met in addition the nclb amended the esea to allow most leas to transfer up to 50 of their grants among four programsteachers technology safe and drug free schools and the innovative programs block grantor into not from title ia the nclb further authorized additional forms of special flexibility to states and leas although participation in most of these authorities has been extremely limited51 another aspect of this active federal role is continuation of strategy of providing esea aid through large number of separate categorical programs the nclb eliminated some previous esea programs and in some other cases it consolidated groups of related esea programs into single program at the same time the nclb authorized

reduction from the 57 authorized programs in the prenclb version of the esea this comparison is somewhat misleading as the current statute combines approximately 20 distinct subprograms under one authorization52 as result of the detailed and broadly applicable requirements adopted under the nclb federal involvement in public k12 education is significantly more extensive than in the past while the aggregate federal contribution to public k12 education revenues remains relatively small approximately 9 in considering the esea for reauthorization the congress will decide whether to continue this active federal strategy perhaps expanding it further through increased assessment or other requirements or alternatively to place tighter limits on the scope of federal involvement in state and local k12 education systems hybrid approach might involve continued or expanded federal requirements regarding pupil outcomes combined with fewer requirements regarding the purposes for which federal grant funds can be used examples of the latter might include program consolidation an expansion of current authority to transfer funds among esea programs or policies offering increased flexibility in return for reaching specified levels of performance

education include the following should the current relatively active level of federal involvement in broad k12 education policies be sustained or expanded an active federal role is an expression of the national interest in improving educational performance and an effort to assure effective use of federal aid funds at the same time federal role of less scope would be consistent with the limited federal contribution to public k12 education revenues as well as the historical primacy of states and leas in k12 education policy have major nclb requirements been implemented by ed in consistent transparent and effective manner an expansion of the scope of federal requirements has been accompanied by increased attention to the ways in which those requirements are administered and enforced by ed efforts might be devoted to ways to enhance the transparency and consistency of future esea implementation activitiesfor example through increased public dissemination of information on policies proposed by states and eds responses to those proposals should the level of flexibility provided to states and leas in their use of esea grant funds be expanded as with the nclb efforts to sustain or expand outcome accountability requirements are likely to be coupled with efforts to increase state and local flexibility in other respects particularly with respect to how federal aid funds may be used should new constraints be placed on the au thority of the secretary of education to change esea policies through regulations or waivers as exemplified during 52 under the fund for the improvement of education esea title vd 20 distinct programs are combined under single authorization in practice appropriations are provided individually for many of these programs
