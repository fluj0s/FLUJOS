2008 farm bill sidebyside comparison introduction recent high energy prices concerns over energy security and the desire to promote rural business and to reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have sparked congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels biofuels transportation fuels produced from plant and animal materials have attracted particular interest ethanol and biodiesel the two most widely used biofuels receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives loan and grant programs and regulatory programs1 the energy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 established renewable fuel standard rfs this initial rfs required the increasing use of renewable fuel in gasoline starting at 40 billion gallons in 2006 and increasing to 75 billion gallons in 2012 however the rfs was significantly expanded on december 19 2007 when president bush signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa instead of requiring 54 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 the new law requires 90 billion gallons further the 2007 law requires that the rfs be expanded to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022 as compared to an estimated 86 billion gallons under epact although this is not an explicit ethanol mandate it is expected that much of this requirement will be met using cornbased ethanol2 the us ethanol industry expanded rapidly in response to epact outpacing the required growth in the earlier rfs and leading some proponents of cornbased ethanol to support an increase in the mandated levels of the rfs the food conservation and energy act of 2008 2008 farm bill pl 110246 promotes the development of cellulosic ethanol production through new blender tax credits reduces slightly the production tax credit for cornderived ethanol when production reaches 75 billion gallons and continues the tariff on imported ethanol it also expands research on agricultural renewable energy and encourages infrastructure development needed for cellulosic ethanol production during the final months of the farm bill debate both food and fuel prices increased dramatically and the role of cornbased ethanol in food price inflation 1 for more information on federal biofuels incentives see crs report rl33572 biofuels incentives summary of federal programs by brent d yacobucci 2 for more information on ethanol see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci crs2 became subject of intense debate because of the rapid expansion of us corn ethanol capacity as of may 28 2008 existing capacity was an estimated at 87 billion gallons per year while an additional 49 billion gallons was under construction3 some are concerned that the united states will soon reach the limit of ethanol that can be produced from corn critics of cornbased ethanol argue that the industry does not need continued government support and that current corn demand for ethanol is putting strain on corn and other grain markets leading to increases in other commodity prices such as livestock feed which then leads to higher dairy and meat prices4 critics also argue that the environmental costs of corn based ethanol may outweigh the benefits proponents of cornbased ethanol production assert that increased acreage and upwardtrending yields will enable corn producers to satisfy the demand for corn for feed fuel and exports advanced biofuels based on nonfood feedstocks are generating much interest feedstocks that could be grown on marginal land with reduced inputs compared with corn would solve the food versus fuel issue it has been argued however biofuels that rely on other sources of biomass including agricultural wastes municipal solid waste and dedicated nonfood energy crops such as perennial grasses fastgrowing trees and algae are still years from commercial production nonetheless this interest has led to proposals to support andor mandate biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch through explicit requirements research development and extension funding andor tax incentives5 noncorn biofuels could include fuels produced from cellulosic material such as perennial grasses ethanol produced from sugarcane or beets and biodiesel or renewable diesel produced from vegetable or animal oils6 under eisa eligible cornbased ethanol production is capped at 15 billion gallons by 2015 starting in 2009 the rfs will require that an increasing amount of the mandate be met through the use of advanced biofuels biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch key elements of eisa and the 2008 farm bill the following table provides sidebyside comparison of biofuelsrelated provisions in eisa with the enacted
