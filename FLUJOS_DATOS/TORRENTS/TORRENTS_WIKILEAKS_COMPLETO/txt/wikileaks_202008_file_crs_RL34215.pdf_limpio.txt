there is evidence that mexican cartels are also increasing their relationships with prison and street gangs in the united states in order to facilitate drug trafficking within the united states as well as wholesale and retail distribution of the drugs for example in january 2006 the national drug intelligence center reported that gangs such as the latin kings and mara salvatrucha ms13 buy methamphetamine from mexican drug cartels for distribution in the southwestern united states according to the fbi mexican cartels focus only on wholesale distribution leaving retail sales of illicit drugs to street gangs the mexican cartels reportedly work with multiple gangs and do not take sides in us gang conflicts16 in addition to drug trafficking mexican cartels have been tied to both human and arms trafficking auto theft and kidnaping mexican drug traffickers increasingly smuggle money back into mexico in cars and trucks likely due to the effec tiveness of us efforts at monitoring
