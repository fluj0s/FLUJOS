incrimination may not be extended in cases where only foreign prosecution is possible paul s wallace jr specialist in american public law american law division summary several courts in the various circuits have considered whether the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination applies to fear of incrimination in foreign countries and they have come to divergent conclusions the united states supreme court granted certiorari in united states v balsys and on june 25 1998 decided that witness may not invoke the fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination in which only foreign prosecution is possible this report will not be updated aloyzas balsys is resident alien living in woodhaven new york he was born on february 6 1913 in lithuania and entered the united states on june 30 1961 in his 1961 immigration application mr balsys had stated that between 1934 and 1940 he served in the lithuania army and that between 1940 and 1944 he lived in lithuania in hiding the application included declaration that balsys understood that if he made any willfully false statement or concealed any material fact and he entered the united states he could be subject to criminal prosecution andor deportation the statute of limitations bars prosecution for false declaration on the 1961 application but there is such limitation on deportation proceedings1 the office of special investigations osi of the criminal division of the department of justice later claimed to have found evidence that mr balsys assisted the nazi forces occupying lithuania during world war ii and that he persecuted the jews and other civilians as member of the lithuanian security police if so mr balsys would be eligible for deportation2 1 united states v balsys 918 f supp 588 592 n5 edny 1996 2 united states v balsys 119 f3d 122 2nd cir 1997 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 in furtherance of its investigation of balsys wartime activities osi issued an administrative subpoena commanding balsys to give testimony and to produce documents relating to his activities during the war and to his immigration to the united states balsys appeared at deposition and provided his name and address he then asserted the fifth amendment privilege3 and refused to answer all other questions the district court granted the governments motion for an order compelling compliance with the department of justice administrative subpoena even though mr balsys claimed that his answers could incriminate him in future prosecutions by lithuanian and israeli authorities4 three other circuits have considered whether the fifth amendment privilege applies to fear of incrimination in foreign countries and they have reached similar conclusions5 vacating and remanding the decision of the district court the court of appeals said that granting the privilege to those who fear foreign prosecution is consistent with the language of the fifth amendment with its aims and with the reasoning of the most relevant supreme court cases6 and therefore held that the petitioner may invoke the privilege7 in addition the court of appeals concluded that inasmuch as the balsys visa application process in 1961 and the present deportation investigation by osi are separate proceedings he did not waive the privilege by answering questions about his activities during world war ii when he completed his visa application8 the supreme court granted the petition for certiorari in united states v balsys and on june 25 1998 reversed the court of appeals and decided by 72 vote that witness may not invoke the fifth amendment privilege against compelled selfincrimination based solely on fear of prosecution by foreign country9 3 the fifth amendment provides in part person shall be

united states v gecas14 the eleventh circuit held that even real and substantial fear of foreign prosecution would not permit the privilege to be invoked against selfincrimination in civil deportation

states and his activities during world war ii although grecas provided his name current and previous us addresses he refused to answer any of osis questions regarding his alleged involvement in the wartime persecution of jews and instead invoked the fifth amendment16 the eleventh circuit reversed deciding that the fifth amendment privilege protected against real and substantial fear of foreign prosecution17 before the case was heard on remand however the eleventh circuit vacated its opinion and on 10 406 us 472 1972 11 id at 47880 12 378 us 52 1964 in murphy the petitioners were subpoenaed

and instructed the district court to determine whether gecas had waived his privilege against selfincrimination by signing his immigration papers under oath see id at 1567 crs4 rehearing banc18 affirmed the district courts order commanding gecas to testify19 the court of appeals held that although gecas faces real and substantial risk of actually being convicted under foreign law based on the alleged conduct the fifth amendment does not protect against this risk20 the supreme court did not agree justice souter writing for the majority in balsys held that concern with foreign prosecution is beyond the scope of the self incrimination clause21 the constitutional amendment regarding the selfincrimination clause states that person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself22 the court noted that series of court decisions have extended the privilege of silence beyond criminal proceedings to civil and administrative proceedings as well23 however it has never said whether in any criminal case means possible prosecution outside the united states24 we are unable to dismiss the position of the united states in this case that domestic law enforcement would suffer serious consequences if fear of foreign prosecution were recognized as sufficient to invoke the privilege25 the court further stated since the likely gain to the witness fearing foreign prosecution is thus uncertain the countervailing uncertainty about the loss of testimony to the united states cannot be dismissed as comparatively unimportant that some testimony will be lost is highly probable since the united states will not be able to guarantee immunity if testimony is compelled absent some sort of cooperative international arrangement that we cannot assume will occur while the court of appeals is doubtless correct that the expected consequences of some foreign prosecutions may be so severe that witness will refuse to testify matter what not every foreign prosecution may measure up so harshly as against the expectable domestic consequences of contempt for refusing to testify we therefore must suppose that on balsyss view some evidence will in 18 see united states v gecas 81 f3d 1032 1032 11th cir 1996 19 id the eleventh circuit in gecas tried to find middle ground between two earlier decisions by constructing based upon the prior decisions and the policies behind the privilege balancing test of the two goals which includes the protection of individual rights and protecting the goals of government in domestic law enforcement 50 f3d at 156162 156265 however on rehearing banc the eleventh circuit said that although gecas faced real and substantial risk of actually being convicted under foreign law the fifth amendment does not protect against this risk gecas 120 f3d at 1422 the court appeared to base its conclusion on the purposes of the fifth amendment privilege deciding finally that the fifth amendments self incrimination clause was intended as limitation on the investigative techniques of government not as an individual right against the world 120 f3d at 1456 20 id 21 united states v balsys 66 uslw 4613 us june 30 1998 22 id

to conclude about the net result of the benefits and burdens that would follow from balsyss view would be scotch verdict if then precedent for the traditional view of the scope of the clause were not dispositive of the issue before us if extending the scope of the privilege were open to consideration we still would not find that balsys had shown that recognizing his claim would be sound resolution of the competing interests involved26 the court expressed concern for the fact that to recognize the protection as balsys requests based solely upon the threat or fear of foreign prosecution would be contrary to the scope of protection which the selfincrimination clause recognizes the clause applies the principle that the privilege against selfincrimination protects state witness against incrimination under federal as well as state law and federal witness against incrimination under state as well as federal law27 pursuant to this principle federal and state jurisdiction are treated as one and the exclusionary rule created by the court prohibits the federal courts from using testimony compelled by state courts28 there is extension of this analogy and cooperative balance regarding the selfincrimination principle to foreign courts and consequently there is basis for appealing to cooperative internationalism by analogy to cooperative federalism29 the court noted that this does not preclude the recognition of cooperative conduct between the united states and foreign nations whereby claim could be made for recognizing fear of foreign prosecution under the selfincrimination clause in the future but there is presentation of facts giving rise to such level of cooperative prosecution in this particular case30 justice breyer with whom justice ginsburg joined dissenting said this court has often found for example that the privilege recognizes the unseemliness the insult to human dignity created when person must convict himself out of his own mouth at its core the privilege reflects our fierce unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel choice of selfaccusation perjury or contempt the privilege can reflect this value and help protect against this indignityprotection that can be overcome by other needs and that value is less at stake where foreign but not domestic prosecution is at issue31 26 id 27 murphy 378 us at 7778 28 balsys 66 uslw
