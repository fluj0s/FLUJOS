arc breaks and ptps the differentiation lecture given on 11 may 1965 thank you thank you well now i think thats probably an appreciation to the release we made today youre living in ayoure living in different world and right now than you were couple of weeks ago and we get even with people these days we release them anyway weve been knocking them out here left right and center with these new power processes and of course ive been d of ping straight down on this line mary sues been doing the folders and so forth and its nothing new for now to come in the office and all of sudden somebody tears in and says well we just made another one see and as matter of fact in the last two hours i see mary sue sitting there telling we just made release we cant do anything with her her needle is just floating free and its at clear read and that is it and this is starting to get very routine these things that we worked for for months in the past and so forth the state of release is of course the old state of keyedout clear and what we used to work for in the past and get sporadically on this person that person and so forth we now get one for one they walk in here theyve had it in somethingin something under fifty hours theyll be release and thats it and this is quite astonishing and thats why i say the bridge is open and thats for sure and not only that but its walked back into the public thirtyfour levels down we know we can audit anybody who is thirtyfour levels below zero that chart by the way doesnt say that there arent additional levelsthe new gradation chartbelow that point but i have not had time to do scout work in ain an institution to look at cases and i tell you if psychiatrist can agree theyre nuts they really must be but anyway to make long story short these are very very exciting times and you havent really begun to see the tidal wave yet im just seeing it now on my desk in amongst the few of us who are in there slugging on the casecracking unit of review and so on the auditors doing marvelous job and mary sues doing wonderful job on this and weve been working day and night this last week to get out there confidential bulletins upon these particular subjects you say confidential yes because some class w auditor auditing these things would justwell hed not only just mess up hed mess up himself too the weird part of it is its too simple its too simple itsit requires too pure rendition you see additives monkey business this and that see youve got the processes that take people up the line and on fairly average cases as matter of fact ourthese new power processes which are the class vii or the clears processes on the aberrated person and so forth are just wham crash and ive seenive already seen an auditor try to audit these things who was not himself up in terrific case state and he just went wham himself got the idea he cant audit them case isnt far enough advanced but this is it man this is it now we know we can make clears and so forth thats up there above vi and ot that roads been open now for some little time people have been slugging away at it and that sort of thing but the news is is thirtyfour levels below zero straight to release in under fifty hourscrash the only way you can get that by the way is become an intern on thecommercialan intern at saint hill for class vii after completing your class vi work and i would advise you very much to do so but if you do so you will have to work in an organization because were not about to tear the public to pieces you understand were justwere just going to release people and this is one we dont spoil the road is wide open for the human race until we find somebody out in the backwoods of montauk i wont mention any nameslike homer and berner because thatd be libelous and so forth these characters grabbing ahold of somebody and trying to run end words on them oh for gods sakes how silly can you get see and trying to show some bird in the raw meat you know well all you have to do is sit down in front of the meter and the next thing you know the guy is wrapped around telegraph pole and it takes four derricks and seven class vs to dig him out of it see bah thats viciousthats not careless thing to do thats vicious thing to do and i dont think its intended any other way its lets fix them up so they cant go well the way to do that is to grab some upperscale process that is overwhelming the guy and overwhelm him but good and we havecatch them once in while that have been overwhelmed by upperscale processes and then we start to release them for the first several hours while all that pours off of them is the upperscale processes they couldnt dig do you follow and they just pour off as terrific locks right on present time the guy is just boxed in like mad his own case hasnt been touched dont you see so these things have to be handled with some skill and weve got it made and we also have got the horsepower necessary to make it stick and we sure jolly well intend to do so i had good news today most orgs are resurging on the state of emergency which theyve been in and one or two orgs which are still down are arguing with about putting in my administrational policies but theyre still down i wonder if theres any coincidence anyway anyway these are great days to live in were going to see quite few new students and some of you who have been hanging fire around herei just opened up the trail for you and so forth took clay table out of your road here in the last 24 hours you may not have noticed this but i have swept it off the line as process particular reason to have it as process you can put it clear down to level zero as demonstration process is marvelous stuff with which to demonstrate definition and that sort of thing but ive taken it off the road as processes when people start to process raw meat with clay table and so forth they neglect one small point but they neglect it so uniformly around the world that we better take it out because clay table peculiarly amongst all other processes requires that the auditing question be answered and its sufficiently uniform that auditors in hgcs have not been able to get it answered that clay table is the one they fall down on hardest so i was looking for things to take off schedules it wasnt that clay table was bad its red hot but i was looking for things to take off so i swept clay table out of your road and also cut your auditing checksheets to ribbons just last night so theres only few processes left on your auditing checksheet so you should be able to move up through the top fairly rapidly now doing everything i can to clear the way for you and i think that you will find it fairly clear the situation internationally also has improved enormously i might make little bulletin on that effect the attack on scientology in the united states has disintegrated into rout for the government they are now being attackednot mildly putby the united states senate and byand very shortly the house is going to open the ball on the fda australia their report from the inquiry has been delayed so longthe usual course of those reports and inquiries they have down there they seem to do this quite routinely in victoria they have inquiries and then they forget about them and the last three inquiries as desperate as they were in progress and so forth all wound up in legislation and so that one will undoubtedly deadend too because its report isnt even due in parliament for months and parliament is recessing and all of that kind of thing is happening and if we can find victoria why we will set it to rights one way or the other if we can find it you know youre only dealing with tiny little postage stamp on the face of the earth and what seems to be bowling everybody over down inin australia is this fantastic news which keeps coming in to them from the united states you see government runs up white flag you see this sort of thing they seem to be very hungry for that news actually its been very hard on the staff down there mainly theyve been knocked around and knocked around and knocked around true theyre so far offpolicy that they set themselves up to be knocked around but nevertheless they did get knocked around and theyretheyve had it pretty hard and heavy and theyll be snapping back along the line most hco secs and assoc secs in the worldi dont think thisyou know thisare being flown into saint hill over the next many weeks and so forth routinely one right after the other for briefing for releasing and for jelling in on the new org board and so forth i mean were getting ready to roll we mean business and this will completely change lot of peoples viewpoints in lot of ways and get lot of questions answered and so forth its very funny these people fly in here and their own area concerns are so terrific you see that theythese things have got to be answered right away and theyre rather impatient with this idea of being put off and that sort of thing and could be jelled in but whatwhat they really dont know is that the new organizational setup solves all the problems they brought in with them see and thisthat is the cue to that but anyway things are moving very hot and very heavy and youre very fortunate right here at this particular time not to have graduated last month anyway thetheres lot of you that im looking at right this moment i want to see go through this new class vii review unit just as soon as you get through with vi so lets whip it up huh i could let you in on what else is going to happen but ive talked about enough here now and so forth probably people thought i was exaggerating or something of the sort when i said we were going to take the planet but ive always meant just that see i havent meant anything else and the plans are now taking shape and form with which to do this exact thing and the big difficulty on this is youve got to do something like this so that it doesnt overweight somebodys plate an executive for instance who iswhos got so many lines coming in to him and hes so crossedup and hes got so many jobs expansion to him begins to mean simply overwork and he begins to say oh were not going to get any bigger because i cant do any more dont you see so we had to set up an organizational plan which would relieve an executive of thisthis terrific burden and which permitted the organizations to go up in size we have that and we are right now in an organizational phase where were just at the end of disseminationi know that sounds odd but its not at all weve got to hand out the materials weve got in the way which we already have planned you see so dissemination as phase in scientology although it will now manifest itself is actually toward the end of its action see for instance i could tell you what to lecture to bunch of people in pe that would sound to you to be about the easiest thing that you ever did in your life youd say but that couldnt possibly have anything to do with pe and yet they would all be enthusiastically howlingly for you right straight therefrom that straight on for instance youve seen the gradation scale well if you lectured to pe about the need for change you see things should be changed you of course could lecture by the hour see and you could say the most banal things you see like your home life really needs to be changed see world affairs need to be changed youll find the world press is instantly right in your pocket because thats the only message they have to sell see the really hotshot reporter is simply selling the world on the idea that it needs to be changed of course hes got the idea of how bad it is over there and so forth but nevertheless your world press does this itthey jump aboard the bandwagontheyd go down as far as disaster they do this that and the other thing but theyll come right back and say there should be change you see and thats the featured news you know us should get out of vietnam well its in need of change dont you see i mean its all covered you find your leading hot frontpage news stories are always the need of change you see people shouldnt be so careless to set apartment houses on fire dont you see because of the you know i mean itwhatever theyre saying its protest and of course every revolutionary group in the world has only this message we need change and frankly revolutions are popular up until the point where you give them the change that is to be made into then they tend to cool off dont you see this is atherefore you find yourself on the lines of world press on the basis of agreement with world press and if you simplysomebody asks you as reportersays what do youwhat is this scientology and what does this scientology stand for well treat him as beginning scientologist not an hpa and you say what do we stand for we stand for change change to better existence for man thats what we stand for and hed say dogooders huh were not really trying to do good were just trying to change things and if you could hold the fort at that point and just keep putting out that message he eventually would become very satisfied that you are all right and you are very newsworthy you see what change do you propose and so forth well we think that everything should change just go into big generalities and so forth play it by ear you dont have to tell him anything hed wind up in total agreement with you what you havent had is your minuszero levels and that scale which ill give you lecture on one of these days if i ever get around to it is actually scale of awareness and youve never had that scale before and you very possibly in looking at it believe youre looking at the old scales and youre not youre looking at brandnew scale and its the scale of awareness the scale of what he can be aware of its what the person can be aware of or the group can be aware of or the civilization can be aware of so that is an awareness scale and that opens the line right up the line to release on study alone because it has trick if you can locate what person is aware of on that scale you only have to tell him about the next level and hell become aware of that and experience case change see the basic discovery of that is case improvement by education thats brandnew technical thing people have sort of believed that might possibly exist but it isnt executed as shown by the fact that in johannesburg when we were testing children we found out the further they advanced in school the lower their iq was so they must have been educated downhill in some way so you could practically educate person uphill or downhill but that is an awareness scale and the next time you look at that scale i call it to your attention to wrap your wits around that very carefully and examine that factor very carefully because youre going to get it confused with conduct now that person is being hysterical does not put him at the level of hysteria hes dramatizing hysteria but what is he aware of do you follow its what is he aware of it doesnt showconduct was the wrong answer you do not estimate cases by conduct only estimate cases by what they can be aware of and you will have parted company with the psychiatrist and the psychologist and all the rest of the ists and ips of history because thats awareness and after all were dealing with living thing that can be aware and that is the thing that we can know about being without any argument at all and were dealing with that beings ability to be aware now when we say aware do we mean analytical or reactive we mean analytically aware now that puts people down pretty doggone far it also makes it little bit hard to detect we have this guy flying around and everything he touches turns to disaster you see if we were dealing by conduct we would say that is disaster his level is disaster nooo lets go down down from disaster because obviously disaster is an overwhelm see hes dramatizing it so it must bea disaster must be higher than he is now where below that is he aware what is he aware of and we go down several levels and we will run into what the person is aware of by our experience with the person its what he talks about or seems to be alert to there are lower levels than minus thirtyfour on that gradation scale by the way and they are also reachable by the power processes which we are using now to release people but i had to get the scale out and thats why you see on that particular one that the bottom line where i have turned the bottom levels sideways and so forth dont even go to the edge of the paper thats by design there are two levels below that therestheres reasonableness and theres false causation theyre two known levels below that and marvelous you take reasonablenessthat everything is reasonable matter what anybody would say to the bloke it appears to be completely reasonable thats wellknown phenomenon that weve talked about before but its down there below uncausing and false causation of course is below uncausing this guy has gotten tired of never having any cause for anything so he invents them and can go down scale from there but anyway youll findyoull find the human race lying toward the end of that scale you wont find them toward the top of that scale in other words the fellow whos aware of being hysterical is probably pretty hightoned you see hes pretty hightoned bloke but youhow many preclears have you run into that are aware of uncausing theyre aware of causing nothing well how many times have you tried to pull an overt on somebody who says he hasnt done anything hes never done anything anyplace to anybody anywhere its impossible to pull an overt because the person is at the level of uncausing dont you see there isnt any and he never has its hardly even fate causes anything its justit just happens thatswe even had song in the united states not too long ago what will be will be not caused by anything you see one of the reasons religion has gone out of vogue is theyve gone below perception of god wouldnt that be popular sermon for church and isnt it true i dont know where you would go to get perception of god since by definition hes invisible that by the way is the greatest arc break operation that has ever been pulled in the history of the human race the god who is everywhere has mass god of total generality and total unlocatabilitywho has total power and total causation one arc break coming straight up thank you think it over its perfectly true well now this lecture which youre going to get today starts now oh you think youve had lecture oh theyre just some casual comments im going to give you lecture now and you better peel your ears back because i do meananyone and everyone that happens to hit this one im going to talk to you about arc breaks and present time problems and the preamble of this lecture is as followsi know i gave you comm bridge between these two the remarks and the lecture but now the lecture has started got it will you please differentiate between arc breaks and present time problems because please note that about ninetyfive percent of the arc broke pcs unquote that you are doing arc break assessments on are not in an arc break theyre in ptp now when you lost sight of that why you also lost your grip on smooth auditing because you can take pc and say he is arc broken when hes in pt problem and you are then in the situation of trying to fix the car when its the radio thats broken worse than thatworse than that the arc break is usually after present time problem unless it is flagrant case of bypassed charge now let melet clarify that that takes some explaining what is present time problem present time problem is postulatecounter postulate this means then that an individual is at wan dont get the idea of ptp being something that somebody just worries about you know worry worry worry worry worry he doesnt hes agin something you got it hes agin it he isnt sitting there even though hes worryworryworrying hes still worrying about something he is against something he doesnt like something which is counter to his postulates which causes him to worry worry worry and go into apathy and all that sort of thing now lets examine this very carefully we have husband who is having an argument with his wife one says im going to go to the movies and the other says you are not going to go to the movies well now youre looking at warfare youre not looking at an arc break but very shortly afterwards they will both of them appear to be arc broken now if you come along as an auditor and you find this girl who just walked off from her husband looking all sad and weepy and that sort of thing and you try to pick up the bypassed charge well youd probably find some which is the fooler but she wouldnt get any better you see now if you tried to find on her the problem she would snap out of it at once do you see whats the problem well he wants to go to the movies and i dont want him to go to the movies you follow and then we had an argument and then he wouldnt talk to well now look at the sequence on the track arc break argument and then breakup of the comm formula now you put this person on meter and you say now has anybody not acknowledged your communication grrow you say oh thats very good yes who was that well it was my husband you say oh fine now do you feel all better why dont they feel all better well its very elementary that wasnt what was wrong with them now if you go around patching up people for broken legs when theyve got cracked skulls youre going to have some case failures i just wish to call to your attention that this is not the right end to approach the case dont you see if the case has got fractured skull then you do something about the fractured skull see if the case has got fractured postulate do something about the fractured postulate you know dont do something about their bypassed charge elementary now what is the real condition of somebody in present time problem arc broken at wan theyre going to get even grrr brrrrr see postulatecounterpostulate when england went to war with germany it was because germany postulated one way and england postulated the other way and that was great big problem lasted several years very recently and there was auditor around there was only guns and nobody took their guns away from them do you see now i assure you it would have done good to have run hitler on an arc break you would have had to have run him on ptp and who knows if some auditor had been there and run him on ptp that might not have been the end of the war although it probably would have taken power process but all right now lets go back and look at thing which we had we call overts now why does person commit overts theres only one reason person commits overts because we now mean intentional overts not accidentals you can accidentally drop something on somebody although youll usually trace that one back to an intentional too what is an overt an overt is solution to problem now when you define an overt as solution to problem you open up the ordinary runofthemill even the very low level case wide open to solution but when you define an overt or series of overts as an arc break you close it to solution so im tired of seeing you get loses im very tired of seeing you get loses on pcs by this misdiagnosis i know you have good heart i know you feel sympathetic i know that your heart is torn to see somebody standing there weeping because somebody has been mean to them and you want to help them out and i know the mildest thing you can say to them is do you have an arc break and the roughest thing to say to them is what overt have you committed but the resolution of the case is not who has been mean to you the resolution of the case is who have you been mean to process the pc at cause always well now because its so impolite to ask them what have you done and because case is usually having very hard time struggling along trying to get his bearings and so forthparticularly if hes low on levels or something and cant cause anything and never has and so forththis case then is going to have very rough time trying to answer this question have you committed an overt because hes never committed an overt because it was all vitally necessary its totally justified well lets ask the more penetrating question and the more penetrating question is why is it so vitally necessary that he commit this overt and why is it so totally justified well it is those two things simply because it was problem which required solution now what throws you is that the problem is on the backtrack someplace lost in the limbo of godknowswhere that has in many cases nothing whatsoever to do with present time well lets take somebody whos been married seven or eight times do you know theyre probably still solving the problems with their second wife when married to the seventh one do you see and many person in life coming up against marital partner and finding it completely impossible to understand why this person believes these things and does these things commits these overts and so forth doesnt realize that that person is still solving the problems related to an earlier relationship the problem does not exist in present time therefore the properson seems unreasonable and yet to that other person it is present time problem and can advisedly be called present time problem because it is present time for him because there hasnt been any present time ever since it happened that was the last present time he had much to do with see he hasnt been with us since and persons overts are solutions to these hung problems and its very hard to figure out how having an automobile accident routinely and regularly banging up the car as habit solves any problem but if you carefully examine the case you would find out that it solved very pertinent pressing problem which went back to postulatecounterpostulate maybe its with father maybe father never let him use car so therefore the way to solve this problem and so forth is to make car unusable you say well thatsthats crazy thats right you take it back little further and youll find more sensible problems and it actually if you go very far you will find out that it all makes sense in giddy stupid way it makes sense it is not senseless thing youre going into now lets find some fellow hes around plant and we can never discover this boy you look for him you page him you put him on the intercom you send messengers for him and so forth you never seem to be able to catch up with this bird although he is at work well for the last few lifetimes he has handled the military very effectively by desertion and the way he handles life is by not being there when he is there hes still got one solution see which is desertion but actually hes on the job while he has deserted do you follow so hes in continual missingness you look for joe and hes gone you look for bill hes gone you know where is this boy wheres he disappeared to well that was his solution now its obviously solution to getting out of work so we bawl him out see obviously thatso we bawl him out and we say it wont do you any good to keep cutting out of here and so forth youve got to work and earn your pay and you must work and then you find out this is somehow very wrong because somehow he manages to get his work done too and that doesntdoesnt remedy the guy hes still all fouled up hes still all messed up as far as youre concerned even though you told him straight out says youre just trying to get out of work thats why you disappear well that was the wrong asisness so it wasnt an asisness and so the questionif you said it wont do you any good to desert you have to go up on the lines just as youre ordered he would have sighed deeply and gone into sort of frenzy and gone anaten and after that wouldnt have had this in other words if you told him the right problemthis is just hazarding guess im not giving you technique because the devil himself could never innever never dream up what problem this bird is actually in dont you see if you could hit it right on the head why bang thatd be that and hed change his conduct right there be nothing to changing his conduct see oh hed say you get what youd call cognition oh it isnt going to do any good to desert oh well i dont know why i would desert around here anyhow and itd suddenly looks silly to him you know and i furthermore well look i havent deserted im here and yet that would be the end of this phenomenon of missingness do you see now you look on lot of things as overts which are in actual fact vitally necessary solutions to urgent immediate problems of survival the only thing wrong with them is when thats what makes them look daffy now you could go back and use old dianetic technology on this line you could say when i snap my fingers the date will flash dont bother to have any date flash right now im not auditing you i snap my fingers the date will flash see bang there goes the thing and he says five youif you were to have said at that moment or if you said at that momentthis is you know the old file clerk flash response all rightand five five years you know bang of course it might have been the year five too were never sure and you say this fellow says 1932 or something like that what problem did you have in the year 1932 now ill tell you youll get many many manifestations but amongst them wont be disinterest he is absorbed you put him right there on the time track where he is solving that problem now to try to get the major problem that exists on somebodys time track and so forth may very well require power processes and so forth this is one of the manifestations which shows up but it doesnt require power process for you to become clever at this because if person has some fundamental problem in his life i dont care when it was or where it was it has formed innumerable locks and those locks have moved on up to pt and those locks are the overts and the withholds which the person is committing right in present time so those formed locks are perfectly legitimate target for an assist they are perfectly legitimate bait for any auditor in any session you dont have to ask for the overts if you ask for the solutions to the problem and then if youre very careful that you got all the solutions to the problem so the old process of tell problem and now what solutions have you had to this problem by the way that was slight misnomer see what solutions have you had to this problem what solutions did you put into effect to solve this problem would have been closer question you see well that old process was nibbling around the edges of overt withhold processes and you actually could work this in such way as to run ow on the person by just saying tell problem now what have you done to solve that problem or how have you attempted to solve that problem or what would have solved the problem or what action of yours was solution to the problem do you see what im getting at because any action they took to solve the problem was an overt to some degree because it was against another postulate do you follow so therefore when you keep sailing in on somebody asking him for arc breaks youre not talking about whats wrong with him in the majority of cases an arc break is charge which has been restimulated on the backtrack which the person hasnt had move into his total consciousness its just borderline consciousness you understand now heshes had an accident and you come just near enough the accident to clip it against the outer fringes of his consciousness now he instantly starts to avoid this accident and becomes very upset and charge has gone into effect on his backtrack which hasnt been identified and that is what an arc break is an arc break is bypassed charge hasnt really anything to do with the solutions to problems now an individual who is failing to complete communication cycle because somebody wont acknowledge it and so forth only has really the bypassed charge of missed withhold it was an inadvertent missed withhold its very spooky thing to be auditing pc and look for overts and withholds and keep getting read on withhold and the pc starts going around the bend trying to think what this withhold is only to discover that it is an inadvertent withhold he didnt intend to withhold it just nobody would acknowledge it he never intended to withhold it at all inadvertent withhold now an inadvertent withhold will cause very near the same phenomena as an actual withhold preclears sitting there trying to tell his auditor the answer to the question and the auditor says do birds fly and the pc says uhbig birds do see and the auditor keeps asking him well what sort of birds well big birds well what sort of birds big birds what sort of birds all of sudden the pc quote arc breaks well he actually doesnt arc break you have really put into effect the mechanism of withhold and so of course he gets nasty and nattery and choppy and so forth but you call it an arc break do you see thats slight misnomer now the only reason that its an arc break is youve bypassed the charge of his answer so that much of it is an arc break but the better part of it is is youve given him problem hes now trying to solve it hes being told to answer the question and he is not being permitted to which is again question versus an answer or postulate counter postulate which wont resolve so it sets up in counteropposition and that is problem if you get pc whos been chopped up and so forth by not having his answers acknowledged or accepted by the auditor and so on its very interesting that it will solve quite rapidly by asking him about what problem he has had in auditing hell give you this problem and that problem and the other problem and so forth and all of sudden well the problem of getting somebody to listen to and that will be the end of that problem do you follow now if you wanted to get his overts against auditors you would say then then how did you go about solving it and he gives you whole string of overts which previously had been completely out of sight well he comes to session late dont you see he reports auditors to supervisors heyou see when they havent done anything you see he could go on and on and on and hed give you whole bunch of these little overts dont you see do you see how this puttogether goes now you could easily be misled because there is bypassed charge there immediately in the session which does respond to some degree to an arc break phenomena so you say he must have an arc break oh yes he also has an arc break but that arc break doesnt happen to be cleanupable it would be pretty hard to clean up that arc break as surface manifestation because it doesnt have anything to do with the problem he only had an arc break because he had problem now if you were to clean up the problem and the problems he had had in relationship to his auditing why whole string of arc breaks will blowsocalled see you get rid of lot of them and also whole string of overts so the way to approach it was not by finding out this little tiny piece of bypassed charge that occurred in the session the way to knock this thing apart was to find out that colossal number of problems he has had about auditing do you follow what problem have you had with about auditing well very often you didnt seem to listen to see well how did you handle this well i stopped telling you right answers now the reason this is solvable is that problems and awareness of problems is down below minus thirtyfour problems is way south and cause is way north so of course you try to pull problems directly with ow the pc would have to already be so hightoned they wouldnt have any effect on him if you did pull them but you can discuss problems with most everybody if you go into spinbin and just stop the first person you meet and say do you have problem ohhooh brother does he have problem but hes liable not to tell you about it because youll order him to being electric shocked or something yeah hes got problems people seem to understand this way down south it seems to be on the basis that where there is life there is problem so your proper approach in making your pcs smooth in making the life of your fellow scientologists run like welloiled dream with auditing is the approach through finding out whats the postulatecounterpostulate situation when pc feels allor looksall downgraded or upset and attack it from that quarter and you suddenly will have the magical result of somebody coming up shining now this does not say there isnt such thing as presas bypassed charge and an arc break brother if you want to see good nice healthy arc break just throw an end word or something into restim on somebody that he is not aware of and here is this total howling generality in full play back down his track but outside of his zone of awareness and brother he will arc break and now you really see an arc break do you see here youve got this total generality because the whole bank is total generality which is the most total generality that one can state that is still true oh yes there is such thing as an arc break very very definitely his affinity reality and communication go right by the boards because he cannot locate the source of he cannot locate where this horrible feeling is coming from he cannot identify the threat and he goes zzzzzzz he feels terrible it isnt because hes sick at his stomach its because he doesnt know whats making him sick at his stomach somebody get broom and knock that down would you see it isnt that he is feeling terror or something like this its because he hasnt clue whats making him feel terror you inadvertently list series of end words or goals on somebody and then abandon the right one in other words he didnt notice that on the list dont you see he put the list down and then you go right over the right one and you give him wrong one well at that moment youre going to have lovely arc break his affinity is going to drop his reality is going to drop his communication level is going to go to pot and it will happen on such steep curve it looks like stuka dive bomber arc breaks be darned its an arc smash you see now his understanding of the situation will go completely by the boards at that exact second and in r6 you can see person go from about tone 40 to about tone minus 40 in the flash of an eye if you goof on bypassed charge because this total generality he knows not what of now has got him in total grip and hes spooked and he goes what happened see rroaw and instantaneously becomes rather irrational about the whole thing and so forth now youif youve ever seen that one happen thats real arc break but this business about some instructor bawls somebody out and he now has an arc break oh b he hasnt got an arc break hes got problem instructor thought one thing he thought the other thing now what goes into view here hes probably got little series of overts against this instructor too and at that moment he contemplates few more now some student grabs ahold of him and gives him an arc break assessment and nothing happens nothing happens at all well of course nothings going to happen because you arent running the right process see youre fixing the piano leg when its the sofa pillow and you know its just the funniest thing in the world youre going to repair all the pianos in the world without fixing any piano stools if you go around and make habit of addressing the wrong item to repair consistently and continually people will get an idea that youre pretty poor mechanic and youll get an idea youre pretty poor mechanic too if you keep repairing sofas and then go over and play the piano to see if it plays any better but it doesnt play any better and you come back over and repair the sofa some more in order to see if the piano plays any better but the piano doesnt play any better you can keep that up for hundreds of years i know nobody would do that but in the field of auditing remember we are dealing with things which are not visible to the naked eye you have to know about them and you come to know about them by experience and subjective reality and so your subjective reality on the thing will tell you this is true when youve had it happen to you few times the trouble with arc break assessments is they very often give an auditor win and he gets stuck in win and this is very often fateful thing to happen to somebody hes got such terrific sudden relief on the pc when he did an arc break assessment you see that he says boy and hes still hunting to do that so he does it on the people with present time problems too and he doesnt get any wins on those so he begins to wonder where is this win he begins to feel around like the guy who needs spectacles but cant find his glasses see where is this thing you know it must be around here someplace well well do some more arc break assessments and itjust nothing happens well he just happened to get the fellow whothat had an end word in restimulation or piece of the reactive mind in restimulation and just happened to knock the thing out dont you see accidentally knocked it out i mean if were doing something very innocent like an arc break assessment on level zero see well they had bypassed charge the fellow had an engram or secondary or gpm or something key in on him you see and it caused an arc break and then we did an assessment and we picked up the key in the exactthe exact keyin the moment of it which keyed it out dont you see boy its one of these things its like throwingits like this stuff they play on the stage here on the london palladium thethrowing some of those balls into the circular holes and so forth trying to match something up you know and the hole isthe hole is the wrong shape and tipped the wrong way dont you see like at carnival did you ever go to carnival and waste your money trying to throw rings on canes and did you ever notice that the canes are placed just so that ring fits on any of them but that sometimes over at the side the one that youre supposed to be able to get that will catch it thats the one in thousand dont you see but you could get that exact instant when you had keyin of heavy bypassed charge key that out and get this fantastic resurgence on your pc and you say boy these arc break assessments boy theyre the most and you go around then for the next year trying to find your glasses what happened you see and i must be bad auditor and i should have to study great deal more so that i can learn how to do this well what you havent learned how to do is run problem now for person who is in the world of livingness you find out that running problems is much the safer bet and if you were to bet on these two things one for one you see if you were to bet on them the thing to put the bet on is the problem because that would occur far more often youd still miss occasionally because the fellow really was in an arc break you see it was bypassed charge from that bank got in and the moment of keyin if contacted would pass out dont you see but it will also pass out if you handle problem dont you see so these light session arc breaks that you get on grade iiiiii pc and so on theyre actually mostmost uniformly handleable on the basis of problem you save your arc break ability and so forth for when you really need it because there is problem of any kind whatsoever would ever touch gpm that would have to be the charge you would have to find out was it an end word was it gpm was it an item was it this was it that have we thrown an ri in restimulation because of course thats so overwhelmingly huge in its ability to overwhelm the pc that he isnt aware of that being problem at all thats just total overwhelm its like saying do you have problem with internal revenue well you couldnt possibly have problem of internal revenue they just throw you in jail so you could call that sort of an arc break you get the idea you get where the borderline switch occurs here you see when guy is so overwhelmed and the charge is so tremendous and so on thatwell you have to key out that thing but then that thing is easily spotted if you know what it is then this tells you of course that person occasionally can go around in an arc break that you couldnt touch at lower levels and thats perfectly correct because most people low on the tone scale are in continuous arc break with existence and the way to handle that arc break with existence is to handle their problems and find out what little continuing overts they have to do all the time all the time all the time all the time in order to keep even with existence and if you did that you would very rapidly achieve state of unarcbrokenness apparently until the next arc break do you see arc break is manifestation of lowering of affinity reality and communication its just that manifestation if this has occurred when youre doing r6 auditing if this occurs along that line someplace ah well you havent any choice but to go down and get that item once in while you can do session arc break assessment when your pc is very arc broken you will hit the exact instant when you keyed something in but if you think that it was something that happened in the session that caused the arc break youre very badly mistaken the session inadvertently brought into view someplace on the backtrack something which was not acknowledged heavy charge on the backtrack moved in just to the fringes of consciousness of this pc and he reacted and his affinity reality and communication went by the boards now if you were to do this little session arc break assessment and one of them bings like i didnt acknowledge your question you can say i didnt acknowledge your question and this thing will go back and lie down and be good dog see that doesnt mean it wont key in again tomorrow now theres something else that must have it keyed in too it must be that hes already in postulatecounterpostulate situation in order to be pulling bank in on himself like that now heres an old thing that i dont particularly think that you ought to experiment with just for the fun of experimenting with it but if you think of yourself as expendable someday well just try it this is an experimental process i underscore it is experimental and is not therapeutic in any way shape or form but it is highly educational run on somebody or yourself the process invent problem and after while youre going to see some black masses start showing up in your vicinity now this isnt because you are pulling in backtrack this is because youre really collapsing your bank so you invent problem and you invent another problem youll seeif youre lucky in this experiment this is the usual resultyoull see mass moving in on you and you invent another problem itll move another two feet closer to you you invent another problem and itll move another two feet closer to you see now if you keep doing this and if all of the problems you invented were brandnew problems which had nothing to do on the backtrack why youd eventually get in ball now also if you invented solution invented solution invented solution invented solution and if they were all invented solutions you similarly would get the mass moving in on you but if you accidentally as you normally would do gave problem which was on your backtrack if you thought of problem and thought of problem and thought of problem and thought of problem and thought of problem the problem would move away from you have you got this now in other words youre getting less problems youll see that black mass in the mind moving out because youre running old problems really thought of problem thought of problem thought of problem now if you want to see it move back in invent solution to it see therell be some kind of representative mass now invent solution make sure you invent solution something that you could do right now in present time to solve that situation well i could hit it well i could asis it i could run flows on it dont you see and youll see that thing coming closer and closer and closer and closer in other words any inventedness totally new inventednessthis is the trickhas tendency to collapse the bank totally new inventedness whether problems or solutions but if you started knocking out bunch of whole track problems you would find the problems going away from you if you started knocking out bunch of whole track solutions you would find the mass going away from you too well why the nearfar and thats all im trying to teach you here you can play this eighteen ways from the middle its very interesting to see mass and you just invent anotheryou answer the question again see and its closer see and then bang you answer the question again and this thing is closer how come its closer where is it coming from how come see and you do an asisness on the subject and it moves away its quite amusing youll see this thing move eventually if you go on and get problem of comparable magnitude problem of comparable magnitude something like that why it may not move away or it may move up it just depends on whether or not youre asising problems you see or inventing them but you normally would see it move out because its almost impossible to invent new problem you havent had so ityoud see this thing go out out outyoud finally say well its out there couple of couple of lightyears thats long way away i cant even see it anymore youd say all right good now solve it thank you solve it solve it solve it solve it wait minute it came back good solve it some more solve it again hey now if you really wanted to be real mean to somebody why just say well solve it and hed say well its about five feet away hed say very cheerfully and you say all right dream up another solution to that erk dream up another solution to it well wait minute its right up against my face now good dream up another solution to it ow see he starts feeling crushed if its psychiatrist leave him that way if its scientologist why pick up some of the things youve been doing and move it out again you didnt get that joke probably too bedazzled with this experiment you understand this experiment in other words you can move mass in and out on the basis that you get rid of problems or get rid of solutions or invent problems or invent solutions do you understand now the usual thing is to put up the representation or experiment in this way run problem of comparable magnitude think of problem of comparable magnitude think of problem of comparable magnitude think of problem of comparable magnitude and youll see that mass moving out out out out out out out you see and then youll say think up solution think up solution think up solution and youll see it come in in in in in in in you got the idea but the main message here is that you can move mental masses around with the idea of problems and the idea of solutions why well its basic definition of problems and solutions solution is an effort to bat it away which normally fails and its postulatecounterpostulate to begin with so just the thought of problem will find the opposite postulate across from you in hurry this basically proves the definition of postulatecounterpostulate now how does this fellow get that mass away from him he feelsyou see this is happening to him in livingness it isnt just an experiment which im giving you which you could run this happens to this bird he has problem and life sort of moves in on him hows he going to get rid of that well his effort is one to bat it to push at it to do something to it whats it the problem well how come he calls it it well because its represented as mass to him because it is mental mass because if he kept on getting this problem it would squash his face in postulate counterpostulate on the backtrack every time you had fight with another thetan why he hit you with beam and you hit him with one dont you see so people have this trained in as quite mechanism here one of the oldest mechanisms there is postulatecounterpostulate so whether he sees it or not when he has problem show up he gets mass show up and whether he realizes it or not the thing he tries to do about it is to do something about it to move it away from him but his effort to move it away from him will move it closer to him so hes in situation when he has problem that he has to do something about something in order to get rid of the something which is moving in on him do you follow that if you dont youre just trying to overread too much into it if guy has problem hes usually got what the problem is now sometimes you can have problem with missingness it isnt there and theres nothing to confront problem of missingness that is the problem of where is it which goes into rather total generality and at this moment your problem fringes on the basis of an arc break and thats why they appear to be cousins so the its gone as situation and where do i find it and where can i look for it and where can i get another one in other words problems of this character you see are borderline to the arc break in other words the nothingthereness will come into close cousin to the generality of an arc break do you follow he cant locate it or find it and so forth do you see so they come cousin so its very easy for you to make mistake between them and i dont blame you for making mistake between them but i should have thought by now that failures to solve arc breaks would have pointed out to you that there must have been something else wrong with the pc because you have quite routine failures in handling arc breaks somebodys turned over to you to run an arc break on well right away that is the wrong thing to do is to tell somebody to take somebody to run an arc break on them the diagnosis has already been made and it is misdiagnosis some student is nattery and choppy and upset about something or other so somebodys liable to come along and say all right do an arc break assessment on that student see well now that would be completely improper direction as matter of fact it comes under the heading of job and reputation endangerment because you very well may have been set up problem that cant be solved because it is problem not an arc break you see somebody has told you to run an arc break assessment when as matter of sober fact they should have told you straighten up that student do you follow and then what you ought to dowhat you ought to do when you find something like this is to ask the person if they have problem and youll get rid of it ten times as fast as anything else on every process except r6 on r6 you see somebody all cavedin and chopped up you jolly well better get your bypassed charge list for r6 you better break it out and go down the line because thats the problem its again problem of whats there which is impinging on the consciousness dont you see but nothing under the sun will ever find it but an r6 assessment you see all these other things are just locks on the reactive bank and that is the reactive bank there is other it maybe never has occurred to you that theres other reactive bank than that fellow just doesnt go on making reactive bank unless hes under an awful compulsion to do so and the basic one of thefifty percent of the reactive bank is devoted to compulsion to make reactive bank do you follow so if youre running r6 or something like that and your boy gets into trouble and so on well theres nothing you can do about him but find the bypassed charge on lower levels why arc break oh i dont know i would finally occasionally use an arc break assessment on some pc particularly if id known id goofed if id catch myself going by and so forth and realized i hadnt acknowledged the pc and the pc was getting rather urgent id realize id failed to acknowledge the pc and id key it out right away quick id say have i failed to answer an auditinghave i failed to acknowledge an answer youve given yes you did well when was that all right i failed to acknowledge an answer and the pcd cheer up and the session would go forward dont you see that type of arc break assessment you see well im afraid i wouldnt sit down with long list and go on for two or three hours of assessment by elimination unless i were doing auditing by list you could probably get somewhere with that that old auditing by list is kind of interesting in life has anybody failed to acknowledge you you know youd get some answers to that question quite an interesting theory dont you see but normally normally you see somebody who is nattery chopped up unhappy with their auditing unhappy with you unhappy well just handle it as problem and itll blow away dont foist off problem on them if they dont have one but you actually will not find an individual who is choppy or upset who doesnt have problem they go together like pat and mike in the old jokes theyre side by side this guys going ohhh i dont want you to audit anymore inoonononoooo well it isnt advisable to say what overt have you committed against nor is it advisable to say because heit wouldnt be there if he knew what engram are you dramatizing see these are perfectly correct questions if they were answerable but they dont happen to be answerable you see sure enough hes dramatizing some engram these things are perfectly true but the question is how can it be approached well the way it can be approached is have you got problem oh boy have i got problem you get an almost bangbang answer see oh im so arc broken im just so arc broken good what problem do you have oh problem well i got just tons of problems and youll find the personll pick right up arc break assessment can be as idiotic asyou dont even take them and put them on meteryou say have you got problem oh yeah whatcha doing about it hmm you see an insane glee come in some peoples eyes you understand what im trying to tell you here im trying to tell you that you dont have overts in the absence of problem people do not commit overts for nothing when they commit overts they are solutions to the problem the problem may be daffy the problem may not have been in existence for the last trillennia but it is still real problemto them and their overts are efforts to solve that problem and that you could unburden their case very easily by finding well problems and solutions run almost in any way of the hundreds and hundreds of different ways i know of to handle problems what part of that problem could you be responsible for thank you very much what part of that problem could you be responsible for what part of that problem could you be responsible for tell problem of comparable magnitude how do you solve that problem in other words you could go on and on and on and on and on you got the idea i mean theres just dozens of them theyre perfectly mechanical see they require insight of any kind whatsoever do you have problem the guy says uhhuh what part of the probl he hasnt even told you what it is and youll be tremendously successful in picking somebodys tone up dont you see you dont have to know anything you dont have to do anything you dont have to be clever you dont have to even read the meter so i want to know why youre working at it when you do whats the sweat its just too easy youll find out that if insome person has tremendously fundamental problem in life you ask them for problem and you say all right was that your problem really the problem was something else the problem was soandso and soandso and you say all right is that your problem and theyll say my problem is really they deny each problem as they asis it and they keep coming up and they keep giving you these problems and giving you these problems well whats happening here theyre asising the problems and they of course are getting down to the main problem they can keep this up for long time too this individual can tell you oh yes i have problem well dont think youve arrived anyplace when hes told you because youve just got the one on top how about the five hundred and eightyfive thousand nine hundred and sixtynine trillion that lie below it theyre all locks on some fundamental problem this guy was still trying to get out of pyramid in localin lower upglop see something is happening somewhere on his track and he just keeps adding stuff on top of it and he will articulate this the basic mechanism of the mindthe basic mechanism of the mind is that it needs problem situation to lock up time you mustnt forget that if person is locked up anyplace or is out of present time it must be because of problem there isnt anything else can stop him on the time track but problem havent you noticed that all the stories that appear in your color magazines every sunday and on tv and so forth and we are looking at journalism which is apparently stuck in world war ii they fight world war ii every few months here well why well because there was postulatecounterpostulate and it was all pulled together with whole bunch of solutions and there it is tied up on the time track and the civilization to marked degree has not moved off that point of the time track so that if you opened cabaret up in london which consisted of deep cellar with lot of arrows pointing and your hostesses were all wearing airraid wardeness uniforms and hats and so forth and what people did was go in there and sit down on the floor and it was sort of dim you would probably if you charged fifty bob for entrance to the place youd probably make fortune as its an airraid shelter people could go to youll find any point of the time track where civilization is stuck why they will buy that period as more real than any new period or creation which you could give them now similarly you want to know how to get your pcs attention if your pc doesnt seem to be giving you very very close attention well you can immediately assume that the pc is locked up someplace in the backin back time and if you want to get his attention you have to enter that back time period from your time period and the way to do that is to trigger the back time period and you instantly have his attention because youre right there with him obviously youre saying to him do you have problem oh yes yes what somebody else here hadnt somebody been here for years very good yes ive got problem my problems soandso and so on well those two sabertoothed tigers theyre sitting over in the corner thats hell of problem im sitting here with youll find him very glib hell answer up right now you very seldom even on very daffy person find theres much comm lag in giving you problem because youve entered that point of the time stream where they are theyre stuck now all youd have to do would be to release in huge mailing tell your problem youd get an awful lot of mail that is the auditing question so therefore why anybody would go around asking people if they had arc breaks and losing when all they have to do is ask them if they have problems and winwell thats it i wouldnt even bother to give you process to run problems today i cantheres just been too many of them all of them effective every one of them had some effectiveness even old mockup processing had effectiveness god forbid knowing the reactive bank now now if youre trying to get overts off so you say well i know hes got overts i know hes got overts i know hes got well you could say that about anybody you see and its perfectly true but how do you make it stick well you cant go up to person at uncausing and say do you have an overt but you can go to that person and say do you have problem and what are you doing to solve it and hed give you his overts now to get him to realize theyre overts is of course quite impossible because theyre necessary solutions you got it well you see i did have lecture to tell you about today didnt i and what i was talking to you about was all froth wasnt it but the lecture wasnt but i hope you can use this i hope you can use it i hope you can press it to your bosom the next time you see some pc looking all durrh restrain this feeling of saying you poor fellow who has done you in and just say whats your problem oh well brrrrr youve got him in communication youve got him answering up the auditing question and all you have to do is remember now to acknowledge and so forth and dont give them further problem of finding out theyre talking but not to anybody all right well i hope you can use that ive latelyactually dont think that youre just being stupid because youve missed this in scientology any technology has alongside of it channel of communication it is how things can be phrased how they could be communicated this in actual factsomebody might havemay have known some of these principles someplace on the track but he never communicated them so the communication is the better part of the thing because only when communicated is it of use and i have found recently by experience with cases how to communicate this to you so that you could understand it and i trust i have done so thank you very much
