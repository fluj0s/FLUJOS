domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947juvenile justice legislative history and current legislative issues summary juvenile justice in the united states has predominantly been the province of the states and their localities the first j uvenile court in amer ica was founded in 1899 in cook county illinois and by 1925 all but two states had established juvenile court systems the mission of these early juvenile courts was to rehabilitate young delinquents instead of just punishing them fo r their crimes in practice this led to marked procedural and substa ntive differences between th adult and juvenile court systems in the states including focus on the offenders and not the offenses and rehabilitation instead of punishment the federal government began to play role in the states juvenile justice systems in the 1960s and 1970s in 1974 c ongress passed the first comprehensive piece of juvenile justice legislation the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act jjdpa the jjdpa had three main co mponents it created set of institutions within the federal government that were dedicated to coordinating and administering federal juvenile justice efforts it established grant programs to assist the states with setting up and running their juvenile ju stice systems and it promulgated core mandates that states had to dhere to in order to be elig ible to receive grant funding although the jjdpa has been amended severa l times over the past 30 years its basic shape remains similar to that of its original conception as it was passed in 1974 the jjdpa fo cused largely on preventing juvenile delinquency and on rehab ilitating juvenile offenders s ubsequent revisions to the act added sanctions and accountab ility measures to some existing federal grant programs and new grant programs to the acts purview in altering the jjdpa to include greater emphasis on punishing juveniles fo r their crimes cong ress has essentially followed the lead of the states during the 1980s and 1990s most states revised their juvenile justice systems to include more punitive measures and to allow juveniles to be tried as adults in more instances this has marked significant change in the philosophy of the juvenile justice system both at the state level and at the federal level from its original conception juven ile justice in general has thus moved away from emphasizing the rehabilitation of juveniles and toward greater reliance on sanctioning them for their crimes the jjdpas authorization expired in fy2007 but its major programs have continued to receive appr opriations reauthorization will likely be an issue confronting the 110th congress policy issues associated with its reauthorization could include what the best federal response to juvenile violence and juvenile crime should be whether the system should fo cus on the rehab ilitation of juvenile offenders or on holding juvenile offenders accountable for their actions and whether the grant programs as currently comprised represent the best way to support juvenile justice efforts in the states s 3155 as reporte d by the senate committee on the judiciary would reauthorize the jjdpas majo

juvenile offenders has largely been the domain of the states and as result of this the laws th at pertain to juvenile offenders can vary widely from state to state there is fe deral juvenile justice system although the federal government does not play direct role in administering juvenile justice in the 1960s the federal government began establishing federal juvenile justice agencies and grant programs in order to influence the states juvenile justice systems the juvenile justice and delinquency preven tion act jjdpa of 1974 created many of the federal entities and grant programs that continue to operate today including the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp and the state formula grants eligibility for many of these grant programs is tied to certain mandates that the states have to adhere to in order to receive federal funding over the ensuing decades the jjdpa has been modified number of times broa dening the mandate of the agencies it created and adding to the grant programs it established this report will analyze the current federal legislation that impacts the state juvenile justice systems although the report provides some background information on the evolution of juvenile justice in the united states the main focus of the report is the major federal legislation that impacts the states juvenile justice systems including the jjdpa as the major provisi ons of the jjdpa are currently authorized through fy2007 several issues pertaining to its reauthorization may be of concern to the 110th congress including but not limited to the

these juvenile courts was to attempt to turn young delinquents into productive adults rather than merely punishing them for their crimes this led to marked procedural and substa ntive differences between th adult and juvenile court systems in the states including focus on the offenders and not the offenses and on rehabilitation instead of punishment1 the federal government began to play role in the states juvenile justice systems in the 1960s and 1970s in the j uvenile delinquency and youth offenses control act2 congress provided funds for state nd local governments through the department of health edu cation and welfare to conduc t demonstration projects to research improved methods for prev enting and controlling crime committed by juveniles in 1968 congress passed additiona l legislation3 to provide direct assistance to state and local governments and to train juve nile justice personnel to receive funding states were re quired to designate single agency to take the lead in improving delinquency preven tion and control programs also in 1968 congress for the first time placed juvenile justice gran t authority within the purview of the department of justice doj despite these congressional efforts to provide assistance to the states as they attempted to rein in juvenile crime juvenile arrests for violent crimes increased by 216 between 1960 and 19744 this increase in juvenile violent crime outstripped the growth in the juvenile population the under18 population grew from 47 million in 1950 to 70 million in 1970 an increase of only 495 it seemed apparent that the technical assistance and financial aid that congress had provided the states was not enough to address the growing problem of juvenile crime and many commentators maintained that there was need for distinct federal entity to manage the fe deral governments response to juvenile delinque ncy in 1974 congress addressed the issue by passing the first comprehensive piece of juvenile justice legislation the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act jjdpa6 the jjdpa created number of grant programs and new federal agency within dojs ojjdp to oversee these grant programs and to coordina the federal government wide response to juvenile delinquency in the 1980s many states responded to th public perception that juvenile crime was increasing by passing more punitive laws for juvenile offenders some of these laws removed certain types of juvenile crimes from the juvenile court system altogether mandating that they be handled by the adult criminal system

report other laws instituted mandatory sentences fo r juvenile offenders convicted of certain crimes this movement toward punish ing juveniles and away from working to rehabilitate them accelerated in the 1990s with all but three states passing laws that modified or removed traditional juvenile court confidentiality agreements all but five states passing laws easing the transfer of juveniles into the adult criminal justice system and majority of states passing laws expanding sentencing options for juveniles7 during this period more punitive m easures were incorporated into the accepted federal funding streams for juven ile justice programs through series of revisions to the jjdpa thes revisions are described in appendices and b juvenile justice history the first juvenile courts the early criminal justice system in america did not include separate juvenile justice system the colonists brought the british criminal justice system with them to the new world this system included forced apprenticeship for poor and neglected children if juvenile committed crime they were first warned shamed or given corporeal punishment and then returned to the community if child committed major criminal act however they were treated and tried as adults trials and punishment were largely base d on the offenders age anybody over the age of seven was subject to trial in criminal court8 these early american laws had three fundamental features they established local control of the justice system gave families the responsibility nd legal liability for their childrens actions and distinguished between deserv ing and undeserving poor people9 the first juvenile court in the united states was established in chicago in 1899 by 1925 all but two states had establis hed separate juven ile justice systems10 the juvenile court of chicago was based on the british doctrine of parens patriae or the notion of the state acting in the natu re of parent this doctrine was used to explain the states interest in distinguishing between adults and children in its dispensation of justice because childre n are not fully imbued with developmental or legal capacity the parens patriae doctrine held that the government could provide protection and treatment for children whose parents were not providing adequate carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs4 11 ojjdp 1999 national report p

chicago became the model for the various state juvenile justice systems that followed it its key features were the definition of juvenile as child under the age of 16 the separation of children and adults in correctional institutions the establishment of special informal procedural rules including the elimination of indictments pleadings and jury trials the provision of probation officers to monitor juveniles released into the community and the prohibition of the detention of children below the age of 12 in jail or police station12 although delinquency am ong children was punished key element of the juvenile justice system as it was conceived originally was the welfare of the child and the concept that delinquent children could be turned into productive citizens through treatment this benevolent mission was clearly stated in most laws that set up juvenile justice systems and led to substa ntial procedural and substantive differences between juvenile and adult criminal systems in the states for example in the adult criminal system district attorneys selected which cases they would bring to trial whereas in the juvenile justice system the juvenile court itself often controlled which cases would be tried juvenile court intake considered extralegal factors such as the childs home situation as well as legal fact ors when deciding whether to bring case to trial and had discretion to handle cases informally13 additionally these early juvenile courts did not incorporate the procedural due process protections afforded adult criminal defendants which were deemed unnecessary as result of the courts bene volent mission attorneys for the state and the youth being tried were not considered essential to the systems operation especially in less serious cases and judges had broad range of dispositions at their disposal that were tailored to the best interests of the child judges dispositions became part of treatment plan for the juvenile and this treatment continued until the juvenile was considered cured or became an adult at age 2114 in 1914 the practice of diversion or the official halting of formal criminal proceedings against juvenile offender was established with the creation of the chicago boys court the goal of divers ion was to provide tr eatment for juveniles outside of the formal juvenile justice system to this end the juvenile court in chicago released juveniles to the superv ision and authority of various community service agencies who evaluated the youths behavior and reported back to the court if the evaluation was satisfactory to the judge the court officially discharged the juvenile without any formal record of the proceedings15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs5 16 national commission on law observance and enforcement

children who were charged with crime as adults16 this situation led the us attorney general ag to recommend that juveniles charged with violating federal laws be returned to their home states juvenile justice system proposition that congress agreed with17 early federal government efforts the earliest federal govern ment involvement in juve nile delinquency occurred in 1909 when the white house held conference on the care of dependent children the goal of this conference was to share information about needy children across the united states and to emphasi ze the immediate need for action this conference led directly to the creation of the us childrens bureau in 1912 the childrens bureau was authorized to inve stigate and report on all aspects of child welfare including the juvenile justice system18 in 1936 the childrens bureau began providing the first federal subsidy program that provided child welfare grants to states these grants were used to care for wide array of atrisk youth including juvenile delinquents the first major federal gislation addressing juve nile delinquents was enacted in 1938 the fe deral juvenile delinquency act of 1938 fjda19 left the state juvenile justice systems as the preferred alte rnative for juveniles arrested for violating federal laws but gave the ag the discretion to charge juvenile as an adult and allowed for federal juvenile proceedings if both parties agreed to it in 1951 congress amended the fjda with the federal youth corrections act20 this act afforded juvenile offenders tried as adults in the federal system special rehabilitation outcomes apart from th is revision however the fjda remained essentially unchanged for 35 years until congress passed major juvenile justice reform measures in the 1970s in 1951 congress also established the juvenile delinquency bureau within the department of healt h education and welfare hew the bureaus placement within hew can be seen as reflection of the early governmental focus on the treatment of juvenile delinquents and the prevention of delinquency rather than on punishment21 in the 1950s and 1960s however many obser vers began to question the juvenile courts ability to successfully rehabilitate linquents while the systems basic goal of rehabilitating juveniles through individually tailored plans was not in question professionals in the field grew

juveniles being tried the right to notice nd counsel the right to question witnesses and the right to protection from selfinc rimination although the court did not include the right to appellate review in its decision it enc ouraged the states to afford juveniles that protection as well24 congress responded to the increasing pub lic awareness of juvenile crime by passing the juvenile linquency and youth offens control act of 196125 this act authorized hew to provide grants totaling 10 million annually for three years to states local government entities and private nonprofit agencies to fund demonstration projects that focused on impr oving the methods used to prevent and control juvenile crime th projects funded through this initiative were focused on urban innercities that had the highest juvenile delinquency rates at the time26 in 1968 c ongress took two further actions that affected federal funding for juvenile justice the first was the j uvenile delinquency pr

was the omnibus cr ime control and sa fe streets act28 which among other things involved doj in juven ile justice for the first time through the law enforcement assistance administration leaa which

criticisms at the way hew implemented the act the hew administered program during its first three years was disappointing because of delay and inefficiency director of the youth development and

the funds that were appropriated were actually expended the funds were generally spent on underfunded unrelated and scattered projects weakness in program administration the dominance of the law

congress around the idea of cr eating new federal entity to oversee the federal governments juvenile justice efforts as the juvenile delinquency prevention and control acts authoriza tion was expiring in 1974 congress moved to replace it with more comprehensive piece of legislation the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act the juvenile justice and delinquency pr evention act jjdpa was

through fy2007 this section analyzes the jjdpa as it stands today by 1974 strong momentum had deve loped in the public academic and governmental arenas toward the idea that th juvenile justice system needed to focus on preventing juvenile delinque ncy deinstitutionalizing youth already in the system and keeping juvenile offende rs separate from adults offenders congress responded to this growing

to be eligible to receive grant funding although the jjdpa has been amended several times over the past 30 years it continues to feature the same three components as it was passed in 1974 the jjdpa focused the federal govern ments efforts largely on preventing juvenile delinquency and on re habilitating juvenile offende rs subsequent revisions to the act placed emphasis on influencing states to expand the use of sanctions and accountability measures through some existing grant programs as well as adding new grant programs to the acts purview th latest reauthorization of the jjdpa enacted by

within the federal government charge d with coordinating all fe deral juvenile delinquency programs all federal programs that deal with unaccompanied minors and all federal programs relating to missing and exploited children36 the coordinating council is composed of the heads of all the federal agencies that touch on these broad areas including the attorney general the secretary of health and human services the secretary of labor the secretary of edu cation the secretary of housing and urban development the administrator of ojjdp the director of the office of national drug control policy the chief executive officer of the corporation for national and community service and the commissioner of immigration and naturalization now the commissioner of immigration and customs enforcement in addition to these standing members the coor dinating council is composed of nine other members of which three are appointed by the president three are appointed by the speaker of the

make grants to states54 and units of local government to strengthen their juvenile justice systems and foster accountability within their juvenile populations the program focuses resources on holding juveniles accountable for their actions and building up the juvenile justice system in the states it also essentially signifies the highwater mark of the federal governments movement away from an emphasis on rehabilitating juveniles and toward the idea that juveniles need to be punished for their crimes indeed the only core mandate of the jabg program is that states must begin to implement system of graduated sanctions55 in order to be eligible for funding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs17 55 continued each delinquent offense and escalate in intensity with each subsequent more serious offense there should be sufficient flexib ility to allow for individualized sanctions and services for juvenile offenders additionally appropriate consideration should be given to public safety and

forcible rape robbery and aggravated assaultas previously mentioned the implementa tion of graduated sa nctions is the only core mandate associated with the jabg pr ogram these graduated sanctions should at minimum ensure that sanctions are imposed on juven ile offenders for each delinquent offense they commit sanctions escalate in intensity with each subsequent more seriousoffense there is enough flexibility to tailor sanctions and services to eachindividual juvenile offender and appropriate consid eration is given when handi ng out sanctions to the victims of the crime and pub lic safety in general states are allowed to participate in the program if their graduated sanctions are discretionary rather than mandatory but must require each juvenile court in its jurisdiction to submit an annual report cerning the extent to which graduated sanctions were implemented and the reasons for which gr aduated sancti ons were not applied this information should be coll ected by units of local government and reported to the states which in turn report it to the ag eligible states and units of local government are also required to blish and convene an advisory board that is charged

century of change p 5 issues for congress the major issue that is likely to confront the 110th congress will be the reauthorization of the jjdpa which is currently authorized through fy2007 as congress debates the jjdpas reauthoriz ation however congress will likely face the same issues that have revolved around the juvenile jus tice system for the past 30 years what is the appropriate federal role in an arena that has predominantly been the province of the states what is the appropriate federal response to juvenile violence and juvenile crime should federal efforts to influen ce the states juvenile justice systems focus on the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders on holding juvenile offenders accountable for their actions or some combination of both are the grant programs as currently comprised the best way tosupport juvenile justice efforts in the states the following section provides more detailed examination of these potential issues rehabilitation versus accountability as previously noted the fundamental tens ion within the juvenile justice system over the past 30 years has been the relationship between rehabilitating juveniles and holding them accountable for their actions to some extent this is an arbitrary distinction in that the system as currently comprised includes both rehabilitative and accountability based programs nevertheless viewed ove r the sweep of time there is little doubt that the juvenile system has trended away from having the rehabilitation of juven iles as its main goal instead over the past few decades the system has increasingly incorporated m easures that emphasize holding juvenile accountable for their actions for exam ple during the 1990s 47 states and the district of columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile justice systems more punitive61 as result juvenile justice can be conceptualized as continuum that stretches philosophically from the rehabilitative idea that juveniles are wayward youth who can be taught to mend their ways and become contributing members of society to the accountability end of the spectrum which holds that juveniles must be taught to take responsibility for their ac tions through the meting out of punishment often referred to as graduated sanctions the federal juvenile justice system can thus be viewed as pendulum that swings between these two poles over the past 20 years it has clearly been swinging away from rehabilitation and to ward accountability through the addition of graduated sanctions to the state formula gr ant programs purpose areas and the requirement that states implement gradua ted sanctions in order to be eligible for jabg funding the 110th congress may consider whether the fe deral government through its

tion of both of these philosophies expanding or modifying the core mandates the federal government has attempted to influence the states juvenile justice systems through the core mandates that states must comply with in order to be eligible for funding in essence the fede ral government has used grant funding as carrot to effectuate changes in the way that states house and treat their juvenile offenders the last modification of co re mandate occurred with the jjdpas last reauthorization when the disproportiona minority confinem ent language was modified to preclude ojjdp from us ing numerical benchmarks in its implementation possible issue for cong ress to consider may include whether to modify or expand the existing core mandates proponents of expanding the core mandates could point to the fact that the mandates have been effective in inducing states to prom ulgate detention standards that focus on minimizing the contact between juvenile offenders and adults and in deinstitutionalizing status offenses62 opponents of expanding the mandates however could point to the relative ineff ectiveness of the di sproportionate minority confinement mandate most states continue to detain minorities at higher rate than their percentage of the states juvenile population and the langua ge has been watered down over the years to ensure that ojjdp does not require states to meet quotas in order to adhere to the mandate63 should congress choose to expand the core mandates policy opti ons could include requiring states to ensure that their delinquency prevention programs are based on solid scientific evidence such as randomized control trials64 requiring states to show that they are reducing the recidivism rates of their juvenile offenders65 expanding the number and quality of programs available for femalejuveniles 66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs29 67 facjj report 68 facjj reportrequiring states to implement mental health and substance abuse screening for juveniles67 or developing and implementing gangviolence reduction initiatives68 juvenile delinquency prevention block grant over the past five years there has appeared to have been some tension between the authorizing legislation and the structur of the appropriations for some juvenile justice grant programs as previously noted the last major reauthorization of the jjdpa eliminated number of small grant programs and consolidated most of their purpose areas into the juvenile delinquency prevention block grant however the annual appropriation for ojjdp continues to adhere to th previous structure and funds have been appropriated in each subse quent fiscal year for some of the grant programs that were repealed in 2002 the current disconnect between the authorization and the appropr iation could present significant challenge for ojjdp given the disparity ojjdp employees must spend some percentage of their time reconciling the differences between the authorization and the appropriation this may not represent the best investment of ojjdp staff time additionally because the eligibility re quirements and funding mechanisms of the old grant programs and the new block gr ant program are different this dichotomy between the authorization and the appropriation likely represents challenge to the states and units of local government as th ey apply for funding potential issue for congress as it reauthorizes the jjdpa could include whether the juvenile delinquency prevention block grant should be implemented as it was authorized whether it should be modified or whet her it should be broken up again into its component grant programs to better refl ect what has been occurring with the appropriation overlap in grant programs the current grant programs within the jjd pa overlap in variety of ways the state formula grant and the delinquency prevention block grant programs for example both feature wide array of purpose areas elucidated in legislative language that are largely similar for example both grant programs include purpose areas for counseling mentoring and training programs community based programs and services after school programs education programs programs that expand the use of probation officers substance and drug abuse prevention programs mental health services ganginvolvement prevention programs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs30 69

among the different agencies involved additionally the delinquency prevention block grant the challenge grants and the title v incentive grants for cal delinquency prevention programs all include language allowing ojjdp to pr ovide funding for additional programs not included in the specific purpose areas identified potential issue for congress could include whether the curre nt overlap within the juvenile justice grant programs is appropriate possible po licy options could include altering the current grant programs to target funding for speci fic activities in each grant program or consolidating the different grant programs into one large program in its fy2008 budget request for example the administra tion is proposing conso lidating all of the juvenile justice grant programs into one large discretionary block grant the creation of new grant programs coul d be an alternative to modifying or consolidating the existing grant programs creating grant programs that are tailored to specific activities eg gangprevention re storative justice mentoring etc could provide dedicated funding streams to activitie s that may get short shrift if they must compete for funding in broader grant pr ogram however th ere are limite d federal resources in the juvenile justice arena and adding grant programs without also increasing funding may take resources away from the current programs possible issue for the 110th congress could include whether the existing grant programs are adequate whether the existing grant progra ms should be modified or whether new grant programs should be

involved in dealing with and providing treatment for juveniles better coordinate their efforts some overlap exists within the federa l government concerning programs that offer services for juveniles for example growing body of evidence points to the relationship between child abuse or ot her forms of mistreatment and juvenile delinquency or other linquent behavior such as youth violence69 this has led to duplication of efforts within many federal agencies and what may sometimes be considerable overlap in the funding oppor tunities available to states and

these diverse departments youth violence prevention funding opportunities are available for virtually every aspect of the issue the violent youth themselves their victims their families the communities they live in the juvenile justice system that prosecutes them and the societal factors that contribute to the violence71 in effect there are multitude of federal programs throughout the government that deal with youth violences causes its effects and its ramif ications the amount of coordination that is occurring between the departments on these issues remains an open question given the nexus between youth violence nd juvenile justice the coordination of these federal government programs should lie within the province of ojjdp and the coordinating council the coordinatin g council for its part meets quarterly for three to four hours on average to disc uss the ongoing juvenile justice related efforts within the agencies72 given the extent of the overlap that exists within the federal government some could question whether more coordination should be required across departments potential issue for congress could involve how effective ojjdp and the coor dinating

provisions are currently authorized thr ough fy2007 this appendix will analyze the original jjdpa the original jjdpa had three main com ponents it created set of institutions within the federal government that were dedicated to coordinating and administering federal juvenile justice efforts it established grant programs to assist the states with setting up and running their juvenile ju stice systems and it promulgated core mandates that states had to dhere to in order to be elig ible to receive grant funding as it was passed in 1974 the jjdpa fo cused largely on preventing juvenile delinquency and on re habilitating juven ile offenders federal government entities established the jjdpa established range of federal government entities charged with overseeing the federal governme nts juvenile justice effort s that continue to exist today in addition to establishing the first federal agency dedicated to the promulgation of juvenile justice the act established series of institutions aimed at increasing the federal governments coor dination of juvenile delinquency programs and of programs that ffect juveniles generally the office of juvenile just ice and delinquency prevention ojjdp title ii part of the original jjdpa established ojjdp within dojs law enforcement assistance administrati on leaa as the new clearing house for federal juvenile justice efforts the act established the office of the assistant administrator of ojjdp who is charged with overseeing the office and coordinating the federal governmentwide juvenile justice efforts under the direction of the administrator of the leaa the act endow ed the administrator with series of powers including the authority to require other federal entities with juvenile delinquency programs to sub mit information and reports to ojjdp and charged the new entity with administering the programs that were created by the act the act also directed the administrator to implement the overall policy and develop the objectives and priorities for all federal juvenile linquency activities as well as all activities relating to prevention diversion traini ng treatment reha bilitation evaluation research and improvement of the juvenile justice system of the united states75 the leaa administrator acting through the jjdp assistant administrator was thus given broad mandate to oversee and coordinate not

annual report of its activities and of the federal governments overall juven ile delinquency programs coordinating council on juven ile justice and delinquency prevention coordinating council the act established an independent organization known as the coordinating c ouncil on juvenile jus tice and delinquency prevention to coordinate the federal gove rnments juvenile delinquency programs the coordinating council was to be comprise d of representatives from broad range of federal agencies who exercise significan t decision making authority in the federal agency involved76 including the attorney general secretary of health education and welfare the secretary of labor director of the special action office for drug abuse prevention secretary of housing and urban development or their respective designees additionally the coordinatin g council was to include the assistant administrator of ojjdp and the deputy ssistant administrator of the national institute for juvenile justice and deli nquency prevention the coordinating council was to meet minimum of six times per year and was to report its activities as part of ojjdps annual report advisory committee on juvenile justice and delinquency prevention advisory committee the act established an advisory committee composed of 21 individuals who were to be appointed by the president to serve in an advisory capacity these individuals were to be experts in the fields of juvenile delinquency prevention or trea tment juvenile justice ad ministration or community based programs and private voluntary organizations the majority of the advisory committee was to be drawn from the private sector and at least onethird of the members were to be younger than 26 at th time of their appointment the members were to serve without compensation and to meet less than four times year the advisory committee was charged with making recommendations to the administrator of ojjdp concerning the pla nning policies priorities operations and management of all j uvenile delinquency pr ograms within the federal government the national institute for juve nile justice and delinquency prevention national institute the act

programs for juvenile justice in addition to creating entities charged with overseeing and developing the juvenile delinquency preventi on programs within the fe deral government the jjdpa created two main grant programs that were aimed at helping states build up and manage their juvenile justice syst ems and prevent juvenile delinquency additionally the jjdpa created grant pr ogram aimed at helping states handle runaway youth formula grant program the first federal grant program established by the jjdpa was formula grant program for states and local governments this formula grant program was broadly aimed at helping states improve their juvenile justice systems by providing funding that coul d be used to assist in the planning establishing operating coordinating and evaluating of juvenile delinquency programs funding under this grant program was to be allocated to states based on their relative populations of people under th age of 18 and state was to receive less than 20000077 to receive funding under this grant program the states were required to submit plans for how they were going to disburse the funding the state plans were to describe series of steps that states were to take in order to be eligible for funding including the creation of juven ile justice entities within the state systems states were required to pass along twoth irds of the funding to local government programs unless granted waiver by the administrator and 75 of the funds expended by the states were to be use d for advanced techniques in developing maintaining and expanding programs and services designed to prevent juvenile delinquency to divert juveniles from the juvenile justice system and to provide community based alternatives to juvenile detention and correctional facilities78 in addition to these restrictions on how the money was to be spent the jjdpa established two core ma ndates that states had to adhere to in order to receive funding the first of these mandates required stat to ensure that juveniles who had committed offenses that would not be crimes if they were committed by an adult known as status offenses not be placed in juvenile detention or correctional facilities this has become known as the deinstitutionalization of status offenders the second mandate required states to ensu re that juveniles we re not detained or confined in any institution in which they would have regular contact with adults in the criminal justice system prevention and treatment programs grant the act authorized the administrator to make grants to and enter into contracts with public and private agencies organizations institutions and individuals that focused on delinquency prevention and treatment the act authorized the administrator to enter into these grants and contracts to among other thin gs develop and imple ment new approaches and methods for juvenile delinquency programs develop and maintain community based alternatives to

nonprofit organizations and were to st one year the overarching goal of the program was to foster innovation in youth developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs36 80 this meant in essence that ojjdp could use 75 of the overall appropriation for its own administrative costs in ensuring that the gr ants that were awarded were effectively concentrating federal funding on the issues th at were considered to be most importantappendix b subsequent revisions to the jjdpa between 1974 and 2001 there were number of laws enacted that modified the jjdpa in some manner this appendix will outline the main changes that were made to the jjdpa over the past three decades the juvenile justice ame ndments of 1980 pl 96509 in 1980 congress made three major change s to the jjdpa and reauthorized the act through fy1984 one of the major changes enacted by pl 96509 was the streamlining of the juvenile justice appa ratus within doj whereas the jjdpa placed ojjdp underneath the law enforcement ssistance administration leaa and gave the leaa administrator authorit over the agency under the new acts provisions the administrator of ojjdp reporte d directly to the ag in essence this gave ojjdp measure of independence and removed the filter between the administrator of ojjdp and the ag despite this however ojjdp remained administratively within leaa another major change made to the jjpda was the creation of new core mandate that states were to adhere to in order to receive funding under the formula grant program th removal of juven iles from adult jails and lockups pl 96509 also began the pr ocess of shifting the jjdpas focus away from rehabilitation and towards sanctions including language that called for ojjdp to focus additional attention on the problem of juveniles committing serious crimes by paying special attention to sentencing and adding resources to the juvenile court system the act also made series of minor modifications to the coordinating council the advisory committee and the national institute aimed at increasing the coordination of federa l juvenile justice efforts and at including the perspective of juveniles into the process among the changes made to the jjpda the act allowed 75 of ojjdps overall appropriation to be used for the concentration of federal juvenile delinquency efforts80 and it added the director of the bureau of prisons the commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs the commissioner for the administration for children youth and families and the director of the youth development bureau to the coordinating council the act directed the advisory committee to include at least five individuals younger than 24 years of age at least two of whom should have been or conti nue to be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile justice system and to contact nd seek regular input from juveniles currently under the jurisdiction of the juvenile justice system the main alteration made by the act was the new requirement that states stop detaining or confining juveniles in any jail or lockup for adults in order to be eligible for the state formula grant the act did however allow for the temporary detention of juveniles accused of seri ous crimes in such facilities where existing acceptable alternative placement was possible subject to the promulgation of regulations by the administrator failure to achieve compliance with this mandate within five yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs37 would terminate states ability to r eceive funding unless the administrator determined that the state was in substantial compliance with the requirements substantial compliance was defined as st ates achieving the removal of not less than 75 of juveniles fro m adult jails and lockups and making an unequivocal commitment to achieving full compliance within two additional years the act also expanded the scope of the prevention and treatment programs grant to include programs that were aimed at removing juveniles from adult jails and lockups and provided that at least 5 of the funding available under this grant program be allocated to the virgin islands guam american samoa the trust territory of the pacific islands and th commonwealth of the northern mariana islands the juvenile justice runaway youth and missing childrens act amendments of 1984 act pl 98473 pl 98473 reauthorized the jjdpa through fy1988 and formally elevated ojjdp to standalone office within doj under the general authority of the ag another major change made to the jjdpa by this act was the expansion of the prevention and treatment prog rams grant program the act dedicated 15 to 25 of the overall funding for state formula gr ants to this program and expanded the number of purpose areas that this discretiona ry grant could be used for including but not limited to community based alternatives to detention diversion mechanisms including restitution and reconciliation projects dvocacy activities aimed at improving services programs that strengthen families prevention and treatment programs developing national educa tion program aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency developing pr ograms aimed at fostering youth employment and developing programs aimed at keeping yout hs in school at least 30 of the funding available under this program was to be apportioned to pr ivate nonprofit agencies and institutions the amendments to the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1988 pl 100690 in 1988 congress reauthorized the jjdpa through fy1992 among other things the act required ojjdp to publish comprehensive plan of the activities it would undertake each year in the federal regi ster it also required ojjdp to prepare an annual report each fiscal year providing detailed summary and analysis of the national trends in juvenile justice includi ng the numbers and types of offenses with which juveniles were being charged the rate at which juveniles were being taken into custody the extent to which states were complying with their state plan requirements and ojjdp and the coordi nating counc ils activities the act also required states as part of th eir plans to include information on their efforts to end the disproportionate confinem ent of minority youth in their detention systems and it raised the minimum funding allocations av ailable for states unde r the formula grant program the act also directed ojjdp to include technical assistance as purpose area for each of its grant programs and fo r the national institute the act modified the prevention and treatment programs gran t program by deleting language inserted by pl 98473 that required 15 to 25 of the formula grant funding be allocatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33947crs38 to this program and by expanding the num ber and types of cons iderations required to approve applications for funding gang prevention grant pl 100690 also established new grant program under part d of title ii of the jjdpa imed at funding prev ention and treatment programs for juvenile gang members the new discretionary grant program authorized the administrator to make grants to public and private agencies and organizations the new grant program identified 10 broad purpose areas aimed at reducing the numbers of juveniles join ing gangs and providing treatment for juveniles convicted of ga ngrelated criminal activities the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention amendments act of 1992 pl 102586 pl 102586 reauthorized the jjdpa through fy1996 the main change enacted by this act was the elevation of disproportionate nority confinement to core mandate status states that were not in compliance with this requirement within three years of the acts passage would long er be eligible for formula grant funding however states that had shown substan tial compliance with the requirement would be eligible for funding for two additional years the act created number of new grant programs within title ii of the jjdpa including grants for communitybased gang intervention for state challenge activitie s for juvenile victims of child abuse and for mentoring the act also added new title v to the jjdpa establishing new program the incentive grants for local delinquency prevention program the act also modified the composition of the coordinating council in addition to the leaders or their designated repres entatives of the
