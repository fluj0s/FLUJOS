that provision of the family medical leave act which mandates the provision of sick leave for employees with serious health conditions could not be enforced by employees against states agencies or instrumentalities in united states v rybar judge alito authored dissent to decision that upheld law providing that it shall be unlawful for any pe rson to transfer or possess machine gun as within the authority of the congress under the commerce clause judge alito noting that the statute lacked both requirement for specific connection to interstate commerce and findings that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns had substantial effect on interstate commerce would have struck the law down in general it appears that judge alitos opinion in the chittister case was consistent with supreme court precedent at the time although judge alito has been criticized because his opinion did not anticip ate the result in the subsequent case of nevada department of human resources v hibbs the hibbs case actually addressed separate provision of the fmla the chittister case is arguably distinguishable from the hibbs case conclusion which has been reached by other federal circuits judge alitos dissent in the rybar case however seems to have anticipated more expansive application of the supreme court decisions in lopez and morrison than was being utilized by most other circuits at the time further his reasoning in rybar may have been repudiated by the supreme court in gonzales v raich consequently it would appear that judge alitos dissent was an argument for more limited

outside of the authority of the congress under the commerce clause judge alito noting that the statute lacked both requirement for specific connection to interstate commerce and findings that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns had substantia l effect on interstate commerce would have struck the law downhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs2 5 2 dall 419 1793 6 immediately after the adoption of the constitution number of citizens filed cases in federal court against states one of these chisholm was diversity suit filed by two citizens of south carolina against the state of georgia to recover revolutionary war debt in chisholm the supreme court noted that article iii of the cons titution specifically grants the federal courts diversity jurisdiction over suits between state and citizens of another state us const art iii 2 thus the court held that this grant of jurisdiction authorized the private citizen of one state to sue another state in federal court without that states consent 7 the states were upset such suit could be brought in federal court protesting that the drafters of the constitution had promised the stat they would not be sued by their creditors in federal courts alden v maine 527 us 706 720 1999 8 after the eleventh amendment was passed number of cases were filed against states by their own citizens with jurisdiction based on federal question jurisdiction rather than diversity under this reasoning if citizen of state sued his or her own state in federal court the prohibition of the eleventh amendm ent would not apply consequently for number of years after the passage of the eleventh amendment this type of case was entertained by the federal courts however this line of cases was ended by the case of hans v louisiana 134 us 1 1890 9 ultimately the issue before the court in ns v louisiana and in subsequent cases was continuedsovereign immunity and the 14th amendment background when an individual attempts to sue state under federal law an argument can be raised by the state that it is immune to such suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity the starting point for such discussion is usually the eleventh amendment which provides that the judi cial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state the actual text of the amendment appears to be limited to preventing citizens from bringing diversity cases against states in federal courts howe ver the supreme court has expanded the concept of state sovereign immunity to reach much further than the text of the amendment the eleventh amendment was passe d as response to the case of chisholm v georgia 5 which allowed private citizen of one state to sue another state in federal court without that states consent6 almost immediately after the decision in chisholm resolutions were introduced in congress to overturn it the end result being the eleventh amendment7 the amendment assured that citizen of one state could not sue another state in fede ral court in other words citizen could not sue under federal diversity jurisdiction without states permission in hans v louisiana the court provided for an even more expansive interpretation of the eleventh amendment8 which banned suits by citizens against states regardless of whether or not the citizen was resident of another state9 laterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs3 9 continued not the eleventh amendment but the issue of state sovereign immunity state sovereign immunity means that state must consent to be sued in its own court system this concept is based on early english law which provided that the crown could not be sued in english courts without its consent the doctrine of so vereign immunity was in effect in the states which were in existence at the time of the drafting of the constitution further various writings by the founding fathers seemed to support the concept see alden v maine 527 us 706 71617 1999 thus the issue before the court in hans was whether the grant of jurisdiction to federal courts under article iii of the cons titution had abrogated state sovereign immunity the hans court found that article iii did not have this effect 10 see eg seminole tribe of florid v florida 517 us 44 1996 in seminole tribe the court evaluated the indian gaming re gulatory act of 1988 which provided indian tribes with an opportunity to establish gambling operations the court determined that the law was passed as an exercise of the article i power over indian commerce us const art i cl 3 noting that the eleventh am endment was ratified after the passage of the constitution and article i the court held that the eleventh amendment limited congresss authority to waive states sovereign immunity under that article 11 fitzpatrick v bitzer 427 us 445 45253 1976 12 one apparent argument is that the four teenth amendment was passed after the eleventh amendment and thus unlike article i it can be seen as an alteration of the restrictions of the eleventh amendment seminole tribe of florida v florida 517 us 44 6566 1996 however as noted above state sovereign i mmunity preceded and predated the constitution consequently all the articles of the constitution could arguably be seen as altering the restrictions of state sovereign immunity another argument made by the court in seminole is that the fourteenth amendment was designed to alter the preexisting balanc between state and federal power at the time of its passage this argument is more plausibl but is still difficult to differentiate between congresss power under the fourteenth am endment and congresss power under the articles of the constitution like the fourteenth amendment the articles of the constitution were clearly intended to alter the balance between state and federal power at the time of the passage of the constitution including state sovereign immunity this is exemplified by the supremacy clause us cons t art vi cl 2 which provides that laws passed under the constitution would be supreme over state law 13 521 us 507 1997cases established that congress could not generally abrogate this immunity under its article i legislative powers10 the supreme court has he ld however that congress can abrogate state sovereignty under the 5 of the fourteenth amendment which authorized congress to pass laws to enfo rce the protections of that amendment11 while the logic behind this distinction is unclear12 it means that in many cases litigants suing states will have to find fourteenth amendment basis for federal legislation in order to defeat an eleventh amendment defense recent supreme court cases however make it more difficult for court to find that the fourteenth amendment is the cons titutional basis for legislation in the case of flores v city of boerne13 the court struck down the religious freedom restoration act rfra as beyond the authority of congress under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the case arose when the city of boerne denied church building permit to expand because the church was in designated historical districthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs4 14 for many years prior to the passage of rf ra in order for law of general applicability restricting the free exercise of religion to be consistent with the freedom of exercise clause of the first amendment it had to be justif ied by compelling governmental interest however in the 1990 case of oregon v smit h the court lowered this standard the smith case involved members of the native american church who were denied unemployment benefits when they lost their jobs for having used peyote during religious ceremony the smith case held that neutral generally applicab law may be applied to religious practices even if the law is not supported by compelling governmental interest rfra was an attempt by the congress to overturn the smith case and to require compelling governmental interest when state applie d generally applicable law to religion 15 528 us 62 2000 16 531 us 356 2001 17 cleburne v clebur ne living center in c 473 us 432 1985the church challenged the zoning d ecision under rfra the supreme court reiterated that 5 of the fourteenth am endment gave the congress the power to enforce existing constitutional protections but found that this did not automatically include the power to pass any legislation to protect these rights instead the court held that there must be congruence nd proportionality between the injury to be remedied and the law adopted to that end14 based on the city of boerne test the court has struck down variety of laws which were designed to deal with the i ssue of discrimination for instance in kimel v florida board of regents 15 the court evaluated whether the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 was valid ex ercise of congresss commerce power and 5 power and thus could be applied against the states the kimel court held however that age is not suspect class and that the provisions of the adea far surpassed the kind of protections that w ould be afforded such class under the fourteenth amendment further the court found based on city of boerne that an analysis of the congresss ability to legislate prophyl actically under section 5 required an examination of the legislative record to determine whether the remedies provided were proportional and congruen t to the problem review by the court of the adea legislative record found evidence of pattern of state governments unconstitutionally discriminating against employees on the basis of age consequently the court held that stat could not be liable for damages under the adea the application of the americans with disabilities act ada to states was also considered in the case of the board of trustees v garrett 16 with similar result in garrett the court evaluated whether two plai ntiffs could bring claims for money damages against state university fo r failing to make reasonable accommodations for their disabilities one plaintiff was under treatment for cancer the other for asthma and sleep apnea although disa bility is not suspect class and thus discrimination is evaluate d under rational basis test the court had previously shown heightened sensitivity to arbitrary discrimination against the disabled17 further congress had made substantial findings regarding the pervasiveness of such discriminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs5 18 538 us 721 2003 19 29 usc 2612a1c 20 226 f3d 223 3d cir 2000 21 29 usc 260154 22 29 usc 2612a1dhowever the supreme court declined to consider evidence of discrimination by either the private sector or local gove rnment and dismissed th examples that did relate to the states as unlikely to rise to the level of constitutionally irrational discrimination ultimate ly the court found that pa ttern of unconstitutional state discrimination against the disabled had been established and that the application of the ada was not proportionate response to any pattern of disc rimination that might exist as noted kimel and garrett involved the evaluation of congressional statutes addressing discrimination agai nst nonsuspect classes when the class which is the focus of legislation has hi gher level of cons titutional protection however the court has seemed to use more lenient standard in the case of nevada department of human resources v hibbs 18 an employee of the neva da department of human resources had dispute with the department regarding how much leave time he had available under the fmla the fmla require s among other things that employers provide employees up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave to care for close relative with serious health condition19 in hibbs the court held that congress had the power to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity under the fm so that state employee could recover money damages th court found that congress d established significant evidence of long and extensive history of sex discrimination with respect to the administration of leave benefits by the states and that history was sufficient to justify the enactment of the legislation under 5 the standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of genderbased classification is more difficult to meet than the rationalbasis test wh ich was at issue in kimel and garrett so it was easier for congress to show pattern of state constitutional violations chittister v dept of community and economic development judge alito wrote the opinion for unanimous court in the case of chittister v department of community and economic development 20 which also considered if congress had validly abrogated states eleventh amendment immunity when it enacted the family and medical leave act of 199321 however unlike the later decided hibbs case which considered the provision of leave to care for family members chittister concerned the provision of personal sick leave because of serious health condition that makes the em ployee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee22 in relatively brief opinion judge alito found that congress had not abrogated the states sove reign immunity for causes of action cited by the plaintiffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs6 23 see eg bruce ackerman et report of the alito project at the yale law school the alito opinions 67 dec 19 2005 this report noted that the supreme court had upheld provisions of the fmla and quoted the supreme court to the effect that the states record of unconstitutional participation in and foster ing of genderbased discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic 5 legislation 24 hibbs

8th cir 2000 while the fifth circuit held that neither personal sick leave or family care si ck leave provisions constitutionally abrogated state sovereign immunity kazmier v widmann 225 f3d 519 52627 529 5th cir 2000 continuedalthough the chittister case preceded the courts opinion in hibbs some have suggested that the opinion should have anticipated the result in that case23 as noted however the opinion in chittister dealt with different provision of the family medical leave act the court in hibbs did not decide the constitutionality of the personal sick leave provision considered in chittister and there are arguments to be made that distinguish these cases the courts decision in hibbs was based to large ex tent on the congressional finding that denial or curtailment of womens employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first and workers second this prevailing ideology bout womens roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or motherstobe24 further because employers assumed that women were primary caretakers they would deny men leave for such purposes thus both of these stereotypes tended to discourage the hiring of women25 and the requirement that employers provide family care leave would alleviate this disparity this reasoning however does not seem pplicable to the case of personal sick leave in chittister the judge alito noted that congresss findings that the the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women would be relevant for evaluation of the family care leave pr ovisions judge alito found however that there did not appear to be similar findings concerning the existence of intentional discrimination by employers against women in the provision of personal sick leave practices26 nor did the court think that such practices would be likely to have disparate impact on men and women even if such evidence existed judge alito questioned whether the fmla would be congruent and proportional response since it did not require nondiscriminatory sick leave practices but merely created minimum level of leave entitlement chittister seems to be consistent with the d ecisions of other fe deral courts which considered this issue before hibbs was decided27 for instance in the case ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs7 27 continued the first

states may discriminate on the basis of disab ility as long as the classification in question is rationally related to legitimate state interest cleburne v cleburne living center inc 473 us 432 1985kazmier v widmann 28 the fifth circuit considered whether the personal leave provision of the fmla could be applied agai nst the states the court first noted that congresss express intent in enacting this provision was to prevent employers from discriminating on the basis of temporary disability29 not gender the court did note suggestions in the legislative record that congress also meant for this provision to prevent discrimination against women on the basis of pregnancyrelated disability30 the fifth circuit however rejected an argument that the personal sick leaveprovision was intended to target sex discrimination first the court noted that the fmla contained separate provision regarding maternity leave which was arguably mo re closely related to concerns about pregnancy discrimination 31 second the court noted that the supreme court has held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy does not violate the equal protection clause32 which would make it difficult to s how that the provision was intended to remedy pattern and histor of unconstitutional gender di scrimination finally the court found that the effect of expressly mandating leave for pregnancy among other serious health conditions would not make employers more likely to hire women but would actually make women less attractive employees ultimately the fifth circuit decided that the provision at issue was in fact directed solely at discr imination based on temporary di sability like discrimination on the basis of sex however discrimination on the basis of disability is subject to minimal scrutiny under the equal protection clause33 as such the most relevant case decided at the time would appear to be the kimel case which evaluated an attempt by congress to remedy discrimination based on age which is another category with fewer constitutional protections relying on kimel the kazmier court found that the fmla prohibits substantia lly more state employment decisions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs8 34 kazmier 225 f3d at 524 quoting kimel 528 us at 85 the court noted that the legislative record for the fmla did not app ear to reveal pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the tempor arily disabled further the court questioned how mandated periods of leave would addre ss unconstitutional discrimination as it would not be unconstitutional for state to offer healthrelated leave at all id at 528 35 422 f3d 392 6th cir 2005 36 see also brockman v wyoming depart ment of family services 342 f3d 1159 10th cir 2003

had not been decided at the time of the kazmier and chittister cases practices than would likely be held unconstitutional under the applicable equal protection rational basis standard34 even after the decision of the supreme court in hibbs federal courts seemed to follow reasoning similar to chittister and kazmier the sixth circuit in touvell v ohio department of mental retardation developmental disability 35 relied on the hibbs case to reach essentially the same conclusion36 in fact the sixth circuit specifically suggested that hibbs did not undermine the reasoning of the various cases from other circuits that had reached this conclusion previously in touvell the sixth circuit made many of the same points as were made in kazmier and chittister regarding the legislative record for the fmla as in kazmier the gender discrimination of concern to the congress related to the care of family members and not to personal sick leave37 the court in touvell found evidence of gender discrimination with regard to personal medical leave38 nor were the requirements for providing such ave seen as having any remedial or prophylactic effect on such discr iminati on as with the previous cases the court found little evidence that gender discrimina tion was even at issue in the fmla personal sick leave provisions like kazmier the sixth circuit found that the sick leave provision was more likely intended to affect di sability discrimina tion and as such it would be more difficult to establish pattern and history of constitutional violation39 f t r considering the legislative record regarding disability discrimination and the nature of the legislation the touvell court concluded that the fmla personal sick leave provisions were not congruen t and proportional responses to any alleged violations as did chittister and kazmier the sixth circuit concluded that the personal sick leave provisions could not be applie d against the state under the eleventh

continuedthe commerce clause background the commerce clause provides that t he congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes40 generally speaking congress s power under the commerce clause can be divided into three categories 1 regulation of channels of commerce 2 regulation of instrumentalities of commerce and 3 regulation of ec onomic activities which affect commerce41 in the 1995 case united states v lopez 42 the supreme court brought into question the extent to which the congress can rely on the commerce clause as basis for federal jurisdiction unde r the gunfree school zones act of 1990 congress made it federal offense for an individual knowingly to possess firearm at place that the individual knows or s reasonable cause to believe is school zone43 in lopez the court held that because the act neither regulated commercial activity nor contained requirement that the possession be connected to interstate commerce the act exceeded the authority of congress under the commerce clause although the court did not explicitly overrule any previous rulings upholding federal statutes passed under the authority of th commerce clause the decision appeared to suggest new limits to congresss legislative authority subsequently the lower federal courts were left to determine the precise scope of the limits imposed by the court in lopez as applied to other federal statutes united states v rybar one statute that has received significant amount of post lopez attention is 18 usc 922o which states that it sha ll be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess machine gun unless one of two exceptions applied44 by 1996 when the third circuit decided united states v rybar several other circuits had already determined that section 922o was not violation the commerce clause there was however little consensus with respect to the reasoning employed45 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs10 45

of the channels of inters tate commerce therefore bringing the statute under the first cat egory of commerce power46 moreover the seventh circuit had held section 922o constitutional as an essential part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated47 finally the majority noted that the tenth circuit had uphe ld section 922o as constitutional regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce thus utilizing the s econd category for permissible regulation of interstate commerce48 the majority opinion in rybar adds little original analysis to this discussion and did not attempt to resolve the reasoning di spute between the other circuits rather the majority traced the legislative history of federal firearms statutes and concluded that by the time congress enacted section 922o it had already passed three firearm statutes under its commerce power based on its explicit connecti on of the interstate flow of firearms to the increasing seri ous violent crime in this country which congress saw as creating probl em of national concern49 specifically with respect to section 922o the majority relied on supporting language in committee reports as well as floor statements dur ing consideration of the legislation50 with respect to the constitutional analysis th majority simply recounted the various methods employed by their sister circuits and conclu ded that section 922o was constitutional as valid exercise of c ongresss power under the commerce clause51 judge alitos

intrastate possession of machine guns has substantia l effect on inters tate commerce53 since in judge alitos opinion neither of these two requi rements was satisfied the statute as written should have been held unconstitutional given that the majority opted not to ssert unique rationale for its conclusion judge alitos dissent refuted all three tablished grounds for holding section 922o constitutional first he challenged the position of the fifth sixth and ninth circuits that the statute is regulation of the channels of interstate commerce according to judge alito those circuits reasoned that under section 922o there could be unlawful possession without an unlawful tr ansfer because th statute exempted lawful possessions prior to its enactment further the circuits argued that the restriction was necessary nd proper way to assist law enforcement in tracking and detecting illegal machine gun transfers54 in judge alitos opinion this reasoning was flawed for three reasons first it relied on faulty facts namely that every unlawful possession is the result of an unlaw ful transfer in fact as judge alito posited an unlawful possession could result from the conversion of lawful weapon or from the expiration of the requisite g overnment authority that made possession lawful55 second the rationale seems to confuse an unlawful transfer with an interstate transfer56 and finally the circuits reliance on the ability of congress to suppress an interstate market by regulating intrastate be havior is an argument in support of the substantial ffects test not the channels of interstate commerce57 next judge alitos dissent challenged the assertion by the sixth and tenth circuits that section 922o can be justifie d as regulation of activities that threaten the instrumentalities of interstate commerce judge alito argued that this would be true if say congress enacted the statute to prevent machine guns from being used to damage vehicles traveling interstate to carry out robberies of goods moving in interstate commerce or to threaten or harm interstate travelers58 congress however made such findings and the r easoning of the sixth and tenth

of appeals concluded that section 922o violated the commerce clause primarily on the grounds that it lacked jurisdictional element limiting its application to only interstate cases as required by the supreme courts decisions in lopez and united states v morrison 529 us 598 2000 see united states v stewart 348 f3d 11321133 9th cir 2003 was described by judge alito as elusive and in his opinion better suited to arguing for constitutionality under the substantial effects prong of the commerce clause59 finally judge alito undertook an analysis of the statute under the substantial effects prong of the courts commerce clau jurisprudence judge alitos theory was that to bring this case within the third lopez category it is not enough to observe that violent criminals racketeers and drug traffickers occasionally use machine guns in committing their crimes and that these cr imes have interstate effects rather there must be reasonable basis for concluding that the regulated activity the purely intrastate possession of machine guns facilitates the commission of these crimes to such degree as to have substantial effect on interstate commerce60 while not dismissing this theory as irrational judge alito rejected the majoritys reasoning for lack of empirical proof of its validity in other words according to judge alito there was substantial evid ence that congress rationally concluded that which was necessary to sustain the statute under the substantial effects prong for judge alito it appeared that neither the combing of the legislative history of federal firearms law nor the majoritys reliance on the committee reports and floor statements was sufficient to establish that congress believed that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns by facilitating the commission of certain crimes has substantial effect on interstate commerce61 in sum judge alito concluded by stating that out of respect fo r the principles of federalism we should require at least some empiri cal support before we sustai n novel law that effects significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction62 gonzales v raich recent opinion by the supreme court s ubsequent to judge alitos dissent in rybar puts much of his reasoning in doubt in gonzales v raich the united states supreme court granted certiorari specifically on the question of

rational basis for believing that when viewed in the aggregat leaving homeconsumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have substantial influence on price and market conditions here too congress had rational basis for concludi ng that leaving homeconsumed marijuana continueduse of marijuana permissible as result of californias law63 justice stevens writing for the majority reversed the ninth circuits decision and held that congresss power to regulate commerce extends to purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have substantial effect on interstate commerce64 in reaching its conclusions the cour t relied heavily on its 1942 decision in wickard v filburn which held that the agricultura l adjustment ac ts federal quota system applied to bushels of wheat that were homegrown and personally consumed wickard stands for the proposition that congre ss can rationally combine the effects that individual producers have on commerc ial market to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce65 the court pointed to numerous similarities between the facts presented in raich and those in wickard initially the court noted that because the commodities being cultivated in both cases are fungible and that wellestablished interstate markets exist both markets are susceptible to fluctuations in supply and demand based on produc tion intended for homeconsum ption being introduced into the national market66 according to the court just as there was difference between the wheat mr wickard produced for personal consumption and the wheat cultivated for sale on the open market there is discernable difference between personal homegrown medicinal marijuana and marijuana grown for the express purpose of being sold in the interstate market67 thus the court concluded th at congress had rational basis for concluding that leavin g homeconsumed marijuana out side federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions68httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs14 68 continued outside federal control would similarly affe ct price and market conditions internal citations omitted 69 id at 220910 70 id at 2211 71 id at 2212 emphasis in original 72 id 73 id at 2213despite having concluded that under the rational basis test congress had acted within its constitutional authority when it enacted the controlled substances act and applied it to intrastate possession of marijuana the court nevertheless had to distinguish lopez and morrison the courts more recent commerce clause decisions the court concluded that th controlled substances act unlike the statutes in either lopez gun free school zones act or morrison violence against women act regulated activity that is qui ntessentially economic therefore neither lopez or morrison cast any doubts on the constitutionality of the statute69 the court specifically rejected the reasoning used by the ninth circuit concluding that congress acted rationally in determining that none of th characteristics making up the purported class whether viewed indivi dually or in the aggregate compelled an exemption from the csa rather the subdi vided class of activ ities defined by the court of appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme70 in supporting its conclusions the court not ed that by characterizing marijuana as schedule i narcotic congress was implicitly finding that it had medicinal value at all in addition the court returned to the fact that medicinal marijuana was fungible good thus making it indistingu ishable from the recreational versions that congress had clearly intended to regulate according to the court to carve out medicinal use as distinct class of ac tivity as the ninth circuit had done would effectively make any federal regulation including quality prescription or quantity controls of any locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for any purpose beyond the outer limits of congre sss commerce clause authority71 moreover the court held that californias state law permitting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes cannot be the basis for placing the respondents class of activity beyond the reach of the federal governme nt due to the supremacy clause which requires that in the event of conflict between state and federal law the federal law shall prevail72 finally the court responded to the responde nts argument that its activities are not an essential part of larger regulatory scheme because they are both isolated and policed by the state of california and they are completely separate and distinct from the interstate market73 the court held that not only could congress have rationally rejected this argument but so that it seemed obvious that doctors patients and caregivers will increase the supply and demand for the substance on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33214crs15 74 id 221314 stating that indeed that the ca lifornia exemptions will have significant impact on both the supply and demand sides of the market for marijuana is not just plausible as the principal dissent concedes it is readily apparent 75 id at 2215open market74 in sum the court concluded that the case for exemption can be distilled down to an argument that cally grown product used domestically is immune from federal regula tion which has already been precluded by the courts decision in wickard v filburn 75 conclusion it is difficult to conclude from judge alitos opinion in the chittister case whether or not the judge has mo re restrictive view of the 11th and 14th amendment than majority of justices on the supreme court in general it appears that judge alitos opinion in the chittister case was consistent with supreme court precedent at the time although judge alito has been criticized because his opinion did not anticipate the result in the subsequent case of nevada department of human resources v hibbs the hibbs case actually addressed separate provision of the fmla the chittister case is arguably distinguishable from the hibbs case conclusion which has been reached by other federal circuits judge alitos dissent in the rybar case however seems to have anticipated more expansive application of the lopez and morrison decisions than was adopted by most other circuits at the tim further his reasoning in rybar may have been largely repudiated in the subs equent supreme court case of gonzales v raich consequently it would appear that judge alitos dissent was an argument for more limited interpretation of the commerce clause than is consistent with current case law
