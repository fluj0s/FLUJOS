nato cied program of work nato for official use only 20 the following two sections provide highglevel ove rview of detection principles and desirable properties to achieve an interoperable assessment framework consensus on these basic principles and requirements is necessary to ensure that capabilities meet both tswg and nato operational mission needs detailed set of crite ria and metrics is needed to provide the requirements baseline especially in nato environ ment 15 detection principles detection methods can be divided into two groups b ulk detection methods and trace detection methods bulk detection methods look for the explos ive itself in the explosive device and require presence of large amounts of explosives to find it trace detection methods work from trace amounts of explosives in gas phase or in the form f explosives particles these traces are present around an object on the packing material r on the person or persons handling the object methods for both bulkg and tracegdetection with their respective advantages and disadvantages will be treated in this report howev er there is more focus on trace detection methods the existence of spot tests for identifica tion of unknown substances by color change are mentioned in the trace detection chapter but t hey are not extensively treated and direct survey of available spot tests has been made the m ethods available today and presented at the conference are generally able to detect types of explosives and markers substances with high vapor pressures that are easier to detect and which are mixed into explosives at manufacture to facilitate detection and are too sl ow to allow for screening of all passengers at an airport for example it is focused on existing and emerging technologies for trace detection including standgoff detection boundaries that xist between existing and emerging technology need to be clarified to fully assess specific techn ology applications the most commonly used techniques are however based on xgray for bulk dete ction and ims for trace detection exact information about how commercial instrument works is not always easily accessible neither is an independent and reliable evaluation of performan ce 16 desirable properties one of the methods available for trace detection an d most commonly used today is ion mobility spectrometry ims in recent report opportunit ies to improve airport passenger screening with mass spectrometry one of the findings was tha t the relatively low chemical specificity of ims means that the instrument alarm threshold must be set high to avoid excessive false alarms yet lower alarm levels are desirable to account fo r inefficient manual and portal sampling techniques and possibly cleaner perpetrators i t was also found that currently deployed ims systems are designed to detect only specific list of explosives and cannot easily be reconfigured to detect an expanded list of explosiv chemical and biological threat substances this describes the needs for improvement very well it can be concluded that it is desirable to find better detection method with lower false alarm ra higher selectivity and sensitivity and with an increased range of detectable threat substances complete list of desired specifications may not be easily realizable since different applications specify different needs however certain criteria can be specified as universally desirable however specific tswgnato criteria may need to be defined clearly to enable effective technical analy sis in general high selectivity the selectivity of the method is of great importan ce since poor selectivity is detrimental to the failuregtogdetect frequency as w ell as the falsegalarm frequency the limit of detection lodhigh sensitivity trace detection method per definition needs to be able to find very small amounts of explosives t herefore it is desirable to have very low limit of detection ie very high sensitivity the exact amount detected is of less importance but measure of much little or more may provide u seful information when attempting to determine the origin of positive response n41756k06k06kdk5584 spksik2615 counter terrorism technology task force ctt tf nato cied program of work nato for official use only 21 high detection probability low false alarm rate for detection method to be reliable it must prove to have very high probability for detecting explosives if they are present and very low risk of false alarms too many false alarms will ma ke personnel handling the instrument less apt to take alarms seriously throughput the speed by which the sample is being analyzed is of importance since it determines whether the technology can be used in re algtime or not harmless to humans when people are involved some bulk detection methods based on various types of radiation are not suitable for ins pection of human subjects other important factors are cost size and mobility the importance of these factors as well as some of the above mentioned varies with applicatio n specific tswgnato factor metrics are needed to more accurately assess specific technolog capabilities below few other factors are listed these relate to some of the factors considered for each detection method mentioned table 6 detection methods the applicability defined in this study as the pri ncipal applicability of certain method not only to detect one specific explosive but rather t he lot the cost involved in utilizing the method within the concept of costs also maintenance costs should be considered the sample type is also of importance if two dete ction methods can be considered as equally good with respect to the other criteria th method applicable to samples of all aggregation states solid liquid and vapor will s tand out as superior the sample type applicable for detection method will also be of g uidance as to the complexity of the sample workgup procedures required prior to detecti on the skill level required of the operator handling the instrument will also influence the applicability most analytical systems require qu ite large degree of knowledge on the principles of the methodology in order to work opti mally also the interpretation of the signal response of the method should preferably be straightforward the field ability is merely factor discriminatin g certain methods from field use due to size lack of robustness etc the size of the instrument could also be an import ant consideration the rapid development of microgelectrogmechanical system mem s technology may render it possible to miniaturize some techniques without sev erely compromising their performance depending on the operational scenario not all prop erties of detection system may be required at the same time each detection system must be app ropriate for the use it is intended for therefore the intended scenario must be taken into account when judging performance of particular detection method or system an informati on list lod speed selectivity applicability cost sample type skill field ability and size c an be found in the end of the description of most trace detection methods information to complete th is list is not always available sometimes the source is the manufacturer of commercial instrume nt and sometimes it is scientific paper the available information especially concerning lectivity applicability skill field ability and size has sometimes been subjectively estimated from crude knowledge about the technology needed and the information that can be extracted t his is especially true for emerging technologies where much of this information is lack ing future technical advances may change these estimations when information is available or it is not even possible to

in detail during conference panel journe ys sessions exhibited at the conference or demonstrated at the conference 21 laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs 211 technology description libs is type of atomic emission spectroscopy whic h utilizes highly energetic laser pulse as the excitation source libs can analyze any matter regardless of its physical state be it solid liquid or gas even slurries aerosols gels and m ore can be readily investigated because all elements emit light when excited to sufficiently hi gh temperatures libs can detect all elements limited only by the power of the laser as well as t he sensitivity and wavelength range of the spectrograph detector operationally libs is ver similar to arcspark emission spectroscopy typical libs system consists of neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet ndyag solidg state laser and spectrometer with wide spectral range and high sensitivity fast response rate time gated detector this is coupled to com puter which can rapidly process and interpret the acquired data as such libs is one of the most experimentally simple spectroscopic analytical techniques making it one of the cheapest to purcha and to operate n41756k06k06kdk5584 spksik2615 counter terrorism technology task force ctt tf nato cied program of work nato for official use only 28 the ndyag laser generates energy in the near infra red region of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelength of 1064 nm the pulse duration is in the region of 10 ns generating power density which can exceed 1 gwcmg2 at the focal point other lasers have been used fo r libs mainly excimer excited d imer type generating energy in the visible and ultravi olet regions the spectrometer consists of either monochromator scanning or polychromator nong scanning and photomultiplier or ccd detector res pectively the most common monochromator is the czernygturner type whilst the most common po lychromator is the echelle type even so the czernygturner type can be and is often used to di sperse the radiation onto ccd effectively making it polychromator the polychromator spectr ometer is the type most commonly used in libs as it allows simultaneous acquisition of the ntire wavelength range of interest the spectrometer collects electromagnetic radiation over the widest wavelength range possible maximizing the number of emission lines detected fo r each particular element spectrometer response is typically from 1100 nm near infrared to 170 nm deep ultraviolet the approximate response range of ccd detector all elements have emission lines within this wavelength range the energy resolution of the spectrometer ca n also affect the quality of the libs measurement since high resolution systems can sepa rate spectral emission lines in close juxtaposition reducing interference and increasing selectivity this feature is particularly important in specimens which have complex matrix containing large number of different elements accompanying the spectrometer and detecto r is delay generator which accurately gates the detectors response time allowing tempora l resolution of the spectrum libs operates by focusing the laser onto small ar ea at the surface of the specimen when the laser is discharged it ablates very small amount of material in the range of nanogram to picogram which instantaneously superheats generatin g plasma plume with temperatures of about 10000g20000 c at these temperatures the blated material dissociates breaks down into excited ionic and atomic species during this time the plasma emits continuum of radiation which does not contain any useful information about the species present but within very small timeframe the plasma expands at supersonic velociti and cools at this point the characteristic atomic emission lines of the elements can be observ ed the delay between the emission of continuum radiation and characteristic radiation is in the order of 10 µs this is why it is necessary to temporally gate the detector because such small amount of material is consumed during the libs process the technique is considered essentially nongdestructive or minimally gdestructive and with an average power density of less than one watt radiated onto the spe cimen there is almost specimen heating surrounding the ablation site due to the nature of this technique sample preparation is typically minimized to homogenization or is often unnecessary where heterogeneity is to be investigated or where specimen is known to be sufficiently homoge neous this reduces the possibility of contamination during chemical preparation steps on of the major advantages of the libs technique is its ability to depth profile specime n by repeatedly discharging the laser in the same position effectively going deeper into the specime n with each shot this can also be applied to the removal of surface contamination where the er is discharged number of times prior to the analyzing shot libs is also very rapid techn ique giving results within seconds making it particularly useful for high volume analyses or ong line industrial monitoring libs is an entirely optical technique therefore it requires only optical access to the specimen this is of major significance as fiber optics can b employed for remote analyses and being an optical technique it is nonginvasive nongcontact nd can even be used as standgoff analytical technique when coupled to appropriate telescopic ap paratus these attributes have significance for use in areas from hazardous environments to spa ce exploration additionally libs systems can easily be coupled to an optical microscope for microgsampling adding new dimension of analytical flexibility n41756k06k06kdk5584 spksik2615 counter terrorism technology task force ctt tf nato cied program of work nato for official use only 29 the use of specialized optics or mechanically pos itioned specimen stage can be used over the surface of the specimen allowing spatially resolved chemical analysis and the creation of elemental maps this is very significant as chemi cal imaging is becoming more important in all branches of science and technology recent interest in libs has focused on the miniatur ization of the components and the development of compact low power portable systems this direction has been pushed along by interest from groups such as national aeronautics nd space adminstration nasa european space agency as well as the military portabl libs systems are more sensitive faster and can detect wider range of elements particula rly the light elements than competing techniques such as portable xgray fluorescence lib s does not use ionizing radiation to excite the sample because it could be carcinogenic libs like all other analytical techniques is not w ithout limitations libs is subject to the matrix effect which can be minimized by good specimen prep aration and the use of accurate calibration standards it is also subject to variation in the l aser spark and resultant plasma which often limits reproducibility the accuracy of libs measurements is typically better than 10 and precision is often better than 5 the detection limits for libs vary from one element to the next depending on the specimen type and the experimental apparatus used even so detection limits of 1 to 30 parts per million ppm by mass are not uncommon b ut can range from 100 ppm to 1 ppm recent developments in libs have seen the introduct ion of doublegpulsed laser systems this operates by discharging the laser twice in the same position on the specimen the pulse separation is typically in the order of couple of hundred microseconds and the spectral analysis is conducted after the second pulse this process i ncreases the sensitivity of libs and reduces errors caused by the differential volatility of ele ments such as that of zinc compared to copper in brasses it also significantly reduces the matrix effects doublegpulsed systems are also proving useful in conducting analysis underwater as the in itial laser pulse forms cavity bubble in which the second pulse acts on the evaporated material libs is technically very similar to number of oth er lasergbased

technology description infrared spectroscopy ir spectroscopy is the subs et of spectroscopy that deals with the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum this covers range of techniques with the most common type by far being form of absorption spectroscopy as with all spectroscopic techniques it can be used to identify compound and to investigate t he composition of sample the interpretation of infrared spectra involves the correlation of abs orption bands in the spectrum of an unknown compound with the known absorption frequencies for types of bonds the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectru m is divided into three regions the nearg midg and farg infrared named for their relation to the visible spectrum the farginfrared approx 400g 10 cmg1 lying adjacent to the microwave region s low energy and may be used for rotational spectroscopy the midg infrared approx 4000g400 c mg1 may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated rotationalgvibrational st ructure whilst the higher energy neargir 14000g 4000 cmg1 can excite overtone or harmonic vibratio ns infrared spectroscopy works because chemical bonds have specific frequencies at which they vibrate corresponding to energy levels the resonan t frequencies or vibrational frequencies are determined by the shape of the molecular potential energy surfaces the masses of the atoms and eventually by the associated vibronic coupling in order for vibrational mode in molecule to be ir active it must be associated with changes in the permanent dipole in particular in the borngoppenheimer and harmonic approximations ie when the molecular hamiltonian corresponding to the electronic ground state can be approximated by harmonic oscillator in the neighborhood of the equilibrium molecular geometry the resonant frequencies are determined by the normal modes corresponding to the molecular ele ctronic ground state potential energy surface nevertheless the resonant frequencies can be in first approach related to the strength of the bond and the mass of the atoms at either d of it thus the frequency of the vibrations can be associated with particular bond type in order to measure sample beam of infrared li ght is passed through the sample and the amount of energy absorbed at each wavelength is rec orded this may be done by scanning through the spectrum with monochromatic beam whi ch changes in wavelength over time or by using fourier transform instrument to measure all wavelengths at once from this transmittance or absorbance spectrum may be plotted which shows at which wavelengths the sample absorbs the ir and allows an interpretation of which bonds are presentthis technique works almost exclusively on covalent bonds and as such is of most use in organic chemistry clear spectra are obtained from samples with few ir active bonds and high levels of purity more complex molecular structures lead to more absorptio n bands and more complex spectra the technique has been used for the characterization of very complex mixtures gaseous samples require little preparation beyond p urification but sample cell with long pathlength typically 5g10 cm is used as gases sho w relatively weak absorbances liquid samples can be sandwiched between two plates of high purity salt commonly sodium chloride or common salt although number of othe r salts such as potassium bromide or calcium fluoride are also used the plates are transparent to the infrared light and will not introduce any lines onto the spectra some salt plates are highly soluble in water and so the sample washing reagents and the like must be anhydrous without wa ter solid samples can be prepared in two major ways th first is to crush the sample with mulling agent usually nujol in marble or agate mortar with pestle thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured n41756k06k06kdk5584 spksik2615 counter terrorism technology task force ctt tf nato cied program of work nato for official use only 36 the second method is to grind quantity of the sam ple with specially purified salt usually potassium bromide finely to remove scattering eff ects from large crystals this powder mixture is then crushed in mechanical die press to form translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass it is important to note that spectra obtained from different sample preparation methods will look slightly different from each other due to the diffe rent physical states the sample is in typical apparatus beam of infragred light is produced and split int two separate beams one is passed through the sample the other passed through reference wh ich is often the substance the sample is dissolved in the beams are both reflected back tow ards detector however first they pass through splitter which quickly alternates which f the two beams enters the detector the two signals are then compared and printout is obtaine d reference is used for two reasons it prevents fluctuations in the output of the source ffecting the data and allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out the reference is usual ly pure form of the solvent the sample is in with increasing technology in computer filtering an d manipulation of the results samples in solution can now be measured accurately water prod uces broad absorbance across the range of interest and thus renders the spectra unreadabl without this computer treatment some machines will also automatically tell you what subs tance is being measured from store of thousands of reference spectra held in storage by measuring at specific frequency over time cha nges in the character or quantity of particular bond can be measured this is especially useful in measuring the degree of polymerization in polymer manufacture modern resea rch machines can take infrared measurements across the whole range of interest as frequently as 32 times second this can be done whilst simultaneous measurements are made u sing other techniques this makes the observations of chemical reactions and processes qu icker and more accurate fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy is measurement technique for collecting infrared spectra instead of recording the amount of energy absorbed when the frequency of the infragred light is varied monochromator the ir light is gu ided through an interferometer after passing the sample the measured signal is the interferogram pe rforming mathematical fourier transform on this signal results in spectrum identical to t hat from conventional dispersive infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrometers are cheaper than conventional sp ectrometers because building of interferometers is easier than the fabrication of monochromator in addition measurement of single spectrum is faster for the ftir technique be cause the information at all frequencies is collected simultaneously this allows multiple samp to be collected and averaged together resulting in an improvement in sensitivity because of its various advantages virtually all modern infrared spectrometers are ftir instruments twokdimensional infrared spectroscopy twogdimensional infrared 2dir spectroscopy is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy it utilizes ultra short infrared laser pulses with typical pulse lengths of 100 fs it allows the observation of coupling between different vibration modes because of its extremely high time resolution it can be used to follow changes in mole cular configurations taking place on picosecond

hit thus they move through the tube relatively unimpeded and reac h the detector first the largest ions take several seconds longer to travel to the detector be cause they collide more frequently with other ions along the way the traditional instrument for sizing aerosol parti cles is the differential mobility analyzer dma simplistic description of the dma is that the instr ument is just two charged concentric cylinders with an inlet slit and sampling slit the dma sep arates particles based on their electrical mobility aerosol particles for sizing are inserted into the annular region between the two cylinders at the inlet slit they are carried by clean air fl owing through the annular region particles with mobility in certain narrow range are sampled at t he sampling slit then an inversion calculation is done to infer the size distribution iv ims devices come in wide range of sizes often ta ilored for specific application and are capable of operating under broad range of conditi ons systems operated at higher pressure ie atmospheric conditions 1 atm or 760 torr are also accompanied by elevated temperature above 100 c while lower pressure systems 1g20 torr do not require heating elevated temperature assists in removing ion clusters that m ay distort experimental measurements unlike the mass spectrometry technique which relies on ve ry low pressures to keep the ions from colliding with each other ims operates at normal tmospheric pressure and the ions collide with each other over and over again perhaps ion mobility spectrometrys greatest streng th is the speed at which separations occurgg typically on the order of 10s of milliseconds and that it can be performed in ambient pressure this feature combined with its ease of use relativ ely high sensitivity and highly compact design have allowed ims as commercial product to be used as routine tool for the field detection of explosives drugs and chemical weapons although because ims only sorts molecules by size and not by chemical properties or other identifying features it is not particularly good technique for making positive identification of unknown compounds however ims can make

electromagnetic waves sent at terahertz frequencies known as terahertz radiation terahertz waves tgrays tglight tglux and thz are in the r egion of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 gigahertz and 3 terahertz corresponding to the wavelength range starting at subgmillimeter 1 millimeter and 100 micrometres ending edge of farginfrared light like infrared radiation or microwaves terahertz wa ves usually travel in line of sight terahertz radiation is nongionizing and shares with microwave s the capability to penetrate wide variety of nongconducting materials they can pass through clo thing paper cardboard wood masonry plastic and ceramics they can also penetrate fog nd clouds but cannot penetrate metal or water the earths atmosphere is strong absorber of tera hertz radiation so the range of terahertz radiation is quite short limiting its usefulness in addition producing and detecting coherent terahertz radiation was technically challenging unt il the 1990s sources while terahertz radiation is emitted as part of the black body radiation from anything with temperatures greater than about 10 kelvin this the rmal emission is very weak as of 2004 the n41756k06k06kdk5584

wave oscillator bwo the far infrared laser fir ser quantum cascade laser the free electron laser fel synchrotron light sources and singleg cycle sources used in terahertz time domain spectroscopy there have also been solidgstate sources of millime ter and subgmillimeter waves for many years ab millimeter in paris for instance produces sy stem that covers the entire range from 8 ghz to 1000 ghz with solid state sources and detectors wadays most timegdomain work is done via ultrafast lasers theoretical and technological uses under developmen t medical imaging terahertz radiation is nongionizing and thus is t expected to damage dna unlike xgrays some frequencies of terahertz radiation can penetra several centimeters of tissue and reflect back terahertz radiation can also detect differenc in water content and density of tissue terahertz imaging could allow effective detection f epithelial cancer and replace the mammogram with safer and less invasive or painful imaging system some frequencies of terahertz radiation can be used for 3d imaging of teeth and could be more accurate and safer than conventional xgray imaging in dentistry because of terahertz radiations ability to penetra fabrics and plastics it can be used in surveillance such as security screening to uncove r concealed weapons on person remotely this is of particular interest because many materia ls of interest such as plastic explosives exhibit unique spectral fingerprints in the teraher tz range this offers the possibility of combining spectral identification with imaging some controve rsy surrounds the use of terahertz scanners for routine security checks due to the potential capabi lity to produce detailed images of subjects body through clothing spectroscopy in terahertz radiation could provide n ovel information in chemistry and biochemistry the recently developed techniques of thz timegdomain spectroscopy thz tds and thz tomography have been shown to be capable of performing measurements on and obtaining images of samples which are opaque in th visible and nearginfrared regions of the spectrum the utility of thzgtds is limited when th sample is very thin or has low absorbance since it is very difficult to distingui sh changes in the thz pulse caused by the sample from those caused by long term fluctuations in the driving laser source or experiment on the other hand the fact that thzgtds produces radiatio n that is both coherent and broadband means that such images can contain far more information t han conventional image formed with singlegfrequency source there are potential applications to satellite telec ommunications and highgaltitude communications aircraft to satellite or satellite to satellite many possible applications of terahertz imaging have been proposed in manufacturi ng quality control and process monitoring these generally exploit the fact that plastics and cardboard are transparent to terahertz radiation so that it is possible to inspect packaged objects one of the main applications of subgmillimeter wave s in physics is the study of condensed matter in high magnetic fields since at high fields say bove 15 t the larmor

astronomy terahertz versus millimeter and submillimeter waves one terahertz is 1012 hz conventionally the microw ave band extends to 30 ghz or so while the fargir is nominally reckoned to start at

description sunlight and almost every other form of natural and artificial illumination produces light waves whose electric field vectors vibrate in all planes that are perpendicular with respect to the direction of propagation when light wave hits an object what happens to it depends on the energy of the light wave the natural frequency at which electrons vibrate in the material and the strength with which the atoms in the material hold on to their electrons based on these three factors four different things can happen when ligh t hits an object it can be reflected or scattered absorbed refracted or can pass through with ef fect reflection of light and other forms of electromagn etic radiation occurs when the waves encounter surface or other boundary that does not absorb the energy of the radiation and bounces the waves away from the surface the incomi ng light wave is referred to as an incident wave and the wave that is bounced away from the sur face is called the reflected wave if the electric field vectors are restricted to single p lane by filtration of the beam with specialized materials then the light is referred to as plane r linearly polarized with respect to the direction of propagation and all waves vibrating in single pl ane are termed plane parallel or planeg polarized unpolarized light can also undergo polarization by reflection off of nonmetallic surfaces the extent to which polarization occurs is dependent up on the angle at which the light approaches the surface and upon the material which the surface is made of nonmetallic surfaces such as asphalt roadways snow fields and water reflect lig ht such that there is large concentration of vibrations in plane parallel to the reflecting rface person viewing objects by means of light reflected

robot vision and machine vision are closely related fields if you look inside text books which have either of these names in the title there is significant overlap in terms of what techniques and applications they cover this implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in the fields are more or less identical something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names on the other hand it appears to be necessary for r esearch groups scientific journals conferences and companies to present or market them selves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and hence various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented the following character izations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted image processing and image analysis tend to focus n 2d images how to transform one image to another eg by pixelgwise operations such as contrast enhancement local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal or geometrical tr ansformations such as rotating the image this characterization implies that image processinganal ysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content computer vision tends to focus on the 3d scene proj ected onto one or several images eg how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3d scene from one or several images computer vision often relies on more or less comple x assumptions about the scene depicted in an image machine vision tends to focus on applications main ly in industry eg vision based autonomous robots and systems for vision based inspection or m easurement this implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrate d with the processing of image data to control robot and that realgtime processing is emphasized by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software there is also field called imaging which primaril focus on the process of producing images but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis f images for example medical imaging contains lots of work on the analysis of image data in medical applications finally pattern recognition is field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general mainly based on statistical app roaches significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data consequence of this state of affairs is that you can be working in lab related to one of these fields apply methods from second field to solve problem in third field and present the result at conference related to fourth field v recognition the classical problem in computer vision image pro cessing and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object feature or activity this task can normally be solved robustly and without ef fort by human but is still not satisfactory solved in computer vision for the general case arb itrary objects in arbitrary situations the existing methods for dealing with this problem can at best solve it only for specific objects such as simple geometric objects eg polyhedrons hu man faces printed or handgwritten characters or vehicles and in specific situations typically described in terms of wellgdefined illumination background and pose of the object relative to the camera

identification an individual instance of an object is recognized examples identification of specific person face or fingerprint or identificat ion of specific vehicle detection the image data is scanned for specific condition examples detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or dete ction of vehicle in an automatic road toll system detection based on relatively simple and fa st computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce correct interpret ation several specialized tasks based on recognition exis t such as contentkbased image retrieval finding all images in larger set of images which have specific content the content can be specified in d ifferent ways for example in terms of similarity relative target image give all images similar to image x or in terms of highglevel search criteria given as text input give all images wh ich contains many houses are taken during winter and have cars in them pose estimation estimating the position or orientation of specif ic object relative to the camera an example application for this technique would be assisting robot arm in retrieving objects from conveyor belt in an assembly line situation optical character recognition or ocr identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text usually with view to encoding t he text in format more amenable to editing or indexing eg ascii motion several tasks relate to motion estimation in which an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the local image velocity at each poi nt examples of such tasks are egomotion determining the 3d rigid motion of the camera tracking following the movements of objects eg vehicles or humans scene reconstruction given two or more images of scene or video sc ene reconstruction aims at computing 3d model of the scene in the simplest case the model can be set of 3d points more sophisticated methods produce complete 3d surface model image restoration the aim of image restoration is the removal of nois sensor noise motion blur etc from images computer vision systems the organization of computer vision system is hig hly application dependent some systems are standgalone applications which solve specific mea surement or detection problem while other constitute subgsystem of larger design which f or example also contains subgsystems for control of mechanical actuators planning informat ion databases mangmachine interfaces etc the specific
