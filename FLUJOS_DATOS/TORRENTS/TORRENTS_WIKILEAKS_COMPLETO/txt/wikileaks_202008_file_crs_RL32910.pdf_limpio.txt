hoseanddrogue introduction air force aerial refueling received considerable attention in the 108th and 109th congresses much attention has focuse d on recapitalizing the kc135 fleet and proposed and ultimately rejected lease of 100 boeing kc767 aircraft1 in light of proposed replacements to the tanker fleet this report examines the department of defenses dod mix of aerial refueling methods currently air force fixedwing aircraft refuel with the flying boom the boom is rigid telescoping tube that an operator on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into receptacle on the aircraft being refueled figure 1 air force helicopters and all na vy and marine corps aircraft refuel using the hoseand drogue nato countries and other allies also refuel with the hoseand drogue as its name implies this refueling method employs flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft drogue small windsock at the end of the hos stabilizes it in flight and provides funnel for the aircraft being refu eled which inserts probe into the hose figure 2 all boomequipped tankers ie kc 135 kc10 have single boom and can refuel one aircraft at time with this mechanism many tanker aircraft that employ figure 1 usaf kc10 refueling b52 with flying boomhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32910crs2 2 kc135 aerial refueling manual to 11c13 3 for more information on ths history of air refueling see httpwwwcentennialofflightthe hoseanddrogue system can simultaneously employ two such mechanisms and refuel two aircraft simultaneously the boom however can dispense fuel faster than hoseanddrogue single flying boom can transfer fuel at approximate ly 6000 lbs pe r minute single hoseanddrogue can transfer be tween 1500 and 2000 lbs of fuel per minute unlike bombers and other large aircra ft however fighter aircraft cannot accept fuel at the booms maximum rate todays fighter airc raft can accept fuel at 1000 to 3000 lbs per minute whether from the boom or from the hoseanddrogue2 thus the flying booms primary advantage over the hosea nddrogue system is lost when refueling fighter aircraft as decisions are made regarding the air force tanker fleet an issue that may arise for congress is whether to examine the mix of boom and hoseanddroguerefuelable aircraft in the air force what might be th benefits and costs of any changes would dod benefit in terms of increased combat power if so would this benefit justify the cost background air force aircraft have not always used the flying boom all us combat aircraft used the hoseanddrogue system until the 1950s the air forces decision to field boomequipped tankers was base d on the refueling needs of longrange bombers which required large amounts of fuel the air for ces fighter community resisted eliminating the hoseanddrogue but wa s overruled by the strategi c air command which operated the tanker fleet and during the cold war placed higher value on refueling bombers3 figure 2 usmc kc130 refueling fa18s with

tanker plan sea power apr 2004the perceived shortcomings of using si ngle boom to refuel fighter aircraft is reflected in 1990 air force initiative to st andardize dod fighter aircraft refueling on the hoseanddrogue method as initially c onceived the initiative consisted of three elements 1 placing probes on all f15 and f16 fighters 2 incorporating probe in the design of the f22a and 3 adding tw drogue pods to at least 150 kc135s to provide redundancy and flexibility air fo rce fighters would retain their boom receptacles4 the 1991 war with iraq operation desert storm heightened dod concerns over lack of uniformity in aerial refueling methods navy leaders expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with the numbe r of air force aerial refueling aircraft capable of employing the hoseanddrogue postconflict analyses recommended that the navy purchase its own fleet of landbased kc10sized tankers to increase the number of hoseanddrogue aircraft and reduce its reliance on air force aerial refueling5 navy concerns were mollified by air for ce promises of increased cooperation and undermined by lack of budget to purchase new refueling aircraft6 the air forces hose anddrogue initiative was also scaled bac k instead of pursuing the three elements described above the air fo rce equipped 20 kc135s and 20 kc10s with multi point refueling system mprs kits that allow them to employ hoseanddrogue systems either from wing pods or attached to the end of the boom effectiveness of the current air force fleet the air forces aerial refueling fleet is often described as high demandlow density hdld force the fleet is in high demand because of the operational benefit derived from aerial refueling the long distances us combat aircraft often must fly and the multiple operations in which they are engaged despite numbering well over 500 aircraft the fleet is considered low density few in number for two apparent reasons first the demand for hoseanddrogue re fueling across dod does not appear to be well matched by the air forces hoseanddrogue capabilities this can create refueling bottleneck as some have observed operation desert storm operation allied force in 1999 over yugoslavia and operation endur ing freedom in 2001 demonstrated that requests for fuel offload do not always match the capacity to deliver it7 it appears that limited access to air force tankers has handica pped or complicated the navys long range strike capability in some conflicts b ecause kc135 aircraft employ single hosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32910crs4 8 ibid 9 david graves

conversation with crs apr 13 2004 12 refuelable aircraft inventory excel spreadsheet usaf office of legislative liaison weapons division apr 12 2005navy fighters must cycle six to eight aircraft through the refueling queue by the time the last aircraft has refueled the first one requires more gas this process can require three to four refueling hits for each aircraft before reaching distant target navy and marine corps strike packages often composed of 24 aircraft have requi red as many as four kc135s to meet their refueling needs8 suggesting dearth of air force tanker support us navy pilots who flew early missions against the taliban during operation enduring freedom described the uk royal air forces raf six vc10 tankers that supported them as godsend and the silent heros of the air war navy pilots expressed clear preference for raf tankers over usaf tankers9 to ameliorate deficit in refueling assets during operation iraqi freedom the navy flew refueling sorties w ith fa18ef aircraft10 while using the super hornet for aerial refueling demonstrated flexibility and reduced the navys dependence on the air force for refueling these desirable attributes came at cost fa18ef aircraft and the pilots that fly them are very specialized using these assets for aerial refueling rather than combat is seen as suboptimization of scarce and valuable resource fa18ef squadron vfa115 flew 623 sorties between march 21 2003 and april 9 2003 216 were refueling sorties when equipped to refuel other aircraft super hornets carry only self defense weapons and are not equi pped to conduct ttack operations11 the second reason the 500 aircraft tanker fl eet is considered low density is that it does not appear that the flying booms fuel transfer rate is fully taken advantage of leading to an underexploitation of the tanker fleet by most air force aircraft in 2005 96 of air force aircraft that are aerial re fuelable use the flying boom however only 20 of the current air force fleet 669 bombers and surveillance aircraft of 3227 aircraft can use the refueling boom to its full capacity four percent of the air force fleet 139 helicopters of 3227 aircraft cant use the boom at all seventy four percent of the fleet 2419 fighters of 3227 aircraft could potentially refuel with the hoseanddrogue with reduction in fu transfer rates12 the following two scenarios illustrate the potentially more effective exploitation of aerial refueling assets by air force aircraft if the air force were to replace its 1356 f 16s and 356 a10s which are outfitted with boom receptacles with 1763 jsfs that are equipped to refuel with refu eling probes only 43 of th fleet 1470 of 3372 aircraft would need to be refueled with booms the black and blackandwhite columns in figure 3 air force boomrefuelable aircraft would be evenly divided between large aircraft that can use this method at its full tr ansfer rate and small aircraft that use the boom at reduced transfer rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32910crs5 13 see crs report rl31673 f22a raptor by christopher bolkcom 14 this analysis assumes changes to other ai rcraft in the air force fleet if the number of longrange bombers strategic airlift aircra ft and aerial refueling aircraft capable of being refueled themselves incr eases in the future the percentage of aircraft most in need of boom refueling would also increase the air force wishes to re place its 722 f15s and 55 f117s 777 total with the f 22a raptor it too could potentially be modifi ed to refuel with hoseanddrogue systems because the f22 design is more mature than that of the jsf changes to the aircraft to convert it from boom to hoseanddrogue refueling may be more expensive and potentially infeasible the air force wa nts 381 raptors th current budget plan supports the purchase of 179 f22as13 if the air force were to modify the f22a to refuel by the hoseanddrogue method and if the air force were to replace its 777 legacy aircraft with 381 raptors the percentage of the total fleet that would require boom refueling would drop to 23 669 of 2932 aircra ft all these airc raft use the boom at its full transfer rate seventyseven percent of the fl eet 2243 of 2912 aircraft would use the hoseanddrogue refueling system and be interoperable with navy marine corps and allied refueling aircraft14 potential issues considering changes to the mix of refue ling methods in the air force tanker fleet appears to raise two overarching issues pot ential operational benefit and potential cost the primary potential operational benefit of increasing the number of aerial refueling hoses has already been described above more effective use of aerial refueling assets another potential benefit of increasing the number of aerial refueling hoses may includefigure 3 current and hypothetical air force aerial refueling profileshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32910crs6 15 michael gething kc135 upgrades continue apace international defense review

kc135 continuedgreater interoperability and thus more effective coordination among the air force navy marine corps and allied air forces calculating the potential costs of increasin g the proportion of hoses to booms in the air force tanker fleet would depend in large part on how dod and congress might decide to recapitalize and upgrade the current fleet one option would be to replace the oldest kc135s with new aircraft equi pped with two refueling hoses structural modifications to commercial ai rcraft to accommodate flying boom are more significant than the modifications for hoseanddrogue mechanisms the boom itself also costs more than the hoseanddrogue and is more comple x thus these new aircraft would likely be less costly than new boome quipped tankers newer kc 135s and kc10s with booms would need to be retained to refuel large aircraft another option would be to replace the oldest kc135s with new boomequipped tankers and to outfit the remaining tankers with the multipoint refueling system mprs estimates by the gao and crs suggest that th cost of producing and installing the mprs could be roughly 51 million per airc raft in 2004 dollars or 510 million for 100 aircraft air force program officials estimate it takes appr oximately 7000 manhours or up to seven months to modify kc135s to accept the mprs15 this cost estimate does not consider newer system s being developed that could be more or less expensive than mprs16 regardless of which approach is taken to recapitalize the kc135 fleet legacy usaf fighter aircraft would need to be retrofitted and new aircraft would need to be manufactured with refueling probes if they were to exploit multipoint hoseanddrogue refueling it may be that the costs incurred by these modifications c ould be offset by the cost savings derived from improved aerial refueling effectiven ess and corresponding reductions in tanker force structure ccording to 1991 air force estimates the 13 billion cost to modify about 3000 f15 and f16 fighter and 250 tankers to hoseand drogue configuration could be offset by reduced operating and support costs from the retirement of about 26 kc135 tankers17 at least five studies have

fulghum lowering the boom aviation week space technology feb 7 2005 24 lisa troshinsky eads aerial refueling boom to be lightweight failsafe aerospace continuedfactors in their analyses and made diffe rent assumptions they came to different conclusions however all found that tankers equipped w ith multipoint hoseanddrogue refueling would refuel combat aircraft more effectively th an boom equipped aircraft and could therefore allow reduction in the tanker fleet reduction estimates ranged from 17 to 5019 these reductions would result from the increased speed with which multipoint hoseanddrogueequipped aircraft could refuel multipleaircraft strike packages the following evaluation illustrates how increasing the speed with which combat aircraft are refueled could translate into increased efficiency and potentially lead to reduced tanker force structure and cost savings by refueling two fighters simultaneously th time that the fighters spend refueling can be reduced by approximately 75 percent th is reduced refueling time in turn would enable the tanker to have considerably mo re fuel available to offload to other receiversthe less fuel burned by either the tanker or the receivers during aerial contact the more that is available to conduct the fighter mission at fighter refueling speeds kc135a burns something in excess of 200 pounds per minute reducing the air refueling time from 40 minutes to 10 minutes 75 percent makes approximately 6000 pounds of additional fuel av ailablethe fuel savings in four tanker formation could be enough to refuel an extra flight of four fighters or allow the same mission to be accomplished with one less tanker20 advocates of the flying boom argue that it is prudent to maintain large number of these tankers in the air force while fighte r aircraft receive much media attention the contribution of longrange bombers to recent conflicts has been noteworthy21 these aircraft may become even more important as the united states reduces its overseas basing and deploys over greater distances bombers nd other large aircraft can spend as much as 20 minutes refueling at the booms maximu m capacity refueling such aircraft with the hoseanddrogue is infeasible22 further boom advocates argue technolog ical advances are being made in new booms which reduce operator workload and s hould make them safe r and more reliable than the hoseanddrogue method23 industry is incorporatin g commercial offtheshelf technology in booms currently under developm ent hoping to make them fail safe24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32910crs8 24 continued daily and defense report sept 15 2004 25 kc135 aerial refueling manual to 11c13finally it is argued tankers with flying booms are in some ways more flexible than tankers with hoseanddrogue refueling tanker with flying boom can be converted in the field to accommodate probeequipped aircraft if necessary hoseanddrogue tankers cannot be converted to accommodate aircraft with boom receptacles to accommodate fighter aircraft tankers with flying booms can reduce the speed at which they dispense fuel25 tankers with hoseanddrogue refueling cannot increase the speed at which they dispense fuel to accommodate bombers and other large aircraft
