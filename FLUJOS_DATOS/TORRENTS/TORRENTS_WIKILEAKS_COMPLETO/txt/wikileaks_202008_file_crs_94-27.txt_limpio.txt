recipient statistics the federal oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi programs collectively make up the system commonly referred to as social security officially there are two separate programs each of which is administered by the social security administration ssa and managed by the operations of its own trust fund the old age and survivors insurance oasi program and the disability insurance di program each disburse benefits to eligible retired or disabled workers and their dependents who have been covered by payroll contributions recipients by trust fund and eligibility status benefit payments are disbursed by the relevant trust fund retired workers and their eligible dependent family members as well as the dependent family members of deceased workers receive benefits from

administration office of policy note totals may not equal the sums of rounded components less than 01 crs5 tax facts the social security trust funds are financed by payroll taxes on covered earnings being covered by social security means that worker is employed in job or is selfemployed and contributes portion of his or her earnings to social security workers not covered by social security are either covered by similar eligible contributory system offered by their employers outside of social security do not have high enough earnings for mandatory participation or have another special exemption the type of workers exempt from coverage are provided below workers exempt from the tax state and local government workers participating in alternative retirement systems hi tax is mandatory for workers hired since april 1 1986 election workers earning 1300 or less year in 2006 career federal employees hired before 1984 who did not choose social security coverage hi tax is mandatory for all federal workers college students working at their academic institutions ministers who choose not to be covered and certain religious sects household workers earning less than 1500 year in 2006 and those under age 18 for whom household work is not their principal occupation selfemployed workers with annual net earnings below 400 social security taxpayers in 2003 covered workers contribute to social security by paying payroll taxes on their earnings wage and salaried workers often have their contributions deducted from each paycheck they receive while selfemployed must report earnings regularly with the social security administration table 3 provides the number of covered workers that contribute to the social security system as of december 2003 the total number of taxpayers is much lower than the sum of the two coverage groups because approximately six million individuals overlap coverage and engage separately in both wage and salaried work as well as in selfemployed work crs6 table 3 social security taxpayers taxpayers by coverage group number number of wage and salaried taxpayers 1451 million number of selfemployed taxpayers 151 million total taxpayers 1543 million source social security administration office of policy includes people who are both selfemployed and wage or salaried employees social security tax rates covered wage and salaried workers contribute 765 of their earnings below the taxable maximum earnings threshold explained below to the social security system employers of covered workers contribute to the system an additional 765 of the earnings of each employee the payroll taxes levied on workers and their employers are called fica taxes after the legislation that created them the federal insurance contribution act selfemployed workers contribute roughly 1530 of their net earnings to the system the payroll tax levied on the selfemployed are known as seca taxes for the selfemployed contribution act fica and seca tax rates are displayed in table 4 on paper it appears that the selfemployed are subject to tax rate that is double that of wage and salaried worker essentially equaling both the employee and employer fica portions however the selfemployed receive two breaks that are not offered to wage and salaried workers and their employers the first break is that not all of selfemployed workers earnings are subject to seca taxes only 9235 of net earnings are subject to seca taxes meaning that 765 is exempt the second break is that onehalf of the tax payments made in the form of seca contributions are deductible for income tax purposes table 4 social security tax rates type of employment and tax of earnings fica rate is paid by employee and employer 765 each seca rate is paid by selfemployed 1530 so urce social security administration website electronic fact sheet httpwwwssagovpubs10003html the selfemployed now compute the tax using only 9235 of net earnings and onehalf of the tax so computed is deductible for income tax purposes crs7 how the tax rates are divided portions of both the fica and seca tax rates are dedicated to fund both social security and the medicare hospital insurance hi program also known as medicare part of the 765 fica tax rate paid by both employers and employees 62 percentage points go to oasdi and the remaining 145 of the tax is used to fund hi similarly of the 153 seca rate 124 percentage points is dedicated to oasdi while 29 goes to hi table 5 provides detail of the breakdown table 5 fica and seca tax rates fund both social security and medicare hospital insurance fica

electronic fact sheet httpwwwssagov pubs10003html how much earnings are taxable covered workers contribute the proper percentage of their earnings by either the fica or seca tax however not all earnings are subject to fica and seca taxes there is maximum taxable earnings threshold which rises each year with overall wage growth earnings above the cap are not subject to the oasdi portion of the fica and seca taxes the earnings above the cap however are subject to the hi dedicated portion of the fica and seca taxes the wage cap is effective for both the employer and employee oasdidedicated portions of the fica tax recent wage cap limits are shown in table 6 the social security administrations office of policy estimates that 946 of covered workers had earnings below the maximum taxable threshold in 2002 the latest year for which data is available table 6 maximum earnings taxable by fica and seca 2004 2005 2006 maximum taxable for oasdi 87900 90000 94200 maximum taxable for hi limit limit limit source social security administration website electronic fact sheet httpwwwssagovpubs 10003html adjusted yearly to reflect the growth of average wages crs8 annual oasdi and hi tax payments in 2004 selfemployed workers are subject to the payroll tax rate which amounts to the sum of both the employer and employee shares of the fica tax rate however the selfemployed benefit from two breaks that reduce their overall tax burden first selfemployed workers are only required to make 9235 of their net earnings subject to the seca tax rate wage and salaried employees have the fica tax rate applied to all 100 of their earnings second selfemployed workers can deduct onehalf of their seca tax payments from their income taxes for example if hypothetical selfemployed person had 35057 in net earnings an amount equivalent to the average wage earner in the economy they would pay seca taxes on 32375 of those earnings 9235 of 35057 when the 153 seca tax rate is applied to 32375 the result is seca tax burden of 4953 in computing the effect of the income tax deduction onehalf of the 4953 tax burden 2477 is used for calculation purposes assuming that this hypothetical selfemployed worker with 35057 in net earnings is in the 15 marginal income tax bracket 2477 income tax deduction is going to result in tax savings of an additional 372 15 of 2477 the net real tax burden in this example would be 4582 instead of 4953 without the income tax deduction and 5364 153 of 35057 without the income tax deduction and the exemption from net earnings these computations are included in table 7 to illustrate the tax burdens of both wage and salary and selfemployed workers with various earnings histories table 7 2004 social security tax payments selected

disburse benefits to future benefits lies in demographics in the early years of the system there were more than ten covered workers contributing with payroll crs10 taxes for every one person drawing benefits presently there is barely more than three covered workers for every beneficiary and the social security trustees project that this ratio will eventually fall to less than 2 to 1 table 10 and

benefit formula the social security benefit computation formula is progressive as it uses bend points to return higher percentages of lowerwage workers lifetime indexed earnings computed on monthly basis for 2006 the bend points used in the benefit formula are 656 and 3955 respectively and are increased annually based on average wage growth if all or most of workers indexed earnings fall under the first or second bend point they will see higher replacement rate of average monthly earnings as compared to monthly social security benefits the more earnings worker may have beyond the second bend point the lower the net return that worker will see in augmenting their social security benefit for basic benefit or primary insurance amount 90 of first 656 of aime plus 32 of aime over 656

worker benefits may be granted with as few as six quarters of coverage if the onset of the disabling condition or event occurred while the worker was at young enough age the number of quarters of

age at which benefits are not reduced for retiring early see the following table crs13 ages at which persons receive full retirement benefits for purposes of qualifying for spousal or widowers benefits the full or normal retirement age known as both the fra or nra has little to do with retirement as claims to these benefits is not conditional on covered work history or more specifically the ceasing of work in fact the fra is misleading to workers too because leaving the workforce is not condition for retirement benefit eligibility rather the fra is simply qualifying age threshold for many years the social security full or normal retirement age remained constant at 65 years in 1983 however comprehensive social security reform package that included many programmatic changes altered the law to gradually phase in an increase of the normal retirement age starting with those born in 1938 the full retirement age will be higher than age 65 depending on your year of birth the highest

source social security administration office of the actuary average monthly benefits oasdi benefits are paid to retired and disabled workers as well as to their eligible dependent family members the benefit formula illustrated above is used to compute primary insurance amounts pias for eligible retired or disabled workers but benefit amounts paid to dependents are determined by applying the relevant percentage amount of the worker they are dependent upon typically eligible spouses and children of workers can receive monthly amount up to 50 of the workers primary insurance amount surviving spouses may be eligible for monthly amount up to 100 of the workers pia factors that may reduce these crs14 maximum percentage amounts include early eligibility dependents own work record and subsequent benefit eligibility based on that work record remarriage and other factors table 14 provides average monthly benefit amounts for selected beneficiary categories before and after the

benefits are inflationprotected by the application of an automatic annual costofliving adjustment cola the percentage applied to all beneficiaries is compiled from economic indicators that track inflation of prices on goods and services over the previous year the cola is applied so beneficiaries do not lose their purchasing power over time as they would if benefits were held constant while prices of goods and services generally increased prior to 1975 colas were applied sporadically to increase benefit levels to keep pace with inflation starting in 1975 colas have been applied annually with the exception being when their effective date was switched from july to january and there was cola applied in the months between july 1982 and january 1984 table 15 and figure 2 illustrate the
