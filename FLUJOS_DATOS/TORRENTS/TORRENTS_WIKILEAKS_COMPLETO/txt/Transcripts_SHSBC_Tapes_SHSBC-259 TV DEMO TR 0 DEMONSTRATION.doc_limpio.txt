tv demo tr 0 demonstration tr demonstration given on 16 january 1963 this is ron and were going to do series of demonstrations tonight of tr 0 and these demonstrations are made with the coach who is senior student and student in the thing is the newcomer now your attention is put on this because the teaching of tr 0 is quite important its the number of tr 1 2 3 and 4 that person does actually which makes his auditing presence and its the best way weve ever found to make auditing presence and so this is the way we make auditing presence and you should get used to these because you will be taking back to your area good concept of what the trs are all about wellprobably at later date well work hard on the cchs so that we can give you those as well the essence of tr 0 is to teach natural confrontingness you go into an academy where new students are first beginning to audit and you will see tremendous stiffness fantastic stiffness now actually it goes this way they go into the coaudit and they are not so stiff they dont seem to be so stiff they seem to be more relaxed but nevertheless you will see them sort of lose their grip on their confront because it isnt indoctrinated into them and its like golf very often brandnew golfer goes out picks up some golf clubs and away he goes and he starts making holes in one and so forth and then he all of sudden cracks up and hes totally incapable of striking single stroke its not possible and from that point on he has to be taught and for quite little time then hes complete duffer hes become selfconscious about his grip hes become oh all kinds of mechanisms hes learned and all this sort of thing well actually our present trs are calculated to bring person up through this with the greatest possible rapidity now the basis of the tr is simply to get the person to sit there and confront you ordinarily find out he confronts with something hes confronting with his belly hes confronting with his nose hes confronting with his hands hes doing everything else little bit later stage why youve got him confronting with professional attitude and an interested attitude and other things of this character and the best way to do is to have him put these things on just hour after hour of sitting there confronting the coach and the coach doing nothing is not going to do very much tr for anybody the coach has got to be good now the trs are actually as good as the coach if coach gives too many flunks and too many loses of course the quality of the tr goes down and if the coach gives the pc or gives the student rather some wins why the trs goes up all right well were all set now and we have gordon who is very senior student here and he is going to give trs and here we go start coach okay all right ian this is tr 0 confronting tr right youre familiar with it i assume student mmhm coach okay im giving an echo back here from myself all right now i want you to relax and just confront just straight tr 0 1 wont be

way he just looks completely fixated now if we could get him to give us dissertation on what he ought to be doing it might be very interesting coach okay ian thats it okay what should you be doing in this drill to be doing tr 0 student just being aware of you coach okay but then are you aware of any mechanics of how you should be doing this student as as soon as i start being aware of you i sort of lose awareness of my own body coach mmhm student as property you know coach okay well what do you do over there when you start confronting what do you really do student just look at you coach at

drill student yeah coach good all right well thats the end of the drill okay student thank you coach thats it good well there you go lrh all right that demonstration there was quite interesting because frankly this student is pretty badly gimmicked up finally figured out the what this was all about the mark of good coach here and gordon did very well there but the mark of good coach is the his ability to find out the mark of good coach is the ability to find out what the what the student is doing and to poke it full of holes so that the student will come off these special things and that last preclear the last student actually was in the attitude of pc to marked degree but was confronting with an idea he was confronting with an idea and that idea was what he was confronting with somebody told him at some time or another that all he had to do to confront was be aware of the pc and ever since that time hes had be aware of the pc sticking out in front of him he himself has not been doing anything with the pc well well cure him of that here at saint hill all right well now weve got another demonstration now you just carry on start coach all right okay what well be doing here is just simple tr 0 to start with student yes coach and all im going to do is ask you to sit there be comfortable and erect posture and simply confront there confront over here you be here and be aware of student fair enough coach okay is there anything youd like to say before we start student coach okay you set fine all right confront start lrh theyre moving on into this i noticed that ann has the some of the same tricks of her husband student sorry coach okay flunk for talking start is it okay if we start student mmhm coach all right thats it are you aware of not doing something in order to confront here you know you know something that you should that you are avoiding doing here student yes fidgeting coach okay is there anything else here that youre avoiding doing student yeah its uh uh crossing my legs and you know just to you know shift them coach all right good enough all right just put your attention over here on student mmhm coach and be aware of of dont too much care about that just confront start lrh apparently both of these students have been trained on you dont confront you suppress and i never saw such suppressed auditor valence there in my life and well lets give her the works on professional attitude an auditing attitude lets give her the works on that coach all right thats it student mmhm coach lets move on over here to the professional attitude portion of this student mmhm coach now what what to you is professional auditing attitude tell about it whats professional auditing attitude student well having your attention on the pc coach mmhm student uh and uh uh just looking like an auditor i suppose coach oh very good all right what would what would looking like an auditor consist of student uh coach well just tell just tell what looking like an auditor would consist of to you student i dont know i sort of think of um well i dont want to use ians term but it is being interested in pc coach all right student thats true coach well all right anything else student well not having attention on yourself coach mmhm good anything else professional auditing attitude would consist of student well not sloppy coach just how do you mean that not sloppy student um not slouchy uh i dont quite get that sort of i would say to be relaxed coach okay student and without looking sloppy thats all coach well good perfectly all right student relaxed and interested is about coach all right fine then id like you to confront with professional auditing attitude here all right start professional auditing attitude student uh coach confront with professional auditing attitude flunk for laughing student huhuh coach all right thats it what did you do to confront with that professional auditing attitude there student uh i put more effort into it which i sort of you know realize isnt what im supposed to be doing coach mmhm student it was it was an effort yeah very much so coach mmhm okay tell little more about that im not quite sure what you mean student i think of my face it sort of tends to fidget and moves around here and uh i try not to have well my attention on rather than on you coach uhhuh all right now tell again just what professional auditing attitude would be student having your attention on your pc coach mmhm good anything else would be anything more that would be part of professional auditing attitude student just looking smart coach all right what was that again student looking smart coach oh all right fine okay confront with professional auditing attitude start all right thats it what did you do to confront with professional auditing attitude student looked at you coach very good did you do anything else student yeah i do seem to be aware of doing extra things coach such as student uh well having quite an effort to just sort of put my body there coach mmhm okay is there anything youre aware of not doing you know just avoiding doing to have professional auditing attitude student uh yeah having attention on my face coach mmhm student that sort of does tend to well i dont have great deal of control over it and often lrh weve got student here by the way who has buttons and you would ordinarily have buttonpunching approach here to this type of pc because this type of pcs liability in an auditing session student im trying not to have my attention on my face or on this coach all right student thats one thing coach all right thank you now what again is professional auditing attitude student having your attention on the pc coach very good anything more on that real professional auditing attitude you know just real pro lrh the student is breaking up little bit on this professional auditing attitude i mean she can make it student im not totally certain n it you know coach all right student its just sort of having all your attention on your pc coach mmhm student and not any on yourself coach all right fine then confront with professional auditing attitude all right start all right thats it what did you do to confront with that professional auditing attitude what did you do student more attention on you coach very good anything else you did there to have real professional attitude student coach okay anything that you didnt do there in order to have professional auditing attitude avoided student yeah coach mmhm what student avoided having as much attention on myself as i did have coach ahh student i want to try it again on that thing coach all right thank you okay how is that different than simple trs lrh this student by the way is getting someplace under this coaching now lets pull an interested attitude coach okay student ah coach do you notice any difference in how you are doing this than sim than confronting anything this is above confronting and beyond student yeah bit more relaxed coach all right very good all right were going to move on to an interested auditing attitude now just that you know student interested coach yeah interested auditing attitude student you mean the auditor being interested and sort of being an interested auditor coach yeah thatsthats the idea student interesting or just interested coach interested student ah coach interested auditing attitude could you sort of describe to an interested auditing attitude student well i get the idea of pc you know cockeyed listening with one ear but you know just listening to the pc with your attention on him coach very good student mm coach good all right is there anything else that you that an auditor would do to have real interested attitude now you know interested attitude there student well just make sure he listens thats all to have his attention put there and not sort of all around the jazz around the room coach uhhuh all right very good then confront with an interested auditing attitude okay student mmhm coach very good interested auditing attitude start all right thats it what did you do to confront with an interested auditing attitude student i moved forward little coach mmhm all right anything else you did to uh to have real interested auditing attitude student coach all right very good student not anything else i can think of coach okay thats fine now tell again what is what is an interested auditing attitude you know just student well person who looks as if theyre interested in the fellow at the other end of it coach all right very good is there anything special youd do to look as though you were interested there student i dont think so coach all right fine student theres coach mmhm student i think there shouldnt be but i think suspect that yes i do uh i get the idea i cock my eyebrow i think coach hmm very good all right well see how this goes then student i didnt get that coach well see how this goes and well do it again here go back and see if theres anything else that comes up student mmhm coach all right id like you to confront with just youre the auditor here you know student mmhm coach very interested attitude okay student mmhm coach all right start student uh im not doing it sorry coach all right thats it what happened lrh of course it cracked her up and she gets flunked of course she gets flunked for grinning coach hm student hm coach all right thank you now can i have confront with an interested auditing attitude start im the pc you know just be interested student all right coach all right just confront interested auditing attitude all right thats it what did you do to confront with an interested auditing attitude there to be be an interested auditor student um looked at you yeah coach okay student well i was sure i put more attention on you than other things coach uhhuh okay is there anything you didnt do or avoided doing you stopped yourself from doing you know that you held down yourself from doing held yourself down from doing something student shifting coach uhhuh student and uh being aware of the rest of my body coach uhhuh student this is sort of hard for to have to sit here coach very good all right is there anything that you shouldnt do beyond this to have an interested auditing attitude that you really shouldnt do student keep busy shifting coach all right fine is there anything that you shouldnt do to have an interested auditing attitude student um yes lrh as soon as you get her flattened off on that little bit why give her thats it end of demonstration coach all right i didnt quite hear that student have your attention on yourself you havent got your attention on your pc coach well very good all right id like to do this again now interested auditing attitude could you tell again just briefly what it is student having your attention on your pc and not on yourself coach all right fine all right confront with an interested auditing attitude start all right very good thats it student mmhm coach okay did you notice anything there that you did in order to confront with an interested auditing attitude student i thought it was bit little bit better perhaps i sort of got more interest on you than than i have had coach very good all right were going to end this off in couple of seconds what was that again i cut you off student i seem to have more attention on you now than i had on you before coach very good okay is there anything different anything more to having an interested auditing attitude than simply to confronting you know anything anything you noticed there thats additional to an interested auditing attitude student that im doing as an additional auditing attitude coach im sorry im not getting that across to you is there anything that is more to an interested auditing attitude you know student than just sitting there coach than just and confronting is there anything more to it student listening coach okay anything more to an interested auditing attitude than confronting student oh yeah being willing to duplicate the pc sort of willing to have him as he is coach all right student without alterising him all the time coach okay fine all right id like to end this off here student mmhm coach thank you all right thats it student thank you coach end of demonstration lrh all right this was very interesting demonstration in view of the fact of tremendous difference between the advanced student doing the coaching and the person being the student because the last two students have only been here since monday just three four days and weve got big deal here of some kind or another oftheres lot of systematized confrontings and you understand that this idea of telling them to be interesting and telling them this and telling them that and so forth is simply to run out the buttons so they just dont keep on confronting by system and really this can be stepped up to where you can break up almost anybodys confront all right now weve got another one going here all right start coach all right ian what were going to do is some student norman coach sorry norman what were going to do is some tr 0 and id like you to tell what you understand about tr 0 student just to be here and confront you coach all right very good now im going to give you start and thats it when i want to tell you something all right and i want you to just relax just relax your body all right fine and just sit there and confront all right start all right thats it now how do you feel about the space you know how big student fine coach all right well how big is your space student the room coach good well am i included in your space student of course coach all right very good now just relax your body bit more terribly tense over here just relax okay student mmhm coach just let go just let your body flop bit go on just relax your bod all right student i feel relaxed coach okay very good now i want you to be there and confront start all right im going to flunk you uh youre staring at i want you to confront all right student okay coach start lrh shes got him into pretty good shape there actually hes cavedinchest sort of confront hes not confronting with lot of things and its similar case hes got lot of notconfront going on here hes probably confronting with an idea and not confronting with the chest with the body at all so it might be of benefit to find out what idea he is confronting with coach okay thats it now norman id like you to tell what you know youre confronting with what do you feel youre confronting with student fin just confronting you but i was sort of trying to listen to what he was talking about coach i get it student okay coach all right well just just relax bit more get your bod you know in the chair student yeah i think its the word relax that might have hypnotic command you know coach i see all right well if i used easy would that be better student thats ne i know what you really mean it just bugs because i used to use it coach all right very good now youve got your i mean your stomach and chest sticking out here just relax get your body in its proper putting it nicely thats fine now you be there and you confront start thats much better all right all right thats it now youre sort of tipping over to the side there can you feel that student yeah coach all right just get your body relaxed student im confronting you more with one side of my backside you know coach i see all right very good well just you know just get your body easy nice you be there and you confront start thats it youre still tipping over to the side there can you feel it student i always sit like this coach oh i see all right well just just straighten up you know prop yourself up bit thats much better student am i okay now coach yeah thats much better student i cant always tell when im doing it coach all right now just relax student mmhm coach okay start lrh this students confront actually is pretty grim hes got some kind of glee glee going on there you could very easily break him up and so forth and actually the coach ought to walk forward to shattering the false composure he is sitting there in coach all right thats it now i sort of feel theres something real solid sitting there in front of student it could be my bank coach all right fine well just you know just get your bod relaxed okay student yeah coach all right some more student i need to coach just let your body flop you know just just hunch over little bit all right let your head drop go on just drop just relax student i wouldnt be comfortable coach just try it student i dont know how coach just relax your body completely more just bit more let it go student i dont understand let what go coach forget about the people student im not interested in them coach all right student id like to know how to do it coach all right just let your body relax you know thats much better all right now i want you to be there all right just you be there and confront now now student okay yeah coach i was just before i was going to give you the start i just felt you building this up again now just let it relax you know just you relax sorry student yeah coach and you confront all right okay all right start now thats very much better all right im going to flunk you for thinking now uhh student i am i didnt feel as comfortable as when i started coach i see all right student i felt i was very here when i started but i dont feel like that i feel like im trying to do something coach mmm student you know im trying to confront and i i dont want to try to do it ii was comfortable sat up straight coach mmm student and comfortable just sitting here like when i started coach all right student i did to try to collapse im trying to do something and i dont like it coach well how are you trying to do this student well im trying to sit the way you want to coach mmhm student and im trying to sit the way you expect to you know the way youre telling coach i get it student uh i i sit up when i sit down anywhere i sit up i sit erect im comfortable coach all right student im very comfortable coach all right well are you sitting relaxed now student yeah coach all right very good now i just want you to be there now student mmhm coach and you confront student yeah coach all right start lrh hes having quite time here i said he could be rattled and you heard how rattled he was starting to get now hed rattle the same way under pc that started to fall to pieces so its much to his advantage as an auditor to get this broken up as early as possible and actually he ought to be wracked up even more than he is being wracked up there by mazie coach all right thats it now uh which way are you sort of aware of holding your body student this way coach that way all right uh youre tilting it which way which side student im intentionally tilting it uh so that this lowers because this shoulder is lower than this one coach i see student normally and i know in tr 0 coach mmhm student im going to get flunked for it so i purposely push myself forward like this and raise this shoulder im intentionally doing that but when im auditing i just sit with this shoulder lower than the other one coach i see all right well lets see if the body can relax let it relax student yeah coach so that you are there and you communicate across to all right student okay coach okay are you feeling more relaxed now student yeah i feel fine coach all right fine now you be there and you confront start all right im going to flunk you youve still got your bod tilted over to the side student mmhm coach so im going to correct that for you all right student mmhm coach well how does that feel student feels fine coach all right are you aware of any change from before student not much coach okay just going to get this straight over there all right now just relax okay thats fine i feel youre much more here than when we started all right student fine yeah coach good now you communicate across to and you confront start lrh i think we ought to ask this student for an amused auditing attitude how would he look if he were amused because he actually looks like hes on the verge of laughing and actually itd be murderous for pc to be audited with that expression coach all right thats it now norman i want you to show an amused auditing attitude student oh coach all right student christ really coach mmhm well before you student what do you mean amused coach oh well you tell what you understand by an amused auditing attitude student well immediately i thought of joke i have with somebody about an acknowledgment it goes yeah okay yeah all right i heard what you said and i sound somewhat amused i mean for to be amused id have to sit with my legs crossed like this and just sneering coach all right very good well you show an amused auditing attitude okay when i say start you can do anything you like to show an amused auditing attitude all right start student well thats ridiculous coach go on very good carry on student just take my frowning off coach all right good fine student okay coach just give it go you know just show an amused auditing attitude let yourself go student this twitch is purposeful coach mmhm all right and some more let it go student i think this is better than the way i confront the other way you know coach all right very good now just carry on youre doing fine how about leering at and grinning student i dont think i can do that now coach uhhuh student im not really amused coach i see all right student i dont know what an amused auditing attitude is coach mm student i really dont coach all right well thats it okay well that was very good okay how did you feel doing that student i was acting because i dont know what an amused auditing attitude is coach i see student i really dont when i think of an amused auditing attitude i think of my being amused at an auditor who has some type of sarcastic attitude you know coach mmhm student but i dont see one coach and as an auditor what do you understand by amused auditing attitude student well if the preclear told something funny id laugh id be amused coach all right very good student i think it would be all right you know if the preclear thought it was funny and uh when were in session and i felt like laughing id laugh id be amused coach all right very good well how about showing that student i cant laugh now you havent said anything funny coach all right well id like you to put that on for okay ill give you start and id like for you to do that student oh boy coach all right start student thats very funny you know coach mmhm student well thats it i would always smile and be amused coach all right thats it that was very good okay all right how are you doing student okay that attitude that i just showed you is closer to my normal attitude when im auditing than when i first walked in coach all right very good id like you to relax and lets get back to tr 0 student okay coach and see how you do now okay student yeah mmhm coach all right now you be there and you confront start thats very much better all right thats it how do you feel about your body now you know student well im feeling more comfortable coach all right student and i feel better uh coach mmhm student i did what i was normally expected to do for tr 0 is to sit erect well i always sit erect anyway as i said coach mmhm student but um i have to try to please the the coach coach mmhm student now that was what i was trying to do coach i see student this way i feel much more relaxed im doing it im confronting you coach okay very good all right now i dont want you to try student coach or try to impress or anything like that student mmhm coach i just want you to be there and you confront all right student yeah sure coach and you just get your body relaxed again theres still tendency to student sometimes i cant tell which way my head goes coach uhhuh student uh i i cant always tell when its tilted coach i see all right very good well now you just relax and you confront okay student uhhuh coach start you break up all right thats it well that was very much better now i want you to relax even more you know this tenseness is coming across to terribly okay student okay coach all right now just relax your body even more you know just get there real easy thats good thats much better how do you feel student fine coach good all right now i want you to communicate across to all right start lrh all right get him to do something there and find out if hes had any gains from the session and then close it off coach okay all right thats it okay now what i want you to do this time is be even more here all right more relaxed student mmhm coach can you do that student ill try now the thing that bugs is you keep saying communicate to you and coach uhhuh student and ive always considered that should uh my willing commun uh my confront is the willingness to see what im looking at and to receive communication and youre sort of twisting that around little bit i never thought of it that isnt to say i havent communicated to coach mmhm student preclear but coach i understand student you know the idea is thatthe willingness to receive communication coach all right very good well as the auditor student mmhm coach um who really sets the session up student do i get pass if i answer the auditor coach all right student okay coach well very good okay now lets just have this once more for few minutes student mmhm coach and i want you know real good tr 0 here and i really want to feel that youre there you know confronting student mmhm coach all right start all right thats it okay that was very much better okay now how did you find this coaching student very good coach all right student very good yeah im glad you didnt ask for professional attitude id have charged you professional fee coach okay anything else about the coaching student it was very good i felt much better towards the end than when i started i was little nervous but other than that im still better at the end i felt more relaxed at the end than the beginning coach all right very good student thank you coach all right well its the end of the coaching now all right student fine yeah coach thats it student thank you
