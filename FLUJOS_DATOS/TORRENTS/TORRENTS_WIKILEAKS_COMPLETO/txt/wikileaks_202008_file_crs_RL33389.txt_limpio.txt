of the executive branch including congressional delegation in the chronology key events are marked by bold text overview of events in 2005 mostly more of the same in 2005 the year 2005 saw little progress in resolving the north korea nuclear issue although adjustments were made such as changes to senior us officials in charge of policy in east asia and the addition of human rights and criminal activities to the agenda of items to cover with north korea overall relationships and regional trends saw major reversals or breakthroughs north korea escalates tension in early 2005 in the first half of 2005 north korea escalated the security situation on the korean peninsula through words and actions on february 10 pyongyang officials announced that north korea had nuclear weapons and would indefinitely suspend its participation in the sixparty talks the multilateral negotiation forum dedicated to the peaceful denuclearization of north korea made up of the united states china japan north korea south korea and russia north korean officials followed up in april with the assertion that the focus of the negotiations should adjust to regional disarmament talks given its status as nuclear weapons state reports of preparations for possible nuclear test in april further escalated the sense of urgency in may north korea announced that it had removed 8000 fuel rods from the yongbyon reactor for reprocessing experts estimate that the reprocessed plutonium could provide enough material for an additional six to eight nuclear bombs later that month north korea launched shortrange missile into the east sea crs2 return to the sixparty talks after nearly year without meeting negotiators from the six nations re convened in beijing in late july 2005 for fourth round of talks the outcome joint statement of principles agreed to in september by all parties was hailed as major breakthrough the key statement committed north korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning at any early date to the treaty on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the international atomic energy agency iaea safeguards in exchange north korea was provided with security assurances south korea committed to provide 2 million kilowatts of electricity and the us and japan pledged to take steps toward normalization of relations with pyongyang crucial disagreement during the talks involved north koreas right to develop peaceful nuclear energy programs as compromise the united states and north korea agreed to discuss pyongyangs right to such program and its demand for lightwater reactors lwrs at an appropriate time the accomplishment proved to be shortlived however as just day after the statement was issued north korean spokesman asserted that north korea would return to the iaeas nonproliferation treaty npt only after it received an lwr from the united states secretary rice dismissed the claim but the sense of significant progress diminished and additional talks were not held in 2005 after the sixparty talks stalled again hostile rhetoric between washington and pyongyang intensified incoming us ambassador to south korea alexander vershbow labeled north korea criminal regime and likened the state to nazi germany for its criminal activities the same week jay lefkowitz the special envoy for human rights in north korea appointed under the north korean human rights act visited north korea and called it deeply oppressive nation while attending human rights conference in seoul the escalated attacks were met with torrent of hostile responses from north korean sources at brief reconvening of the sixparty talks in november the counterfeiting issue became the main focus the north koreans insisted that the imposition of sanctions on macau bank for its alleged role in helping north korea launder counterfeit us dollars constituted hostile action that made implementation of the beijing joint statement impossible human rights on agenda criticism of north koreas human rights record became more prominent on the us agenda in 2005 jay lefkowitz was appointed as the special envoy for human rights in north korea position created by the north korean human rights act of 2004 his public statements on the situation facing refugees and north korean citizens paired with highprofile meeting in the white house between president bush and prominent north korean defector and author amplified the administrations concern about north koreas human rights record emphasizing this record drew attention to the gap between the united states and south korea in dealing with the norths human rights abuses in order to avoid provoking pyongyang seoul abstained from voting on resolutions condemning north korea at the united nations commission on human rights conference and the united nations general assembly meeting in 2005 crs3 counterfeiting issue takes center stage in addition to human rights north koreas criminal activities began receiving heightened attention in late 2005 in september american officials imposed penalties on banco delta asia macau bank that allegedly allowed the laundering of us dollars counterfeited by north korea noting the chilling effect on the sixparty talks some analysts question the timing of the announcement but treasury officials insist that the issue is lawenforcement activity and in way related to the multilateral negotiations south korea has distanced itself from the us accusations and reiterated its stance that raising such matters causes unnecessary friction with pyongyang and jeopardizes the resolution of the nuclear issue china warned by the united states to crack down on illegal north korean transaction in its banks has taken some steps to curb such activity but us officials say it is unclear how aggressively chinese authorities are moving beijing has also urged pyongyang not to use the issue as reason to boycott the sixparty talks in december the us treasury department also put out an advisory warning us financial institutions to be wary of financial relationships with north korea that could be exploited for the purposes of illicit activities north korea increases restrictions on foreign aid in august 2005 the north korean government announced it would longer need humanitarian assistance from the united nations including from the world food program wfp the primary channel for us food aid in response the wfp shut down its operations in december 2005 and the united states suspended its shipments of food aid north korea also asked all resident foreigners from the dozen or so aid ngos operating in pyongyang to leave the country in november 2005 pyongyang decided to reject aid from the european union eu after the eu proposed resolution on human rights in north korea part of pyongyangs motivation appears to be have been desire to negotiate less intrusive foreign presence particularly the wfps fairly extensive monitoring system officially the north korean government has attributed its decisions to an improved harvest the decline in wfp food shipments desire to end dependence on food assistance and its unhappiness with the united states and eus raising the human rights issue apparently north korea will continue to accept direct food shipments from south korea and china and many have accused these countries with undermining the wfps negotiating leverage with pyongyang china which provides all of its assistance directly to north korea is widely believed to have provided even more food than the united states since 2001 south korea has emerged as major provider of food assistance perhaps surpassing china in importance in some years almost 90 of seouls food shipments from 20012005 have been provided bilaterally to pyongyang notably china apparently does not monitor its food assistance and south korea has small monitoring system changes to us team in charge of north korea policy several key officials in charge of us policy toward north korea were reshuffled in 2005 critics of earlier us policy were optimistic that condoleezza crs4 rices confirmation as secretary of state in january would bring greater degree of coherence to us policy because of her reputation as one of president bushs most trusted confidantes us ambassador to south korea christopher hill career foreign service officer with reputation as strong negotiator was selected to be assistant secretary for east asia and the pacific as well as the chief envoy for the sixparty talks as rice began her post at the state department policy analysts studied her language for clues about the us approach to north korea during her confirmation hearing rice included north korea among the list of outposts of tyranny thereby appearing to signal tough approach to the north however her declaration during march swing through asia that north korea was sovereign state was interpreted as willingness to negotiate with pyongyang apparently operating with more authority than his predecessor hill engaged the north koreans in bilateral meetings and eventually in the sixparty talks two figures that appeared later in the year however were seen by many in the policy community as delivering more hardline message to the north koreans alexander vershbow the incoming us ambassador to south korea and jay lefkowitz special envoy for human rights in north korea see statements above northsouth cooperation intensifies pyongyangseoul relations though typically moving in fits and starts overall definitively advanced toward stronger cooperation major progress was achieved in developing the kaesong industrial zone an interkorean project of 15 south korean firms employing about 6000 north korean workers south korea started electricity flows to firms operating in the zone located in north korea territory north of the demilitarized zone dmz tourism numbers ballooned although all from south korea to north korea and only in controlled areas and interkorean trade topped 1 billion in 2005 ministerial talks the first in over year were held in june military hotline was established and variety of negotiations if not concrete results on joint river surveys fishing farming and transportation went forward significantly the south korean defense white paper decided not to label north korea as its main enemy and instead designated it as substantial military threat north korea demanded 500000 tons of fertilizer from the south but seoul officials only provided 200000 tons because of pyongyangs refusal to return to the sixparty talks tension in ussouth korea relations continues ties between washington and seoul were often strained by the capitals different approaches to north korea despite official declarations that they shared the same goal of eliminating north koreas nuclear weapons program through diplomatic process the roh administrations public embrace of framework aimed at balancing the nuclear issue with northsouth reconciliation contributed to the impression in many corners that south korea was asserting distinctly independent foreign policy stance sometimes at odds with stated us goals disagreement between the us military command in korea and the south korean defense ministry on the contingency plan known as oplan 5029 to respond to an internal crisis in north korea was diffused if not fully resolved despite these tensions presidents bush and roh held summits in june and november in which they reiterated their crs5 shared strategic goal but declined to work out tactical differences indicating need to strengthen the bilateral relationship the two leaders announced new strategic dialogue and the intention to move forward with possible free trade agreement fta negotiations at their meeting preceding the november asiapacific economic cooperation apec summit in busan korea chinas leadership asserted though the north korea nuclear issue remains unresolved china has burnished its leadership credentials as host of the process beijing was praised as an effective broker and drafter of the breakthrough joint statement issued at the fourth round of sixparty talks as the party viewed with having the most leverage over pyongyang china was called upon to reengage north korea after the february 10 announcement that it possessed nuclear weapons beijing officials have carefully timed their high level visits to the koreas with an eye on balancing their interests with both chinese president hu jintaos visit to pyongyang in october highlighted the consolidation of strong political and economic relations between the nations and provided significant counterweight to his visit to seoul for the apec summit the following month many analysts view chinas strategy as largely successful in serving its national interests avoiding major diplomatic crises preventing the collapse of north korea strengthening its economic relations with south korea deflecting potential us criticism on other issues such as human rights because of its leverage over north korea and enhancing its own reputation as major diplomatic power history issue hurts japans relations with neighbors apart from the dynamics surrounding the onagain offagain sixparty talks historical issues continued to simmer in northeast asia generally at japans expense early in the year dispute over the historical claims to the tokdotakeshima islands set of small uninhabited rocks now controlled by south korea erupted between seoul and tokyo most observers saw the controversy as inflamed by domestic politics on both sides as result relatively minor issue derailed major diplomatic initiatives japanese prime minister koizumis fifth visit to the yasukuni shrine in october prompted outraged responses from both beijing and seoul and both canceled upcoming summits with tokyo in protest japans attempts at moving the normalization process forward with north korea also faltered the appointment of taro aso as foreign minister and shinzo abe as chief cabinet secretary both known as conservative figures who support the yasukuni visits was viewed by many in the region as an indication of japans drift toward the right regional leaders voiced opposition to japans bid for permanent place on the united nations security council on the whole japans relations with the region declined as longstanding historical resentments and ascendant suspicions of japans intentions hurt bilateral relationships with its neighbors usjapan relations meanwhile continued to advance as leaders announced major revamping of the military alliance that calls for japan to take more active role in contributing to regional stability crs6 contact outside of the administration north korea continued to allow periodic visits by nonadministration officials and specialists some observers viewed the receptions as part of pyongyangs strategy of creating divisions and distractions within the us policy community in january representative curt weldon led congressional delegation to pyongyang after trying to assure senior north korean officials that the united states was sincere about wanting to peacefully resolve the nuclear weapons issue weldon reported back that north korea was ready to rejoin the sixparty talks he also revealed that the north koreans claimed to have nuclear weapons claim that later

his proengagement views and impressed upon him that pyongyang was unwilling to dismantle its nuclear weapons program until the united states moved to normalize relations this message from the north koreans reinforced their repeated demand that they receive assurances and assistance at the front end of any exchange while the united states maintained that any deal was predicated on first the elimination of all nuclear programs in north korea stanford university professor john lewis and former alamos national lab director sig hecker also visited pyongyang and delivered messages about the
