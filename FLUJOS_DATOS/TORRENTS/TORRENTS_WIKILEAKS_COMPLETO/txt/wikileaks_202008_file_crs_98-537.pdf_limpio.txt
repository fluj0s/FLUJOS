government control but is not completely autonomous until new liberalized investment policy was announced in november 1997 pakistan restricted foreign bank branching and business with stateowned corporations7 lack of definitions in section 102b prohibition on bank loans the language in section 102b respecting bank loans is unadorned8 as recently amended it reads the united states government shall prohibit any united states bank from making any loan or providing any cred it to the government of that country except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities which includes fertilizer although this provision was enacted in 1994 treasury has not issued any implementing regulations it apparently has adopted pol icy of waiting until the president invokes sanctions against par ticular country to address each countrys individual situation9 as is customary when economic sanctions are invoked under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98537crs4 9continued on sanctions in us policy undersecretary of state stuart eizenstat referred to section 102b as in some respects very vague act ma ny of the committee members were concerned about the impact on people in the united states and in the subject countries as well as on the deterrent effect the undersecretary referred to the process of drafting the regulations as involving mitigating the impact on us business and workers 1050 usc 1701 1706 11under ieepa the president issues an ex ecutive order invoking the sanctions and delegates to the department of the treasury implementation authority with respect to economic sanctions at that point regula tions are developed this process may be lengthy for example it was not until may 21 1998 that final rules were published implementing executive order 13047 of may 20 1997 prohibiting new investment in burma 63 federal register 27846 1998 1255 federal register 33091 33092 august 13 1990 1356 federal register 2113 1991international emergency ec onomic powers act ieepa10 in that case after the presidents order treasury issues regulations to be administered by the office of foreign assets control these regulations specifically apply the sanction to the institutional structure of the targeted country11 to illustrate the process by which an order is refined into regulations one might examine the sanctions against iraq wh on august 9 1990 president bush invoked ieepa to sanction iraq the directive ex ecutive order 12724 generally prohibited any commitment or transfer direct or indirect of funds or other financial or economic resources by any united states person to the government of iraq or any other person in iraq12 the president therefore had decided to impose broad economic sanctions against not only the government of iraq but also any person in iraq this of course is distinguishable from the present situation where the law itself mandates broad prohibition on bank loans to government the regulations implementing the iraq sanctions however do illustrate the issues that the drafters of the india regulations will face the iraq regulations issued on january 18 199113 contained an intricate definition of th term government of iraq which if applied to india would mean closure for us branches operating there that definition was the term government of iraq includes the state and the government of iraq as well as any political subdivision agency or in strumentality thereof including the central bank of iraq b any partnership associa tion corporation or other organization substantially owned or controlled by the foregoing c any person to the extent that such person is or has been or to the extent that there is reasonable cause to believe that such person is or has been since the effec tive date acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of any of the foregoing andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98537crs5 1431 cfr 575306 15the foreign sovereign immunities act applies to foreign states and determines whether to differentiate an agency or instrumentality of the state as being subject to jurisdiction based on whether the core functions of that entity are govern mental in nature the statute has an exception by which jurisdiction is denied over suits based upon commercial activity carried on by the foreign state 28 usc 1605a2 in republic of argentina v weltover inc 504 us 607 1992 the supreme court held argentina subject to suit to recover on bonds called bonads issued through its central bank under progra m whereby the government had assumed the risk associated with crossborder currency transa ctions to reach the decision the court distinguished between government as market regulator and as player in the market the issuance of the bonds of public debt instruments was held to be commercial activity and was seen to be similar to issuance of debt instruments by private partiesd any other person or organiza tion determined by the director of the office of foreign assets control to be included within this section14 nowhere in section 102b is definiti on given for the term government with respect to the country against which the sanctions are to operate how broadly or narrowly that term is defined by the implementing regulations is critical for example will the statecontrolled central bank be included in the definition will banks in which the state holds 51 equity be covered how will staatecontrolled and owned development banks be handled how will state controlled corporations engaged in international trade be treated will treasur distinguish between governmental entities acting or performing sovereign functions from governmentowned or controlled entities performing commercial functions one approach that has been suggested is to limit sanctions to indian or paki stani governmental operations that are performing sovereign functions rather than commercial or proprietary ones the foreign sovereign immunities act 28 usc 1601 1611 by which foreign states are subject to us court jurisdiction for commercial but not governme ntal functions may pr ovide an analytical framework for making such distinctions15 section 102b does not defi ne united states bank does it mean only us commercial banks or does it in clude development banks does it include branches of indian banks operating in the united states does it include securities firms section 102b does not define making an loan or providing any credit to the government of the sanctioned country how w ill treasury treat the required investment in republic of india currency and obligations imposed upon branches of us banks doing business in india how will it treat currency swaps involving indian currency what will be the treatment of sales and exchanges of securities that have already been issued by the republic of india what distinctions will be drawn with respect to banking transactions facilitating indias purchases of exempt co mmodities such as food and agricultural products what rules will pply to interbank loans depos its and clearing of negotiable instruments will there be exceptions for interbank clearances of checks and payment settlements that may result in overnight debit balances section 102b does not designate an agency to enforce the bank loan sanctions this raises the question of whether the office of foreign assets control at treasury or the federal reserve board will be designated with that authority arguments in favor of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98537crs6 latter include its familia rity with the banks involved and its distance from any presidential administration there also may be the per ception that federal reserve board oversight would bring more flexibility conclusion absent mechanism in section 102b fo r terminating or spending sanction legislation appears to be th only way of lifting sanctions once imposed in the case of the sanctions against india and pakistan under the indianpakis tan relief act of 1998 p l 105277 tit ix 901 congress authoriz ed presidential waiver for period of up to one year the president used this authority to waive the sanctions until october 21 1999
