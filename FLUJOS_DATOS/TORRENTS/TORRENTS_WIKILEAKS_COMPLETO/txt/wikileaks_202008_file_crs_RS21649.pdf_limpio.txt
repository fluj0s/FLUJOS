17 2003 richard grasso resi gned as chairman of the new york stock exchange nyse after public uproar over his 1875 million pay package although grasso is not charged with any violation of law or other wrongdoing many see his compensation as symptomatic of fundamental problems in nyse governance regulation and operations numerous re form proposals are under discussion both within the nyse among regulators and in congress first the nyse has proposed to restructure its board of directors to exclude representatives of the securities industry second some see conflict of interest in the nyses role as selfregulatory organization is its responsibility to enfor ce trading rules compromised by its devotion to its members financial interests finally the nyse is the last major stock market where most orders are executed by humans on trading floor rather than matched by computers would public inve stors benefit if the exchange or its regulators made reforms in market structure to foster competition with the nyses electronic rivals as the worlds largest stock exchange nd key part of the us economy the nyse is central focus of congresss oversig ht of financial mark ets in october 2003 the house financial services and senate banking committees held hearings on market structure and the future of the securities industry further hearings are planned this report sets out the basic issues in nyse governance and market structure and will be updated as events warrant nyse governance the new york stock exchange nyse is membership organization chartered as nonprofit corporation member s range from the largest wall street firms to specialized brokers who conduct all their bus iness on the exchange floor the nyse is also regulated at the federal level by the securities and exchange commission sec which has broad oversight powers including the authority to modify abrogate or require the nyse to adopt any rule it sees fit nyse management thus answers to two sets of masters its membership of profitseeking firms and individuals to whom it is source of revenue and its government overseers the sec and congress who view it almost as publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21649crs2 utility whose fair and orderly operation is essential both to millions of public investors and to companies that sell stock and bonds to raise capital to create wealth and jobs like most private corporations the nyse is run by professiona l managers who serve at the pleasure of board of directors memb ership of the board of directors is divided between the nyses two major constituencies before the reform proposals now under consideration the board cons isted of 12 members from the securities industry generally the heads of major wall street firms or nyse floor brokers and specialists 12 from outside the industry who include ceos of ma jor corporations dir ectors of pension funds and other institutional investors and other prominent individuals and three members of nyse management including the ceo who serves as chairman of the board because the board is responsible for hiring and comp ensating the ceo it was the first target of reform proposals following the grasso resignation on november 5 2003 the nyse unveiled propos for restructured board the new board would be composed of six to tw elve independent members representatives from the securities industry would serve as di rectors the board of directors would appoint board of executives consisting of about 20 representatives of brokerdealers floor traders institutional investors and listed companies the board of executives would act in an advisory capacity the board of directors would have full control over the regulatory budget auditing executive hiri ng and compensation and the nomination of directors the proposal must be approved by the nys membership vote has been set for november 18 2003 to approve both the restru cturing and an initial slate of eight directors only two of whom currently sit on the board the sec must also approve in statement on november 5 2003 the sec indi cated that it approved of the proposal but that it might seek additional reforms the proposal would address some of the more salient concerns raised by the grasso affair compensation of nyse executives w ould longer be set by those whom the exchange is supposed to regulate suspici ons that the nyse puts the interests of its members ahead of its duty to public investor s might be allayed so mewhat however to the extent that governance problems at the nyse are judged to be severe there are apparent limits to the effectiveness of board restructuring as in private corporations the nyse board must leave daytoday operations to management to critics of the nyse the cause of the exchanges problems lies deeper they see intractable conflicts of interest in the concept of selfregulati on can an association of inte nsely profitdriven individuals and firms be expected to enforce rules for th protection of public investors who are their customers but sometimes also their co mpetitors in cutthroat marketplacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21649crs3 1 trading ahead or frontrunni ng

in fiscal year 2002selfregulation selfregulation the principle that the securities markets ought to bear large part of the responsibility and cost of regulating themselves s been cornerstone of us stock market regulation since the enactment of the basic federal securities laws and the creation of the securities and exchange co mmission sec in the 1930s under law and sec regulation stock exchanges are selfregu latory organizations sros charged with adopting and enforcing rules to maintain fair and orderly trading to some this seems like foxes guarding the henhouse the ideal of market regulation is to prot ect public investors and put them on level playing field with market insiders but the current market price of an nyse membership or seat is nearly 2 million in addition to income from sales commissions and fees for various services nyse members earn substa ntial revenues from trading for their own accounts conflicts of interest may arise from the fact that public investors trading in the markets are not only nyse members clients but sometimes their competition as well from this perspective recent allegations that nyse firms have profited illegally by trading ahead of their public customers and that the sec had to prod the nyses investigation come as surprise1 arguments like these about the inherent flaws in sel fregulation were heard in the 1930s still congress chose the system nd has since expanded it common view would be that of sec chairman william d onaldson who observed that selfregulation has worked pretty well despite some hiccups through the years2 there is widespread agreement that sel fregulation has some advantages over direct government regulation govern ment securities regulation has been likened to buzzsaw sometimes the proper tool but other times less effective than the surgeons scalpel of selfregulation3 in an area where shades of gray must be taken into account sros can set ethical standards for private market participants an activity difficult or inappropriate for government by handling significan t portion of enforcement cases themselves sros reduce the expense to the government of maintaining large enforcement staff4 finally sec enforcement tends to be reactive and afterthef act none of the worst market scandals of the past decade the nasdaq price fixing scheme the postenron accounting frauds or the corruption of stock analysts was first uncovered by the sec the sros record in these three episode s is better unfortunatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21649crs4 5 see crs report rs21193 nasdaqs pursuit of exchange status and an initial public offering by gary shorter 6 national association of securities dealers inc report of the nasd select committee on structure and governance to th nasd board of governors 1995 3 vin short abandoning selfregulation entir ely is minority position however some argue that selfregulation on the nyse could be strengthened by separating the regulatory and enforcement apparatus from the compe titive market operation the model here is nasdaq which was spun off from its parent company and sro the national association of securities dealers nasd following the ex posure of widespread price fixing in 1994 an autonomous regulatory unit nasd regu lation inc was created and the nasdaq market began transition not yet comp lete into forprofit stockholderowned corporation5 the analogy between nasdaq in 1995 and th nyse today is imperfect the nasdaq scandal involved many of that markets largest dealers and its most heavilytraded stocks for several years public invest ors routinely received inferior prices the investigation of nyse specialists involves lleged abuses on much sma ller scale the problem may not be systemic as nasdaqs clearly was blueribbon investigation into nasd and nasdaq headed by senator warren rudman found that the governing structure was extremely cumbersome in part because co mmittees representing small groups of traders were able to obstruct reforms6 it is possible but not certain that insulating the nyse regulators from the profit seeking traders would result in more vigo rous enforcement and oversight critical question is how the sro is to be funded if it becomes separate entity moreover if the enforcement function distances itself from the market it might lose the advantages of an sro and become weaker duplicate of the sec market structure some critics of the nyse including its competitors view issues of governance and selfregulation as outward symptoms of an underlying problem the nyses real problem in this view is that it clings to an obsolete trading model that benefits its members at the expense of public investors the nyse trading floor where traders buy and sell in an auction market whose basic framework is two centuries old supported of course by vast array of electronics is seen as expensive and inefficient several versions of computerized screenbased trading offer competition to the trading floor most major stock market s around the world have abandoned facetoface trading in the united states computerized trading was pioneered by nasdaq in the 1970s and 1980s and refined in the 1990s by new set of computerized exchanges called electronic communications networ ks or ecns the basic concept of an ecn is to take full advantage of increases in computer speed and technol ogy to handle the billions of shares that change hands daily in us ma rkets offers to buy and sell are matchedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21649crs5 7 for general background on ecns see crs report rl30602 the electronic stock market

the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets oct 16 2003 p 2 10 breakdown by source is available at httpwwwnysedatacomfactbookmainasp 11 see eg robert greifeld op c it on subpenny trading quotes priced in increments smaller than one cent are invisible to some market participants electronically and often executed instantly7 in contrast to the thousands employed by the nyse an ecn handling similar volume might have staff of few dozen the ecns now handle over half the tradin g volume in stocks listed on the nasdaq market but only about 5 of nyse volume why the discrepancy the nyse argues that its floorbased trading system produces superior prices that orders sent to the specialists on the floor are often filled at pr ices better than the publicly quoted price or inside the spread this price improveme nt disappears when the trading mechanism does nothing but match ffers to buy and sell the ecns counter that regulatory barri ers act to preserve the nyses monopoly in its own listed shares specifically the trade through rule which mandates that orders in shares listed on an exchange be sent to the registered exchanges that make up the intermarket trading system and exposed th ere for minimum of 30 seconds in search of price improvement8 this rule may sound innocuous to the layman but nyse rivals complain of an eternity of seconds which negates primary advantage of ecn trading speed of execution9 it is difficult to evaluate the competing claims of execution quality and speed market liquidity and so on proponents of various ma rket models have st rong financial stakes in the outcome of the debate the results of independent empirical studies are mixed and the markets continue to evolve rapidly in the long run the ecn market model ma offer significant economies for traders and investors nyse member firms that do business with the public had gross revenues of 1487 billion in 200210 in an age of cheap computing power this may simply be too high price for intermediary services in the short run stions remain about the ecn trading model how will it perform in market crash what are the effects on price setting mechanisms and market liquidity of dispersing trading among many market centers can the ecn model support vigor ous selfregulation nd market oversight while ecn order handling systems may prevent certain trading abuses seen on traditional exchanges what new forms of abuse could emerge11 to the unhappiness of some but the satisf action of others the sec has moved very slowly to address funda mental market structure issues in 1997 the sec issued rules that brought ecns into the mainstream of trad ing of nasdaq shares and allowed them to increase their share of market volume recent testimony does not suggest that the sec plans to sweep away the barriers that are said to keep ecns from handling significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21649crs6 12 testimony before the subcommittee on securities and investment senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs oct 15 2003 13 pursuant to the securities acts amendments of 1975volumes of trades in nyselisted stocks on october 15 2003 sec chairman william donaldson before the senate banking s ubcommittee on securities took note of the limited access to the nyse the existing co mpulsory markettomarket linkage in stocks the intermarket trading system its applies only to nyse and amex stocks and in the view of many has been less than successful in overcoming obstacles to providing effective intermarket access12 at the same time how ever he endorsed the existence of separate market structures i firmly believe our system of multiple competing markets on balance has worked remarkably well we have the worlds most competitive and efficient markets legislation bearing directly on market structure is before the 108th congress the sec has authority under existing statutes to direct the nyse and ot her sros to modify any of their rules and thus can effect changes in trading mechanisms or exchange governance by regulation continuing congre ssional interest evidenced by hearings and other oversight activities is driven by concerns about fair ness to public investors and the efficiency and competitiveness of us financial markets and the existing statutory mandate that the sec facilitate the development of national market system for trading
