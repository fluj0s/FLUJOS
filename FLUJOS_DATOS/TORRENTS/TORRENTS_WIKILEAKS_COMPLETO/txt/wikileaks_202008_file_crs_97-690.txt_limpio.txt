russian military bases remain under 15year accord signed in 1997 russia further ramped up its security presence in september 2003 with the signing of 15year basing accord with kyrgyzstan for use of the sovietera kant airfield near the capital of bishkek and near ganci the russian troops ostensibly also form part of cst rapid deployment force although the purpose of the base purportedly is to combat regional terrorism and defend cis borders it also appears aimed at countering us and nato influence the cis antiterrorist center body created at former russian president vladimir putins urging to facilitate cooperation between intelligence agencies of the memberstates set up regional branch in bishkek after september 11 2001 kyrgyzstans armed forces number about 10900 active ground and air

other groups from tajikistan invaded kyrgyzstan in julyaugust 1999 they allegedly aimed to create an islamic state as springboard for jihad in uzbekistan another possible aim may have been to secure

kyrgyzstan others invaded uzbekistan uzbekistan provided air and other support and kyrgyz forces defeated the guerrillas by late october 2000 in 2002 and 2003 the imu allegedly set off bombs in

designated the imu as foreign terrorist organization in september 2000 political and economic developments february 2005 legislative election and march runoff resulted in opposition candidates winning less than 10 of seats although there reportedly were many close races where they lost only by few votes the us state department judged the crs5 election as somewhat improved over previous ones but still falling seriously short of democratic standards opposition partyled protestors called for new election and then president akayevs resignation and they occupied several local government buildings including in the southern city of osh when they stormed presidential offices in bishkek on march 24 2005 akayev fled the country some observers hailed this coup as the third socalled democratic revolution in eurasia after those in georgia and ukraine and the first in central asia they suggested that the country because of its slightly wider scope of civil liberties compared to the rest of central asia might lead the region in democratic reforms other observers cautioned that governmental corruption and institutional weakness would make it difficult for kyrgyzstan to easily democratize opposition politician and acting president kurmanbek bakiyev received 8871 of about 20 million votes in 7person presidential election held on july 10 2005 the osce stated that fundamental civil and political rights were generally respected but it raised concerns about problematic vote tabulation in november and december 2006 conflict between the executive and legislative branches over the balance of powers resulted in the passage of successive constitutions with president bakiyev appearing to lose and then win back some presidential powers in late september 2007 the probakiyev constitutional court invalidated all constitutional changes since the adoption of the 2003 constitution bakiyev announced few days later that he was setting up and supporting new political party the ak dzhol peoples party he then pushed through snap referendum in october 2007 on draft constitution an advisory body to the council of europe the venice commission assessed the draft as placing an excessive concentration of power in the hands of the president5 the day after the referendum was held bakiyev dissolved the legislature and set new elections for december 16 2007 move many observers viewed as preventing opposition parties from carrying out effective campaigns during the short period of time twelve parties were registered for the december 2007 election the new constitution established 90seat legislature elected by party lists new election law stated that party could not win seats unless it received 5 or more of the vote of all registered voters another provision stated that party could not win seats unless it gained at least 05 of the vote in each region this provision did not specify how the percentage was to be calculated leading to controversy that was eventually settled by supreme court decision after the election the cec announced that ak dzhol had won 71 seats the social democratic party had won 11 seats and the communist party had won 8 seats but that ata mekan had been disqualified based on the 05 rule in its final report on the election observers from the osce assessed the race as failing to meet number of osce commitments the elections were missed opportunity falling short of public expectations for the further consolidation of the democratic election process the observers assessed the organization of the count as bad or very bad in 33 per cent of polling stations observed with implications for transparency and 5 the european commission for democracy through law venice commission opinion on the constitutional situation in the kyrgyz republic december 17 2007 in may 2008 bakiyev argued that strong presidency was needed to prevent the country from descending into clan and regionbased civil war crs6 accountability of the process although the observers fell short in declaring the results invalid they stated that there were serious irregularities and inconsistencies in vote counting and that there was questionable consistency between reported preliminary and final results6 according to the us state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2007 released on march 11 2008 kyrgyz police and security forces at times employed torture beat detainees and prisoners to extract confessions and used false charges to arrest persons and solicit bribes for their release police corruption was major problem but the

assaulting journalists and vandalizing property and restricted freedom of assembly by harassing ngos labor unions and political parties human trafficking remained persistent problem and victims

assistance to victims the country was source transit and to lesser degree destination for trafficked persons kyrgyz gdp reportedly grew 82 in 2007 but increasing prices for food and energy imports
