also see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressi onal budget process by james v saturno 4 mandatory spending also referred to as direct spending is provided mainly in substantive law under the jurisdiction of the legi slative committees in contrast to discretionary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees most direct spending programs are entitlements such as social security medicare federal civilian and military retirement and unemployment compensationoverview of the budget reconciliation process the congressional budget act of 1974 established the congressional budget process1 under the act the house and senate are required to adopt at least one budget resolution each year and have done so except for fy1999 fy2003 and fy20052 the budget resolution which takes th form of concurrent resolution and is not sent to the president for his approval or veto serves as congressional statement in broad terms regarding appropriate revenue spending and debtlimit policies as well as guide to the subsequent consideration of legislation implementing such policies at agency and programmatic levels budget resolution policies are enforced through variety of mechanisms including points of order3 the house and senate budget committees which were created by the 1974 act exercise exclusive jurisdiction over budget resolutions and are responsible for monitoring their enforcement in developing budget resolution the h ouse and senate budget committees use various sources of budgetary informa tion and analysis including baseline budget projections of revenue spe nding and the deficit or surplus prepared by the congressional budget office cbo budget resolution typically reflects many different assumptions regarding legislative action expected to occur during session that would cause revenue nd spending levels to be changed from baseline amounts most revenue and ma ndatory spending4 however occurs automatically each year under permanent law therefore if the committees with jurisdiction over the revenue and mandatory spending programs do not report legislation to carry out the budget resolution policies by amending existing w revenue and manda tory spending for these programs likely will continue w ithout change there are some notable exceptions to the permanency of revenue and mandatory spending laws such as many of the tax cuts proposed by presiden t george w bush and enacted in 2001 and 2003 discretionary spending on the other hand is provided annually in regular supplemental and continuing appropriations acts the house and senate therefore are assured an opportunity each year to cons ider discretionary spending within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33132crs4 5 see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr for more information on the processcontext of budget resolution policies th enforcement of budget resolution policies regarding discretionary spending relies for the most part on the ability to raise points of order against individual appropriations acts that violate the suballocations of discretionary spending made pursuant to section 302b of the 1974 act the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process5 the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue spending and debtlimit levels in to conformity with the policies of the budget resolution under the reconciliati on process the hous and senate may compel their committees to develop legislation changing existing law accordingly reconciliation can be potent budget enfor cement tool for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process first reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directin g the appropriate co mmittees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetar outcomes if the budget resolution instructs more than one committee in chamber then the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget reso lution the budget committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliati on bill without making any substantive revisions the second step involves consideration of the resultant reconc iliation legislation by the house and senate unde r expedited procedures among other things debate in the senate on any r econciliation measure is limite d to 20 hours and 10 hours on conference report and amendments must be germane and not include extraneous matter the house rules committee typically recommends special rule for the consideration of reconcilia tion measure in the house th at places restrictions on debate time and the offering of amendments in cases where only one committee has been instructed the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber thus bypassing the budget committee in some years budget resolutions included reconciliation instructions that afforded the house and senate the option of considering two or more different reconciliation bills once the reconciliation legislation called for in the budget resolu tion has been approved or vetoed by the president the process is concluded c ongress cannot develop another reconciliation bill in the wake of veto without first adopting another budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions as an optional procedure reconciliation has not been used in every year that the congressional budget process has been in effect beginning with the first use of reconciliation by both the house and nate in 1980 however reconciliation has been used in most years congress has sent the president 19

been considered by the other chamber or been regarded as reconciliation measure when considered by the other chamber in 2000 for example the house considered and passed several reconciliation measures but they were not considered by the senate6 initial actions under reconciliation fo cused on deficitreduction efforts consequently the procedures were employ ed to achieve spending reductions and revenue increases on net basis in the latter part of the 1990s particularly when large surpluses emerged in the federal budget for the first time in decades the focus of reconciliation action was

tain durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs and section 5101b provi des for 36month period for oxygen equipment37 apparently due to clerical rror the engrossed senate amendment mistakenly referred to 36 month period in section 5101 which the house agreed to without correction in the course of enrolling the measure for the president the erroneous reference to 36 month period in the
