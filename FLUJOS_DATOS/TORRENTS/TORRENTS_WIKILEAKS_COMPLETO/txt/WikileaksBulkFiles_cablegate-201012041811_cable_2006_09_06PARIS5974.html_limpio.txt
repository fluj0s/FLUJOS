who might change france classified by ambassador craig stapleton for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c eight months before frances 2007 presidential election interior minister nicholas sarkozy remains the best positioned of the many contenders for frances presidency he is markedly different presidential heavyweight proamerican and committed to freemarket principles notwithstanding his evident strengths and popularity many french voters are still uncomfortable with the idea of president sarkozy and questions about his hyperactive personality his core lawandorder agenda and divisions within the ruling ump make his election far from certain sarkozys gaullist political heritage and his likely i can speak frankly to the americans refrain mean that france and sarkozy would remain an independent and challenging ally however sarkozy presidency would certainly bring new and welcome tone to usfrench relations and perhaps over time french approach to world problems that is less fixated on reflexively seeking ways to distinguish france from the us sarkozys greatest contribution to france could be his promise to free the countrys latent economic dynamism from the constraints of statism and labor rigidity end summary timeline to the election 2 u eight months ahead of the first round of frances 2007 presidential election to be held on either sunday april 15 or sunday april 22 2007 interior minister and president of the centerright union for popular movement party ump nicolas sarkozy remains the best positioned of the many contenders in the last presidential election in 2002 there were 16 candidates in the first round slightly fewer are expected this time around the second round runoff between the top two votegetters of the first round will be held two weeks later either sunday april 29 or sunday may 6 sarkozy has served as interior minister in the government of prime minister dominique villepin since that governments inception in june 2005 in january 2007 tentatively scheduled for january 1415 the ump will hold party congress expected to designate sarkozy the party leader as its presidential candidate shortly before that congress sarkozy may well leave the government to dedicate himself fulltime to pursuing the presidency in recent weeks sarkozy has been careful to signal that he is keeping all his options open in this connection pointing out that nothing prevents him from remaining in the government while he pursues the presidency sarkozy himself will make the final decision and will not hesitate to ignore the advice of others as he did when he chose to rejoin the government in june 2005 the best positioned contender 3 c ever since his first tenure as interior minister 2002 2004 when he emerged as toptier national political figure sarkozy has been highly popular with large segment of the french electorate the most recent polling figures show that popularity holding steady sarkozys unchallenged control of the union for popular movement ump party which was founded by president chirac also increases his election chances sarkozy has worked to turn the ump into formidable electoral machine complete with focus groups for keeping his message tuned to voters concerns and volunteer organizations for turning out the sarkozyforpresident vote since he became president of the party in 2004 sarkozy has also increased the number of party members from 100000 to 250000 today this political organization gives sarkozy powerful advantage and should ensure his presence in the second round of the election moreover sarkozy is formidable campaigner energetic quick on his feet and appealingly direct the combination of popularity control of his party and masterful political skills including as campaigner is unmatched by any of the other presidential contenders different kind of presidential heavyweight 4 c sarkozy is hard to pigeonhole he is not traditional french conservative which is clear from some of his policy proposals sarkozy often speaks of the need for france to break with policies and attitudes that undercut the paris 00005974 0022 of 004 countrys economic dynamism sarkozy has long called for lower taxes and more liberal ie freemarket economic policies to encourage entrepreneurship he has also long called for less regulated environment for big business something of novelty in country in which both left and right have always been comfortable with high level of government regulation of the economy the untested popularity of sarkozys freemarket orientation helps explain why few commentators at this stage are ready to hazard firm prediction on the outcome of the 2007 election other than to affirm that presuming candidates of the centerleft and of the centerright compete in the second round it will be exceedingly close sarkozy himself has indicated to us on numerous occasions that the election will be 51 49 sarkozy is well aware of the resistance in france to shrinking the role of the state in protecting the economic security of both individuals and businesses 5 c sarkozys proposals in the field of social policy for example affirmative action in employment and education for immigrants who are discriminated against and limited voting rights for noncitizen residents are not policies traditionally associated with the right of the political spectrum in france sarkozys proposals for reforming french government institutions making the president answerable to the legislature and responsible for the domestic policies of the government while giving the legislature more oversight over frances foreign policy also break the mold of traditional centerright french gaullism most of all sarkozy is associated with tough firm enforcement of anticrime and counterterrorism measures doubts about president sarkozy 6 c sarkozy is also perceived as different kind of political personality recent polls point to the austere gaulle and the imperturbable mitterrand as by far the most revered of french presidents that the edgy intense handson sarkozy is so far from the preferred model of olympian reserve raises the question of whether as matter of cultural psychology the french are ready to entrust the presidency to sarkozy clearly many french people recognize that new model is needed presidency that directs and is responsible for domestic policy especially given the new shorter fiveyear presidential term the iconoclastic sarkozy has the most extensive experience and strongest credentials for filling that role the french however are also famously hesitant to embrace change and in time of apprehension and selfdoubt could prefer more traditional and reassuring figure some also fear sarkozy presidency citing his hyperactive personality and persisting factional splits within his own party and his polarizing image as lawandorder strongman electorally sarkozys lawandorder image is potentially the most significant it is this hardedged profile that makes sarkozy divisive more than unifying figure generating intense allegiance on the right and equally strongly unsettling so many on the left and even the center of the political spectrum proamerican at heart but still french gaullist 7 c sarkozy for french politician is forceful and unabashed about the need for france to get beyond its antiamerican reflexes with the exception of his reservations about the wisdom of the us invasion of iraq in 2003 sarkozy is the french political leader most supportive of the us role in the world sarkozy has told the ambassador on several occasions that france needs to help the us get out of iraq sarkozys proamerican orientation has earned him the sobriquet sarkozy the american and his affinity for americans and the us is genuine and heartfelt sarkozys admiration for the us comes through in one of his favorite stories when as young boy he told father that he wanted to be president his father told him in that case with name like sarkozy youd better immigrate to america the young nicolas replied that he wanted to become president of france not the us sarkozy has always wanted to make france land of equal opportunity for immigrants also 8 c sarkozys proamericanism however should not be interpreted as meaning that gaullist insistence on frances and the eus independence from the us in the international arena will disappear frances selective paris 00005974 003 of 004 support for us positions will continue nor will sarkozy likely abandon frances traditional preference for strengthening the eu over nato in the name of transatlantic rapprochement as sarkozy told visiting congressional delegation last year we should never forget that we are loyal friends and that friends can disagree although sarkozy feels close to america to this day he recalls with fondness his discovery of america as an international visitors program grantee in 1985 his assertive personality is such that as frances president he would not shy away from offering firm advice about how the us might best advance towards shared goals up to and including bald advice to change course even so what sarkozy would call the loyalty factor in his friendship toward the us would remain intact and sarkozys articulate public defense of that attitude could over time result in greater french receptivity to americas global outlook and policy positions especially if extended over twoterm tenyear presidency the result could be france less resentful of the us one less reflexively inclined to taking positions that intensify and highlight frances differences with the us sarkozys freemarket convictions could transform france 9 c sarkozys greatest contribution to france could be in freeing the countrys latent economic dynamism from the constraints of statism and labor rigidity sarkozy has since the beginning of his long career in politics been among the most outspokenly liberal that is profreemarket of french political leaders his speeches on economic and social issues nearly invariably include paeans to commerce hard work and entrepreneurship followed by an exhortation to frenchmen and women to be proud of these qualities sarkozy would like to make the french more liberal than they are and believes economic forces acting on france justify his endeavor sarkozy often underlines the inescapability of the global market and exhorts the french to accept the challenges of competing in it with greater selfconfidence he is adept at depicting in ways that ordinary voters understand the drag on opportunity and growth of bloated state intent on monitoring nearly every aspect of economic life 10 c at the same time sarkozy understands that the french want to be protected and that they are comfortable with high degree of state involvement in the economy the current controversy over the privatization and merger involving the national gas company gdf and the energy giant suez exemplifies the persisting sensitivity of loosening state control over the economy in france sarkozys record he is above all pragmatic politician as liberalizing policy practitioner is quite mixed for example during his tenure as finance minister marchnovember 2004 when confronted by labor union resistance to significant privatization of state utilities sarkozy compromised he worked hard and offered government assistance to keep factories threatened with closure operating in france spurred by public complaints about rising prices in supermarkets he negotiated voluntary price controls with major chains he practiced patriotic liberalism in helping engineer the merger of large french pharmaceutical company aventis with larger french pharmaceutical firm sanofi rather than with sanofis foreign rival the swiss firm novartis by and large the public approved sarkozys protectionist actions 11 c it remains to be seen whether economic reform will be decisive issue in the upcoming presidential campaign comment if the current trend of economic growth and reduced unemployment continues this is less likely to be the case end comment if it does emerge as the key campaign issue and if victorious sarkozy moves early and aggressively to effect reform then he could push the french past the tipping point and into farreaching and necessary restructuring of the french social model an ambitious sarkozy reform program would likely include for example measures to further loosen the currently mandated 35hour workweek measures to reduce wealth and inheritance taxes to encourage longterm investment in family firms measures to restructure unemployment and welfare benefits so they act as incentives to find work quickly and measures to reform the university system so it provides students with the skills the job market requires from them the result could be society in which entrepreneurship selfreliance and optimism would be more paris 00005974 004 of 004 highly valued and in which competition could coexist with the cherished notion of equality such changes could release the latent economic creativity and dynamism of the french who by and large are highly skilled and hardworking but it will be tall order 12 c in sarkozy who harbors more americalike vision for france the moment might well meet the man ushering in an era of higher economic growth and innovation in france such an economically revitalized france would cohere neatly with sarkozys fundamentally gaullist principles renewed economic vitality would bolster both frances ambitions to lead in europe and to play major role in international affairs please visit paris
