communications and economic growth in the judgment of most expe rts in order to tap fully the potential of these new technologies it is also genera lly agreed that legislatures will need to confront and resolve many difficult technical and legal policy issues the scope ofcopyright protection and any limitations on the rights of copyright owners for the use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments was addressed by the105 th congress in enacting the digital mille nnium copyright act dmca pl 105 3041 the digital millennium copyright act is the outcome of several years of congressional consideration of copyright policy issues relating to domesticdevelopment of the national information in frastructure once called the information superhighway now referred to as the int ernet and to international development of two new intellectual property treaties working group on intellectual property of the white house national information infrastructure nii task force convened series of conferences exploring the copyright policy issues relating to the nii their september 1995report led to the introduction in the 104 th congress of s 1284 and hr 2441 which would have implemented the working groups recommendations2 hearings were held on the nii copyright policy issues but the bills were not enacted at the international level two new in tellectual property treaties were created by diplomatic conference of states in geneva switzerland on december 20 1996 under the auspices of the world intellect ual property organization wipo these are the wipo copyright treaty

report 97444 and d schrader world intellectual property organization performances and pho nograms t reaty an overview crs report 97523 4 two treaties rather than one treaty we re developed because ma jority of countries do not protect sound recordings as copyright subject matter the united states protects soundrecordings as copyright subject matter but other countries and especially the members ofthe european union protect sound recordings under socalled related or neighboringrights unfair competition or other noncopyright legal theories also the fact of separatetreaty for phonograms allows for the extension of protection to performers most of whomare not considered authors within the meani ng of the copyright law in those countries that protect sound recordings as copyright subject matter 5 hr 3048 and s 1146 contained the same proposals relating to fair use library reproduction distance learning ephemeral r ecordings operational copying by computers and protection against removal or alteration of cmi the provisions dealing with anti circumvention of copying technologies were virtually identical except for definition of effective technological measure hr 3048 moreover contained other amendments relating to the first sale doctrine and shrinkwrap licenses not found in s 1146 but did notcontain any provisions on online service provide r osp liability which were included in s 1146treaty3 the wipo copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs for databases to the extent they are intellectual creations and fordigital electronic uses of copyrighted works in general the wipo performancesand phonograms treaty covers protection for performers and producers of soundrecordings called phonograms internationally and generally applies the same orequivalent protection to sound recordings as that applied to other copyright subject matter by the wipo copyright treaty 4 the president forwarded the two wipo tr eaties to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification by the united states and requested the introduction oflegislation to implement the two substan tive provisions of the treaties which the administration deemed would require legislation to satisfy the obligations of thetreaties s 1121 and hr 2281 as originally introduced embodied theadministrations recommended minimalist approach to implementing legislation the bills were premised on the assumpti on that existing united states copyright law was largely consistent with the treat obligations s 1121 and hr 2281 would have created new legal protection against devices and activities that are primarilydesigned to circumvent anticopying technologies and against fraudulent removalalteration or provision of copyright management information cmi technicalamendments were also included in the bills to update the copyright acts references to treaty relationships after the introduction of the administra tions implementation bills alternative

new section 1201 17 usc implements the anticircumvention obligations of the wipo treaties subparagraph a1aprovides that person shall circumvent technological measure that effectively controls access to work protected under this title 17 this prohibition is however delayed for two years after the date of enactment in order to allow time for the development of record as to how the implementation of these technologies is affecting availa bility of works in the market place for non infringing uses 16 and for the conduct of rulema king proceeding by the librarian of congress that proceeding can be repeat ed every 3 years it is anticipated that the main focus of the rulemaking pro ceeding will be on whether substantial diminution of that availability is actually occurring in the market for particular classes of copyrighted worksthe rule making may also to the extent required assess whether an adverse impact is likely to occur over the time period relevant to each rulemaking proceeding however the determination should be based uponanticipated rather than actual adverse impacts only in extraordinary circumstancesin which the evidence of likelihood of fu ture adverse impact is highly

generally do not require the desi gn of consumer electronics or computer products to achieve protection against circumvention in departure from thatgeneral principle section 1201k requires that analog video cassette recordersmust conform to the two forms of copy c ontrol technology that are in wide use in the market today the automatic gain control copy control technology and the colorstripe copy control technology 23 the housesenate conferees explained that this provision was included in order to deal with very specific situ ation involving the protection of analog television programming and prerecorded movies and other audiovisual works inrelation to recording capabilities of or dinary consumer analog video cassette recorders before agreeing to include this requirement in the final legislation the conferees assured themselves in relation to two critical issues that these analog copy control technologies do not create playability problems on normal consumer electronics products

17 uscworks easier and more beneficial both to the public and copyright owners pursuant to the wipo treaties the provisions cannot and are not legislated as formality ie as condition of the exercise or joyment of the copyright nor can the cmi requirements prohibit the free movement of goods the new rights to protect the integrity of cmi systems apply both to analog and digital formats in this respect the dmca exceeds the minimum treaty obligations since the wipo treaties require protection only for electronic rights managementinformation the prohibitions do not apply to the ordinary and customary practices of broadcasters or the inadvertent omission of credits from broadcasts of audiovisual works since such acts do not involve the provision of false cmi with the requisite knowledge and intent 25 exemptions the lawfully authorized activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies are exempt from the cmi requirements26 broadcasters cable systems and those who provide programming to these entities are also generally exempt from lia bility under the cmi provisions if they do not intend to induce enable facilitate or conceal copyright infringement27 the conditions for applying the limitation on liability differ depending upon whether the transmission is an analog or digital one in the case of an analog transmission an eligible person will not be liable if it is not technically feasible to avoid the violation or if avoidance would create an undue financial hardship in the case of digital transmission th exemption is dependent upon the status of efforts to create voluntary standard s for transmission of cmi the act contemplates that voluntary standards will be developed until standard is set an eligible person is not liable if the transmission would cause perceptible visual oraural degradation of the digital signal or if the transmission would conflict with an applicable government regulation or industry standard other than cmi standards ifa voluntary cmi standard has been set the eligible person will not be liable if the cmi was not located in accordance with the industry standard civil and criminal remedies the digital millennium copyright act establishes nearly the same civil and criminal remedies for violations of either the anticircumvention provisions of 17usc 1201 or the cmi provisions of 17 usc 1202 civil remedies the

infringing activities of their customers was or iginally one of the major controversies regarding wipo treaties implementation30 the original implementation bills recommended by the administration did not ddress the issue on the theory that since the treaties themselves do not address who is liable for any copyright infringements the matter could be left to judicial interpretation that outcome was opposed by many groups including coalitions representing the osps telecommunications entities the electronics industry and library andeducational institutions without legislative guidance these groups argued therewould be unacceptable business uncertainty and protracted litigation to delineatewho is liable for infringements by osp cust omers the issue of osp liability was resolved by negotiated agreement among the private sector interests most directly affected by use of copyrighted works on the internet 31 that agreement formed the basis for most of title ii of the dmca title ii of the dmca

copying protection extends both to the artistic and the utilitarian features the vessel hull design act is however subj ect to sunset 2 years after enactment background the boat design title enacts design protection proposal that had been considered and rejected in the form of broad design legislation for at least 20years the boat hull design proposal responds to decision of the supreme court inbonito boats v thunder craft boats 61 in which the court held that state law protection of boat hulls was an unconstituti onal interference with the federal patent and copyright laws the boat hull design proposal first passe d the house of representatives as separate bill hr 2696 and was added as separate title to hr 2281 as passed by the house on august 4 1998 the house senate conferees compromised by allowing the boat design act to remain in hr 2281 as enacted but subjected the act to termination after 2 years the register of copyrights and the commissioner of patents and trademarks

have significance primarily for designs of useful articles other than vessel hulls this damages provision is another example of the way titlev of the dmca may lay the foundation for protection of the design of useful articles ingeneral 63 section 1302 actually lists fifth exclusion for designs dictated solely by utilitarian function another clause of the vessel hull design act however specifies that this exclusion does not apply in the case of vessel hull designsboat design protection is intended to f ill gap that some perceive exists between the current design patent and copyr ight laws the same argument has been made for legislation to enact design right for useful articles in general whengeneral design legislation was considered by earlier congresses objections from the insurance industry consumers retailers and others concerned about possible anticompetitive effects were sufficient to prevent enactment basic boat design right new chapter 13 of title 17 usc is headed protection of original designs although the definition of useful article isintended to make clear the protection is limited to designs of boat hulls section 1301creates new legal protection for the original design of useful article which makes the design attractive or distinctive in appear ance design is original if it is the result of the designers own creative endeavor and represents distinguishablevariation compared to other designs the distinguishable variation must be morethan trivial and not copied from another person the overall shape of boat larger than rowboat and smaller than 201 feet in length can be protected against copying of its artistic or utilitarian features the fact that protection can extend to solely utilitarian design features is departure fromgearlier design proposals which would have excluded designs dictated solely byutilitarian function in order to obtain boat hull design protection an application for design registration must be made to the administ rator the register of copyrights within 2 years after the design is made public the boat design right is enforced through civil remedies only these remedies include an injunction actual damages or up to 50000 or 1 copy as the courtconsiders just 62 the infringers profits destruction of infringing articles and attorneys fees to the prevailing party exclusions from protection the biggest exclusion from protection is achieved by defining useful article to mean only vessel hull including plugor mold also excluded from protec tion by section 1302 are designs that are 1 not original 2 staple or commonplace 3 different from staple designs only ininsignificant details or elements that are common variants or 4 embodied in useful article made public by the designerowner more
