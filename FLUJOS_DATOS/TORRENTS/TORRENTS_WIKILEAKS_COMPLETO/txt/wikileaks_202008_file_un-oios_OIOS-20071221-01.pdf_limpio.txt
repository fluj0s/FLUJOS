united nations mission in sudan executive summary in undertaki ng complex and multidimensional peacekeeping operations the united nations faces many challenges including surging budget that has grown from us1 billion i n 1999 to us5 billion in 2006 this has precipitated the shift away from input based budgeting to results based budgeting rbb within the overall context of ongoing organizational reforms this report is review of the relevance efficiency and effectiveness of rbb in peacekeeping operations with specific focus on the united nations mission i n sudan unmis the report is third in series of such reports prepared by the office of internal oversight services oios in response to request by the controller oios notes that the unmis mandate makes it complex and integrated mission many of the tasks assigned to the mission in the mandate call for an integrated strategy between unmis and other united nations agencies funds and programmes operating in sudan unmis was also assigned additional tasks by the security council to lead the process that will culminate in the deployment of joint united nationsafrican union peacekeeping operation in darfur oios took into account these and other specific circumstances in which mission planning in general and the rbb in particular is operationa lized in unmis oios notes that staff in unmis perceives the controllers budget instructions and the strategic guidance as generic and not particularly targeted to address specific sit uations in individual missions oios confirmed earlier conclusions ma in the reviews of rbb in the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik and the united nations mission in liberia unmil that combining the two into single guidance document may improve their perc eived utility by mission staff unmis issued separate mission budget instructions mbi after receipt of the controllers budget instructions and strategic guidance oios notes that since the creation of the strategic planning office senior management involvement has improved in the rb b process but recommends that the mission should also establish formal mechanism for mission wide forum where senior management may articulate their vision and priorities as well as field questions from staff as lead up to the pr eparation of the rbb framework in addition oios also saw need for all sections in the mission to have opportunity to participate and contribute to the strategic planning process as well as engage in formal coordination for planning and preparation of the draft rbb framewo rk oios found that some indicators of achievement in the rbb framework did not have specific baselines and targets in addition the expected accomplishments and indicators had not been changed since inception of the mission and some of them had since been overtaken by events oios draws the missions attention to rbb guidelines which require expected accomplishments and indicators to be changed in order to reflect the 3 progress of the sion in fulfilling its mandate in particular oios notes that t he rbb framework did not reflect any of the additional tasks assigned to the mission with regard to the humanitarian crisis in darfur in spite of the fact that this has increasingly become priority for the mission and the strategic guidance for 2007 2008 also explicitly drew mission attention to that requirement oios found that the mission strategic planning framework is not yet fully integrated into the rbb framework in addition although senior leadership is fully supportive and engaged in the stra tegic planning process few sections of the mission did not have the opportunity to participate oios concluded that this compromised ownership and accountability and urges that appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the process is particip atory and inclusive the automated lotus based rbb monitoring tool that is used in unmis for data collection and monitoring the rbb framework was found to be effectiv and reportedly userfriendly however oios urges unmis to demonstrate in more pract ical way how the reports generated by the lotus monitoring tool are utilized to inf orm management decision making oios also urges unmis to take appropriate steps to ensure that all rbb focal points receive training as well as to develop standard opera ting procedures sops for rbb oios notes that unmis has practice of appointing alternative rbb focal points in every section to ensure continuity during staff turnover and absence from mission and recommends that this be shared with other missions as best practice oios concluded that unmis was making good progress to improve mission planning but needed to strengthen linkages with the budgeting process by integrating the mission strategic planning framework with the rbb framework the report contains 7 recommendations all specifically directed to unmis however references have been made throughout the report to observations made in the rbb reviews in unmik and unmil where other relevant recommendations to improve rbb in peacekeeping were made to oppba and dpkodfs 4 contents paragraphs page executive summary

diverse partners each focusing on specific aspects of the integrated peacekeeping effort such as humanitarian relief elections monitoring and supervision economic reconstru ction and insti tution building over the past seven years the aggregate peacekeeping budget has increased more than five fold from us1 billion in 1999 to over us5 billion in 2006 it is against this backdrop that former secretary general kofi annan proposed organiza tionwide reforms including shift away from input based budgeting to results based budgeting rbb with the intention of establishing versatile planning and management tool that would directly connect resource allocation to results1 2 the office of internal oversight services oios at the request of the controller2 is undertaking review of the relevance efficiency and effectiveness of the r bb in peacekeeping operations the review covers all phases of the rbb as applied to peacekeeping operati ons and encompasses the rbb framework at the mission level as well as support and guidance provided by headquarters to the missions throughout the rbb process 3 this report is third in series of oios reports on rbb and specifically examines the rbb proc ess as applied to the united nations mission in sudan unmis3 the review focuses on the consistency and alignment of the rbb operational framework in regard to the missions mandate as well as its relevant processes policy guidelines and standard opera ting procedures sops for peacekeeping oper ations particular emphasis is on the practical application of the rbb framework to unmis operations including the presence of time bound performance indicator baselines and targets documentation of performan ce indicator methodologies at mission level observed change in indicators of achievement and whether the elements of the framework provide an adequate measurement of results achieved the review further addresses integration of rbb into the missions pl anning and decision making process evaluation self monitoring and any adjustments to the framework capacity development training and the use of best practices recommendations which were made in previous reports on rbb at the united nations interim dministration mission in kosovo unmik and the united nations mission in liberia unmil which may also apply to unmis will not be repeated in this report as new recommendations but will be reiterated to note that the recommendation also applies to unmi s 4 in conducting this review oios utilized variety of qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods basing its findings on the following six data sources 1 interviews 1 interim report on results based budgeting for the biennium 2002 2003 a57478 of 15 october 2002 2 controllers memorandum to oios of 28 nov 2005 3 oios has already issued tw reports review of results based budgetin g in the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik of 6 august 2007 and review of results based budgeting in the united nations mission in liberia unmil of 31 october 2007 7 with personnel from the department of peacekeeping operation dpko the depart ment of field support dfs and the office of programme planning budget and accounts oppba at headquarters 2 interviews and focus groups with mission staff at unmis4 3 surveys of senior management in all 18 peacekeeping missions to assess their u nderstanding nature and extent of involvement in rbb systems application 4 similar surveys of staff at the operational level in all 18 peacekeeping missions 5 programme data analyses and 6 literature review and document analysis 5 5 there were few limitations in conducti ng the survey of mission staff due to high vacancy rates staff absences on leave and staff turnover it was difficult to define fixed universe of staff from which to survey and oios was also unable to apply consistent sa mpling criteria in the selection of the sur vey population by the missions as result oios is not able to determine precise survey response rate in order to address these limitations all findings were based on evidence derived from multiple sources including surveys 6 oios greatly appreciates the cooperation and assistance extended to it by dpko dfs oppba and senior leadership and staff in unmis during the course of this review the report fully incorporates the comments received from unmis and notes that all recommendations have been accepted and implementation of the recommendations is in progress ii review findings 7 unmis has been using rbb since its inception in 2005 and hence been focusing on results based performance measurement however oi found that rbb was not being utilized to its full potential at unmis due to the following two issues i until 2007 the mission did not have dedicated capacity to address coordinated and comprehensive planning for the mission resulting in the linkage be tween the strategic planning and the missions budgetary rbb process less effective ii since the creation of the strategic planning office spo senior management involvement has improved in the rbb process but it could be better managed at the mission through formal mechanism where senior management articulate their vision and the specific direction for the rbb framework each year and the issuance of mission specific instructions or sops on rbb 8 additionally oios found that overall there are impr ovements that can be made to the missions rbb framework areas for improvement include 4 an oios inspec tion team visited unmis from 29 june 2007 to 7 july 2007 and held meetings with 73 key unmis staff in the form of 56 one onone interviews and 3 focus groups 5 the two separate surveys for senior management and rbb at the operational level were administer ed during february april 2007 period yielding 51 and 110 responses respectively for unmis 5 and 8 responses respectively 8 i the missions rbb framework is generally comprehensive with its elements being specific attainable and realistic however the majority of the indicators of achieveme nt did not have baselines and targets6 ii the missions rbb framework has undergone only slight modification since it was first drafted and those who drafted the framework have since left the mission this has resulted in the rbb framework not being complet ely reflective of the missions qualitative and quantitative work at the present lack of understanding by current staff members of all sections at the mission of elements of the framework or the missions increased assistance to the activities in the d arfur region iii rbb capacity at the mission was lacking due to the limited number of focal points at the mission having been trained and the absence of ongoing rbb training facilities iv unmis informed oios that the lack of rbb capacity should be perceived in the context of additional functions that unmis took on during this period vis àvis the heavy support package and the establishment of african unionunited nations hybrid operation in darfur unamid in addition while rbb training is necessary and has commenced at sector level in the meantime future turnover of trained staff is likely to diminish the overall positive impact of rbb training an rbb training programme is being undertaken at the sector level 9 oios also found that the mission is genera lly progressing in the following two areas i performance monitoring through the utilization of the lotus based rbb monitoring tool at the mission this formal monitoring mechanism is userfriendly and allows for the systematic collection of data required for portfolios of evidence ii the establishment in every section of the mission of two rbb focal points including an alternative focal point that participates in all rbb activities throughout the year enabling coverage on rbb matters despite high staff turnover and other absences such as vacation and sick leave iii unmis background 10 unmis was established by the security council resolution 1590 2005 of 24 march 2005 with mandate to help the security council achieve an overall objective of national rec onciliation lasting peace and stability and prosperous and united sudan in which human rights are respected and the protect ion of all citizens is assured the unmis mandate entails four main tasks 1 to support implementation of the 6 oios found that only 17 out of the 46 37 per cent indicators of achievement in the 2007 2008 rbb framework had baselines and targ ets 9 comprehensive pea ce agreement cpa signed by the parties7 2 to facilitate and coordinate the voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons and humanitarian assistance 3 to assist the parties in the mine action sector and 4 to protect and promote h uman rights in sudan 8 since the mission has to deal with this broad range of issues the secretary general has repeatedly stressed the importance of joint integrated strategy among the agencies funds and programmes in order to successfully imple ment the cpa and to achieve the goal of supporting the sudanese people in establishing peaceful and democratic sudan where all citizens will live in conditions of greater dignity and security 11 the missions organizational structure itself is made up of several offices generally referred to as sections each reporting vertically through hierarchy to the srsg who acts on behalf of the secretary gene ral as the head of the mission each section in the mission is responsible for its own work plan the work plans drawn from the missions mandate and based on the strategic framework developed by unmis senior leadership were drafted by the section chiefs in consultation with staff at headquarters and in the sectors the rbb frameworks 2008 2009 were veloped based on these work plans hence are referenced in the rbb framework sections carry out planned activities towards delivering outputs in the rbb framework in the rbb framework the missions operation s are grouped under either sub stantive or pport components in unmis there are four substantive components and one support component 9 sections are clustered together under these component s according to their thematic simila rity for example under the single support component s upport sectio ns deliver ing administrative and logistics services in support of the substantive work of the mission are clustered together the rbb process is coordinated on the substantive side by the chief of staffs office and on the support side by the chief budget officer for each section the section chief and two rbb focal points are responsible for the rbb process in respect of the work of their section 12 in response to the deteriorating conditions in darfur the security council has assigned additional tasks to unmis10 these additional tasks include contingency planning for the darfur region b assisting the african union au with planning and assessments for its mission in darfur and c preparing to support the implementation of future agreement in darfur in close cooperation with the au in the past year unmis has been progressively more engaged in supporting the au and the african union 7 under the mediation of the intergovernmental authority on development igad the government of sudan and the sudanese peoples liberation movement splm signed series of six agreements i protocol of machakos signed in kenya on 20 july 2002 ii protocol on security arrangements signed in naivasha kenya on 25 september 2003 iii protocol on wealth sharing signed in naivasha kenya on 7 january 2004 iv protocol on power sharing signed in naivasha kenya on 26 may 2004 v protocol on the resolution of conflict in southern kordofannuba mountains and the blue nile states signed in naivasha kenya on 26 may 2004 and vi protocol on the resolution of conflict in abyie signed in naivasha kenya on 26 may 2007 8 united nations securit council resolution 1627 of 23 september 2005 9 budget for the united nations mission in sudan for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 a61745 of 15 february 2007 10 united nations security council resolution sc1821 of 31 august 2006 10 mission in sudan amis11 participating in the au mediated peace talks the security council has also recen tly approved the creation of hybrid united nations au peacekeeping force to quell the violence and instability plaguing the darfur region the hybrid operation to be known as united nations african mission in darfur unamid will incorporate the existi ng amis and is expected to be in place fully by the end of 200712 unmis is expected to play vital role in the establishment and implementation of this new mandate iv preparation of the rbb framework 13 since inception unmis has been utilizing the rbb proc ess for budgetary aspects of the mission using results as the basis of evaluating performance key features of the results based approach in unmis include the articulation of objectives expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement at the mission level replacing the prior system which was premised on input and output with one which demonstrates performance accountability effectiveness and relevance through focus on results thus integral to its budgetary process unmis annually prepares logical framework with objectives linked to set of activities and outputs and performance indicators to assess its performance from that perspective the unmis rbb framework is grouped by key components peace process security governance humanitari an assistance recovery and reintegration and support the outputs in the framework reflect the missions contribution within the larger presence of the united nations in sudan many of the tasks outlined in the cpa and its protocols will eventually be addressed through extra budgetary resources of the united nations country team unct and are therefore not directly assessed by unmis through its rbb framework 13 14 the rbb cycle is initiated when the mission receives the controllers budget instructions nd strategic guidance from oppba and dpko respectively the controllers budget instructions sets general policy methodology and procedural issues for development of the rbb framework14 as these issues tend to be the same across all missions the instru ctions are therefore not particularly mission specific except for section that provides some mission specific guidance derived from either the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions acabq or the general assembly some survey res pondents in unmis were of the view that the strategic guidance issued by dpko tended to be generic and addressed mainly procedural issues rather than mission specific strategic directives furthermore mission staff members noted during interviews with oi that the strategic guidance issued from headquarters could not fully capture the complexity of the real situation on the ground in sudan let alone the complex process of deriving mission plan for implementation of 11 amis is an african union peacekeeping force of 7000 troops founded in july 2004 with the aim of performing peacekeeping operations in sudans western region of darfur under security council resolution 1564 of 18 september 2004 amis is to closely and continuously liaise and coordinate its work with unmis 12 united nations security council resolution sres1769 2007 of 31 july 2007 13 budget for the united nations mission in sudan for the period from 1 july 2006 to 30 june 2007 a60726 20 march 2006 14 peace keeping finance division oppbadm memo reference gen0607mt dated 21 june 2007 5 11 mission mandate15 oios reviewed rbb guidance documentation for 2007 2008 and concurs that more detailed strategic guidance would complement unmiss broad mandate for better planning oios believes that combining the controllers budget instructions and the strategic guidance into gle rbb guidance would incre ase their focus and relevance oios notes that recommendation regarding this issue was made to oppba and dpko on the basis of similar findings in oios reviews of rbb at unmik and unmil16 as previously observed for unmik and unmil oios reiterates the need to streamline these instructions thereby making them more mission specific and useful for staff involved in the rbb process 15 oios found that the mission issues separate mission budget instructions mbi to all sections as guidance for the rbb framework process oios observed that the mbi is distillation of senior managements high level expectations for mission planning for specific period withi n the missions broad mandate this practice is commendable as it enable s the mission to synchronize and coordinate mission strategy to standardized formats for estimating resources for the mission especially concerning staffing posts17 in practice however the mbi is not sufficiently detailed with instructions of senior leadership pertaining to issues such as the contributions of specific components to indicators of achievement perceived risks and challenges and specific milestones for individual components18 while oios believes that issues of framework content could be addressed through formal dialogue between senior management and respective sections together with rbb focal points oios notes that there currently i s such arrangement in place consequently chiefs of sections and rbb focal points do not have the opp ortunity to field questions and glean the vision and priorities of senior leadership before the begin drafting the framework oios notes that since the creation of the spo the senior leadership involvement in the rbb process has improved but establishing formal mechanism such as mission wide rbb meeting or forum where senior management articulat their vision and direction and field questions on the rbb guidance as well as mbi would further improve the process 16 unmis informed oios that in 2007 unmis senior leadership was formally engaged in the strategic planning process namely in the development of the strategic assessment the scenarios and the strategic framework 2007 2012 the strategic assessment appraised progress and challenges in the peace process in sudan as they relate to the unmis mandate it identified changes and drivers of change that had affected or were likely to affect the peace process and unmis mandate implementation as well as the missions operational environment and assessed the missions operational environment and assessed the missions ability to effectively and efficiently implement its mandate in the future and the changes required within unmis to that end based on this scenarios of the future of the peace process in sudan were developed to identify circumstances and issues where unmis could be most challenged to respond or adapt following this strategic framework in support of the successful 15 interviews with unmis staff also refer to 18 of this report 16 oios report on review of rbb in unmik dated 6 august 2007 recommendation sp 07001001 par 43 17 unmis memo budget for 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 field office input 25 june 2006 18 ibid 12 implementation of the comprehensive agreement was drafted to serve both unmis and the country team unct members based on the latter framework two year rolling work plans for each section were developed in an inclusive and consultative process involving unmis as well as the unct including ocha undp unhcr and wfp the rbb framework for 2008 2009 was directly derived from these work plans more specifically elements activitiesoutputs and indicators of highest importance were selected for the rbb frameworks consequently it is deemed that vision and direction from unmis senior leadership were appropriately considered during the development of the rbb framework 17 oios notes that coordination can be improved between sections in the substantive and support component in the formulation of the missions rbb framework 19 several rbb focal points mentioned that there w ere not sufficient meetings being held between sections to coordinate and plan the modalities of rbb resulting in unnecessary delays and inefficiencies in implementation of programmes for example plans to increase car log installation by the transport section were not well coordinated with the communication information technology section thus affecting the work flow in both sections oios notes however that there was some coordination effort within th substantive component s for example the civil affairs section takes the initiative to consult with other sections on their activities outputs and indicators but this coordination is not formal and there is formalized mechanism for consultation and coordination in the planning and preparation of the missions rbb framework20 oios urges unmis to formalize this coordination as part of instructions detailed in the mbi in order to improve efficiency in planning preparation and implementation of rbb i n the mission 18 unmis informed oios that the coordination between the substantive and support units improved during the 2008 09 budget preparation process by establishing single focal point in the integrated support service which includes the communicat ions and transport sections the focal point reviews the rbb frameworks before submitting them to the budget section for further review and consolidation the focal point ensures congruence in the support sections while budget section ensures the rbb fr ameworks overall consistency and the appropriateness of resource requirements while this coordination system has functioned well so far there is room for further improvement moreover in practice sections coordinate their plans with one another inclu ding the substantive and support sections the coordination has been reinforced by senior management during the budget planning process v analysis of the unmis rbb framework for 2007 2008 19 as mentioned earlier the rbb framework for unmis is made up of f our substantive components and support component the substantive components are comprised of the peace process security governance and humanitarian assistance 19 results from focus group discussions with rbb focal points 20 mechanism was seen in review of the mbi unmis memo budget for 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 field office input 25 june 2006 13 recovery and reintegration the framework has total of 13 expected accomplishments 46 indicators of achievement and 165 outputs oios found that only 17 of the 46 indicators of achievement 37 per cent had baselines and targets21 in several areas of the rbb framework phrases and words such as serious violations regular meetings and access to life saving support which were used in formulating expected accomplishments indicators of achievement and outputs were not specific measurable andor time bound furthermore regarding measurability after review of rbb frameworks for 2005 2006 2006 2007 2007 2008 oios finds that in cases where outputs may be quantified unmiss rbb framework indicators could be better expressed for their purpose in terms of comparable relative measures using ratios and percentages as well as targets and baselines to ease and enhance measurability22 for mission management and staff as well as for the acabq baselines and targets are useful for monitoring and evaluating mission progress with respect to in dicators of achievement therefore baseline d ata should be collected and targets should be properly established wherever practicable 20 oios found the unmis rbb frameworks to be generally comprehensive and it also found that according to smart23 principles while the frameworks elements are specifi c attainable and realistic they are less so measurable or time bound furthermore oios notes that some unmis staff members state that the framework is not completely accurate depiction of the work being undertaken by the various sections within the components oios learnt that the rbb framework has only undergone slight modif ication in the past few years staff members who initially drafted the original indicators of achievements for various components have since departed the mission resulting in lack of understanding as well as lack of owner ship of the framework elements for example none of the staff members interviewed at the mission had been involved in the original drafting of the rbb framework for the mission staff members interviewe d at dpko and dfs headquarters indicated that the mission has experienced high staff turnover as well as relatively high vacancy rate24 these human resource issues have resulted in the staff members involved with the rbb process at unmis lacking instit utional knowledge on the missions rb b framework and rbb in general this point s to the need for capacity building at unmis an issue that will be addressed in greater detail in section viii of the report paragraphs 4143 21 oios analysis in this regard is based on baselines and targets that were measurable and indicated the progress of the work of the mission from year to year such as various numbers or percentages that are used to measure progress for example indicator 311 increase in the percentage of positions in the national civil service that are filled by people from southern sudan 2005 2006 15 per cent 2006 2007 20 per cent 2007 2008 25 per cent indicators of achievement that are of the yesno type are only consider ed appropriate if the indicator of achievement pertains to critical issue and it can be objectively verified 22 see unmis rbb frameworks for 2005 2006 2006 2007 2007 2008 indicators of achieveme nt 211 212 215 412 23 specific measureable attainable realistic and time bound 24 oios commends the efforts currently underway to address these human resource issues such as the deployment of the personnel management and support services team aggressive recruitment strategies and improving living and working conditions in the field the vacancy rate for international staff as cited in the performance report of the united nations mission in the sudan for the period 1 july 2005 to 30 june 2006 a61689 is 192 14 21 unmis informed oios that baselines exist whenever appropriate and in cases where an indicato r have target such as the adoption of bill there is baseline other than that such bill or previous bill existed the specific nature of peacekeeping necessitates this type of indic ator and will continue to do so nevertheless for the rbb frameworks 2008 2009 the indicators of achievement were further refined and sharpened to improve their measurability 22 oios notes that mission planning was not proactive and incumbent staff memb ers do not have clear understanding of the indicators of achievement in the rbb framework resulting in general relucta nce to innovate new strategies however as elaborated elsewhere in this report oios was informed that the mission was taking measu res to address the issue by conducting strategic and operational planning exercise s25 in these exercise s all sections are provided assistance with developing and linking their respective work plans to the long term mission objective as well as determini ng specific performance indicators activities and timelines for the plans oios was also informed that this would be integrated into the 2008 2009 framework and believes that this should result in more accurate reflection of the work programme of the mission in the rbb framework rbb focal points that were interviewed also saw this as an opportunity for making changes to those elements of the framework that had remained unchanged from the beginning however staff members were not sure that such chan ges would be accepted by headquarters as had happened in the past regarding changes to the rbb framework by mission staff oios is of view that it is good practice to change the expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement in the framework in order to reflect the progress of the mission this was observed in the oios review of rbb in unmil where the rbb components were changed after in depth discussions with headquarters on the appropria teness of the proposed changes26 oios further notes tha t modifying the rbb framework to reflect changes is in accordance with rbb guidelines27 however it should be noted that where progress has been achieved the frameworks should continue to reflect continued efforts to achieve objectives28 23 unmis inform ed oios that the rbb frameworks are approved by the general assembly and consequently cannot be changed mid term as they serve as the baselines against which the missions progress is measured however the rbb frameworks reporting system provides the n ecessary flexibility to accommodate additional activities during the period 25 interviews with unmis senior management 26 oios report on review of rbb in the united nations mission in liberia unmil 31 october 2007 27 rbb guidelines 2005 2006 performance reports and 2007 2008 budget proposals peacekeeping finance division oppbadm 28 for example oios observed from review of the performance report of the united nations mission in the sudan for the period 1 july 2005 to 30 june 2006 a61689 that several elements of the unmis rbb framework were changed ove r time in respect to human rights objectives even if the previous years performance and events expressly indicated that such targets had not been achieved for example 2005 2006 indicators of achievement 342 343 were not achieved as indicated in th 2005 2006 performance report however 2006 2007 and 2007 2008 rbb frameworks these indicators of achievement are longer listed under expected accomplishment 34 even though they were reported as not achieved 15 24 oios was further informed that the rbb framework did not reflect the missions activities as having an increased focus on darfur the strategic guidance for 2007 2008 budget per iod underlined the missions increased focus on darfur noting in light of the recent signing of the darfur peace agreement it is quite possible that by the time the 2007 2008 budget cycle commences unmis will be carrying out additional functions and activities in the darfur region29 rbb focal points confirmed that even though the missions activities were increasingly focused on darfur adjustments had been made to reflect this in the framework for 2007 2008 rbb focal points voiced concerns tha t these activities were taking much of the missions time and energy while the work originally outlined in the framework was effectively placed on hold and not accorded priority status oios believes that the establishment of unamid under resolution 1769 2007 should ease much of the pressure on unmis regarding darfur but nonetheless urges unmis to make appropriate adjustments to the framework and to ensure that all darfur related activities are duly reported in the performance report for the 2007 2008 period in order to allow unmis to demonstrate its achievements according to an established rbb plan30 25 with regard to unamid unmis informed oios that the mission has adjusted its activities in line with the changing nature of the situation on the g round these additional activities will be reflected as unplanned outputsactivities in the performance report 2007 2008 similarly additional unplanned outputs related to darfur were included in the 2006 2007 performance report 26 in addition to this being an integrated mission unmis deals with broad range of issues that require use of joint and integrated strategy between the mission and other agencies funds and programmes oios learnt that the rbb framework does not fully reflect information on p artnerships with other united nations agencies and the unct specifically those activities that the mission carries out for the benefit of and in association with the other agencies31 for example the security section of the support component provides unified and integrated security system for the agencies funds and programmes in sudan and according to rbb practice in an effort to justify resources supporting this role the section submitted examples of outputs reflecting its activities these sec urity section outputs were however not included in the framework for 2007 2008 and explanation was provided for this exclusion32 27 unmis informed oios that regarding the issue of the security section providing integrated security system has been addre ssed and is reflected in the 2008 2009 rbb framework 28 also c losely linked to the above issue oios was informed through its interviews that some agencies in the unct feel that unmis does not take into account work done 29 code cable 1774 30 june 2006 2007 2008 results based budget process at unmis 30 rbb guidelines 2005 2006 performance reports and 2007 2008 budget proposals peacekeeping finance division oppbadm annex ii guidance for preparation of the performance report 31 interviews with unmis staff rvey responses review of unmis rbb frameworks 32 interviews with and documentation provided by unmis staff 16 by agencies that have been present i n sudan longer than the current unmis mission33 and that unmi s is duplicating their efforts in principle the rbb framework should contain only elements pertaining to the mission and oios believes that the mission should also be explicit in its presenta tion about how the missions resources are impacted by collaboration with partners to the extent that this influences the indicators of achievement of the mission interviewees agreed that unmis was proceeding in the areas of rule of law and child protec tion without regard to the prior work of the united nations development programme undp and the united nations childre ns fund unicef respectively analysis of survey responses from unmis indicates that 50 percent of respondents feel that the rbb frame work as it stands does not capture linkages between partnerships and mission stakeholders even though such linkages may be relevant for integrated operations of unmis oios made similar observations on partnerships in the review of rbb in unmik34 and ad vises dpko dfs and oppba to review this issue further in order to develop mechanism that enables rbb frameworks to clearly reflect mission performance including segregation and attribution of outputs as well as clarifying the contribution towards ind icators of achievement by unmiss partners 29 oios found that majority of staff members interviewed were concerned that some qualitative aspects of the missions work were not able to be reflected in the framework because of its quantitative emphasis for example the human rights section has two indicators of achievement namely indicator of achievement 344 which deals with the government ratifying convention and 341 which deals with the government increasing the number of human rights violat ion ca ses that are prosecuted respondents noted that as the outputs to achieve these indicators of achievement are of qualitative nature such as discussion s and consultation s with the government of sudan it is not reflected in the rbb framework other than the quantity of meetings additionally the civil affairs section also advised that its work is mainly qualitative in nature and therefore not sufficiently reflected in the rbb framework for example its work on good offices35 in sudan is not reflected in the framework oios notes that recommendation regarding this issue was made to oppba dpkodfs on the basis of similar finding in the oios review of rbb at unmik36 oios reiterates that dpko dfs and unmis should review methodology for formulation f logical framework to ensure that qualitative aspects of the work programme are reflected in the framework 30 oios n otes that unmis has an office of gender affairs which works as an advisory unit on gender issues and has mandate that covers the whole sion horizontally in support of the implementation of the peace agreement the office is involved in number of mission activities including training of civilian and military staff 33 interviews with the office of the united nations resident coordinator 34 oios report on the review of results based budgeting in the united nati ons interim administration mission in kosovo unmik 6 august 2007 paragraph 21 page 12 35 good offices are diplomatic interventions or missions by the secretary general or his appointed envoys aimed at preventing and resolving conflicts 36 oios repor t on review of results based budgeting in united nations mission in kosovo 6 august 2007 recommendation sp 07001004 paragraph 46 17 on gender sensitivity issues and also works with civil affairs to ensu re gender mainstreaming is included in all community work oios found that gender mainstreaming is represented throughout the substantive components of the rbb framework with gender initiatives explicitly appearing nine times in the rbb framework for 200 7200837 oios found that this integration was good effort towards ensuring gender mainstreaming vi linkages to strategic planning and mission management 31 oios learnt that until 2007 unmis did not have any dedicated capacity to ensure coordinated and co mprehensive strategic planning for all aspects of the mission including monitoring and implementation of the mission plans 38 in the absence of dedicated planning capacity the missions strategic planning process has gradually developed but it was not l inked to the missions budgetary rbb process comprehensive management audit of dpko by oios in 2005 pointed to general lack of strategic guidance policy and standard operating procedures in support of the integrated mission planning process in sud an39 the oios audit further noted that the mission planning process in unmis was independent of the rbb process because the integrated mission planning process was still being developed and lacked detailed implementation guidelines for its integration wit h the rbb process respondents to the oios survey noted that the absence of an overall mandate implementation plan mip was due to the lack of strategic planning capacity resulting in formal overall strategic plan being developed and in its absence the rbb frameworks have served as proxy respondents further suggested that the rbb should be viewed as being more of record keeping tool on implementation40 rather than at the strategic level 32 however encouraging advances have taken place in the mission particularly in the field of strategic planning and mandate implementation in recent months the establishment of sp in 2007 has led to general reorganization process to review and improve mission planning mandate implementation and the li nkages between strategic plans work plans and budgeting process unmis has recently initiated its first full strategic and operational planning process since inception with major highlights being the work on strategic planning framework that includes strategic assessment scenario planning strategic framework and strategic review 33 oios notes however from interaction with missions senior management and review of key planning documents that while the work on the missions strategic planning framew ork is in progress along with the missions other key managerial 37 see component 1 peace process output 16 component 3 indicator of achievement 312 outputs 6 7 indicator of achi evement 3 output 8 38 interviews with unmis senior management and review of key planning documentation 39 report of the office of internal oversight services on the comprehensive management audit of the department of peacekeeping operations a60717 of 1 3 march 2006 40 survey responses to oios rbb survey 18 processes it is not yet fully integrated with the missions rbb framework41 in the report investing in the united nations for stronger organization worldwide a60692 the secretary general has stated in relation to budget and finance activities that the budget and planning process should be explicitly linked to results and managerial performance as part of more rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework this is critical fo r ensuring that the annual budgetary assumptions build on processes experience and outcomes of previous years and reflect the missions current priorities and resource needs such integration involves linking the short term annual budgetary process wi th longer term goals envisaged in the missions broader strategic plan and improving collaboration across the mission components oios is concerned that lack of integration between the rbb framework and the strategic planning framework could result in an inconsistent approach to managing the risks involved in strategic planning as the two planning approaches could operate on different assumptions furthermore there would be greater risk in the use of resources as critical activities may not be bu dgeted for and resources could be used for non critical activities 34 unmis informed oios that the outputs mention ed in rbb framework 2007 2008 correspond to the most important outputs in the sections work plans and through these ultimately to the missi ons strategic framework further to increase coherence and integration of the resource planning and decision making process during the rbb framework development process the strategic planning office initiated resource mapping exercise against the section work plans to identify the most resource intensive activities this mapping exercise supported and facilitated the staff projections of the substantive sections in addition the office commenced streamlining the monitoringevaluation and reporti ng functions aiming in particular for single reporting system for both the section work plans and the rbb framework 35 oios was informed that the unmis mission strategy is being developed by process of close interaction between the sp and other missio n components and approved by senior management the process is meant to ensure that all planning elements are linked in logically coherent and consistent fashion and to improve the linkages and the transparency f the mission planning process in inte rviews with mission components42 oios learnt however that the strategic planning process was not fully participatory and not all sections of the mission were substantively involved in the process oios considers the strategic planning framework to be ngterm strategy and therefore it is imperative that strategic planning in the mission is truly inclusive process open participatory and including all components and major stakeholders an inclusive process will help to build commitment to the planni ng process and encourage ownership of the plans at all levels as well as build foundations for future working relationships and intra mission cooperation and therefore ways of working between and across different components of the mission including velopment of greater cooperation between the sp other substantive offices and the missions budget office 41 interviews with unmis senior management and planning staff 42 more than four missions substantive section chiefs confirmed they did not have chance to contribute to the planning process 19 are key oios observes that this is an area where sharing of knowledge on best practices is particularly useful in order to strengthen organizatio nwide coherence 36 unmis has informed oios that the missions main strategic documents were developed by mission senior leadership in consultative and inclusive manner furthermore the developments of work plans drafted by section chiefs in consultatio n with staff at headquarters and in the sectors other agencies and the unct were consulted to ensure coherence and goal alignment in regard to mandate implementation vii performance measurement monitoring and reporting 37 the measurement of results prov ides information for decision making on future direction of the mission or activities to be undertaken outputs that should be delivered or adjustments that might be necessary in the mix of resources for ensuring that the expected results occur43 the prer equisites for successful strategic planning and rbb include process of monitoring and tracking of results achievement right from early stages of the planning process survey responses from unmis senior management confirmed this and noted that they regar d the rbb framework useful in providing relevant perfo rmance criteria for the mission44 38 the establishment of monitoring and tracking of results will set the conditions for optimizing its ultimate impact on mission success setting measurable indicators of achievement and outputs and sustainable systems with relevant capacity throughout the missions str ategic planning and operations oios finds that the monitoring capability and accountability should be further strengthened by the proposed strategic plann ing framework of the mission as planning processes will be better articulated leading to more efficient preparation of missions annual budget in line with the missions strategic plan 39 as per the united nations rbb guidelines issued by the office of t he controller all peacekeeping missions are required to submit portfolios of evidence as part of their annual performance report rbb framework template 45 portfolio of evidence should be able to support each actual indicator of achievement and completed actual outpu t in order to monitor progress oios found that at present the mission uses an automated lotus notes based rbb monitoring tool for data collection and m onitoring of the rbb framework rbb focal points explained that data was collected on q uarterly basis including data from all regions46 all the rbb focal points in the mission found the lotus monitoring tool to be user friendly and useful providing an easy mechanism to collect data required for the portfolios of evidence they could not however say what these quarterly reports were used for after they were collecte d and compiled by the database oios emphasizes the use of such data reports on results achieved to help 43 interim report on results based budgeting for the biennium 2002 2003 a57478 of 15 october 2002 44 survey responses to oios rbb survey from unmis mission senior management 45 httpppbdunorgrbb 46 focus group interview s with rbb focal points 20 inform decision making through regular progress and financial reviews with senior management oios is aware that all these issues should be addressed through the enterprise budgeting application eba project that oppba is working on to modernize budgeting and performance reporting for peacekeeping missions and which is due to be rolled out early in 200847 oios however commends unmis for establishing and ensuring mission wide use of standard system for collecting data and monitoring the rbb framew ork 40 oios also learned that the portfolio of evidence is compiled and bmitted to dpkodfs headquarters on an annual basis oios notes that the portfolio of evidence contained up todate data because it was compiled using information that is collected continuously and compiled into quarterly reports all rbb focal points in terviewed confirmed that the lotus monitoring tool allowed them to track their reports with ease making compilation of the portfolio f evidence less time consuming this model could be replicated in other missions that do not have standard system for data collection and monitoring as reported in other oios reports on review of rbb in unmik and unmil 48 viii capacity development and best practices 41 oios was informed that team from oppbapfd and dfs visited unmis and conducted training for rbb focal points in preparation for the 2007 2008 rbb framework the team also conducted individual consultations and assisted the focal points with their individual and section work plans as well as inputs for the framework49 however oios was informed by other rbb fo cal points from both support and substantive components that they had not received any formal training and concluded that this may be partially due to staff turnover in the mission oios also found that the mission did not have sops on rbb50 none of the focal points interviewed were aware of any sops although all of them said that if they were available sops could help them to better understand their roles and responsibilities on rbb51 oios notes that as found in oios reviews of rbb at unmik and unmi l there are several documents that contain information that may be compiled into useful sops on rbb including 1 rbb process and peoples table and 2 peacekeepers pocket guide to rbb terminology52 oios urges unmis to make use of these documents to c ompile mission level sops on rbb for its focal points and make them available to all staff members including through publication on the missions intranet 47 eba will be accessible by all parties in the budgeting process including missions and have functions for data management and information flow work plan management as well as monitoring and reporting importantly eba will als include platform for the mission to enter planned rbb frameworks for the budgets and to report on the rbb frameworks as part of the performance report including portfolios of evidence 48 oios reports on review of rbb in unmik and unmil dated 6 august 2007 and 31 october 2007 respectively 49 focus group interviews with rbb focal points 50 ibid 51 ibid 52 oios reports on the review of rbb in unmik and unmil 6 august 2007 and 31 october 2007 respectively 21 42 closely linked to the issue of rbb capacity oios also found that none of the focal points had any knowledge of rbb best practices only one survey respondent was aware of the oppba website on rbb best practices53 but could not recall the last visit to the website oios notes however that the lotus based monitoring tool that has been adopted in unmi s was developed in the united nations sion in sierra leone unamsil in oios opinion therefore there is formal platform with compendium of best practices where staff members may access such best practices as and when they are searching for info rmation and answers to specific issues and problems recommendation to develop such tools as compendium of best practices was made to dpko and dfs based on similar findings in the oios review of rbb in unmik54 43 oios learned that every section in unmis has two rbb focal points including an alternate focal point participating in all rbb activities and is kept informed on all relevant matters on the rbb framework concerning the section this enables sections to have continual presence of focal point on rbb despite high staff turnover and other absences s uch as vacation and sick leave oios notes that this practice is als done in unmil and urges dpko dfs to share it with other missions as best practice oios also notes that the rbb focal point f or the police had taken the initiative to conduct workshops on rbb for other staff in the police section the focal point used rbb training materials that were used by dpko and dfs headquarters staff the aim was to develop excess rbb capacity in the pol ice section as hedge against staff turnover and to increase appreciation of the utility of rbb oios commends initiatives by individual staff members promoting broader participation and knowledge of rbb by all mission staff and not just rbb focal po ints 44 unmis has informed oios that formal rbb training has started at sector level and will be continued throughout 2008 aiming to provide rbb training to all sector offices and all units at headquarters before the next planning cycle begins in addition the training material for rbb along with planning and reporting guidelines developed so far may serve as basis for sops these will developed jointly by the strategic planning office and the budget office in time for the next planning cycle ix conclusion 45 there are certain challenges unique to peacekeeping that influence the ultimate effectiveness of rbb as management and planning tool peacekeeping missions frequently operate in an especially fluid and uncertain context of political and security change this high degree of uncertainty therefore undermines the ideal rbb scenario in which mission s could establish logical framework with clear objectives linked to set of stable and predictable outputs and performance indicators against which mission performance would be assessed 53 http ppbdunorgrbb 54 oios report on the review of rbb in unmik 6 august 2007 22 46 oios concluded that unmis is progressing on the right path in its implementation of the principles of rbb and eventual transition to full fledged results based approach by the establishment of spo catalyz ing the improveme nt in mission planning as well as the development of clear linkages between strategic planning work processes and resource budgeting in order for the mission to achieve the full benefits of rbb unmis must ensure that the new strategic planning framewor k is fully integrated into the mission rbb framework this will ensure that short term annual objectives are fully aligned to the long erterm strategic goals of unmis 47 oios also concluded that the mission rbb process could be strengthened by increasing intra mission coordination between the support and substantive components and by more careful formulation of indicators that have specific baselines and targets in addition although senior leadership is fully supportive and engaged in the strategic planning process few sections of the mission did not have the opportunity to participate oios concluded that this compromised ownership and accountability and urges that appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the process is participatory and inclusive oios also urges unmis to take appropriate steps to ensure that all rbb focal points receive training as well as to develop standard operating procedures sops for rbb x recommendati ons recommendation 1 48 unmis should establish formal mecha nism where senior management may articulate their vision direction and priorities for the mission as part of the development of the mission rbb framework 15 sp07004001 recommendation 2 49 unmis should strengthen the mechanism to enhance co ordination
