renewed interest in immigration reform among reform supporters there has been speculation that there may be an early effort in 2009 to enact legislation commonly referred to as the dream act to enable certain unauthorized alien students to legalize their status unauthorized aliens in the united states are able to receive free public education through high school they may experience difficulty obtaining higher education however for several reasons among these reasons is provision enacted in 1996 that prohibits states from granting unauthorized aliens certain postsecondary educational benefits on the basis of state residence unless equal benefits are made available to all us citizens this prohibition is commonly understood to apply to the granting of instate residency status for tuition purposes unauthorized alien students also are not eligible for federal student financial aid more broadly as unauthorized aliens they are not legally allowed to work and are subject to being removed from the country multiple bills have been introduced in recent congresses to address the unauthorized student population most have proposed twoprong appr oach of repealing the 1996 provision and enabling some unauthorized alien students to become us legal permanent residents lprs through an immigration procedure known as cancellation of removal bills proposing relief for unauthorized students are commonly referred to as the dream act while there are other options for dealing with this population this report deals exclusively with the dream act approach in light of the widespread congressional interest in it two similar standalone dream act bills were introduced in the 110 th congress s 774 and hr 1275 like dream act bills introduced in prior congresses these measures would have repealed the 1996 provision and enabled eligible unauthorized students to adjust to lpr status through twostage process aliens granted cancellation of removal under the bills would have been adjusted initially to conditional permanent resident status to have the condition removed and become fullfledged lprs the aliens would have needed to meet additional requirements the s 774 provisions were also included in hr 1645 known as the strive act different version of the dream act was included in the comprehensive immigration bill that the senate considered but failed to invoke cloture on in june 2007 s 1639 in october 2007 the senate again considered but failed to invoke cloture on another version of the dream act s 2205 while s 2205 was similar in many ways to s 774 hr 1275 and dream act bills introduced in earlier congresses in some respects it was notably different most significantly s 2205 would not have repealed the 1996 provision that discourages states from granting certain postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens based on state residence this report will be updated as legislative developments occur

2008 election results have sparked renewed interest in immigration reform among reform supporters while it is unclear at this time what type of immigration reform agenda if any presidentelect obamas administration and congressional leaders will pursue there has been speculation that there may be an early effort to enact legislation commonly referred to as the dream act to enable certain unauthorized alien students to legalize their status1 legalization of unauthorized illegal alienstermed earned legalization by supporters and amnesty by opponentshas proven to be highly controversial in recent years and it may become even more controversial if economic hard times and rising unemployment rates result in increased opposition to granting legal status to potential competitors for limited job opportunities while still controversial proposals for legalization of the subpopulation of unauthorized aliens who were brought as children to live in the united states by their parents or other adults have enjoyed broad base of support in recent congresses while in the united states unauthorized alien children are able to receive free public education through high school 2 many unauthorized immigrants who graduate from high school and want to attend college however face various obstacles among them provision enacted in 1996 as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira 3 discourages states and localities from granting unauthorized aliens certain postsecondary education benefits more broadly as unauthorized aliens they are unable to work legally and are subject to removal from the united states4 in recent years multiple bills have been introduced in congress to provide relief to unauthorized alien students in most cases these bills proposed to repeal the 1996 provision and enable certain unauthorized alien students to adjust to legal permanent resident lpr status in the united states in both the 107th and 108th congresses the senate judiciary committee reported bills of this type known as the development relief and education for alien minors act or the dream act in this report following common usage the term dream act is used to refer to bills to provide relief to unauthorized alien students whether or not they carry that name dream act bills were introduced in the 109th congress one of which was incorporated into the immigration reform bill passed by the senate in may 2006 s 2611 dream act legislation was again introduced in the 110th congress and dream act provisions were included in the immigration bill considered by the senate in june 2007 s 1639 the senate also considered standalone dream act bill s 2205 in october 2007 neither of these bills was passed by the senate 1 see for example susan ferriss

dream act bills introduced in recent congresses would enable certain unauthorized alien students to obtain lpr status in the united states in the case of most bills through twostage process requirements to obtain conditional lpr status stage 1 typically include residence of at least five years in the united states and high school diploma or the equivalent or admission to an institution of high er education in the united states requirements to have the condition removed and thereby become fullfledged lpr stage 2 typically include acquisition of degree from an institution of higher education in the united states completion of at least two years in bachelors or higher degree program or service in the uniformed services for at least two years in 2003 using data from the march 2000 march 2001 and march 2002 current population surveys cps census 2000 and supplementary rese arch jeffrey s passel of the pew hispanic center made estimates of the number of potential dream act beneficiaries5 according to his analysis each year roughly 65000 undocumented immigrants graduate from high school who have lived in the united states for at least five years passel further estimated as part of this 2003 analysis that there were about 7000 to 13000 unauthorized aliens enrolled in public colleges and universities in the united states who had lived in the united states for at least five years and graduated from us high schools in 2006 using data from census 2000 and other sources the migration policy institute mpi published estimates of the population eligible for legal status under dream act proposals before the 109th congress discussed in the appendix 6 these bills like earlier measures would have established twostage process for unauthorized alien students to obtain lpr status the same requirements outlined above to obtain conditional lpr status and to have the condition removed would have applied under these bills according to the mpi estimates 360000 unauthorized high school graduates between the ages of 18 and 24 would have been immediately eligible for conditional lpr status 7 of this total an estimated 50000 were enrolled in college and thus were considered likely to be eligible for fullfledged lpr status in 2007 using data from the march 2007 cps and other sources the center for immigration studies cis estimated the number of potential beneficiaries under the dream act bill considered in the senate in october 2007 s 2205 cis put the number of potential beneficiaries at 21 million based on the physical presence and age requirements in the bill as described below8 5 unpublished work by passel october 21 2003 on file with crs 6 jeanne batalova and michael fix new estimates of unauthorized youth eligible for legal status under the dream act migration policy institute immigration backgrounder oc tober 2006 1 at httpwwwmigrationpolicyorg 7 this 360000 estimate is as of the end of 2005 according to the authors they focus on 18 to 24year olds because they consider this group the most likely to immediately qualify to adjust status under the dream act the authors assume that if the dream act becomes law most 1824 year olds who receive c onditional status would either enroll in college or serve in the military ibid p 4 8 center for immigration studies dream act offers amnesty to 21 million news release october 23 2007 at httpwwwcisorg

unauthorized aliens are neither entitled to nor prohibited from admission to postsecondary educational institutions in the united states to gain entrance to these institutions these students must meet the same requirements as any other student which vary depending on the institution and may include possessing high school diploma passing entrance exams and surpassing high school grade point average gpa threshold although admissions applications for most colleges and universities request that students provide their social security numbers this information typically is not required for admission even if they are able to gain admission however unauthorized alien students often find it difficult if not impossible to pay for higher ed ucation under the higher education act hea of 1965 as amended they are ineligible for federal financial aid 9 in most instances unauthorized alien students are likewise ineligible for state financial aid furthermore as explained in the next section they also may be ineligible for instate tuition g343g351g351g348g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g561 section 505 of iirira places restrictions on state provision of educational benefits to unauthorized aliens it directs that an unauthorized alien shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within state or political subdivision for any postsecondary education benefit unless citizen or national of the united states is eligible for such benefit in less an amount duration and scope without regard to whether the citizen or national is such resident there is disagreement about the meaning of this provision and authoritative guidance is available in either congressional report language or federal regulations10 the conference report on the bill containing iirira did not explain 505 conference report on predecessor iirira bill which contained section identical to 505 described the section as providing that illegal aliens are not eligible for instate tuition rates at public institutions of higher education 11 some interested parties have argued that congress exceeded its authority in 505 by legislating on how states can dispense state benefits although 505 does not refer explicitly to the granti ng of instate residency status for tuition purposes and some question whether it even covers instate tuition the debate surrounding 505 has focused on the provision of instate tuition rates to unauthorized aliens key issue in this debate is whether it is possible to grant instate tuition to unauthorized students and not to all citizens without violating 505 various states have attempted to do this for example 9 the hea is pl 89329 november 8 1965 20 usc 1001 et seq section 484a5 sets forth immigrationrelated eligibility requirements for federal student financial aid and 484g requires

for instate tuition at state community colleges and california state university campuses12 the measure however bases eligibility on criteria that do not explicitly include state residency to qualify for instate tuition student must have attended high school in california for at least three years and graduated an unauthorized alien student is also required to file an affidavit stating that he or she has filed an application to legalize his or her status or will file such an application as soon as he or she is eligible california officials have argued that by using eligibility criteria other than state residency their law does not violate the 505 prohibition on conferring educational benefits on the basis of state residency the federal courts have not yet ruled on whether state laws that authorize instate tuition for unauthorized students violate 505 13 g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 dream act

postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens both bills also would have enabled eligible unauthorized students to adjust to lpr status in the united states through the cancellation of removal procedure described above under s 774 and hr 1275 aliens could have affirmatively applied for cancellation of removal without being placed in removal proceedings there would have been limit on the number of aliens who could be granted cancellation of removaladjustment of status under the bills to be eligible for cancellation of removaladjustment of status under s 774 or hr 1275 an alien would have had to demonstrate that he or she had been physically present in the united states for continuous period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of enactment and had not yet reached age 16 at the time of initial entry both bills also would have required the alien to demonstrate that he or she had been admitted to an institution of higher education in the united states

they maintain that it is both fair and in the us national interest to enable unauthorized alien students who graduate from high school to continue their education and they emphasize that large numbers will be unable to do so unless they are eligible for instate tuition rates at co lleges in their states of residence advocates for unauthorized alien students argue that many of them were brought into the united states at very young age and should not be held responsible for the decision to enter the country illegally according to these advocates many of th students have spent most of their lives in the united states and have few if any ties to their countries of origin they argue that these special circumstances demand that the students be granted humanitarian relief in the form of lpr status those who oppose making unauthorized alien students eligible for instate tuition or legal status emphasize that the students and their families are in the united states illegally and should be removed from the country they object to using us taxpayer money to subsidize the education of individuals through the granting of instate tuition rates who are in the united states in violation of the law they maintain that funding the education of these students should be the responsibility of their parents or their home countries they further argue that it is unfair to charge unauthorized alien students instate tuition while charging some us citizens higher out ofstate rates
