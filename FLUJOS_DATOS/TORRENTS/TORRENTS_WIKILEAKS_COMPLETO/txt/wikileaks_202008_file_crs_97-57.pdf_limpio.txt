major federal laws and rules which limit or restrict the lobbying of c ongress with federally appropriated funds as those restrictions appl to federal agencies and employees and to private contractors and grantees of the federal government officers and employees of the departments and agencies of the executive branch of the federal government are expected to communicate to congress their need for certain legislation or appr opriations and to provide members of congress with administration opinions ideas facts figures and arguments concerning public policy issues and the legislation affecting or relevant to such policies similarly the administration and its officers and empl oyees may engage in public discourse discussion and exposition of administration policy and may legitimately provide public arguments for or against certain public policy issues and gislation federal officers and employees of department s and agencies however are generally restricted by criminal provision 18 usc 1913 as well as several appropriations riders from using federal appropriations for certain types of significant grass roots lobbying or pub licity or propaganda campaigns which urge or exhort persons to contact their members of congress the partment of justice has interpreted 1913 narrowly finding that the law bars only largescale or significant expenditures of public funds on private communications expressly urging persons to contact congress persons who hold federal contracts and federal grants may generally not be reimbursed from that federal c ontract or grant and may not use contract or grant funds directly to lobby the united states c ongress in the first instance there are few narrow and specific stat utory restraints on certain program funds and on some recipient agencies and organizations unde r specific federal programs on the use of funds for such lobbying purposes the rest rictions of more ge neral applicability to all grantees and contractors however come from the federal acquisition regulations cost principles for governme nt contractors and grantees and from the socalled byrd amendment regarding certain kinds of lobbying with federal monies by federal grant contract or cooperative agreement recipients section 18 of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 pl 10465 co mmonly called the simpson amendment although not dealin g with limitations on

funds there are several provisions of federal law rule and regulation which limit or restrict the use of funds appropriated by congress for the purposes of lobbying activities this report provides brief discussion of the major federal laws and rules which limit or restrict the lobbying of c ongress with federally appropriated funds as those restrictions appl to federal agencies and employees and to private contractors and grantees of the federal government federal agencies and officials it is generally understood that it is pr oper for federal executive officials to communicate directly to congress the need for legislation or ppropriations as well as to communicate the administrations pos ition for or against legislative proposals additionally it is recognized that an administration is allowed to engage in public discourse discussion and exposition of ad ministration policy and positions which may include public arguments for or against certain legislation and specific programs however statutory provisions and various appropriation riders prohibit such officers and employees of federal partments and agencies from using federal appropriations for certain grass roots type of lobbyin g or publicity or propaganda campaigns which urge or exhort the public to write or contact their members of congress to influence legislation criminal provision the principal statutory prohibition on l obbying with appropr iated funds is federal criminal law at 18 usc 1913 wh ich prohibits officers and employees of the federal agencies from using appropriati ons to lobby or influence member of congress on legislation the prohib ition is upon federal employees using appropriations to pay for any personal rvices advertisement telegram telephone letter printed or written matter intended or designed to influence members of congress on legislati on or appropriations direct lobbying although the payment for such activitie s with federal funds is barred 1913 expressly exempts from the prohibition the activities of officers and employees of the federal government communicating to mbers of congress on the request of any member or to congress through the proper official channels requests for legislation or appropriations deemed nece ssary for the efficient conduct of the public business this provision of law has thus b een consistently interpreted in the past byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9757crs2 1 see opinion of assistant attorney general of the united states henry j miller 1962 printed at 108 congressional record 84498451 may 15 1962 department of

legislation1 but most likely would prohibit substantial letterwr iting or other types of signif icant propaganda or publicity campaigns also called grass roots lobby ing campaigns funded with appropriated monies which are directed at the general public and which specifically urge or exhort the public or individuals to write or contact their congre ssman on an issue before the congress2 in 1962 an informal opinion from assistan t attorney general henry j miller discussed the right and obligation within our constitutional framework for the president and the executive agencies and their officers and employees to communicate directly with members of congress to express their views and the administrations arguments and positions in favor of or opposition to proposed or pending legislation finding that unso licited contacts with members of congress from sargent shriver then director of the peace corps urging members to support peace corps authorization did not violate the provisions of 18 usc 1913 the assistant attorney general explained personal contacts with members of congress by executive officers are both sanctioned and required by article ii section 3 of the constitution the power to recommend measures to congress woul d appear clearly to comprehend and include the power to urge argument s on individual members of congress in support of such measures3 similarly in 1989 the office of legal counsel of the depa rtment of justice found that the prohibitions of the law do not apply to direct communications between agency personnel and members or st aff of congress that office of the department of justice explained that there is restriction on department officials directly lobbying members of congress and their staffs in support of administration or department positions4 grass roots indirect lobbying legislative history the statute thus does not necessarily reach direct contacts by officers and employees of the executive branch of the federal government with members and staff of congress but rather appears to be intended to reach certain indirect or grass roots lobbying efforts by agencies and their employees entailing publicity or propaganda campaigns directed at the public which urge request or are intended to have persons contact thei r congressman in 1978 opinion the office of legalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9757crs3 5 2 op olc

by federal judges of resources associated with their official position to communicate with members of congress on pending legisla tion noted concerning 1913 the provision was intended to bar the use of official funds to underwrite agency public relations campaigns urging the public to pressure congress in support of agency views5 this general understanding nd interpretation of the pr ovision is consistent with the apparent legislative intent of the statute the legislative history of the statute appears to indicate congressional purpose to restrict and prohi bit socalled grass roots lobbying or propaganda campaigns funded by federal ppropriations in colloquy on the floor of the house the s ponsor of the original restriction in 19196 representative james good of iowa res ponded to the question of representative smith of idaho as to whether it is intended by section 5 to prevent the employees or officers of the government from communicating directly with their representatives in congress by stating that that is expressly reserved7 explaining the purpose of the amendment representative good stated it is new legislation but it will prohibit practice that has been indulged in so often without regard to what administ ration is in power the practice of bureau chief or head of department writing letters throughout the country sending telegrams throughout the country for this organization for this man for that company to write his congressman to wire his congressman in behalf of this or that legislation the gentleman from kentucky mr sherley former chairman of this committee during the closing days of the last congress was greatly worried because he had on his desk thousands upon thousands of telegrams that had been started right here in washington by some official wiring out for people to write congressman sher ley for this appropriation and for that now they use the contingent fund for th at purpose and i have doubt that the telegrams sent for that purpose cost the government more than 7500 now it was never the intention of congress to appropriate money for this purpose and section 5 of the bill will absolutely put stop to that sort of thing8 while the language and the intent of the criminal statutory provision may appear to cover broad range of conduct and co mmunications involving public issues it should be noted that there has never b een any recorded department of justice enforcement action nor any criminal indic tments ever brought under this provision since it was enacted into law in 1919 the precise conduct that might subject one to criminal prosecution therefore is somewhat matter of conjecture the department of justice however regardless of the political party of the administration hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9757crs4 9

an executive branch activity at the behest of private party since criminal remedy is provided for violation of the law but noted in dicta that even if remedy were available under the statute the production and distribution of such pamphlet by federal agency even though the pamphlet is admittedly biased would not violate 1913consistently interpreted the statutory pr ohibition in very narrow manner and has questioned the constitutionality of the provision if interpreted broadly9 communications to the public while the focus of the prohibition is upon agency communications to the public rather than on direct communications to congress not all agency communications to the public concerning pending legisl ation violate the antilobbying provision interpretations of 1913 and s imilar prohib itions recognize that members of the administration and other executive branch officers and employees are obviously not prohibited from all official public ex pressions of support or opposition or expressions for the need for certain legisl ation or governmental programs there is therefore an apparently accepted distinction between prohibited grassroots lobbying with federal funds regardin g legislation as opposed to permissible public advocacy for certain administration programs favored legislation or policy10 as noted by one congressional commentator concerning an administrations public expressions of opinions on policy certainly any administra tion should be expected to use all legal means at its disposal to encourage acceptance of its programs11 federal court found that certain pamphlet published by federal agency although admittedly biased towards the nuclear energy progra m did not violate the prohibition at 1913 because the communication did not urge or request nor was it likely to induce persons to contact their congressmen12 similarly in 1981 the office of legal counsel of the department of justice explained in broad terms the proper c ontemplated relations hip and interchange between the executive branch and the congress as well as between the executive branch and the public c oncerning legislation the constitution contemplates that there will be an active interchange between congress the executive branch and the public concerning matters of legislative interest for that reason alone this department has traditionally declined to read the criminal statute nd the general rider as requiring federal officers and employees to use their own funds and their own time to frame necessary communications to congress and the public we have taken the view that the criminal statute and the genera l rider impose such requirement theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9757crs5 13 5 op olc 180 185 1981 14 13 op olc supra at 366 15 13 op olc supra at 363 in the opinion of the department of justice also exempt from the law are lobbying activities of executive branch officials whose positions typically and historically entail an active effort to secure public support for the administrations legisla tive program including presidential aides appointees and their delegees id at 363364 16 olc guidelines of april 14 1995 supra at 2permit wide range of contact between the executive and the congress and the executive and the public in the normal and necessary conduct of legislative business13 the 1989 opinion of the office of legal c ounsel of the department of justice asserted also that general public expre ssions concerning legi slation or other public policy issues by federal executive branch officials and employees through public speeches appearances or published writin gs would not violate the antilobbying provisions of 18 usc 1913 accordingly we do not believe the stat ute should be construed to prohibit the president or executive branch agenci from engaging in general open dialogue with the public on the administrations programs and policies nor do we believe the statute should be construed to prohibit public speeches and writings designed to generate support for the administrations policies and legislative proposals14 public speeches were deemed to be exempt even when expressly calling on the public to contact congress because they were seen to lack the requisite use of device such as telephone or telegr aph or some other written communication as expressed in the text of 18 usc 191315 this opinion was reflected in the 1995 g uidelines issued by the department of justices office of legal counsel th at the prohibition would cover only certain types of private forms of communicati ons as opposed to public speeches and writings that is that the prohibition applied only to substantial grass roots lobbying campaigns of telegr ams letters and other priv ate forms of communication expressly asking recipients to contact members of c ongress in support or opposition to legislation16 minimis expenditures the criminal statute has thus been interpreted to apply to certain expenditures of federal funds for private communicati ons through such devices as letters telegrams or telephone calls to members of the pub lic which expressly urge or request those persons to c ontact member of congress on legislation the statutory restriction at 18 usc 1913 has been in terpreted narrowly by the department of justice through the administrations of both parties however so as to actually prohibit in its view only what the depar tment of justice has described as gross solicitations of public support or significan t or large scale expenditures of public funds in these types of grass roots lobbying

emphasis addedthe department of justice found in an informal opinion in 1973 that the law was not intended to reach all public expression of views on legislation but rather was directed at gross solicitations of public support in 1973 the white house withdrew information packets and speech kits it had distributed to agency and department heads concerning sugges tions for publicity campaign over budget legislation after complaints from congre ss and finding by the comptroller general that production of ch battle of the budget kits appeared to violate appropriations restrictions on lobbying with federal funds17 in finding however that there was criminality in such conduct under 18 usc 1913 assistant attorney general henry peterson stated the legislative history reflects the congress sought to recognize its responsibi lity to legislate and that of the president to exercise his views in an appropriate manner regarding the merit or deficiencies of legislation the apparent intention of congress in enacting 18 usc 1913 was to bar gross solicitations of public support ie conduct that would propagandize and generate public backing financed with appropriated funds18 in 1989 assistant attorney general william barr of the office of legal counsel olc of the department of justice advised attorney general dick thornburgh that in addition to the statute at 18 usc 1913 not applying to direct contacts between executive agency officials and members of congress and their staff the antilobbying act would also not apply to speeches appearances or writings of administration officials nor would the act prohibit private communications with members of the public as long as there is not significant expenditure of appropriated funds to solic it pressure on congress examining the legislative history of the provision the olc of th department of justice explained these remarks in the laws legislative hi story demonstrate that congress was concerned about the use of appropriated funds to implement grass roots mailing campaigns at great expense f ootnote our calcula tions indicate that an expenditure of 7500 in 1919 would be roughly equivalent to one of 50000 today based on this legislative history this office has consistently concluded that the statute was enacted to restri ct the use of appropriated funds for large scale high expenditure campaigns specifically urging private recipients to contact members of congress about pending legislative matters on behalf of an administration position19 the department of justice has thus expressly interpreted the antilobbying criminal statute as having minimis threshold as far as the expenditure of federal funds for c onduct whic h apparently was intended to come within the statutory restriction that is communications such as letters and lephone calls from an executive official to the public to put pr essure on congress cerning legislation the minimis threshold amount of 50000

statute further purpose of the prohibition at 18 usc 1913 would appear to be to prohibit federal agency from expending any federal funds or res ources in assisting private parties or groups in their lobbying nd attempts to influence congress in federal district court case the court indicated that the statute would appear to have as its purpose to prevent corruption of th legislative processe s through government financial support of an organization wh ich attempts to influence members of congress and thereby precludes the drowning out of the privately financed voice of the people by publicly funded special interest group21 the statutory provision at 18 usc 1913 applies by its expr ess language only to federal officials and thus the cr iminal provisions would not reach private contractors or grantees of the federal government22 furthermore the restrictions apply only to the lobbying of congress and do not apply to lobbying by one executive agency of another agency nor to l obbying of state legislatures by federal officials23 appropriations restrictions in addition to the criminal statute at 18 usc 1913 there is often included in an appropriations bill for agencies or departments rider in the form of general restriction on the use of such funds ppropriated in that act for publicity or propaganda purposes directed at l egislation pending before congress24 as an appropriations measure this restriction is subject to interpretation and enforcement by the comptroller general of the united states general accounting office in interpreting such antilobbying provisions the comptroller ge neral has found that they apply to conduct similar to that c overed by the criminal provisi on that is publicity and propaganda campaig ns directed at the public at large

1972communicating with the public and with legi slators regarding its policies if the policy of an agency is affected by pendi ng legislation discussion by officials of that policy will necessarily either exp licitly or by implication refer to such legislation and will presumably be either in support of or in opposition to it an interpretation of the antilobbying re striction which strictly prohibited expenditures of public funds for dissemi nation of views on pending legislation would consequently preclude virtua lly any comment by officials on administration or agency policy result we do not believe was intended we believe therefore that congre ss did not intend to preclude all expression by agency officials of view s on pending legislation rather the prohibition of the antilobbying restric tion in our view applies primarily to expenditures involving direct appeals addr essed to the public suggesting that they contact their elected representatives and indicate their support of or opposition to pending legislation ie appeals to mbers of the public for them in turn to urge their representatives to vote in particular manner25 since there is overall antilobbying ppropriations rider now applicable to the funds for all federal agencies and partments when questions arise about an expenditure of funds for communications by an agency or department of the federal government the particular ppropriations legislation for that agency or department in question must be examined there are few different varie ties of publicity and propaganda riders the general accoun ting office has noted that the broader restriction on publicity and propaganda not authorized by congress which appears in several appropr iations laws might be broad enough to cove r those activities which are usually more narrowly and expressly re stricted under riders aimed at publicity and propaganda campaigns concerning l egislation pending before congress26 in applying these restrictions to the particular facts before it the comptroller general has generally looked to determine if communi cations have expressly urged the public to contact members of congre ss by the use of such words and phrases as let congress know we support it or c ontact your representatives and make sure they are aware of your feelings concerning this important legislation27 when communications were made to the public concerning pub lic policy matters even if such communications gave arguments for or against specific legislation violation was found when the material was essentially expository in nature and did not urge or suggest anyone contact their member of congress28 in one example concerning department of transportation expenditures at the time congress was considering passive restraint systems

individuals to expressly urge them to c ontact members of congress on legislative issue may run afoul regardless of any minimis threshold amount of appropriations riders on executive agency funding the partment of justices office of legal counsel has noted that the comptroller general may interpre t the appropriations restrictions on grass roots lobbying campa igns in stricter fashion than the department of justice interprets the cr iminal counterpart in 1995 document the office of legal counsel advised that agenc ies may wish to observe more general restriction with respect to officials other than those listed in section the president his aides in the executive office of the president the vice president cabinet members and senateconfirmed officials against expressly urging citizens to contact congress in support of or opposition to legislation30 the olc guidelines stated the comptroller general following his understanding of the department of justices historical interpretation of the act before the 1989 barr opinion has construed the restriction as being triggered by explicit requests for citizens to contact their representatives in support of or opposition to legislation given the comptroller generals interpretation and given the difficulty of predicting what may be perceived as grass roots campaign in particular context agencies may wish to err on the side of caution by refraining from including in their communications with private citizens any requests to contact members of congress in support of or opposition to legislation31 the comptroller general has not expressly found any specific minimis amount or requirement for finding that funds were us ed improperly but has noted in the past that funds expended may be small and may be co mmingled with proper expenditures and therefore further acti on would be taken to recover the funds32 the general accounting office has noted that the extent to which gao will investigate an alleged misuse of funds for lobbying depends in large measure on the amount of money involved33httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9757crs10 34 federal appropriations law supra at 4167 to 4169 citing comp troller general decision b129874

restriction the comptroller general has f ound that the an tilobbying appropriations riders would apply to an agencys attempt to provide assistance to private lobbying groups that is that an agency should not be able to do indirectly that which it can not do directly while the comptroller general has t hus found that appropriated funds may not be used to develop propaganda material to be given to private lobbying organizations to be used in their efforts to lobby congress the distinction was ex pressly made between the use of such funds and personnel to prep are material not otherwise in existence to be given to private lobbying organiza tion as opposed to the permissible use of stock information position papers or educa tional material to service requests from outside groups34 grantees and contractors of the federal government persons who hold federal contracts and federal grants may generally not be reimbursed from that federal c ontract or grant and may not use contract or grant funds directly to lobby the united states congress unless there is clear congressional authorization to engage in such activities with federal funds there are few narrow and specific statutory restra ints on certain program f unds and on some recipient agencies and organizations under specific federal programs on the use of grant or program funds for such lobbying purposes35 the restrictions of more general applicability to all grantees and contractors however come from the federal acquisition regulations cost principles for government contractors and grantees and from what is known as the byrd amendment regarding lobbying on certain specified matters by federal grant cont ract or cooperative ag reement recipients appropriations restrictions provisions of some yearly appropriati ons laws provide an express limitation on the use of federal grant or contract funds from federal agency to pay for lobbying activities for example th appropriations re striction at section 504b of the department of labor hea lth and human services nd education and related agencies appropriations act 1995 provide d that part of any appropriation contained in this act shall be used to pa the salary or expenses of any grant or contract recipient or agent acting for such recipient relating to any activity designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the

students to write to member s of congress to urge their opposition to proposed cuts in student financial aid programs38 while the comptroller general has interpreted this appropriation rider on grantees and contractors in similar manne r as the publicity and propaganda riders on federal agencies that is to apply to grassroots lobbying campaigns where the public is urged to contact their member of congress the office of legal counsel of the department of justice has offered an opinion that the partic ular rider on grantees and contractors in the labor education and hhs appropriations laws is broader than the general publicity and propaganda riders and applies even to funding communications from contractors and grant ees receiving funds under that particular act directly to members of congress on pending legi slation or appropriations39 byrd amendment there is an additional permanent federal restriction on grant ees and contractors of the federal government known as the byrd

lobbying on legislation before congress is concerned the provisions of the byrd amendment would apply fairly narrowly if at all to such activities since the amendment is directed at lobbying onl on specified federal actions concerning the making of grants loans contract s and agreements and the extensions or modifications or such agreements loans contracts or grants while the provision would appear to bar the use of federal funds to lobby member of congress to intervene with an agency concerning the making extension or modification of grant loan contract or agreement the byrd amendment does not appear to apply generally to the lobbying of the congress concerning the consideration of federal legislation generally in further info rmation and guidance to clarify ombs interim final guidance the office of management and budget explained the prohibition on use of federal ppropriated funds does not apply to influencing activities not in connection with specific covered federal action these activities include those related to legislation and regulations for program versus specific covered federal action40 the byrd amendment prohibitions also do not prohibit grantees or contractors from using their own funds to lobby the gove rnment on any matter if the entity has any monies or resources other than fede ral appropriated funds sufficient to cover lobbying activities it is expressly to be assumed that nonfedera l monies were used in any lobbying effort41 furthermore any monies made available in contract which are considered the profit or fees earned are not considered federal appropriated funds and may be used for lobbying activities42 acquisition regulations and cost principles in addition to these statutory restri ctions are regulations and guidelines concerning government contractors nd grantees which implement cost and accounting principles attempting to insure that government contractors and grantees not be reimbursed from federal contract or grant mone for the cost of lobbying and public advocacy activities which ar not authorized by law provisions in the federal acquisitions regulations apply to certain government contracts with

on lobbying activities by certain nonprofit groups as condition to receiving federal grants and loans we re enacted into law in 1995 this provision does not expressly address limitations on the use of federal funds for lobbying the use of which is already restricted by the limitations discu ssed above but rather applies to the use of an organizations own resources section 18 of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 pl 10465 co mmonly called the simpson amendment prohibits section 501c4 civic leagues and social welfare organizations from engaging in certain lobbying activ ities with their

affiliated 501c4 which would not receive any federal funds and which could engage in unlimited lobbying47 the method of separately inco rporating an affiliate to lobby which was described by the

engage in lobbying activities the term lobbying activities as used in the simpson amendment is defined in secti on 3 of the legislation to include only direct lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts such as preparation planning research and othe r background work intended for use in such direct contacts49 organizations which use their own private resources to engage only in grass roots lobbying and public advo cacy including all communications made in speech article publication or other material that is distributed and made available to the public or through radio television cable televi sion or other medium of mass communication50 would therefore not be engaging in any prohibited lobbying activities under this provision the lobbying disclosure act definitions expressly exclude and do not independently apply to activities which consist only of grass roots lobbying and public advocacy similarly since the term lobbying activities relates only to th direct lobbying of covere d federal officials the simpson amendment would not appear to limit in any way an organizations use of its own private resources to lobby state or local legislators or other state of local governmental bodies or units while direct lobbying of the congress or of certain high level executive branch officials is covered under the lobbying disclosure act as lobbying contact and thus by finition lobbying activity the acts of testifying before congressional committee subcommittee or task force or of submitting written testimony for inclusion in the public record of any such body or of responding to notices in the federal re gister or other such publication soliciting communications from the public to an agency are expressly exempt from the definition of lobbying contact and t hus in themselves cannot qualify as lobbying activity51 tax implications of lobbying by nonprofit organizations although private groups may generally use their own resources and monies to engage in public
