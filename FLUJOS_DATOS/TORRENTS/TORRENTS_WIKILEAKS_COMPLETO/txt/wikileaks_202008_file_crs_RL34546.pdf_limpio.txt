divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34546wind power in the united states technology economic and policy issues summary rising energy prices and concern ove r greenhouse gas emissions have focused congressional attention on energy alterna tives including wind power although wind power currently provides only about 1 of u s electricity needs it is growing more rapidly than any other energy source in 2007 over 5000 megawatts of new wind generating capacity were inst alled in the united states second only to new natural gasfired generating capacity wind power has become mainstream in many regions of the country and is longer considered an alternative energy source wind energy has become increasingly competitive with other power generation options although the impacts of the current financial crisis are uncertain wind technology has improved significantly ove r the past two decades crs analysis presented here shows that wind energy still depends on federal tax incentives to compete but that key uncertainties like climate policy fossil fuel prices and technology progress could dominat future cost competitiveness key challenge for wind energy is th at electricity production depends on when winds blow rather than when consumers need power winds variability can create added expenses and complex ity in balancing supply and demand on the grid recent studies imply that these integration costs do not become significant 510 of wholesale prices until wind turbines account for 1530 of the capacity in given control area another concern is that new transmission infrastructure will be required to send the windgenerated power to mand centers building new lines can be expensive and timeconsuming and there are debates over how construction costs should be allocated among endusers nd which pricing met hodologies are best opposition to wind power arises for nvironmental aesthetic or aviation security reasons new publicprivate partne rships have been established to address more comprehensively problems with avian bird and bat deaths resulting from wind farms some stakeholders oppose the constr uction of wind plants for visual reasons especially in pristine or highlyvalued areas debate over the potential for wind turbines to interfere with aviation rada r emerged in 2006 but most experts believe any possible problems are economica lly and technically manageable federal wind power policy has centered primarily on the production tax credit ptc business incentive to operate wind facilities the ptc is currently set to expire on december 31 2009 analysts and wind industry representatives argue that the onagain offagain nature of the ptc is inefficient and leads to higher costs for the industry federal re newable portfolio standard which would mandate wind power levels was rejected in the senate in late 2007 its future is uncertain if wind is to supply up to 20 of the nations power by 2030 as suggested by recent us department of

any other electricity source wind energy already plays significant role in several european nations and countries like china and india are rapidly expanding their capacity both to ma nufacture wind turbines and to integrate wind power into their electricity grids this report describes utilityscale wind power issues in the united states the report is divided into the following sections background on wind energy wind resources and technology industry composition and trends wind power economics and policy issues three policy issues may be of particular concern to congress should the renewable energy produc tion tax credit be extended past its currently scheduled expiration at the end of 2009 and if so how would it be funded the economic analysis suggests that the credit significantly

1990s through today production tax cr edits have encouraged builders to maximize the output of wind electricity since they earn credits for each kilowatthour generated vagaries of the weather it is not as reliable as conventional sources some benefits of wind power cite d by proponents such as long term reduction in demand for fossil fuels are not easily quantified to jumpstart wind power devel opment past these hurdles many states have instituted rps programs that require power companies to meet minimum renewable generation goals national rps requirement has been considered nd to date rejected by congress other policy questions such as fede ral funding for wind research and development and siting and permitting requirements are also outlined background the modern wind industry began in the early 1980s when the first utilityscale turbines were installed in california and denmark1 wind power then as today was driven by high energy prices energy in security and concer n about environmental degradation early wind turbines installed primarily at altamont pass outside of san francisco in california were primitive compared to todays machines and suffered from poor reliability and high costs like most new technology early wind turbines had to go through process of learni ng by doing where shortcomings were discovered components were redesigned and new machin were installed in continuing cycle todays wind industry is notably different from that in the early 1980s wind turbines now are typically 100 times more powerful than early versions and employ sophisticated material s electronics and aerodynamics costs have declined making wind more competitive with other power generation options large companies and investment banks now drive most wind power activity compared to the early days of collaborating scientists inve ntors and entrepreneurs2 from the mid1980s to the late 1990s th us wind industry stagnated due to low energy prices and the technologys re putation for high cost and low reliability but researchers continued to make improvements in the technology driving down costs and improving reliability new federal and state incentives encouraged developers to focus on the production of ectricity at wind plants also known as wind farms and not just installing the equipment3 in 1999 the us industry began period of rapid expansion slowed occasionally by expiring federal incentiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34546crs3 4 this statement is supported by the economic analysis presented later in the report by the fact that wind accounts for over 6 of total

siting and financing new coalfired power plants given expectation of future carbon constraint and consumer preference for renewable energy however wind power still accounts for onl about 1 of the total electricity generated in the united states12 in some regions lack of transmission capacity is already beginning to constrain further growth in the wind power sector and in states like iowa texas and minnesota where wi nd power has achieved higher share of total electricity generation there are cerns that additional wind power could lead to higher prices or threaten grid security finally there is currently shortage of wind turbine components and backlog in scheduling transmi ssion interconnection leading to delays and rising costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34546crs5 13 these issues are

95benefits and drawbacks of wind power there are frequently noted benefits and drawbacks to wind energy text box 1 and text box 2 summarize selected problems and benefits respectively for wind power drawbacks key challenge for wind energy is that electricity production depends on when and how consistently winds blow rather than when consumers most need power this variability can create added expenses and complexity in balancing supply and demand on the grid13 several recent studies note that system integration costs do not become significant 3 to 5 per megawatt hour until wind turbines account for 1530 of the capacity in control area14 these apparently modest cost estimates have yet to be confirmed within the context of the us electricity system another concern is that new transmission infrastructure may be required to send the wind generated power to where it is needed this can be an expensive and timeconsuming effort there are debates over how constr uction costs should be allocated among end users and which pricing methodologies are most economically effici ent although transmission constraints face all new power generating options wind power is especially handicapped because wind resources are often far from demand centers and do not usually use the full capacity of the transmission line due to the variable output texas is analyzing new transmission capacity to send windgenerator power from west texas to the more populated northern and eastern sections of the state that could cost from 3 billion to over 6 billion15 on national scale the us department of energy doe states that the most costeffective way to meet 20 wind energy target by 2030 would be by constructing over 12000 miles of new transmission lines at cost of approximately 20 billion16 see the section on trans mission constraints for more on this issuetext box 1 selected problems facing wind power power output depends on when the wind blows not when users need electricity

some critics wind power also results in unacceptable bird and bat deaths to others it is the visual impact s that wind turbines have on the landscape or the noise that causes objection fina lly increasingly tall wind turbines have interfered with military and airport radar these issues are discussed in later section of the report benefits wind turbines have direct missions of air pollutants including oxides of sulfur and nitrogen merc ury particulates and carbon dioxide19 they also offset the need to mine process and ship coal and uranium drill and transport natural gas and to much lesser degree oil and construct or maintain hydroelectric dams as noted previously wind power contributed approximately 32 billion kilowatthours of electricity to the us electri city grid in 2007 if

2008 given rising prices for coal natural gas and nuclear fuel power suppliers are drawn to the certainty that wind while variable is inexhaustible and has fuel cost by displacing coalfired and gasfired generation wind power would reduce the demand for these fuels perhaps moderating future prices and price volatility wind plants can catalyze rural development because farmers and ranchers receive royalty payments from wind developers who lease their land the vast majority remains available for crops or grazing farmers and ranchers typically receive from project developers 20005000 per year for each turbine on their land21 the land taken out of production for wind turbine pads access roads and ancillary equipment reduces income for corn farmers for example by about 165 per turbine22 wind energy provides an additional source of revenue for local governments in the form of property taxes on wind plant owners wind turbines unlike fossil and nuclear power plants do not require water for cooling potentially important issue in areas with scarce water resources also the lead time for planning and constructing wind plants is shorter th an that for nuclear and coal assuming transmission access is not an issue finally wind power proponents argue that wind energy creates green collar manufacturing and field service jobs ra ther than traditional carbonintensive employment23

section outlines technolog trends in the wind power sector wind power fundamentals unequal solar heating of the earths atmosphere and oceans creates wind wind turbine blades like airplane wings produce lift when air passes over one side of their shaped surface more rapidly than another figure 2 this lift spins the turbine blades and rotor which is connected to generator through gearbox inside the housing the generator and accompanying power conditioning equipment then delivers electricity to the transmission grid at the appropriate voltage nd frequency the process is roughly opposite to common household fan which uses electricity to turn the blades and create air motion wind turbines can stand alone or be integrated into wind farms with power generating capacity equaling that of traditional power plant25 this report focuses only on large utilityscale wind turbines smaller offgrid wind power applications are also growing rapidly although their aggregate impact is limited26 physical relationships the evolution of wind power technology and market development has been influenced by three physical relationships first figure 2 wind power

measured in watts is p k dav3 where k is constant that depends on turbin design characteristics and physical limitations d is the density of air is the area swep t out by the turbine rotor blades namely br2 with r being the length of the rotor blade and v is the wind velocity 28 for wind mapping resources see nr website httpwwwnrelgovwindwind turbines power output varies with the cube of wind speed27 thus all else held constant if wind velocity doubles power output increas eightfold wind power developers therefore face the challenge of finding where winds blow best winds at 250 feet in altitude are stronger and st eadier than those closer to the ground this factor explains why wind turbine towers are placed high in the air second power output varies with the area swept out by the turbine blades during their rotation doubling turbine blades length will yield quadrupling of power output todays utilityscale wind rbine blades are co mmonly 130 feet long or more in an attempt to harness more energy turbine manufacturers have devoted attention over the past two decades to fi nding materials strong and durable enough to handle the twisting forces that are transmitted from the longer blades through the rotor and gearbox in fluctuating winds finally power output increases directly with air density density is typically higher in winter months and at low altitudes and lower in summer months and at high altitudes winds near the cold scandinavian seas for example contain more exploitable energy than those of the hot highaltitude desserts of the american southwest wind resources wind resources in the united states and elsewhere have been studied for decades the national renewable energy laboratory nrel has produced national and state wind resource maps that i ndicate areas with promising winds figure 3 28 excellent winds mean thos that average about 17 miles per hour or above at 150 feet in altitude additional mapping efforts characterize seasonal and even daily variations in average wind speed after using these maps to identify promising regions wind plant developers must still study and document local conditions carefully often for 12 months or long

blades cannot be easily elevated high into the ai r where the best winds blow as result horizontal axis machines wh ich spin about an axis parallel to the ground rather than perpendicular to it have

northern baltic coast region where wind resources are superior wind plants are wi dely deployed in germany and few onshore areas with good wind resource s remain to be developed the shortage of onshore sites is leading germany to repl ace older less efficient wind turbines with larger more powerful models the shortage of highquality onshore sites is also leading to an expansion of offshore wind plants in 2006 the federal government passed law stating that grid operators must bear the costs for connecting to offshore wind plants as soon as they are ready to begin producing power at the

variable nature of wind power has an additional cost implication electric power systems must be able to reliably meet all firm customer loads at all times for this reason power systems are built ar ound generating technologies that are dispatchable and predictable that is units that can be reliably turned on or off or have their output ramped up or down as need ed to meet changes in load however because wind turbine is weather dependent it is not dispatchable or as predicable as fossil or nuclear unit as noted prev iously energy storage can help address this shortcoming in wind energy although it also results in higher costs when power system is dependent on only small amounts of wind generation to meet load the variations in wind output can be absorbed by the systems existing buffer capacity this capacity is either foss il fuel nuclear or dispatchable renewable energy eg hydroelectric geothermal and biomass however when wind constitutes large part of the systems total generating capacity perhaps 10 to 15 or greater the system must incur additiona l costs to provide reliable backup for the wind turbines for example in 2007 utility in montana built gasfired plant for the primary purpose of compensating for wind power variability67 various estimates have been made of the cost of integrating large blocks of wind capacity into power system estimates for integration

recent system integration issue in texas in summary wind power has the economic advantage of zero fuel costs and costs for the pollution controls associated with the consumption of fossil and nuclear fuel however wind plants have relatively high fixed costs and the plants cannot be operated as intensively as fossil or nuclear plants due to the variability of the wind wind variability also creates

charge of 282 per megawatt hour this cost is assumed to rema in constant in real dollar terms for the forecast period the results for the six cases are summarized below in table 3 these estimates should be viewed as indicative and not defi nitive and are subject to high degree of uncertainty as shown in the table in case 1 the levelized cost of wind power is few percent higher than coal or gasfired power given the range of uncertainty in the assumptions the costs of these options are essentially similar nuclear power which is assumed to benefit from the full range of federal incentives production ta x credit and loan guarantee is about 10 less expensive than wi nd and the least expensive of all the alternatives examined in case 2 reducing incentives significantly changes the results ifthe renewable production tax credit is assumed to terminate the cost of wind power increases by 10 in this situation coal and gas have 14 to 15 cost advantage over wind however the biggest impact of reducing incentives is on nuclear power assuming loan guarantee the cost of nu clear power increases by 28 from 60 to 77 per megawatthour 76 in this situation wind powers cost also without production

dioxide per unit burned than coal and combined cycle gasfired plant requires less fuel to produce unit of electricity than pulverized coal plant higher than in the base case wi nd has an 18 cost advantage over gasfired electricity case 3 the imposition of an illustrative cost of 25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide on fossilfired generation c ase 4 has the greatest impact on the relative competitiveness of wind with coal the carbon cost takes coal from 4 cost advant age over wind in the base case to 19 disadvantage the impact on gasfired power is significant but less dramatic gas goes from 6 cost advantage to 4 disadvantage when carbon costs are imposed78 as discussed above the combina tion of high capital costs and relatively low utilization rates as measured by the capacity factor creates cost disadvantage for wind power the importance of utilization is illustrated by case 5 which assumes wind capacity factor of 44 compared to the 34 rate used in the base case with high capacity factor wind has the lowest cost of the alternatives examined and in particular is over 25 less costly than coal or gas the final case case 6 assumes the imposition of systemintegration charge of 282 per mw h on wind generation as table 5 shows costs under this case and the base case are similar in summary the financial analysis suggests the following given the base case assumptions including continuation of the renewable production tax credit the cost of wind power is comparable to coal and gas the addition of an illustrative system integration charge to account for largescale wind penetration of utility system does not greatly change these results federal financial incentive policies have significant impact on thefinancial analysis the economic s of wind are materially worse when the production tax credit is eliminated and materially improved versus nuclear power when nuclear incentives are reduced improved technology or prime loca tions that allow wind projects to achieve high rates of utilization would significantly lower the cost of wind power assuming higher natural gas prices than the current eia referenceforecast or the imposition of carbon charges on coal

addition to the visual impacts ther are other objections all wind turbines produce mechanical and aerodynamic noise noise is thus siting criterion for regulatory purposes early wind turbin models were

electricity grid in the united states is aging and overloaded in some regions and new investment is re quired to ensure reliable efficient transmission of electricity101 siting new transmission lines is an expensive time consuming and often controversial endeavor wind plan t developers seek access to transmission capacity that allows them to send their elect ricity to market without having to build new lines especially ones they need to pa for themselves as noted previously much of the nations best wind resources are located in remote lightly populated areas where little transmission capacity exists demand centers where the electricity is consumed can be hundreds of miles away 2006 estimate puts the cost of new transmission lines at 15 2 million per mile and costs may have increased since102 transmission constraints ccur in at least 3 ways limited transmission capacity scheduling difficulties in using existing lines and delays in interconnecting new wind power sources to the grid limited transmission capacity good sites for wind plants may be located in areas with limited available capacity on the transmission network or the sites may be distant from any existing transmission lines these capacity limits are the most fundamental constraint facing wi nd power project developers it can take many years to plan and build new infrast ructure wind plant developers who build in regions with limited or transmission capacity may have to incur all construction costs for new or improved transmission in frastructure an expensive proposition texas is attempting to

infrastructure promote electric power reliability and lower costs for consumers by reducing transmission congestion order 679 allows public utility to obtain in centive rate treatment for transmission infrastructure investment s under certain conditions scheduling difficulties transmission scheduling difficulties for wind power can result because the original rules for access to transmission capacity were not designed with intermittent sources lik wind in mind as the electricity sector slowly transforms itself from one with veral hundred vertically integrated utilities with their own transmission control areas to one with combination of regional transmission organizations rtos and traditional control centers the rules are being rewritten under the old rules economic penalties we re applied to generators that did not meet their dayahead schedule require ments for wind power this occurred frequently since power output varies with wind variability making scheduling difficult wind developers claim that the old rules discriminated against intermittent sources in february 2007 ferc issued order 890 to allow greater access to transmission lines for power generators of all types including renewable energy projects106 rate pancaking using the transmission facilities of multiple operators and incurring access charges from each is another scheduling barrier for wind power

further that subsidies generally distort the free market and that renewables should not get special treatment that exempts them from this principle also regarding the concern about the environmental problems of c onventional energy sources they contend that the most costeffective economic policy is to put tax on the pollution from energy sources and let the free market make the necessary adjustments another argument against the ptc is that intermittent renewable ener gy production has fluc tuating nature that makes it less valuable than energy produced by conven tional facilities ptc eligibility ious vs ipps the renewable ptc is not available to investor owned utilities ious although utilities do finance and own wind plants typically independent power producers i pps build finance and own wind plants and sell power to regulated utilities there are number of financing mechanisms where other providers of capita l assist with financing wind plants in exchange for portion of the tax credits one questi on for congress is whether utilities should become eligible to receive the ptc doing so would allow them to finance wind plants at lower cost since the interest rates they pay on debt is lower than what an ipp pays this would reduce the cost of wind power one impact of allowing utilities to receive the rene wable tax credits is that they could become more competitive at producing wind than ipps this could threaten the growth of the dozens of companies that now build wind plants specific ptc legislative options during the 110th congress variety of bills sought to

in 2013116 while this legislation did not pass future versions of legislation are likely to ve similar price levels on carbon dioxide allowances according to the levelized cost analysis presented earlier such price would make wind power about 19 less ex pensive than power derived from coal even without the ptc wind power would be more competitive than coal for natural gas the impact of carbon allowance cost s would be less dramatic although the levelized cost of wind as modeled here w ould be noticeably lower than natural gas power congress will need to reconsider the policy goal of the renewable ptc if and when carbon constraint is imposed alternatives to the ptc one alternative to the ptc is the renewable energy payment system also known as the feedin tariff this policy is widely

ces some states without restructured industry also adopted an rps the number of states with an rps has grown steadily but without consistency rps requireme nts vary from state to state in april 2008 ferc reported that 26 states and the district of columbia had an rps in place collectively covering about 54 of the national electric load119 mandatory state rps targets range from low of 2 to high of 25 of electricity generation however most targets range from 10 to 20 and are sc heduled to be reached between 2010 and 2025 most states include wind energy as an eligible resource and allow some form of trading between holders of the renewable energy credits that result from operating wind projects120 noncompliance penalties imposed by states range from about 10 to 55 cents per kilowatthour many states in the southeast and midwest regions do not have an rps requirement several states have br oadened their rps provisions to allow certain energy effi ciency measures and technologies to help satisfy the requirement federal rps debate state rps action has provi ded an experience base for the design of possible national requireme nt proponents of federal rps contendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34546crs43 121 eia impacts of 15percent renewable portfolio standard doe june 2007 24 pthat national system of tradable credits would enable retail suppliers in states with fewer resources to comply at the least co st by purchasing credits from organizations in states with surplus of lowcost production opponents c ounter that regional differences in availability amount and type s of renewable energy resources would make federal rps costly and unfair efforts to include federal rps in th energy independence and security act pl 110140 were unsuccessful in june 2007 samdt 1537 to hr 6 proposed 15 federal rps senate floor action on the proposal triggered lively debate but the amendment was ultimately ruled nongerm ane in that debate opponents argued that national rps would raise retail electri city prices and disa dvantage southeastern states because they lack sufficient renewa ble energy resources to meet 15 rps requirement rps proponents c ountered that an energy information administration eia report indicated that the south s sufficient biomass power potential from existing plants to meet 15 rps wit hout becoming unusually dependent on other regions121 further eia estimated that the 15 rps would likely raise retail prices by slightly less than 1 over the 2005 to 2030 period but would also be likely to cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over that period in december 2007 the house approved hr 6 with 15 rps but the senate droppe d the provision under threat of an administration veto of the bill the prospects for another federal rps initiative in the 110th congress are unclear conclusions wind power in the united states is growing rapidly although it currently supplies only about 1 of the countrys ectricity needs some states and regions have much higher level of wind penetration furthe rmore the amount of proposed new wind plants either under construction or waiting to be built is significant and could soon make wind the largest source of new power supply at the national level continued expansion of wind power in the united states could be slowed by the current financial crisis lack of transmi ssion capacity or expiration of the federal renewable production tax credit on decembe r 31 2009 on the other hand federal policy on climate change expected by many in the 111th congress would likely put value on carbon dioxide emissions and give wind power additional advantages compared to coal and natural gasbased electricity congress will need to carefully consider the interactive nature of energy and climate legislation when crafting future policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34546crs44 122 converting series of cash flows to fi nanciallyequivalent uniform annual payment is twostep process first the

grant et principles of engineering economy 6th ed 1976 chapter 4appendix financial analysis methodology and assumptions the financial analysis of power plant costs in this report estimates the operating costs and required capital recovery of each generating technology for an analysis period through 2050 plant operating costs will vary from year to year depending for example on changes in fuel prices and the start or end of government incentive programs to simplify the comparison of alternatives these varying yearly expenses are converted to uniform annual cost expressed as 2008 present value dollars122 similarly the capital costs for the genera ting technologies are also converted to levelized annual payments an investorowned utility or independent power project developer must recover the cost of the i nvestment and return on the investment accounting for income taxes tax law depreciation rates and the cost of money these variables are encapsulated within an annualized capital cost for project computed using capital charge rate the financial model used for this study computes projectspecific capital charge rate that reflects for example the assumed cost of money and the appli cable depreciation schedule in the case of publicly owned utilities the return on capital is function of the interest rate capital recovery factor reflecting each projects cost of money is computed and used to calculate mo rtgagetype levelized annual payment123 combining the annualized capital cost with the annualized cash flows yields the total estimated annualized cost of project this annualized cost is divided by the projected yearly output of electricity to produce cost per mwh for each technology by annualizing the costs in this manner it is possible to compare alternatives with different yeartoyear cost patte rns on an applestoapples basis inputs to the financial model include fi nancing costs forecasted fuel prices nonfuel operations and maintenance expense the efficiency

recent projects government incentives are also an important part of the financial analysis epact05 created or extended federal in centive programs for coal nuclear and renewable technologies this study assumes the following incentives renewable energy production tax credit of 20 cents per kwh with the value indexed to inflation the credit applies to the first 10 years of plants operation the base case analysis assumes that the tax credit which is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2008 will be extended as has happened in the past the credit is available only to wind power production that is sold to an unaffiliated third party under most circumstances this requirement effectively limits the production tax credit to indepe ndent power producers utility that owns wind plant and uses the power to serve its own load would not qualify124 the credit is currently available to new wind geothermal and several other renewable energy sources new solar energy systems do not qualify and geothermal systems can take the production tax credit only if they do not use the renewable investment tax credit discussed below nuclear energy production tax credit for new advanced nuclear plants of 18 cents per kwh the credit applies to the first eight years of operation unlike the renewable production tax credit described above the nuclear credit is not indexed to inflation and therefore drops in real value over time this credit is subject to several limitations it is available to plants that begin construction before january 1 2014 and enter service before january 1 2021 for each project the annual credit is limited to 125 million perthousand megawatts of generating capacity the full amount of the credit w ill be available to qualifying facilities only if the total capacity of the qualifying facilities is 6000 megawatts or less if th total qualifying capacity exceeds 6000 megawatts the amount of the credit available to each plant will be prorated for example eia assumes in its 2007 annual energy outlook that 9000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity qualifies in this case the credit amount drops to 12 cents per kwh125 the base case for this study
