not exclusively funded by the federal government and were intended to support veterans returning from war the implementation of the postvietnam era veterans educational assistance program veap marked the first time that an educati onal benefit had been estab lished during peacetime and for an allvolunteer force the first time that education benefits were viewed as military recruiting tool and the

rebecca r skinner and blake alan naughtonduring the period since 1944 when veterans education benefits first were made available there have been numerous changes to the veterans education programs and the benefit amounts made availa ble also during this pe riod other forms of federal financial assistance have been made to students including students who are veterans through the enactment of an array of federa l student financial ai d programs at the same time however college prices and costs associated with obtaining postsecondary education have continued to increase3 the relationship between veterans educa tion benefits and fe deral student aid and the manner by which fede ral student aid is calculate d and awarded have changed several times as veterans education benefits programs have evolved at present federal student aid awards are calculated according to the federal need analysis system which takes an individuals receipt of veterans education benefits into account during the process of determining eligibility for cer tain federal student aid programs the rules governing the interaction between the federal student aid programs and veterans educa tion benefits programs affect how much aggregate aid is made available to vete rans to support their access to postsecondary education this report reviews the evolution of ve terans education be nefit programs and describes the types of educa tion benefits that have been made available under these programs the report is organized into three major sections the first section provides an historical overview of education benefits for military veterans beginning with the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 gi bill of ri ghts the second section is an analysis of the estimated value of veterans education benefits relative to average college prices this section focuses on the estimated value of veterans education benefits and college prices at fouryear public and private institutions and twoyear public institutions the final s ection briefly examines the interaction between veterans education benefits and fede ral student aid benefits authorized under the higher education ac t of 1965 hea as amended veterans education benefit programs this section provides brief history of the education benefits programs that have been made available to veterans beginning with the gi bill of rights summary of selected characteristics of the various programs is presented in table 1 at the end of this section gi bill of rights the original gi bill the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 was intended to help veterans readjust to civilian life avoid high levels of unemployment and afford returning veterans an opportunity to receive the education and training that they missed while serving in the litary under the gi bill the veterans administration now the depa rtment of veterans affa irs va paid up to 500 ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34549crs3 4 reliable comprehensive data on the price of college attendance during the 1940s are not available based on data obtained on indi vidual institutions it seems likely that 500 annually would have been sufficient to cover educational costs at most institutions for example based on anecdotal evidence tuition and fees at harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology were 450 and 500 respectively in the 1940s 5 in 1976 at the end of the vietnam hostilities benefits were extended from 36 months to 45 months and the time period in which benef its could be used was extended from eight years to 10 years following dischargeyear directly to an educational institu tion for tuition books fees and other training costs4 the va also paid as much as 50 month increased to 65 in 1946 and 75 in 1948 as subsistence allowance to si ngle veterans and greater monthly amounts to veterans with one or more dependents this program ended on july 25 1956 korean gi bill the veterans readjustment assistance act of 1952 the korean gi bill pl 82550 was authorized to help veterans returning from the korean war to adjust to civilian life the benef it provided up to 110 month to single veterans for educational expenses and educationrelated expenses and higher amounts for veterans with dependents unlike the gi bill of rights which paid both educational expenses and separate s ubsistence allowance the m onthly benefit for the korean gi bill was intended to cover both it was believed that requiring the veteran to contribute to the costs of hisher educati on would encourage more careful spending in addition partially in res ponse to alleged incidents of fraud and abuse by forprofit proprietary institutions of higher edu cation ihes each veteran received lump sum payment from the va instead of the va making direct payments to ihes the program ended january 31 1965 postkorea and viet namera gi bill the postkorea and vietnamera gi bill was enacted in 1966 under the veterans readjustment benefits act of 1966 pl 89358 this program was originally intended for vetera ns of the postkorean war era and was not intended to be as generous as some of th earlier programs for veterans5 under this act veterans who had been on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days were entitled to one month of educational assistance for each month of service this was the first gi bill that provided benefits to members of the armed forces while they served on active duty as opposed to providing benefits only after the completion of active duty the program became effective june 1 1966 but benefits were made available retroactively to postkorean war era vete rans and vietnamera veterans who had served prior to the effective date th initial monthly benefit amount for single veteran was 100 per month nd monthly benefit amounts were increased several times during the operation of the progra m ultimately to 376 per month in 1984 the program ended december 31 1989httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34549crs4 6 the department of defense could

been numerous changes to the veterans education benefit programs periodically pr ogrammatic eligibility criteria and be nefit amounts have been amended several pr ograms have expired and been repl aced by successor programs one useful way to examine vetera ns education benefits is to compare the actual real value of the benefits made av ailable under these diffe rent programs over time the analysis presented here considers only the benefits available for education and living expenses it does not factor in any individual contributions toward education benefits that serv icemembers have been requi red to make beginning with the establishment of the veap in 1976 nor kickers provided to encourage enrollment in the armed forces in add ition it only considers be nefits available to fulltime students with dependents20 this section examines the value of the education benefits provided through the gi bill of rights and successor programs from 1944 through 2007 in inflationadju sted constant 2007 dollars it also examines the purchasing power of bene fits made available under the mgibad program the largest of the currently ac tive veterans educati on benefits programs with respect to the costs of obtaining postsecondary education veterans education benefits are gene rally awarded for specific number of months depending upon the program when the recipient enrolled and the duration of service for example recipient can receive mgib benefits for 36 months which could be disbursed over the c ourse of three years twelve monthly payments per year or over the course of four years nin monthly payments per 9month academic year21 in the analyses presented here it is assumed that the benefits will be disbursed over fouryear period ie for four 9month academic years college price data are primarily from the digest of education statistics 2007 produced by the department of education ed da ta for 20072008 are from the college board because these data are not currently available from ed the college board bases its college price data on sample of institutions whereas ed includes the universe of institutions of higher education ihes in its price data value of veterans education benefits 19442007 as previously discussed the original gi bill provided up to 500 annually for education expenses this is th equivalent of 5890 in 2007 dollars22 an additional 50 was pr ovided monthly for living expenses in 1944 which in 2007 dollars ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34549crs12 23 this assumes that living expenses were provided for nine months each year the length of traditional academic year pl 78346 specifically refers to an ordinary school year when discussing education benefits the m onthly allowance for living expenses increased to 65 in 1946 and 75 in 1948
