awards and incentives the statutory authorities generally have been established by congress to provide agencies with tools to help them manage their workforces and thereby to better accomplish individual agency missions as well as public policy goals that cut across agency boundaries some of these authorities are contained within title 5 of the united states code hereafter title 5 these authorities cover most agencies in the executive branch and some in the legislative branch1 other authorities may be unique in their coverage to single agency occupation type or workforce and may be located in agencyspecific carve outs in title 5 or in other titles2 many of the statutory authorities if not most are prescribed for agencies in great detail this report discusses statutory authorities for federal employee awards and incentives under executivebranchwide provisions of title 5 corresponding data sources and employee perceptions from the federal human capital survey and potential issues for congress the report does not include discussion of awards or incentives authorized under agency or workforcespecific statutory authorities in all cases award and incentive payments may be constrained by statutory limitations on an employees aggregate compensation in calendar year sometimes called salary caps the relevant cap is determined in part by the pay system that applies to the position to which an employee was appointed 3 in addition awards and incentive payments generally are designated by statute and regulation as not being part of an employees basic pay therefore they do not count for calculation of federal employees retirement annuity the advent of pay for performance for some agencies and workforces has to some extent blurred the distinction between pay on one hand and awards and incentives on the other the term pay for performance typically refers to the linkage of performance appraisals to salaried pay 4 this blurring arguably raises the possibility that discrete analysis of awards and incentives only separate from pay may provide only partial picture5 with this caveat noted this report nonetheless focuses on awards and incentives because awards and incentives have different purposes and requirements the report discusses each topic separately terminology associated with award and incentive authorities sometimes may cause confusion because separate and distinct technical terms have been introduced that in common usage often tend to be synonyms therefore the report begins with brief discussion of terms 1 for discussion see title 5 the federal civil service by barbara l schwemle in crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium by clinton t brass et 2 for example the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal bureau of investigation fbi have their own agencyspecific authorities for recruitment incentives fema 5 usc 1010410105 and retention and relocation incentives fbi 5 usc 5759 3 for discussion see crs report rl33245 legislative executive and judicial officials process for adjusting pay and current salaries by barbara l schwemle 4 for an overview of pay for performance see crs report rl34529 payforperformance linking employee pay to performance appraisal by wendy r ginsberg 5 technically pay for performance is not an award however the advent of pay for performance allows the basic pay of employees to be adjusted upward based on the performance ratings that are given actions like this generally may not be taken in pay systems that do not feature pay for performance absent pay for performance agencies instead have tended to rely on awards to reward performance and on incentives to influence behaviors like recruitment relocation and retention therefore any implementation of pay for performance system may influence agency and employee behaviors with regard to any award and incentive programs and vice versa f

this report uses specific terms in order to achieve consistency with current usage by the office of personnel management opm6 in the report the term award refers to an agency payment that is used to reward an individual employee or group of employees for quality of past performance7 awards are distinct from pay term that refers to salaries and wages that federal employees receive for work performed8 title 5 award authorities differ in their coverage and requirements among three general types of employees federal employees generally career senior executive service ses employees and political appointees by contrast the term incentive refers to payment that is designed to provide monetary inducement for an individual or group to accept new position or to remain employed in current position title 5 incentive authorities come in three types recruitment relocation and retention also known as the three rs or 3rs 9 unlike awards the three incentive authorities do not differ from each other in terms of the employees they cover the next two sections of this report discuss each topic in turn g3g160g138g155g141g156 g561 g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g156g561 federal executive branch employees can be characterized as belonging to multiple related but often differing workforces laws regulations executive orders and administrative policies determine how employees in the distinct workforces are variously appointed hired appraised compensated and managed the authorities that apply to these separate workforces can be identical similar or substantially different from each other authorities about employee awards for example differ among segments of the federal workforce some authorities also provide flexibility to specific agencies to customize th eir practices while still operating within broad requirements 10 due to the underlying diversity of workforces among and within agencies this report simplifies the analysis by discussing three major types of federal employees for purposes of employee awards which are not mutually exclusive in all cases 6 terminology related to awards incentives bonuses etc can be confusing because colloquial use of terms may vary considerably under title 5 separate and distinct terms have been introduced that often tend to be synonyms in common usage perhaps as consequence opm gradually has been revising its own usage of terms in regulations and reports to clarify meanings to nonspecialists to reduce po tential confusion this repor t seeks consistency with opm usage while noting technical terms and definitions for an example of opm discussing these terminology issues see us office of personnel management hereafter opm recruitment relocation and retention incentives calendar year 2007 report to the congress shrpcpla6 washington dc september 2008 hereafter calendar year 2007 3rs report p 4 httpwwwopmgovocapayhtml3rsreporttocongressindexasp 7 chapter 45 of title 5 refers to these awards as fa lling within broader category of incentive awards 8 for discussion of components of whitecollar salaries including basic and locality pay see crs report rl34463 federal whitecollar pay fy2009 salary adjustments by barbara l schwemle 9 chapter 57 of title 5 refers to these incentives as bonuses in keeping with opm practice this report uses the term incentive in place of bonus to differentiate these kinds of payments according to their underlying purposes see us opm calendar year 2007 3rs report p 4 10 for example some authorities require more specific regulation or allow administrative practice to be established without regulations

carveout authorities11 career ses employees12 and political employees who have had statutory or policy restrictions on their ability to receive awards13 some federal employees may fall outside these three categories for purposes of awards for example some positions are excepted by law from the governmentwide appointment provisions of title 514 these employees may be subject to different laws about awards eg some in the federal aviation administration 49 usc 106 or awardlike performance pay amounts eg senior foreign service 22 usc 3965 instead of or in addition to those of title 5 some special categories of employees are eligible for awards eg award to law enforcement officers for foreign language capabilities 5 usc 45214523 as noted earlier this report focuses on executivebranchwide authorities and does not address these kinds of agency or occupationspecific authorities

and 11 for the title 5 definition of employee see 5 usc 2105 for the definition of employee for purposes of executivebranchwide award authorities discussed in this report see 5 usc 4501 in this context the metaphor of carveout oftentimes refers to situation when statutory provisions outside of title 5 apply to an employee instead of the title 5 provisions other times the carveout meta phor may refer to situation when agency or workforce specific provisions inside title 5 are used instead of more general title 5 provisions that cover many agencies 12 the ses consists of seni or executive service positions 5 usc 2101a senior executive service position is defined in 5 usc 3132a2 13 the term political employee sometimes is used as co lloquial expression that refers to several subtypes of employees for examples of statutory use of the term however see 5 usc 9803 and 49 usc 106 see also 5 usc 4508a2 for use of the term senior politically appointed officer political appointees sometimes are referred to as appointed or noncareer employees for di scussion of some types of political appointees see crs report rl34706 federal personnel conversion of employees from appointed noncareer positions to career positions in the executive branch by barbara l schwemle 14 these employees are in the excepted service which is defined at 5 usc 2103 although this report does not cover these

order to ensure that merit system principles are applied consistently across the federal government and that the executive branch has the ability to collect information about its workforce 21 opm receives data from agencies about most of the federal civilian workforce and maintains much of the data in electronic databases including the central personnel data file cpdf22 however as is the case with most large sources of data in the public and private sectors the resources that are available for easily extracting and presenting data can be limited for example some information from the cpdf is available in an online database that is administered by opm 23 cpdf data about awards however appear to be available only from 1 special runs on the cpdf performed by opm or other entities that have copy of the cpdf or 2 publications issued by opm in addition in light of current methods of recording and reporting data and existing information technology infrastructure the accuracy of some data in these databases cannot be guaranteed24 otherwise members and committees of congress have sometimes relied for access to this information on direct requests of agencies or field studies by the government accountability office gao 25 that said some longterm efforts are underway to among other things make agency workforce data more accessible26 21 executive order 13197 governmentwide

clinton administration policy and again allowed awards to be given to political appointees under title 5 provisions all awards must be based on substantial work achievements that go well beyond the performance of routine duties political appointees should be judged and rewarded in the same manner as career employees due to the sensitivity of this parity issue i ask you to personally review any awards proposed for political appointees the memorandum outlined basic eligibility criteria including that schedule c employees are eligible for performancebased cash awards and ther awards in the form of cash time off or nonmonetary items to recognize contributions to government economy efficiency or effectiveness the memorandum also noted that noncareer ses employees are eligible for awards based on contributions to government economy efficiency or effectiveness but are not eligible for ses performance bonuses finally the memorandum stated that qsis can be used to reward political appointees if an employee receives the highest performance rating that an agency uses and meets any other criteria set by your agency the card memorandum reportedly was not disclosed until media

data show disparities between politically appointed and career ses employees in terms of the percentage of employees receiving the highest level performance ratings performance ratings for career ses employees tend to correlate strongly with the magnitude of awards this tendency suggests the possibility that the performance ratings of politically appointed ses employees may have implications for

this row are derived by crs from opm report s by s ubt racting ca reer ses n um bers f rom career noncareer and limited term ses employees n um bers data in the table cover the time period during which the ses pay for performance system has operated part of the motivation behind the new pay system was to address perceptions of too high of percentage of ses employees receiving the highest level rating55 which may explain decreasing percentages of employees receiving these ratings figures in table 2 for politically appointed ses employees which crs derived from other data in opm reports show that the percentage of politically appointed ses employees rated at the highest level has consistently exceeded the percentage of career ses employees it is not clear why these differences exist however as noted above differences in career ses employee performance ratings have been shown to be associated with considerably higher average awards in fy2007 for example the most highly rated career ses employees received an average performance award of 15051 in agencies that have five rating levels and 17140 in agencies that have four rating levels 56 these figures compared with average performance awards of 8615 and 7022 respectively for career ses employees rated at the next lower level although politically appointed ses employees are not eligible for these ses performance awards 5 usc 5384a1 politically appointed ses employees are eligible for salary adjustments under the pay for performance system as well as other kinds of awards discussed earlier however these salary adjustments and additional kinds of awards for which politically appointed ses employees are eligible did not appear to be within the scope of opms reports in sum it is not clear from publicly available data whether comprehensive look at awards and salary adjustments for politically appointed ses employee s would show higher or lower average levels of award and salary adjustment compensation comp ared with career ses employees however if the award amounts that politically appointed ses employees receive are similar to those of career ses employees in relation to their performance ratings eg 15051 at the highest level and 8615 at the next lower level the consistently higher incidence of top performance ratings for ses political appointees may indicate that pol itically appointed ses employees receive higher average amounts for awards than career employees receive g515g345g20g516g561g11g151g140g142g151g157g146g159g142g156 g561 statutory provisions that

detail they also direct opm to prescribe by regulation much of how the incentives are to be implemented implementing regulations are found in three subparts of 5 cfr part 575 subpart recruitment incentives 5 cfr 575101 et seq subpart b relocation incentives 5 cfr 575201 et seq and subpart c retention incentives 5 cfr 575301 et seq the 3r incentives are discussed below in four sections the first section focuses on eligibility requirements in statute and regulation that are common to each of the incentive types the second section discusses several procedural aspects of how incentive payments are to be implemented that are broadly similar among the three incentives the third section provides an overview of each incentive types distinctive parameters and payment amounts which differ from each other finally the fourth section discusses common source of data about the 3r incentives the report presents topics in this sequence because each section introduces terms and concepts that are used in subsequent sections 58 g5g152g150g150g152g151g561g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561

3r incentive authorities in chapter 57 share the same statutory eligibility requirements two types of eligible employees are identified in statute first payment to gs employees is authorized by 5 usc 5753a for recruitment and retention incentives and by 5 usc 5754a for retention incentives second the same statutory provisions authorize incentive payments to be made to employees in category approved by the office of personnel management at the request of the head of an executive agency the latter authority gives opm considerable flexibility to allow the payment of incentives but also embodies an institutional check against overuse of discretion by executive agencies 59 opm maintains an online listing of agencies that have requested and received opm approval to offer 3r incentives along with corresponding employee categories and dates of approval60 some statutorily eligible employees work in legislative branch agencies therefore opms implementing regulations include within the definition of agency an executive agency or legislative branch agency included in 5 usc 5102a1 5 cfr 575102 575202 and 575302 statutory provisions also identify three types of employeesall of which are political appointees in executive agencieswho may not receive these incentive payments 5 usc 5753a and 5754a specifically an incentive payment may not be made to an individual who is appointed to or who holds pas position 58 opms guidance and explanations for agencies on each of the 3r incentives is available at httpwwwopmgovoca pay the third section draws some text verbatim from these online resources 59 an institutional check refers to the situation when congre ss delegates authority to an agency but also ensures that one or more additional agencies or entities can veto or block the

federal employee who might otherwise leave one government agency for another within the same geographic area second the sense of congress provision expressed the sense that the director of opm should

has been customized to individual agencies and workforces eg doctors nurses law enforcement officers75 it also has been increasingly decentralized in execution the civil service typically is described as divided into three separate services the competitive rvice the excepted service and the ses the competitive service has its statutory basis in the general personnel laws of title 5 and specifically title 5s appointment provisions the ses has it s own customized appointment provisions in title 5 employees who are in the excepted service work in agencies or organizations that operate outside of title 5s appointment provisions76 different statutory provisions relating to hiring pay awards and labormanagement relations may apply to these workforces or portions of these workforces at the same time functions once performed by opm or centralized offices have been delegated to agencies or contracted out an implication of this customization and decentralization is that pay award and incentive authorities available to specific agencies and workforces may differ substantially across government title 5 award and incentive authorities have wide coverage across agencies and workforces perhaps as recognition of this diversity congress granted extensive flexibility and discretion to agencies under these chapter 45 and chapter 57 provisions to customize award and incentive practices to fit agency missions environments and resource levels it may be fair to ask however for any given agency or workforce whether these authoritiesalone or in combination with agency or workforcespecific carve out authoritiesgive agencies the capabilities they need in order to properly recruit motivate reward and retain highperforming workforces how would one make such an assessment for example how do these award and incentive authorities relate to an agencys pay systems and alternative award and incentive authorities to what extent does an agency offer intrinsic rewards and incentives eg autonomy professional development in addition to extrinsic ones eg involving monetary compensation what is the proper balance between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards in specific agency or workforce situation such issues typically would require case bycase analysis in light of an agencys or workforces circumstances and mission furthermore related issues frequently arise in the context of such questions including questions of how agencies actually are using their authorities why they use them in these ways nd how best to balance agency flexibility with oversight and accountability

management capacities or resource levels may need to be studied or changed to address emerging challenges inside an agency or outside the agency in its policy environment without study and investigation however it may be difficult to identify the true sources of problems for example to what extent is retention problem within part of an agencys workforce function of competition from nongovernmental employers what is the basis for the attractiveness of alternative places of employment does the competition derive primarily from intrinsic factors extrinsic factors or both if salary competition is major source of competition is an agency using awards or incentives to compensate for perceived lack of competitiveness alternatively are recruitment or retention problems more symptom of outmoded management practices program design or organizational structures more broadly are awards and incentives being used in ways that would be viewed as appropriate and legitimate by oversight institutions and stakeholders eg opm congress and the public for example are employees who receive retention incentives truly likely to leave federal service without the incentive payments how are such determinations made to what extent are awards and incentives being used to cope with increasing pay compression in civil service basic pay due to pay caps linked to the executive schedule 77 or are they being used as salary enhancements for privileged segments of an agencys workforce in the case of awards is the performance appraisal system that underlies an agencys award decisions valid the system measures aspects of performance under an employees control that reflect relevant job characteristics and are free from contaminating factors outside the employees control reliable eg different raters would agree on criteria and determinations and free from bias eg free from rating errors such as leniency severity central tendency or halo effects 78 the way in which systems of oversight and regulation are structured within agencies and the executive branch may help provide answers to questions like the ones posed above

agencies and the executive branch for example congress frequently has provided for institutional checks within agencies and the executive branch as noted earlier an institutional check refers to the

however it is unclear whether opm has ever revoked or suspended an agencys authority to offer incentives when well designed an institutional check may produce information that might galvanize action to address problems without need for congress ional intervention and involve other parties in decision making when one party may not be fully relied upon to act in the public interest when acting alone or behind closed doors related issues for congress may involve whether and how to create institutional checks within an agency or within the executive branch to ensure that laws are executed faithfully to congressional intent on one hand institutional checks may create additional bureaucratic hurdles that result in some inefficiency and frustration on the other hand institutional checks may not result in unnecessary red tape and may be judged necessary in order to avoid abuses and management dysfunctions and promote the accomplishment of agency missions and goals congress also has established oversight and regulatory capacity in agencies and the executive branch through the use of planning transparency and reporting requirements such requirements also may address issues of congressional oversight g7g161g142g155g140g146g156g146g151g144g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561 it has become widely recognized that congress does not have resources to pursue indepth oversight and investigations into all areas of public policy and management that some observers might wish 80 with an increasingly customized and decentralized civil service system these issues may be especially relevant to hr authorities and practices including those related to employee awards and incentives how then might congress exercise oversight over civil service system that is increasingly fragmented in making this assessment congress may decide that current statutes and practices provide for sufficient oversight however if congress determines that additional avenues of transparency and oversight about employee awards and incentives should be explored eg along with corresponding workforce authorities and practices several options might be considered in general congress needs information about the condu ct of federal agencies in order to fulfill its constitutional obligations two challenges appear to be the most significant in this regard for employee awards and incentives 1 efficiently and accurately identifying the governing award and incentive authorities for specific agencies workforces and other groups of employees including carve out provisions inside and outside of title 5 and 2 getting timely and specific data on agency practices and utilization of these authorities for example the incidence of chapter 45 awards appears to have received little attention in publicly available documents from opm for several years data on awards to political appointees also appears to be sparse at least publicly 80 ibid and mathew d mccubbins and thomas schwartz congressional oversight overlooked police patrols versus fire alarms american journal of political science vol 28 february 1984 pp 165179 arguably in response to these challenges congress expanded the number and types of general management laws that cover myriad aspects of federal management in order to provide enhanced oversight tools and mechanisms oftentimes through public transparency and participation requirements that allow noncongressional observers to raise flags for congresss attention in case problems are perceived for

establish more formal reporting requirements for opm and agencies eg make permanent the reporting requirements for 3r incentives that were included in the federal workforce flexibility act of 2004 another option might be to focus on longterm information technology solutions to matters of data availability and accuracy another might be to amend 5 usc 1103c which requires opm to design set of systems including appropriate metrics for assessing the management of human capital by federal agencies to require agencies and opm to provide desired information in an accessible format to congress and the public opms implementation of the statute from enactment of the provision through 2008 appeared to produce information primarily for the use of opm and entities within the executive branch under the george w bush administrations presidents management agenda pma with little public disclosure of opms detailed evaluations of agency information 81 third option might be to conduct oversight hearings to influence agency practices and prompt the release of information fourth option might be to more formally require agency and opm reporting on subjects of congressional interest perhaps including summary or detailed statistics or specific documents g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 clinton t brass analyst in government organization and management cbrasscrslocgov 74536 81 opm has used the human capital assessment and accountability framework hcaaf to comply with 5 usc 1103c per opm establishment of the hcaaf and its related standards and metrics fulfills opms mandate under the chief human capital officers act of 2002 chco act as codified at 5 usc 1103 c and implemented under subpart b of 5 cfr 250 to design systems and set standards including appropriate metrics for assessing the management of human capital by federal agencies see httpwwwopmgovhcaaf_resource_center22asp in 2008 opm issued regulations to implement the statutory requirements that are located at 5 cfr part 250 however opm did not mandate that the plans and reports that are required by the regulation be posted online 73
