leaders through popular par ticipation in elections also political powers are separated and exercised by institutions that check and balance each others powers hence impairing tyranny of power democracies generally have free market economies which depend upon the rule of law and private property rights the rule of law is assured through an independe nt judicial and legal system the accountability of government officials to the citizenry is assured most importantly through elections that are freely compet ed and fairly conducted an informed electorate is assured through the governments obligation to publicize its activities termed transparency and the citizenrys freedom of expression6 in contrast in an authoritarian state the leadership rules with wide and arbitrary latitude in the political sphere but interferes somewhat less in economic and social affairs the government strictly limits opposition activitie s and citizens are not able to change leaders by electoral means rather than legitimizing its rule by appealing to an elaborate ideology an authoritarian regime boasts to its citizenry that it provides safety security and order7 some theorists have delineated political system with mixed features of democracy and authoritarianism they label managed democracy8 in managed democracy the leaders use government re sources and manipulation to ensure that they will not be defeated in elections although they permit mocratic institutions and groups to function to l imited extent9 presidential advisor vladislav surkov and the propresidential united

president and then presidential candida marked the reversal of democratization rather than the consolidation of regular pluralistic processes popular choice p 223russia certainly has made some progress in democratization since the soviet period the extent of progress however and the direction of recent trends are subject to dispute democratization has faced myriad challenges including former president boris yeltsins violent faceoff with the legislature in 1993 and recurring conflict in the breakaway chechnya region such challenges virtually all analysts agree have hindered russia from becomin g fullyfledged or consolidated democracy in terms of the above definiti on some analysts have viewed putin as making decisions that have diverted ru ssia further away from democracy but they have argued that the country is not yet fu lly authoritarian and ma be described as managed democracy11 others insist that he is clearly antagonistic toward democracy not least because he launched s ecurity operations in chechnya that have resulted in wide scale human rights abuses and civilian casualties12 the ngo freedom house claims that russia under putin has suffered the greatest reversal among the postsoviet states in democratic freedoms and warns that the main danger to russias future political stability and continued economic growth is an overly repressive state13 other observers agree with putin that st ability is necessary to build democracy he stresses that the governments first priority is to deal with terrorism and other threats to sovereignty and rritorial integrity such as corruption some suggest that such strong state may be compatible with free market economic growth trends in democratization the 20032004 legislative and pr esidential election cycle most analysts agree that russias democr atic progress was une ven at best during the 1990s and that the 20032004 cycle of legi slative and presidential elections and subsequent elections in 20052006

examples where the putin administration appeared to manipulat local elections included the 2003 st petersburg mayoral race and elections of the regional heads in ingushetia and chechnya voters elected

president putin called for the state council conclave of federal officials and heads of regions to consider procedures that would give the dominant regional party voice in the presidential appointment

namely democratization authoritari anism or middle ground that many observers term managed democracy another possible scenario perhaps considered as an interlude is period of chaotic instability that may occur if president putin steps down in 2008 the breakup of russia also termed the failed state scenario is deemed by many observers to be less lik ely and is not examined here but has been advanced by putin as justification for his political changes79 the main question in considering the scenarios is whether the current level of managed democracy can endure for some time or whether it is stage on the way to either more democratization or more authoritarianism implications include how the level of democratization may affect the economy and foreign policy80 scenarios for russias political evolution managed democracy scenarios of managed democracy usually envisage the continuation of current policies that hinder democratization eventually according to some analysts russia may re sume democratizati on or it may become authoritarian others warn that managed democracy could persist indefinitely with political processes sometimes leaning toward greater management and sometimes toward greater democracy but not leading to fundamental changes in policy or personnel those who view recent politics as managed democracy suggest that putin prevented public debate during the 20032004 duma and presidential elections of problems facing russia such as chechny and privatization that might have resulted in different elect oral choices and

regional ethnic economic bureau cratic and other groups have been strong impediments to putin s exercise of more power putin has used revenues generated by high world il prices as largesse to these groups to placate them rather than using the funds to further democratic and market economy reforms such standoff could persist fo r some years even if putin steps down in 2008 but eventually democratic activ ism and economic velopments could threaten this fragile system of rule82 other observers assert that putin is necessarily stifling some democratization in order to pursue economic reforms that w ould be threatened by populism they suggest that popular demands for prosecutin g the oligarchs and other businessmen renationalizing assets and resurrecting soviet era price controls and social subsidies would have been irresistible if democratic institutions functioned freely they also caution that ultranationalists and comm unists might have garnered dangerous electoral power in this sense they claim russia has the level of democratization typical of many developing countries eventually according to this view popular prejudice against free markets legacy of sovietera propaganda will abate as the economy grows and putin or his succe ssors can permit greater democratization83 another view at least somewhat supportiv of putins beslan proposals is that they are necessary to combat terrorism and do not fundamenta lly set back russian democratization according to this view russia will continue to cooperate with the united states on the global war on terror and issues such as nonproliferation although differences on some foreign polic issues may occur such as russias criticism of us operations in iraq analyst dmitriy simes has suggested that putins beslan

that putin is much less democratic than former russian president boris yeltsin are overblown the political system is better run in several respects than it was under yeltsin free market economy is still developing and russia has not become an imperial state85 in contrast analyst anders aslund has viewed the putin era as interrupting russias substantial moveme nt toward democracy and market

freedom house has argued similarly that the increasing level of governmental corruption under putins rule is linked to the declin ing accountability of the government to its citizens87 several analysts have argued that russias heavy reliance on oil and gas for economic growth and budgetary revenues supports managed democracy of sort found in similar economies such as venezuel azerbaijan and ka zakhstan analyst lilia shevtsova asserts that the ru ssias energybased economic boom has tranquilized the putin administration so that it simply s honed rather than challenged the principles that hold the postcommunist russian system together personified power the dominance of the bureaucracy great power ideology and state control of all significant property88 some observers suggest that younger educated russians are more likely to support democracy so that generational tur nover eventually will end the current era of managed democracy many current officials spent their formative years and careers in the soviet era and hence may be attuned to authoritarianism but the numbers of such officials will decline with in decade or so although in the near term they may cling to power other observers are more pessimistic about this support for democratization c iting polls supposedly indicating that younger russians may be more worldly than their elders and value freedom over equality but are not yet committed to the basic values of human rights tolerance and constitutional liberalism in the 20032004 elections these young russians appeared to support united russia or zhirinovskiys liberal democr atic party rather than liberal parties89 authoritarianism some analysts view current political developments in russia as marking the descent to undemocra tic rule in

georgia and ukraine91 analysts who blame lagging democratiza tion in part on the soviet legacy point to the high percentage of russian offici als that are holdovers from the soviet period or received training in sovietera orga nizational methods these officials have feared democratization and have worked to substantially undermine it according to this view92 russian sociologist olga krysht anovskaya argues that these holdover officials have relied on ideologicallykindr ed security police and military personnel the socalled siloviki or strong ones to retain pow er and have elevated them to many posts she asserts that about 60 of putins top advisors are siloviki about 20 of the duma and over 30 of govern ment officials researcher mikhail tsypkin has reported that about onethird of the deputy ministers in the government are siloviki who continue to be paid by their ag encies at the regional level even if security officials do not hold governor ships many hold deputy governorships kryshtanovskaya alleges the siloviki are attuned to order and obedience to authority and view pluralism and free markets as chaotic kryshtanovskaya warns and they will work to ensure that they remain in power following the upcoming 20072008 cycle of duma and presidential elections93 tsypkin has speculated that the federal security service is in charge of voting machines and computerized votecounting in russia giving the siloviki final control over election results94 another proposed reason for authoritarian tendencies is that ageless cultural factors predispose russians to seek vozhd

predispositions favor ing allpowerful leaders change analyst christopher marsh has argued that despite the authoritari an legacy of thousand years of tsarist and communist party rule in russia some cultural aspirations for democracy have developed and form basis for further democratization98 while many observers acknowledge that moves by the putin administration to raise barriers to political participation can reinforce political cultu re of passivity they point to the popular color revolutions in georgia and ukraine as evidence that this vicious circle can be broken these analysts suggest that as the civil society matures prompted by the growth of the middle class russians will rewrite the constitution and otherwise restructure their political system to create more democratic balance

monetization reforms but postponed elimina ting some inkind benefits and greatly boosted budgetary funding for cash payments in january 2005 putin partly justified the elimination of direct

observers argue that there has been close relationship between domestic and foreign policy in russia so us policymakers must try to encourage pluralism and discourage authoritarianism they maintain that when the soviet union of which russia was part was communist it opposed the west and as it began to democratize its foreign policy became more accommodationist these observers argue that prospective russian dictator would need to rely on the military and security forces to maintain power these forces have lagged the most in adopting democratic values and continue to favor antiamerican foreign policies that if implemented would threaten us national security interests139 such policies conceivably might include hostile nuclear strategic posture steppedup proliferation of arms and wmd

in chechnya and elsewhere in russia144 others reject the view that us democratization aid can only be of marginal effectiveness in russia they argue that some of the assistance has proven beneficial and that there would be much more of positive effect if the aid were increased these observers suggest that such aid will serve us interests because russia will ultimately become more coope rative partner to the west they warn against any reduction of such aid at the present time because russias civil society is too fragile to stand on its own in the face of threats from the russian government these observers claim that us diploma tic and public expre ssions of concern to russia about its democra tic policies should be ma tched by an active us democratization aid effort in particular they
