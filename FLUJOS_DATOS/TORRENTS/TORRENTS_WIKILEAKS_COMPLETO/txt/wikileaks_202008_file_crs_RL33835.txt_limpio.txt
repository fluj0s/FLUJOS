6 2008 gerald mayer analyst in labor policy domestic social policy division real earnings health insurance and pension coverage and the distribution of earnings 19792007 summary from 1979 to 2007 there were differences between men and women in the level and growth in real earnings and in employmentbased health insurance and pension coverage earnings and benefit coverage also differed between persons who work fulltime yearround and all working persons all workers from 1979 to 2007 average real weekly earnings for all workers increased by 259 earnings increased at all earnings levels with workers at the 95th percentile receiving the largest increase 394 the earnings gap between men and women narrowed the earnings of lower and middlewage men ie at the 20th 40th and 60th percentiles were relatively unchanged but the earnings of women increased at all earnings levels inequality increased from 1979 to 2007 the top 5 of earners gained larger share of earnings other workers received smaller share workers with higher earnings are more likely to have employmentbased health insurance and pension coverage from 1979 to 2007 participation in pension plan increased for lowerwage workers but decreased for higherwage workers the increase among lowerwage workers was due entirely to greater participation among women from 1987 to 2007 health insurance coverage fell for workers at all earnings levels the decline was greatest among lowerwage workers ie at the 1st quintile among middlewage workers ie at the 2nd 3rd and 4th quintiles the decline in coverage was greater for men than women in brief from 1979 to 2007 the real weekly earnings of lower and middlewage men were relatively unchanged and they lost health insurance coverage and most lost pension coverage among lowerand middlewage women real weekly earnings and pension participation improved but they lost health insurance coverage fulltime yearround workers from 1979 to 2007 the real weekly earnings of fulltime yearround workers rose by 137 earnings increased at all earnings levels with the largest increase going to workers at the 95th percentile 288 the earnings gap between men and women who work fulltime yearround narrowed the earnings of men at the 20th and 40th percentiles fell while the earnings of women increased at all earnings levels inequality increased as the highest paid workers ie top quintile gained larger share of earnings for workers employed fulltime yearround health insurance coverage fell at all earnings levels from 1987 to 2007 the decline in coverage was greatest for lower and middlewage workers and greater for lower and middlewage men than women except for the highest earning workers ie top 5 pension coverage fell at all earnings levels among lower and middlewage workers pension coverage declined among men but was relatively unchanged among women thus lowerwage men who worked fulltime yearround experienced both decline in real earnings and lower pension and health insurance coverage the real earnings of lowerwage women improved but their pension coverage was unchanged and they lost health insurance coverage this report will be updated periodically

real earnings and the distribution of earnings are indicators of nations economic wellbeing changes in the level of real earnings ie actual earnings adjusted for inflation show how workers buying power has risen or fallen over time changes in the distribution of earnings show how the buying power of different workers has changed over time real earnings and the distribution of earnings affect several public policy issues when wages rise with productivity increased earnings can expand the social security taxable wage base which can reduce the future need for higher social security payroll taxes or cuts in benefits higher earnings can also help pay for future medicare benefits conversely lower earnings can make it more difficult to finance the social security and medicare programs the level of real earnings can affect the national poverty rate and therefore federal spending on welfare and assistance for food housing healthcare and energy the federal minimum wage can affect the real earnings of lowerwage workers as well as the overall distribution of earnings in large part real earnings depend on the amount of investment per worker in the form of both human capital eg education and healthcare and physical capital eg computers and other equipment investment depends on personal business and government saving thus federal budget deficits or surpluses can affect the national saving rate and the amount of investment per worker government spending and tax policy can also affect earnings federal support for research and development can affect real earnings through the development of new goods and services and more productive technologies tax policy can affect decisions to save and invest as well as the aftertax distribution of earnings policies that affect personal saving and the availability of private pension benefits can impact retirement income and reliance on social security benefits policies that influence the availability of private health insurance can affect federal spending on healthcare rules on immigration can affect both real earnings and the distribution of earnings an increased supply of unskilled foreign workers can lower the wages of lessskilled us workers and increase inequality conversely an increased supply of skilled foreign workers can lower the wages of skilled american workers and reduce inequality similarly trade policy can affect both real earnings and the crs2 distribution of earnings increased imports from lowwage countries can raise the living standards of us households but affect the wages of domestic workers who produce competing goods and services increased exports of goods produced in the united states can raise the wages of american workers finally differences in earnings among racial or ethnic groups or extremes in inequality can affect popular support for major social political and economic institutions organization of report this report examines the trends in real weekly earnings and the distribution of weekly earnings in the united states from 1979 to 2007 the report provides separate analyses for men and women1 the report begins with definition of earnings and summary of the findings in the report next the paper discusses broad policies to increase real earnings or reduce inequality the final section of the report provides detailed summary of the findings the report analyzes individual earnings study of individual income or of family earnings or income may reach different conclusions2 the report does not review research on the causes of changes in real earnings or inequality3 the definition of earnings the results of an analysis of real earnings and the distribution of earnings are affected by the definition of earnings whose earnings are studied eg all workers fulltime workers primeage workers or others the measure of inequality and the time period studied earnings are payments that individuals receive for their labor services individuals may be paid for period of time worked eg an hourly wage or weekly salary or the quantity of goods or services produced eg piece rate earnings 1 in addition to real earnings and the distribution of earnings economists also study earnings mobility or how the earnings of given sample of workers change over time because of mobility the distribution of lifetime earnings may differ from the distribution of annual or weekly earnings 2 earnings account for the largest share of individual and family income 3 hearings during the first session of the 110th congress examined the trends and causes of inequality see us congress house committee on ways and means hearing on the economy january 23 2007 available at httpwaysandmeanshousegov us congress house committee on education and labor

january 31 2007 available at httpjecsenategov crs3 may be defined as cash wages or as total compensation the latter consists of cash wages plus fringe benefits such as employerprovided health insurance employer contributions to retirement plan and paid sick leave and vacations the results of an analysis of individual earnings would differ from study of individual compensation or individual income or of family earnings or income4 many individuals and families receive cash or inkind benefits from sources other than work eg interest dividends rent cash welfare assistance refundable tax credits or inkind benefits such as food housing healthcare or energy assistance5 some families have more wage earners than other families this report analyzes individual weekly earnings where earnings consist of cash wages before taxes or other deductions individual earnings consist of total annual earnings from all jobs weekly earnings are annual earnings divided by the number of weeks worked the analysis includes wage and salary workers and selfemployed workers ages 16 and older because there are differences in the labor market characteristics of men and women the earnings of men and women are analyzed separately6 the analysis uses data from the annual social and economic asec supplement to the current population survey cps the cps is household survey conducted by the census bureau for the bureau of labor statistics bls the annual supplement asks workers how much they earned the previous year thus the 2008 supplement collected earnings information for 2007 the appendix includes fuller explanation of the data and methodology used in this report finally the report analyzes the earnings of two groups of workers 1 all workers and 2 workers employed fulltime yearround all workers include persons employed either fulltime or parttime as well as workers who worked either part of the year or all year fulltime workers are persons who work 35 or more hours week yearround workers are persons who work 50 or more weeks year 4 the distribution of earnings may change even though the distribution of total compensation does not change eg if workers choose to receive greater or smaller share of compensation as wages or if employers raise or lower their contributions for health insurance or retirement benefits for analyses of the distribution of household income see crs report rs20811 the distribution of income by brian w cashell crs report rl32639 inequality in the distribution of income trends and international comparisons by brian w cashell and us department of commerce bureau of the census income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2005 p60231 august 2006 available at httpwwwcensusgovprod2006pubsp60231pdf 5 the results of an analysis of the distribution of earnings would differ from an analysis of the distribution of income if income from transfer payments or from savings and investments rise or fall in addition change in nonlabor income may affect earnings ie decisions to work or how much to work 6 in general women tend to work fewer hours per week than men spend less time in the labor force and enter and leave the labor force more often than men the distribution of women by occupation and industry also differs from men see crs report 98278 the gender wage gap and pay equity is comparable worth the next step by linda levine crs4 analyzing the earnings of fulltime yearround workers helps control for changes in hours worked per week temporary and seasonal employment and spells of unemployment from 1979 to 2007 the percentage of workers employed full time yearround increased by 122 percentage points from 564 in 1979 to 686 in 2007 see figure 1 the percentage of workers employed fulltime and the percentage of workers employed both fulltime and yearround tend to dip during recessions from 1979 to 2007 there were recessions from january to july 1980 july 1981 to november 1982 july 1990 to march 1991 and march to november

2001 recession comparison to earlier recoveries and possible explanations by marc labonte and linda levine crs5 summary of findings all workers from 1979 to 2007 the average real weekly earnings ie earnings adjusted for inflation of all workers increased by 259 earnings increased for workers at all percentiles8 the increase was greatest for workers at the 95th percentile 394 at all earnings levels from 1979 to 2007 men earned more than women but during the 28year period the earnings of women increased more than the earnings of men thus the earnings gap between men and women narrowed over the period from 1979 to 2007 the increase in earnings among lower and middlewage workers ie workers at the 20th 40th and 60th percentiles was due mainly to higher earnings among women the earnings of men at these percentiles were relatively unchanged up by 36 down by 29 and up by 34 respectively but the earnings of women at these percentiles increased by 435 378 and 449 respectively the cps has consistent information on health insurance coverage from 1987 to the present workers with higher earnings are more likely to have employmentbased health insurance coverage however from 1987 to 2007 the percentage of workers with employmentbased health insurance coverage declined at all quintiles9 from 1987 to 2007 the decline in health insurance coverage was greatest for lowerwage workers ie workers at the first quintile coverage declined among both men and women but among middlewage workers ie workers at the second third and fourth quintiles the decline in coverage was greater for men than women workers with higher earnings are more likely than lowerwage workers to participate in an employer or union provided pension plan relative to higherwage workers however participation among lowerwage workers in pension plan improved from 1979 to 2007 the improved participation among lowerwage workers was due entirely to increased participation among women 8 if workers are ranked from lowest to highest paid workers at the 20th percentile earn more than 20 of workers workers at the 40th percentile earn more than 40 of workers and so on 9 if workers are ranked from lowest to highest paid and then divided into five equalsize groups each group is quintile crs6 from 1979 to 2007 participation among middlewage men in an employerbased pension plan fell but increased among middlewage women as measured by the gini coefficient inequality increased among all workers over the period from 1979 to 2007 inequality increased among both men and women from 1979 to 2007 periods of rising inequality were followed by periods of falling inequality inequality fell from 2005 to 2007 inequality increased more among men and women when analyzed separately than among men and women analyzed together although overall inequality declined from 2005 to 2007 among women it increased from 2005 to 2006 and then declined from 2006 to 2007 from 1979 to 2007 the rise in inequality was due mainly to the growth in the share of total weekly earnings received by the top 5 of earners and the decline in the share of earnings received by other workers from 1979 to 2007 the share of total earnings received by the top 5 of earners increased by 26 percentage points during the period when inequality increased it was generally because the top 5 of earners received larger share of earnings while other workers received smaller share conversely when inequality declined it was generally because the top 5 of workers received smaller share of earnings and other workers received larger share fulltime yearround workers from 1979 to 2007 the average real weekly earnings of fulltime yearround workers increased by 137 earnings increased at all earnings levels the largest increase 288 occurred among workers at the 95th percentile during the 28year period the earnings of lowerwage men ie men at the 20th and 40th percentiles employed fulltime yearround fell by 97 and 69 respectively conversely the earnings of women at the 20th and 40th percentiles increased by 73 and 252 respectively at all earnings levels the earnings of women increased more than the earnings of men thus as was the case with the category of all workers the gap narrowed between the earnings of men and women employed fulltime yearround higher earning fulltime yearround workers are more likely than lowerwage workers to be covered by an employmentbased health insurance plan nevertheless from 1987 to 2007 health insurance coverage declined at all earnings levels the decline in coverage was greatest for lowerwage workers crs7 during the 20year period from 1987 to 2007 health insurance coverage declined among both men and women employed fulltime yearround but the decrease was greater for lower and middle wage men ie men at the first four quintiles than among lower and middlewage women higherwage fulltime yearround workers are more likely than lowerwage workers to participate in an employer or union provided pension plan however except for the top 5 of earners participation declined at all earnings levels from 1979 to 2006 from 1979 to 2007 participation by lower and middlewage men in an employmentbased pension plan declined more than among lower and middlewage women at the lowest quintile participation among men fell by 87 percentage points compared to 33 percentage point decline among women participation fell among men at the second third and fourth quintiles but was relatively unchanged among women the distribution of earnings among workers employed fulltime yearround is more equal than the distribution of earnings among all workers nevertheless from 1979 to 2007 inequality increased among fulltime yearround workers periods of greater equality were followed by periods of rising inequality from 2006 to 2007 the distribution of earnings became more equal inequality among women employed fulltime yearround is significantly lower than inequality among men but inequality among men and women analyzed separately increased more from 1979 to 2007 than inequality among men and women combined over the period from 1979 to 2007 the top quintile of earners received larger share of total weekly earnings while the first four quintiles received smaller share from 1979 to 2007 the share of earnings received by the top 5 of earners increased by 15 percentage points similar to the pattern among all workers when inequality increased among fulltime yearround workers the share of earnings received by the bottom four quintiles generally fell while the share of earnings received by the top quintile especially the top 5 generally rose conversely when equality improved the opposite occurred crs8 policies to increase real earnings or reduce inequality variety of policies are available to increase real earnings or reduce earnings inequality policies to increase real earnings may differ from policies to reduce inequality in some cases the policies may conflict some of the policies may have mainly shortterm effects other policies may require longerterm commitment real earnings productivity real earnings rise with increased productivity policies to increase productivity may include plans to raise both private and public saving increase capital investment per worker expand investment in human capital eg education training and healthcare and encourage the development of technology technological innovation may include improved equipment the introduction of new products or improved methods of production transportation or communication10 economic efficiency another way to increase real earnings is to improve economic efficiency according to standard economic theory competitive markets generally result in the most efficient allocation of resources where resources consist of individuals with different skills capital goods eg computers machinery and buildings and natural resources more efficient allocation of resources generally results in greater total output and consumer satisfaction economic efficiency can be improved through policies that provide consumers with greater access to goods and services eg improved infrastructure to exchange goods and services and expanded trade and better allocation of labor and capital eg neutral tax policies migration or the deregulation of labor product or other markets inequality inequality may be reduced using either direct or indirect policies direct policies include income transfer programs indirect policies consist of plans that improve the incomeproducing human capital of lowerskilled workers eg education training or healthcare efforts to reduce inequality may involve tradeoff however with policies to improve economic efficiency indirect policies inequality can be reduced with policies that reduce the relative supply of lessskilled labor increase the relative supply of skilled labor or both such policies may include improved investment in preschool grade school and high school education better adult education and improved access to healthcare 10 improved technology may allow for greater outsourcing of both manufacturing and service jobs which may or may not affect the distribution of domestic earnings see crs report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine and crs report rl32484 foreign outsourcing economic implications and policy responses by craig k elwell crs9 for lower income workers and their families inequality may also be reduced by increasing the relative supply of collegeeducated workers for example programs that lower the cost of higher education or increase educational assistance to lower income students some policies may be more cost effective than others immigration policies that allow more skilled workers fewer unskilled workers or both into the country can also reduce inequality direct policies income inequality may also be reduced through income redistribution programs these programs include policies such as progressive taxation including refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit eitc or the child tax credit ctc they also include inkind transfers of food housing healthcare and energy assistance tradeoff with economic efficiency competitive markets may allocate resources efficiently but they may result in an unequal distribution of earnings thus programs that reduce inequality may involve tradeoff with policies to improve economic efficiency some economists argue that higher minimum wage easier union organizing rules or more restrictive trade policies may reduce inequality other economists maintain that these policies may reduce total economic output and may not have significant impact on inequality similarly some economists argue that high marginal tax rates and income redistribution programs may harm economic efficiency for example high tax rates may discourage saving and investment transfer payments or other forms of nonlabor income may reduce the supply of labor ie they may affect decisions to work or how much to work macroeconomic policies fiscal and monetary policies that reduce or maintain low unemployment may also affect the distribution of earnings during an economic expansion an increase in the number of hours worked or the hourly wages of lowerwage workers may improve the relative earnings of lowerwage workers fiscal policy consists of government spending and revenue decisions monetary policy consists of actions by the federal reserve bank that affect money supply and interest rates11 the trend in real weekly earnings the remainder of this report provides detailed description of the findings summarized above this section examines the trend in real weekly earnings from 1979 to 2007 earnings are for both wage and salary workers and selfemployed workers nominal or actual earnings are adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index for all urban consumers adjusted to take into account the current methods for measuring changes in prices cpiurs an explanation of this index is provided in the appendix this section shows the trend in real weekly earnings for workers at the 20th 40th 60 80th and 95th percentiles if workers are ranked from lowest to highest paid th workers at the 20th percentile earn more than 20 of workers workers at the 40th 11 fiscal policy ie budget surpluses or deficits may also impact interest rates crs10 percentile earn more than 40 of workers and so on all of the results in this section are shown using graphs all of the data displayed in the graphs are provided in the appendix all workers from 1979 to 2007 the average real weekly earnings of all employed persons increased by 259 earnings increased for workers at all percentiles see figure 212 the increase was greatest for workers at the 95th percentile for example for workers at the 20th percentile earnings increased from 244 to 292 per week or 195 for workers at the 95th percentile earnings increased from 1587 to 2212 week or 394 from 2001 to 2007 the earnings of workers at the 95th percentile fell by 07 from 2228 to 2212 figure 2 real weekly earnings all workers 19792007 source crs analysis of data from the current population survey cps 12 because of changes in topcoding in the cps that affected the change in average earnings from 1992 to 1993 average earnings are not shown in figure 2 or in the other figures in this report that show trends in real weekly earnings since the reported change in earnings from 1992 to 1993 cannot be separated into the effects of the change in topcoding and the actual change in earnings in tables 1 and 2 the percentage change in average earnings from 1979 to 2007 is the sum of the changes in average earnings from 1979 to 1992 and from 1993 to 2007 see the discussion of topcoded earnings later in this report crs11 figures 3 and 4 show two differences in the real weekly earnings of men and women first at each percentile the earnings of men are greater than the earnings of women for example in 2007 men at the 20th percentile earned 365 week compared to 250 week for women at the 60th percentile men and women earned 900 and 635 week respectively at the 95th percentile men earned 2653 week compared to 1700 week for women over the period from 1979 to 2007 average real weekly earnings increased more for women than men 504 and 167 respectively at all earnings levels weekly earnings increased more among women than men thus over the 28year period the earnings gap between men and women narrowed at the 20th 40th and 60th percentiles the increase in earnings among all workers was due almost entirely to higher earnings among women the earnings of men at the 20th 40th and 60th percentiles were relatively unchanged up by 36 down by 29 and up by 34 respectively but for women at these percentiles earnings increased by 435 378 and 449 respectively see table 1 in the appendix the narrowing of the earnings gap between men and women may have been caused by number of factors womens relative hourly wages may have increased they may have worked more hours gains in educational attainment and work experience may have helped narrow the gap more women may have entered traditionally male occupations13 13 for more discussion on the reasons for the narrowing of the wage gap between men and women see crs report

the average real weekly earnings of fulltime yearround workers increased by 137 earnings increased at all percentiles the largest increase 288 occurred among workers at the 95th percentile the trend in real weekly earnings of workers employed fulltime yearround differs from the pattern of earnings for all workers the earnings of fulltime yearround workers are higher than the earnings of all workers compare figure 2 and figure 5 from 1979 to 2007 the earnings of workers employed fulltime yearround increased less than the earnings of all workers for example for fulltime yearround workers earnings at the 20th percentile increased by 29 compared to an increase of 195 for all workers figure 5 real weekly earnings fulltime year round workers 19792007 source crs analysis of data from the current population survey cps from 1979 to 2007 the earnings of all lowerwage men were relatively unchanged but earnings among men employed fulltime crs14 yearround fell at the 20th and 40th percentiles the earnings of all men were up by 36 and down by 29 respectively but for men employed fulltime yearround earnings fell by 97 and 69 respectively from 1979 to 2007 the earnings of lowerwage women employed fulltime yearround increased but by less than the increase in earnings among all lowerwage women as was the case with all workers the average real weekly earnings of women employed fulltime yearround increased more than the earnings of men 377 and 97 respectively at all percentiles the earnings of women working fulltime yearround increased more than the earnings of men for example compared to the decline in earnings among men at the 20th and 40th percentiles the earnings of women increased by 73 and 252 respectively compare figures 6 and 7 figure 6 real weekly

source crs analysis of data from the current population survey cps fringe benefits total compensation consists of wages and fringe benefits this section examines the trends in employmentbased health insurance and pension coverage employmentbased coverage consists of health insurance or pension plans provided by an employer or union workers who are not covered by an employmentbased health insurance plan may purchase insurance from private insurance company or they may be covered by public insurance program eg medicaid or medicare workers may also contribute to an individual retirement account ira14 this report only takes into account employerprovided health insurance and pension plans the report does not examine the cost of health insurance or the amount that employers contribute to employee retirement plans for the analysis in this section workers are divided into quintiles workers are first ranked from lowest to highest paid workers are then divided into five equal size groups or quintiles the top quintile is further divided into two groups the top 5 of earners and the top 81 to 95 of earners 14 for information on the types of iras see crs report rl31770 individual retirement accounts and 401k plans early withdrawals and required distributions by patrick purcell crs16 employmentbased health insurance the cps has consistent information on employmentbased health insurance coverage from 1987 to the present however because of changes in the survey some of the data since 1987 are not entirely comparable for example in 1994 the health insurance questions in the cps were redesigned15 these changes resulted in higher estimates of the number of persons with employmentbased health insurance the reported change in health insurance coverage between 1993 to 1994 cannot be separated into the effects of the change in the survey questions and the actual change in coverage therefore in figure 8 and figure 9 the period from 1987 to 2007 is separated into two subperiods 1987 to 1993 and 1994 to 2007 also in this section of the report and in table 3 and table 4 in the appendix the changes in coverage from 1987 to 2007 are the sum of the percentage point changes over each of the two subperiods that is the sum of the percentage point change from 1987 to 1993 and the change from 1994 to 200716 all workers four features characterize the trend in employmentbased health insurance coverage from 1987 to 200717 workers with higher earnings are more likely to have health insurance in 2007 847 of the top 5 of earners had coverage compared to 468 of workers in the lowest quintile 15 us census bureau income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2006 current population reports p60233 us govt print off august 2007 available at

coverage for the years 1996 to 2005 because of these revisions the estimated number of persons with employmentbased health insurance increased slightly this report does not take these revisions into account also in 2000 the cps added questions to verify that people who answered to all questions about specific types of insurance were actually uninsured this change also increased slightly the

insurance coverage generally declined from 1987 to the early 1990s increased or was relatively stable to about 2000 and then declined again from about 2000 to 2007 for example at the second third and fourth quintiles the percentage of workers with employmentbased health insurance declined from 1987 to 1993 increased from 1994 to 2000 and then declined from 2000 to 2007 from 2006 to 2007 coverage among all workers at the third quintile increased by statistically significant 11 percentage points over the same twoyear period coverage among women at the fourth quintile increased but decreased among women at the highest quintile ie at the 81st percentile and above see table 3 in the appendix fulltime yearround workers figure 9 shows the percentage of full time yearround workers with employmentbased health insurance workers with higher earnings are more likely to be covered by employmentbased health insurance on the other hand from 1987 to 2007 the percentage of fulltime yearround workers with employmentbased health insurance declined at all earnings levels as was the case with all workers from 1987 to 2007 the decline in coverage was greater at both the beginning and end than in the middle of the period from 1987 to 2007 the decline in insurance coverage was greatest for lower wage workers at the lowest and second quintiles coverage declined by 98 and 105 percentage points respectively compared to 47 percentage point decline among the top 5 of earners during the 20year period from 1987 to 2007 health insurance coverage declined among both men and women but the decrease was greater for lower and middlewage men ie men at the first four quintiles than for lower and middle wage women for example at the lowest quintile coverage fell by 107 percentage points among men compared to 69 percentage point drop among women at the second third and fourth quintiles coverage among men fell by 114 91 and 78 percentage points respectively among women at these quintiles

percentage points from 649 to 629 rounded20 among the top 5 of earners the improved participation of lowerwage workers was due entirely to increased participation among women at the lowest 19 the

survey cps the distribution of weekly earnings this section examines the trend in the distribution of weekly earnings from 1979 to 2007 different measures of inequality provide different information and can lead to different conclusions about the trend in the distribution of earnings most measures identify whether inequality has changed over time or whether inequality is greater among some groups of workers than among others but some measures may not reveal how inequality has changed over time or differs among groups this report uses two measures of inequality the gini coefficient and the share of total weekly earnings received by each quintile of workers together the two measures show whether the distribution of earnings has changed over time and if so how it has changed topcoded earnings to protect the confidentiality of survey participants the cps data available for public use have an earnings amount assigned to higherearning workers over time changes in these amounts or topcodes can affect the observed trend in inequality in the cps total annual earnings consist of wages and salaries as well as farm and nonfarm selfemployment income wages and salaries are further separated into crs23 earnings from workers longest job and other wage and salary earnings eg from another or second job before 1996 each source of earnings was topcoded at the same amount since 1996 each source of earnings has been given unique topcode currently the top code for earnings from workers longest job is 200000 the topcode for other wages and salaries is 35000 if someones longest job was as wage and salary worker but they also had earnings from selfemployment the topcode from selfemployment is 50000 if the income from selfemployment is from farming the topcode is 25000 before 1996 if earnings were topcoded reported earnings were the topcoded amount for example for 1995 earnings were topcoded at 99999 for anyone who earned more than 99999 the cps reported their earnings as 99999 since 1996 for workers with earnings above the topcoded amounts reported earnings are the average of earnings for workers with similar characteristics average earnings are calculated for persons based on gender race ethnicity and whether or not they work fulltime yearround for 2007 earnings from persons longest job were topcoded at 200000 for white males who worked fulltime yearround and who earned more than 200000 the cps reported average earnings of 419969 ie the average earnings of white male fulltime yearround workers who earned more than 200000 the change in 1996 in the way topcoded earnings are reported ie average earnings as opposed to the actual topcode amounts can affect the observed trend in inequality for years before 1996 several economists who were given access to internal cps data calculated average earnings for persons with earnings above the topcoded levels like average earnings above the topcoded amounts reported by the cps since 1996 the economists calculated average earnings for persons based on gender race ethnicity and whether or not they work fulltime yearround their results are reported in paper published by the national bureau of economic research nber for consistency over the period from 1979 through 2007 this report uses average earnings above the topcoded amounts as reported by the cps for the years 1996 and later and average earnings as published in the nber report for the years before 199621 because of continuing concerns about confidentiality and because of questions about the reliability of responses from persons who claim to have very high earnings internal cps data are also subject to form of topcoding between 1984 and 1985 the cap on annual earnings in the internal cps was raised from 99999 to 250000 between 1992 and 1993 the cap was raised from 299999 to 99999922 the large increase in 1993 had significant effect on the average amount of earnings for the 21 larrimore jeff richard v burkhauser shuaizhang

internal cps data from 1992 to 1993 in this report the graphical representations of the gini coefficient are separated into two periods 1979 to 1992 and 1993 to 2007 similarly in the graphs of the share of earnings received by quintile the share of earnings received by the top 5 of workers is separated into two subperiods in addition in the discussion of the change from 1979 to 2007 in the share of total weekly earnings received by the top 5 of earners the percentage point change is the sum of changes over the two subperiods gini coefficient the gini coefficient is measure of earnings equality that ranges from 0 to 1 if the earnings of all individuals are the same the gini coefficient is equal to 0 representing complete equality if one worker receives all of the earnings and all other workers receive zero earnings the gini coefficient is equal to 1 thus larger coefficient indicates greater degree of inequality more information on the gini coefficient is provided in the appendix all workers inequality increased among all workers over the period from 1979 to 2007 inequality also increased among both men and women from 1979 to 2007 periods of rising inequality were followed by periods when inequality fell in general inequality increased from 1980 to 1989 then declined slightly from 1989 to 1992 before rising again from 1993 to 1995 decline in inequality from 1995 to 1999 was offset by an increase in inequality from 1999 to 2005 inequality fell from 2005 to 2007 even within this general pattern however there were some year toyear variations in the trend in inequality see figure 12 from 1979 to 2007 inequality increased more among men and women analyzed separately than among men and women analyzed together one explanation for this difference is that at the same time that overall inequality increased the distribution of earnings among women became more similar to the distribution of earnings among men as reflected in the narrowing of earnings gap between men and women although overall inequality declined from 2005 to 2007 among women it increased from 2005 to 2006 and then declined from 2006 to 2007 crs25 figure 12 gini coefficient all workers

2007 inequality also increased among persons who work fulltime yearround periods of rising inequality were followed by periods when inequality declined from 2006 to 2007 the distribution of earnings became more equal inequality among women is significantly lower than inequality among men but inequality among men and women analyzed separately increased more than inequality among all fulltime

distribution of earnings has changed over time but it does not show where the distribution may have changed to analyze where the earnings distribution has changed this section examines the share of total weekly earnings received by each quintile of workers all workers an analysis of the share of total weekly earnings by quintile shows that inequality was greater in 2007 than in 1979 at the end of the period the top 5 of earners received larger share of total weekly earnings while other workers received smaller share for example from 1979 to 2007 the share of earnings received by the top 5 of earners increased by 26 percentage points over the 28year period when inequality increased it was generally because the top 5 of earners received larger share of total earnings while other workers received smaller share conversely when inequality declined it was generally because the top 5 of earners received smaller share of total earnings and other workers received larger share see figure 14 from 2006 to 2007 the share of total earnings received by the top 5 of workers dipped slightly from 249 to 243 changes in the share of earnings received by men and women generally followed the same pattern as the trend for all workers see table 8 in the appendix the percentage point changes over the different periods shown in table 8 match the years over which the gini coefficient increased or

increased among full time yearround workers from 1979 to 2007 over the period the top quintile of earners gained larger share of total weekly earnings while the first four quintiles received smaller share from 1979 to 2007 the share of earnings received by the top 5 of earners increased by 15 percentage points the share of earnings received by the second and third quintiles fell by 15 and 16 percentage points respectively similar to the pattern among all workers when inequality increased among fulltime yearround workers the share of earnings received by the bottom four quintiles generally decreased while the share received by the top quintile especially the top 5 of earners increased conversely when inequality fell the opposite occurred see figure 15 the same pattern generally held for both men and women inequality declined from 2006 to 2007 over the twoyear period the share of total earnings received by the top 5 of earners fell from 224 to 207 while the share of earnings received by the bottom four quintiles increased crs28 figure 15 share of total weekly earnings by quintile fulltime yearround workers 19792007 source crs analysis of data from the current population survey cps note because of changes in topcoding from 1992 to 1993 the share of earnings received by the top 5 of earners is separated into two subperiods 19791992 and 19932007 reasons for changes in the share of total weekly earnings by quintile the share of earnings received by workers at each quintile may change for many reasons the relative number of hours worked may change and relative earnings per hour may change as discussed at the beginning of this report both the percentage of workers employed fulltime and the percentage of workers employed fulltime yearround tend to fall during recessions during an economic expansion as the demand for labor increases both hours worked and earnings per hour often rise especially among lowerwage workers23 for example the data on real weekly earnings in table 1 in the appendix show that when inequality fell from 1995 to 1999 the real weekly earnings for workers at the 20th percentile increased by 123 compared to 126 increase for workers at the 95th percentile conversely when inequality increased from 1980 to 1989 earnings at the 20th percentile rose by 11 but increased 134 at the 95th percentile several other factors may also affect relative earnings the supply of and demand for workers with different skills may change changes in consumer tastes or technology may affect the demand for labor social and demographic changes 23 during an economic expansion in order to hire more workers employers may offer higher wages employers may also ask workers to work or require more overtime both of these changes would increase total weekly earnings crs29 may affect the supply of labor changes in wages may affect both the demand for and the supply of labor congress may enact policies that affect earnings for example during the period from 1979 to 2007 congress passed four laws that raised the basic federal minimum wage24 following welfare reform in 1996 the employment of single mothers increased significantly25 regulatory changes or changes in trade policy may affect earnings us firms may engage in greater outsourcing foreign companies may increase investment in the united states each of these changes may affect the distribution of workers in different occupations and industries for example the decline in manufacturing employment in the united states since 1979 when employment peaked at 194 million may have affected both wages and fringe benefits26 union membership in the united states which also peaked in 1979 at 210 million may also have affected earnings and fringe benefits27 separating the effect of each of these and other factors on earnings and fringe benefits is difficult however in addition economists may not agree on the effects of each factor 24 the first law pl 95151 raised the minimum wage in january 1979 january 1980 and january 1981 the second law pl 101157 raised the wage in april 1990 and april 1991 the third law pl 104188 raised the wage in october 1996 and september 1997 in 2007 congress enacted pl 11028 which raised the minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 an hour the minimum wage rose to 585 in july 2007 and to 655 in july 2008 it will rise to 725 an hour in july 2009

explanation of the measures of inequality used in this report it also describes the source of data and the methodology used in the report the second part of the appendix shows the data used in the text and graphs in the report measures of inequality this report uses two measures of inequality the gini coefficient and the share of earnings received by each quintile of workers gini coefficient the gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula where fi is the proportion of earners in interval i and pi is the proportion of total earnings received by earners in interval 1 and all lower intervals28 graphically the gini coefficient is illustrated in figure 16 the horizontal axis shows the percent of all earners the vertical axis shows the percent of earnings received by all earners the diagonal line represents total earnings equality for example on the diagonal line 25 of earners receive 25 of earnings 50 of earners receive 50 of earnings and so on in figure 16 the two dotted lines called lorenz curves illustrate two possible earnings distributions the gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the diagonal line and the lorenz curve and b the total area under the diagonal line the two earnings distributions in figure 16 may represent the earnings for two groups of workers or the same group of workers at different times the distribution of earnings for the first group where the gini coefficient is 163 is more equal than the distribution of earnings for the second group where the gini coefficient is 289 for the first group of workers the bottom 60 of workers receive half of all earnings the top 40 receive the other half of earnings in the second group the bottom 70 of earners receive half of all earnings the top 30 receive the other half share of total earnings by quintile to calculate the share of earnings received by each quintile of earners workers are first ranked from lowest to highest paid workers are then divided into five equalsize groups or quintiles the total earnings received by each quintile is divided by the total earnings of all workers if 28 us bureau of the census studies in the distribution of income series p60183 1992 p 60 crs31 everyones earnings were the same each quintile would receive onefifth of all earnings the greater the share of earnings received by the highest paid workers ie the top quintile or the smaller the share of earnings received by the lowest paid workers ie the lowest quintile the greater the degree of inequality in this report the top quintile of earners is further separated into two groups the top 5 of earners and the top 81 to 95 of earners data source and methodology the analysis in this report uses data from the annual social and economic asec supplement to the monthly current population survey cps the cps is household survey conducted by the us bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls of the us department of labor the monthly cps is the source of the national monthly unemployment rate and other labor force data figure 16 illustration of lorenz curves and gini coefficients for two groups of workers source illustration created by crs the asec supplement to the monthly cps asks additional questions about individual earnings for the previous year the sample is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population of the united states the sample for the supplement includes members of the armed forces living in civilian housing units on military base or in household not on military base the sample does not include persons living in institutions such as mental hospitals nursing homes or correctional facilities the 2008 supplement interviewed about 76600 households29 29 us census bureau current population survey 2008 annual social and economic continued crs32 the asec supplement collects earnings information for both wage and salary workers and selfemployed persons some workers may have both wage and salary income and selfemployment income in addition selfemployed persons may have both wages and income or loss from investment in their business eg in equipment buildings office space materials supplies and other kinds of capital since wages cannot be negative this report uses positive earnings only ie it excludes persons whose investment losses were greater than their wage but this approach may include investment losses if person combines their wage and investment loss and their wage is greater than their investment loss the approach may also include investment income if person reports his or her earnings as the total of their wage and investment income excluding persons with negative earnings has little or effect on the real earnings by percentile shown in this report including persons with negative earnings increases the level of inequality but has little or effect on the trend in inequality in tables 1 and 2 comparisons of real earnings between consecutive years should be made with caution when answering the question about annual earnings some respondents may round off their earnings for example many people may report that they earn 50000 year when they earn either more or less than 50000 from one year to the next this rounding may affect the observed trend in real weekly earnings cpiurs in this report nominal weekly earnings were adjusted for inflation using the cpiurs the consumer price index for all urban consumers research series over the years bls has introduced number of changes in the way it measures changes in prices each improvement is intended to make the cpiu more accurate but the historical cpiu is not adjusted to take the improvements into account the cpiurs adjusts the historical cpiu starting in 1978 to take into account most of the improvements made in measuring price changes the cpiurs shows what the cpiu would have been if current methods had been used to measure inflation compared to the cpiu the cpiurs provides more consistent measure of inflation30 topcoded earnings in the asec supplement if persons annual earnings exceed certain amount ie topcode the individuals actual earnings are not reported instead the cps reports the average earnings of those persons whose earnings are above the topcoded amount for 2007 ie the 2008 asec annual earnings from persons longest job were topcoded at 200000 bls averages earnings for several groups of workers based on gender race hispanic origin and work experience for example the cps reports average earnings for all white non hispanic men who work fulltime yearround and whose earnings

person may have held more than one job during the year in this report topcoding may affect the measures of inequality in two ways first because of topcoding the gini coefficient may understate the degree of inequality topcoding should have less of an effect on the estimates of real weekly earnings or the estimates of the share of total weekly earnings by quintile second as described in the text of this report because of changes in 1994 affecting annual earnings for 1993 in the way the cps recorded the earnings of the highest paid workers the observed trend in inequality may not be comparable for years 1979 to 1992 and the years 1993 and later confidence levels estimates based on survey responses from sample of households have two kinds of error nonsampling and sampling examples of nonsampling error include information that is misreported and errors made in processing collected information sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population of households is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample of households and the actual population value is known as sampling error when using sample data researchers typically construct confidence intervals around population estimates confidence intervals provide information about the accuracy of estimated values with 95 confidence interval and repeated samples from population 95 of intervals will include the average estimate of population characteristic data used in text and graphs the remainder of this appendix provides the data used in the text and graphs in this report in tables 8 and
