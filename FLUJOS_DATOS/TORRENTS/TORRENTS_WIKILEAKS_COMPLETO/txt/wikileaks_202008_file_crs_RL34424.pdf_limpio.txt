associated with such federal government functions as running executive branch agencies congressional oï¬ƒces and agencies and international operations of the government essentially all spending on federal wages and salaries is discretionary discretionary spending is often contrasted with mandatory or direct spending mandatory spending includes federal spending on entitlement programs the food stamp program and other spending controlled by laws other than appropriation acts spending levels for mandatory programs are generally controlled by eligibility criteria and size of the eligible

agencies and international operations of the government essentially all spending on federal wages and salaries is discretionary fy2008 federal spending accounted for just over fifth 209 of the us economy nearly equal to its average share of gross domestic product gdp since fy1962 while discretionary spending was the largest component of federal spending until the mid1970s mandatory spending now accounts for about 3 more of gdp than discretionary spending from fy1962 when discretionary spending accounted for 472 of total outlays to fy2008 discretionary spendings share of federal outlays has fallen by almost fifth over time discretionary spending has fallen as percenta ge of gdp because it has grown slower than the overall economy rapid growth of entitlement ou tlays and slower growth in defense spending relative to other federal spending are two major causes of the longterm fall in discretionary spendings share of federal spending discretionary spending is often divided into defense domestic discretionary and international outlays defense and domestic discretionary spending compose nearly all of discretionary spending in fy1962 discretionary spending equaled 123 of gdp with defense spending making up 90 of gdp in fy2008 total discretionary spending fell to 79 of gdp with defense spending totaling 43 of gdp however over the last six years military spending has increased sharply on average from fy1999 to fy2008 defense outlays grew 8 per year in real terms while nondefense discretionary outlays grew 25 per year in real terms increases in discretionary spending are likely over the next several fiscal years due to the current economic turmoil and resulting federal intervention to stimulate the economy over the long term projected future growth in entitlement program outlays may put severe pressure on discretionary spending unless policies changes are enacted or federal revenues are increased this report will be updated annually

federal budget and particularly discretionary spending appropriations legislation which controls discretionary spending grants budget authority to accomplish specific ends budget authority is what federal agencies can legally spend budget authority has been compared to funds deposited into checking account which then can be used for specified federal purposes outlays are disbursed federal funds therefore an outlay is not recorded until the federal government disburses appropriated funds to purchase goods and services table 1 illustrates the different categories of federal spending ie

effects of the federal budgets while budget analysis of specific federal programs is typicall based on budget authority because that is what congress controls most directly congressional appropriations which grant budget authority for specific purposes are not always tightly linked to changes in outlays in the following year while budget authority can be granted for single year some appropriations such as for many military construction projects provide budget authority for multiple years or indefinitely thus outlays that flow from an appropriated sum might be spread over several fiscal years implying that budget authority totals will differ from outlay totals for single fiscal year 5

the early 1960s over time the share of total discretionary spending in federal spending has fallen while the share of mandatory spending has increased discretionary spending accounted for 675 of total outlays in fy1962 but only an estimated 381 of total outlays in fy2008 6 mandatory spending by contrast rose from 261 of total outlays in fy1962 to 537 in fy2008 in contrast to the longer term trends betw een fy1999 and fy2008 discretionary spending grew more quickly than mandatory spending after falling for three decades between the late 1960s and the late 1990s discretionary spending increased 51 year in real terms on average from fy1999 to fy2008 over the same period the share of discretionary spending as proportion of federal outlays grew from 336 in fy1999 to 381 in fy2008

in fy1962 discretionary spending comprised 675 of total outlays with mandatory spending and net interest accounting for 261 and 65 respectively discretionary spending as share of total outlays reached

appropriated funds are spent they face constraints imposed by legislation designed to protect congresss power of the purse according to the antideficiency act federal official cannot spend government money beyond what is available through appropriations or fund by law see general accountability office antideficiency act background available at httpwwwgaogovada antideficiencyhtm for code citations

mandatory spending over time controlling the federal budget may have become more difficult for congress in other words because mandatory spending is set automatically less money is available to allocate to other government agencies and programs unless revenues rise or congress modifies eligibility requirements and benefits of mandatory spending programs in addition to these measures of spending cbo also subdivides discretionary spending into defense domestic and international categories figure 3 shows these categories of discretionary spending as share of gdp over the period fy1962fy2008 defense spending 73 of total discretionary spending in fy1962 accounted for 538 of discretionary spending in fy2008 in terms of gdp discretionary defense spending fell from 95 gdp in

spending grew more slowly than federal spending in other areas some contend that defense expenditures as proportion of gdp should be expected to fall over the long term because the cost of defending the nation depends on factors that are largely independent of economic growth defense spending increased sharply in the mid1960s as the united states involvement in vietnam deepened after largescale withdrawals of american troops from vietnam began in 1969 defense spending as share of gdp fell for the next decade the soviet invasion of afghanistan prompted the carter administration and then the reagan administration to boost military expenditures resulting in an increase in defense spending during the early 1980s after the berlin wall was opened in november 1989 and communist governments in central and eastern europe collapsed defense spending as share of gdp dropped to historically low levels providing what some called peace dividend defense spending again rose after the attacks of september 11 2001 and wars in afghanistan and iraq began increased defense spending accounts for 756 of the increase in discretionary spending in the past decade discretionary defense spending

discretionary spending programs are now operating under continuing resolution through march 6 2009 with the inauguration of the new president budgetary priorities may change as the new administration and congress confront ongoing financial and economic challenges while facing the need to complete funding for the remainder of fy2009 and begin consideration of the fy2010 budget given the current state of the economy significant increases in discretionary spending at least over the next several years are likely the federal government has responded to this financial turmoil with an extraordinary set of measures in february 2008 congress enacted 152 billion package pl 110185 economic stimulus act of 2008 to stimulate consumption that sent refunds to taxpayers and let firms depreciate their capital more quickly later in the year the federal reserve created panoply of lending facilities to provide financial institutions with loans in exchange for various types of

stimulus is in order the size variety and complexity of new stimulus in addition to previous federal responses to this turmoil present many challenges to budget analysis the ultimate costs of these responses and their budgetary impact especially with regard to disc retionary spending levels will depend on how the economy performs how well firms with federal credit guarantees weather future financial shocks and whether the government receives positive returns on its asset purchases

appropriations decisions in particular provide congress with the ability to change continue or reverse trends in discretionary spending if discretionary spending were held constant in real terms as the cbo baseline presumes then discretionary spending per capita would decrease as population grows and it would shrink as share of gdp as the economy grows on average the us population grew 1 year and per capita gdp grew 225 per year from 1962 to 2005 11 if those trends were to persist then holding discretionary spending constant in real terms implies per capita discretionary spending would shrink by 1 year and discretionary spending as share of the economy would shrink by 325 per year due to the current economic downturn largescale fiscal stimulus and aggressive spending measures intended to mitigate systematic risks in financial markets may be needed to limit serious damage to the economy when economic recovery begins and as soon as appropriate many economists and policy makers hope that spending increases used to stimulate the economy will be reversed at that point it is suggested that attention turn to deficit reduction over the long run growth in entitlement spending will present severe fiscal challenges recent research on longterm fiscal challenges has focused on continued increases in the per beneficiary cost of health care as well as the more predictable demographic changes that will occur as the baby boom generation retires projections from variety of sources predict that spending on medicare and social security will increase sharply as share of gdp in coming decades 12 cbo projects that medicare will expand from 56 of gdp in 2030 to 148 in 2082 and that social security will grow from 61 of gdp in 2030 to 64 of gdp by 2082 federal medicaid outlays 14 of gdp in fy2007 are projected to reach 176 of gdp in 205013 social security medicare and medicaid outlays as proportion of gdp are projected to equal or exceed the present share of federal revenues as proportion of gdp 177 in fy2007 sometime after the middle of the 21st century maintaining current levels of discretionary spending would then require either substantial tax increases or major changes in those entitlement programs 11 these figures based on crs calculations derived from cbo and census bureau data 12 see cbo the longterm budget outlook december 2007 point
