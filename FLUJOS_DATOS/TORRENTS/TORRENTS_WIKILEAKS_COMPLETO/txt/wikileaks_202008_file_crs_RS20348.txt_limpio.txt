government government and finance division summary the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations act or continuing resolution is referred to as funding gap when funding gap occurs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies entailing the prompt furlough of nonemergency personnel and curtailment of agency activities during the period covering fy1977fy2008 17 funding gaps occurred ranging in duration from one day to 21 full days about half of these funding gaps were brief ie three days or less in duration with most occurring over weekend and the disruption in federal operations was minimal in late 1995 and early 1996 president bill clinton and the republicancontrolled congress engaged in difficult and protracted negotiations over budget policy resulting in the veto of continuing resolution and several regular appropriations acts for fy1996 two funding gaps amounting to five days and 21 days ensued with about 800000 federal employees furloughed initially there have been funding gaps since the two that occurred in fy1996 this report will be updated background the routine activities of most federal agencies are funded annually by one or more of the regular appropriations acts when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed continuing appropriations act is used to provide interim funding measures providing continuing appropriations usually take the form of joint resolution rather than bill and are referred to as continuing resolutions or crs during the 57year period covering fy1952fy2008 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose funding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts further crs2 continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regular appropriations were enacted late1 the antideficiency act 31 usc 13411342 15111519 generally bars agencies from continued operation in the absence of appropriations2 exceptions are made under the act including for activities involving the safety of human life or the protection of property the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations act or cr is referred to as funding gap although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year they also may occur any time cr expires and another cr or the regular appropriations bill is not enacted immediately thereafter also multiple funding gaps may occur for fiscal year in 1980 and 1981 attorney general benjamin civiletti issued opinions clarifying the need for federal agencies to begin terminating regular activities immediately upon the occurrence of funding gap3 consequently when funding gap occurs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies shutdown entails the prompt furlough of nonemergency personnel and curtailment of agency activities including the provision of many services to the public4 the general practice of the federal government over the years has been to pay furloughed employees after the shutdown has ended for time missed even when work was performed in order to avoid funding gaps and their unwanted consequences proposals have been offered from time to time to establish an automatic continuing resolution acr that would provide fallback source of funding for activities at restricted level in the event the timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted5 the funding would become available automatically and remain available as long as needed so that funding gap would not occur and the furlough of federal employees would be avoided or at least severely limited although the house and senate have considered acr proposals in the past none have been enacted into law 1 section 1414 of pl 82547 66 stat 661 made regular appropriations enacted late available as of july 1 1952 the first day of fy1953 and ratified any obligations incurred before their enactment 2 the antideficiency act is discussed in crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium clinton t brass coordinator on pp 9397 in addition the

for an automatic continuing resolution by robert keith crs3 funding gaps fy1977fy2008 as table 1 shows there were 17 funding gaps during the 32year period beginning with fy1977 and continuing through fy2008 fy1977 marked the first full implementation of the congressional budget process established by the congressional budget act of 1974 the enactment of cr on the day after the previous cr expired which has occurred often is not counted as involving funding gap during the past nine fiscal years covering fy2000fy2008 for example nextday crs were enacted 14 times most of the funding gaps occurred during the first half of the 32year period during the 16year period covering fy1977fy1992 15 funding gaps occurred however only two funding gaps occurred during the remaining 16 years covering fy1993fy2008 multiple funding gaps occurred in four instances 1 three gaps covering total of 28 days in fy1978 2 two gaps covering total of four days in fy1983 3 two gaps covering total of three days in fy1985 and 4 two gaps covering total of 26 days in fy1996 six of the funding gaps commenced with the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 the remaining 11 funding gaps occurred at least several days after the fiscal year had begun nine of the funding gaps ended in october four ended in november three ended in december and one ended in january6 funding gaps ranged in duration from one to 21 full days six of the seven lengthiest funding gaps lasting between 8 and 17 days occurred between fy1977 and fy1980 before the civiletti opinions were issued after the issuance of these opinions the duration of funding gaps in general shortened considerably ranging from one to three days with the longer gaps occurring over the weekend an important exception to this trend occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 when president bill clinton and the republicancontrolled congress engaged in difficult and protracted negotiations over budget policy resulting in the veto of continuing resolution and several regular appropriations acts for fy1996 two funding gaps amounting to five days and 21 days ensued with about 800000 federal employees furloughed initially there have been funding gaps since
