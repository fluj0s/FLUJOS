budget and accounting act of 1921 requires the president to submit annually comprehensive bu dget to congress that covers the full range of federal activities current law requires the president to submit his budget proposal later than the first monday in february 31 usc 1105a the formulation of the budget usually begins approximately 10 months before the president submits his budget to congress about 18 months before the start of the fiscal year during the early stages of the budgets formulation federal agencies prepare their budget requests following their own procedures omb plays coordinating role in this process and provides policy guidelines through circulars bulletins and ot her detailed communications in particular omb circular a11 available on ombs web site at httpwwwwhitehousegovomb contains detailed instructions and schedules for submissi on of agency budget requests and other material to ensure that budget requests adhere to standardized conventions and formats agency budget requests are submitted to omb in early fall often in september these requests then are reviewed by omb staff with the agencies notified of the omb directors decisions through passback agencies may appeal these recommendations to the director and in some cases directly to the president once final decisions on the budget requests are made by the president agencies revise their budget requests accordingly and prepare supporting material for inclusion in the presidents budget submission the presidents budget then is compiled and submitted to congress

congressional budget process and provides stat ement of the budgetary goals of the president after the president submits his budget proposal omb and other administration officials testify before congressional committees individual federal agencies also justify and explain their specific budget requests at congressional hearings as budgetary legislation is formulated agencies submit extensive written justifications usually focusing on the proposed increase or decrease in spending to the responsible appropriations subcommittees of each chamber omb ensures that agency budget justifications testimony and other submissions are consistent with the presidents policies by requiring agencies to clear any material through omb before providing it to congress the president is required to submit midsession review by july 15 of each year this budget update must reflect changes in economic conditions any legislative actions taken by congress and other factors affecting the presidents initial budget submission for more comprehensive discussion of the midsession review see crs report 98768 the president s budget requirement for midsession review the president also may revise his budget recommendations any time during the year t

during the congressional budget process by issuing statements of administration policy commonly referred to as saps also available on ombs web site typically the president and his aides will negotiate with congressional leaders in order to have an impact on budgetary legislation these negotiations may involve overall budget policies or program details and may occur at any point during congressional consideration as with any other legislation the president may sign or veto the appropriations acts and any other budgetary legislation enacted by congress g7g161g142g140g158g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561 once appropriations acts and any other budgetary gislation such as revenue or reconciliation measures become law they are executed by the appropriate federal agencies however funds provided in statutes are not automatically available to agencies for obligation appropriated funds first must be apportioned by fiscal quarter or by activity as appropriate omb is responsible for reviewing apportionment requests and making funds available to agencies the antideficiency act 31 usc 134142 15111519 prohibits agencies from obligating funds in excess of levels provided in law any withholding of funds must follow impoundmen t procedures established by the impoundment control act ica of 1974 title x of pl 93344 2 usc 681 et seq the act defines two types of impoundments deferrals and rescissions deferrals delay the spending of funds while rescissions permanently cancel budgetary resources the president must report any deferrals to congress but may only propose rescissions congress usually acts on rescission proposals in annual appropriations acts rather than by the legislative procedures established under the ica if congress does not act on the presidents rescission proposals within 45 days the president must make the funds available for obligation other techniques for making spending adjustments after legislation has been enacted include reprogramming funds shift within appropriations accounts and transferring funds shift between accounts which requires statutory authority
