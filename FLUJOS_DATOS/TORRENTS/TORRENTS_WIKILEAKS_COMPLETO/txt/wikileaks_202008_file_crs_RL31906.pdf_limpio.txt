anti americanism implications for us policy toward north korea overview for most of the first four decades af ter the country was founded in 1948 south korea was ruled by authoritarian govern ments ever since the mid1980s when widespread antigovernment protests for ced the countrys military rulers to enact sweeping democratic reforms democratic institutions and traditions have deepened in south korea in 1997 long time dissident nd opposition politician kim dae jung commonly referred to as dj was elected to the presidency the first time an opposition party had prevailed in south korean presidential election by law korean presidents can only serve one fi veyear term in december 2002 kim was succeeded by member of his party roh pronounced noh moohyun self educated former human rights lawyer who emerged from relative obscurity to defeat establishment candidates in both the primary and general elections roh campaigned on platform of reform reform of korean politics economic policymaking and usrok relations to narrowly defeat conservative candidate lee hoi chang in the general election roh capture d 489 of the vote to lees 466 prior to assuming the presidency roh s only previous government experience was an eightmonth term as minister of maritime affairs and fisheries in 2000 and 2001 and two stints as lawmaker in the national assembly from 19881992 and 19982000 during the 1990s roh lost two legi slative elections and one bid for the mayoralty of his hometown pusan ironica lly during the presidential campaign the circumstances surrounding thes defeats contributed to r ohs image as principled reformer noteworthy aspects of the 2002 presidential election the 2002 election was notable for seve ral interrelated reasons first it exposed the deep generational divide among south koreans exit polls showed that nearly 60 of people in their 20s and 30s voted for mr r oh compared with less than 40 of people in their 50s and 60s it is perhaps not co incidental that thos supporting lee directly experienced the korean war 1950 53 and its immediate aftermath roh 56 himself represents generational sh ift eleven years younger than lee he also is the first south korean president who was not an established political figure when the country began to emerge from authoritarian rule in the late 1980s second rohs victory was due in part to his call for south korea to become more equal partner in the usrok alliance and to his criticism of us policies on the korean peninsula roh pledged to largely continue kim dae jungs sunshinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31906crs2 policy of engaging north korea alt hough these views resonated most strongly among younger generations of south korean s they have entered the mainstream of korean society as shown by the massive demonstrations in 2002 protesting the acquittal of two us servicemen who were operating military vehicle when it killed two korean schoolgirls third the election and the antiamerican demonstrations highlighted the growing influence and sophistication of ko rean civil society groups which now have significant voice in determining policy outcomes in seoul many of these organizations garnered support for roh dur ing the election campaign and organized the antius protests and the red devil rallies to cheer south koreas national team on to the semifinal during the 2002 soccer world cup the groups goals and means which tend to rely heavily upon ne tworking through the internet have been particularly effective in encourag ing younger koreans to become politically active higherthanexpected turnout of younger voters benefitted roh as overall turnout in the 2002 election was record low of 70 compared with 80 in the 1997 election country divided the challenge facing roh who was inaugurated on february 25 2003 is how to carry out his re form agenda despite the deep divisions in south korea the country is split not only generationally but also regionally the national assembly is contro lled by the opposition grand na tional party gnp and rohs own party the millennium democratic party mdp is also divided between his supporters and large fac tion of party elders that nearly succeeded in ousting roh as the mdps presidential candidate several weeks before the election rohs task will be complicated by the national assembly elections scheduled to take place in april 2004 these are likel to exacerbate the zerosum tendency in south korean politics in which ruling and opposition parties rarely cooperate furthermore both the ruling mdp and oppos ition gnp are under significant internal stress and there is speculation that there will be major political realignment before the next legislative election south koreas political system weak legislature nominally power in south korea is shared by the president who is elected to one five year term and the 273member unicameral national assembly national assembly members are elected to 4year terms of these 227 members represent singlemembe r constituencies the remaining 46 are at large members selected on the basis of proportional voting as mentioned above the next legislative elec tions will be held in april 2004 since the assemblys powers were nhanced in the 1987 constitution it has at times altered the political climate by pr oviding opposition parties with forum to criticize inspect and attempt to embarrass the executive branch indeed one of the assemblys major accomplishments since 1987 has been to institutionalize its oversight of the executive executive branch officials regularly appear before committees helping to make south korean policymaking more transparent alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31906crs3 south koreas major political parties as of august 2002 273 seats in the national assembly gnp grand national party 153 seats victories in the august 2002 bi elections gave the gnp its first majority in the national assembly since 1997 mdp millennium democratic party 101 seats the party of president roh moohyun founded by former president kim dae jung the mdp controlled the national assembly via an alliance with another party until september 2001from time to time opposition parties have used ssembly proceedings to successfully stymie presidential initiatives usually by boycotting legislative sessions in reality however the president continues to be the dominant force in south korean policymaking as formal and informal limitations prevent the national assembly from initiating major pieces of legislation for instance the korean constitution grants the assembly the power only to cut funds from the presidents budget not to propose any increases or lter the executives budgetary allocations article 57 also the assembly must act on the budget not later than thirty days before the start of the new fiscal year on january 1 article 54 south korean legislators suffer from numerous other limitations they have little in the way of legislative support agen cies and the typical seoul legislative office is staffed by three salaried fulltime workers even the prime minister who has little power is nominated by the president the fact that parties in the assembly repeatedly have resorted to the brinkmanship tactic of the boycott reflects the legislative branchs weakness institutionbuilding by the national assembly rohs election has accelerated moves by the opposition grand nati onal party gnp which controls the national assembly to increase the national assemblys resources through the creation of institutions modeled after the us congressional budget office the congressional research service ndor the general accounting office the assemblys other powers bill in the national assembly may be introduced by members or by the executive branch if passed bill is sent to the executive for presidential promulgation within 15 days the president may veto the bill and send it back to the national assembly for recons ideration if the assembly overrides the veto with the concurrence of twothirds or more of members present the bill will become law with respect to the judiciary the consent of the national assembly is also required for the presid ential appointment of all supreme court justices also required is the ratification by the assembly of treaties and agreements as well as international acts or conventions to which south korea is signatory the declaration of war the dispatch of troops abroad or the stationing of foreign troops in south korean territory requires the consent of the assembly as well political parties south korean political parties form disband and merge regularly in part because they tend to be regionallybased and centered around charismatic personalities rather than substantive issues it is not uncommon for members of the national assembly to jump from one party to another practice that has led to considerab disaffection among the south korean electorate during the 2002 presidential election roh moohyun benefitted from his image of principledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31906crs4 politician who had suffered pers onally because of his resolu tion not to participate in these political

generally conservative opposition grand national party gnp which at 153 seats has majority in the assembly and the smaller 14 seats conservative united liberal democrats uld which is led by the veteran politician kim jongpil and has declined dramatically in size and influence in recent years in april 2003 the gnp further increased its majority by winning 2 of 3 bielections th at were notable for turnout of below 30 the lowest in nearly 40 years there is speculation that there may be major political realignment before the april 2004 national assembly elections the mdp and gnp both are undergoing unsettled times the gnp which suffered from defections early in the presidential campaign is still recovering from lee hoi changs defeat the divisions are even more acute in the mdp where rohs ba of support within the ruling party is confined to relatively small group of young er reformers during the presidential election the partys establishment figu res favored another candidate who roh defeated in the mdps primaries the count rys firstever in the winter of 2002 later in the presidential campaign opposition to roh inside the mdp grew to such an extent that several party leaders publicly talked of disbanding and forming new party led by another candidate some political analysts speculate that roh may seek to gather into new party reformist politicians from the mdp gnp and smaller parties regionalism south korean politics is highly regionalized the mdps base is in the southwestern cholla region also known as honam where roh won 93 of the vote in the 2002 presidential election see figure 2 in the last nationwide national assembly elections held in april 2000 gnp candidate won any of chollas 29 seats conversely gnp candidate lee hoi chang won 71 of the vote in the southeastern kyongsang region also know n as yongnam the gnps stronghold in the 2000 national assembly elections the gnp won 64 of the 65 constituencies in kyongsang before kim dae jungs victory in 1997 south koreas military governments gave preferen tial treatment to the kyongsang region leading cholla residents to accuse the government of disc rimination the greater seoul area which is the

assemblies and establishing popular election of local officials for the firs t time since the 1950s increased local autonomy has encouraged political consciousness and activism as south koreans have come to expect local and national elected leaders to be more responsive and accountable to their constituents4 despite these changes seoul remains the locus of political power in south korea in part because local governments have little authority to impose their own taxes5 president roh moo hyun has vowed to further decentralize politi cal power giving more autonomy to the provinces and by

confined to highly ideological groups particularly student organizations that generally operated on the political margins in korea in the late 1990s however criticisms of united states policy moved into the mainstream move that also has made antiamericanism less ideological and more issuespecific the criticisms range wide ly and include accusations that the bush administration is not listening

individuals who support the alliance but oppose us policy on specific issues such as alleged crimes committed by us servicemen this latter group appears to be in the majority among current anti

the measure the deployment was approved on april 2 2003 thanks to support from the opposition gnp which has long supported close allia nce relations with the united states relations with north korea underlying the wave of america bashing in south korea is the declining sense of th reat most south koreans feel from north korea during the presidential campaign roh called for tinuation of kim dae

ec onomic sanctions to achieve this end instead he has calle d for peaceful resolution of the problem through dialogue in his inaugural address roh put forth the vague outlines for policy of peace and

cooperation of seoul to be successful preemptive attack on north koreas known nuclear facilities as was c ontemplated by the clinton administration in 1994 would likely be strongly opposed by the roh govern ment and the south korean people the recent surge in antiamerican sentiment so mean that failure to obtain south koreas cooperation could lead to serious st rain if not rupture in the fifty year old usrok alliance yet suspicions of the bush administrations policy toward north korea among many south koreans arguably will make it politically costly for president roh to support more confront ational approach if the united states decides to pursue this course particularly during year when rohs party is trying to capture the national assembly on the other hand rohs election could present the bush administration with an opportunity if roh is persuaded to follow the united states lead his outspoken advocacy of engaging north korea may positi on him to sell more aggressive north korea policy to the south korean public which remains divide d about how best to deal with north korea as recently as the summer of 2002 before the anti american protests grew in size domes tic disenchantment with kim dae jungs sunshine policy appeared sufficiently strong that roh began to distance himself from the approach antiamerican sentiment is likely to continue ngo activity in south korea tends to have an exaggerated peakandvalley nature that appears to be direct result of what one us scholar of korean politics has called loose coalition style of civic activism typically highprofile event results in few groups taking the lead in putting together coalition of disparate ngos resulting in largescale protests as issues lose steam the activism fades dramatically because each member organization has its own agendas that may have nothing to do with the antiamerican issue at hand13 thus although the recent antiamerican demonstrations have largely vanished from south koreas streets this does not necessarily mean that antiamerican sentiments have died down it may only mean that the feelings are lying dormant until either another event triggers furt her round of protests or the fundamental issues of concern are addressed the r ecent announcements by the us department of defense that it plans to realign the structure of us forces in south korea may represent
