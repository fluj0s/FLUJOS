these countries those that apply to cuba though are perm anent and more restrictive tsra also gives congress the authority in the future to veto presidents proposal to impose sanction on the sale of agri cultural or medical products codifying the food and medical sales exemption for cuba generated much debate exemption proponents argued that prohibiting sales to cuba harmed the us agricultural sector and that opening up limited trade would be one way to pursue constructive engagement policy opponent s countered that an exemption would undercut us policy to pressure the castro g overnment to make po litical and economic reforms though top cuban offi cials initially stated purchases would be made with tsras conditions in place food stock losses due to hurricane and shift in cuban strategy led to almost 125 billion in cash pur chases by cuba of us food and farm commodities from d ecember 2001 to april 2006 agricultural sales to iran libya and suda n under tsra have totaled 313 million congressional opponents of tsras prohib itions on private us financing of agricultural sales public financing of eligible exports and tourist travel to cuba have introduced bills since 2000 to repeal

falling agricultural exports and declinin g commodity prices in the late 1990s led farm groups and agribusiness firms to urge the executive branch to drop and calls for congress to pass legislation to exempt food from us economic sanctions against certain countries the clin ton administration on april 28 1999 announced it would lift prohibitions on us commercial sales of most agricultural commodities and food products to three countries iran libya and sudan moreover it indicated that it would not include these products in announcing future sanctions on other countries the administrations decisi on reflected its view that food should not be used as foreign policy tool and offi cials acknowledgment that us sanctions policy had hurt the us farm economy on july 27 1999 the

decision announ ced in september 1999 now permit sales of agricultural products to north kor ea without an export license licensed agricultural sales to cuba under policy announced in may 1999 were restricted only to private and nongovernmental entities but were broadene d under statutory change that went into effect in july 2001 for the two years that the clinton administrations policy was in effect treasury approved licenses that resulted in us sales of corn to iran durum wheat to libya and hard red winter wheat to sudan also president clinton in issuing executive orders in 1999 to impose us economic sanctions on serbia and the taliban in afghanistan specifically exem pted commercial sale s of food and medical products from prohibitions imposed on all us exports to these destinations congressional efforts to expand this polic to also cover sales to cuba and to remove uncertainties in executive branch implementation of us sanctions policy resulted in passage of the trade sancti ons reform and export enhancement act of 2000 title ix of hr 5426 as enacted by pl 106387 on october 28 2000 referred to below as tsra tsra c odified the lifting of us sanctions on commercial sales of

exports in us economic sanctions policy farm organizations agricultural comm odity associations and agribusiness firms since the 1980 grain embargo on the s oviet union have favored changing us policy to exempt export sales of agri cultural commodities food products and agricultural inputs from the broad economic sanctions currently imposed on targeted countries they argued that prohibiti ons hurt only us farmers and business undermine this countrys reputation as reliable supplier and do not change targeted countries behavior in recent year s these groups joined with firms in the pharmaceutical and manufacturing sectors to call for comprehensive review of the economic impact of these sanctions and for limits on the executive branchs use of sanctions to restrict trade opposition to exempting sales of ag ricultural commoditie s and food products from us sanctions policy has been somewh at more diffuse opponents argued that current law gives the president sufficient fl exibility to permit food to be shipped for humanitarian reasons and that us foodstuffs if sold could be misused by foreign governments or not made ava ilable to those in need some objected to the loosening of trade restrictions with certain countri such as cuba coming largely from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs3 1 this total amount excludes commercial agricultural sales made to libya after broad us economic sanctions were lifted in april 2004foreign policy and defense community they viewed sanctions as legitimate and effective policy tool and drew little dis tinction between prohibiting sales of food and prohibiting exports of all other products provisions enacted in 2000 to exempt food and medical products from us economic sanctions overview of tsra the most significant policy change made by the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 exempts commercial sales of agricultural and medical products to cuba from the longsta nding us trade embargo on that country at the same time tsra ma permanent prohibition on cubas access to us private and other public financing to pur chase exempted products though press coverage suggested that the debate was solely over cubaspecific measure this act codified an exemption for sales of agri cultural and medical pr oducts in the conduct of us sanctions policy with respect to five countries and the terms under which this exemption operates it further codified clinton administration policy based on existing law that prohibited making available us government credits credit guarantees and other financial assistance to facilitate agricultural and medical product sales to certain sanctioned countries also tsra made changes to the food and medical products exemptionfromsanc tions policy exercised administratively by the executive branch since mid1999 this act 1 broadens the exemption to allow sales of nonfood agricultural commod ities and fertilizers and 2 streamlines the process us exporters follow to obt ain licenses to sell exempted products to sanctioned countries other tsra provisions require the pres ident to secure future congressional approval before he can impose for foreig n policy or national security reasons restriction or prohibition on the sale of agricultural and medical products the act also limits the duration of any such approved sanction to not more than two years unless congress approves an extension status of implementation the tsra provisions that cover agricultural and medical exports to countries subject to us unilateral sanc tions took effect on february 25 2001 however interagency differences between the department of commerces bureau of industry and secur ity bis then known as the bureau of export administration bxa and treasurys ofac over how to interpret these provisions were not resolved until considered by the white houses national security council both agencies issued their interim rules to reflect tsras statutory changes on july 12 2001 these took effect on july 26 2001 from august 2001 through april 2006 us exporters sold almost 16 billion in agricultural products to cuba iran libya and sudan under tsra provisions1 the 60 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs4 2 published in the federal register july 12 2001 pp 3667536683 available at httpfrwebgateaccessgpogovcgibingetdoccgidbname2001_registerdocidfr12j y0121pdfin agricultural exports to north korea and also most shipments to sudan most likely were food donations and not commercial sales extension of food and medical exemption to cuba tsra allows licensed commercial sale s of agricultural and medical products to cuba this policy change reflects the laws requirement that the president terminate any unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction 120 days after enactment this provision eff ectively supersedes statutory provisions in the cuban liberty and demo cratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 that law codified the thenregulatory prohibitions on all us exportimport and other transactions under the us embargo imposed on cuba in the early 1960s under this embargo commercial sales of usorigin agricultural products and medical products at times to cuba generally we re prohibited sepa rately the cuban democracy act of 1992 allows some commerc ial sales of us medical products to cuba but under tight conditions though the clinton adminis tration announced sanctions policy changes in 1999 and in 2000 to allow sales of agricultural nd medical products to iran libya sudan and north korea it did not have legal author ity to do the same with respect to cuba this explains why most of the congressi onal debate leading up to tsras passage revolved around whether this same exemption should be statutorily extended to apply also to cuba as house debate and compromise unfolded in early summer 2000 those opposed to this opening in trade w ith cuba succeeded in adding number of cubaspecific provisions under tsra agricultural and medical sale s to cuba are now subject to various conditions and restrictions that are similar to those already in effect on similar product sales to the other sanc tioned countries us exporters must follow an export licensing process before any product can be shipped further permanent prohibition is in place against the use of any us government export program or financing provided by us private banks or state and local governments to facilitate licensed sales cubarelated regulations issued biss interim rules continue the pre 2001 policy that requires medi cal product xports to cuba be licensed they also establish an expedited process for handlin g agricultural product sales to cuba and waive the restriction on the direct shipment of eligible products now permitted to be sold to cuba2 codification of foodmedical exemption tsra enacts as us policy the principl that commercial sa of food other agricultural products medicine and other medical products shall not be used as tool to conduct foreign policy or to ddress national security objectives seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs5 definition of products covere d by exemption this law stipulates that this principle apply to all countries now subject to us unilateral sanctions and require that president in the future justify to congress why sales of these products to sanctioned country or foreign entity should be limited and obtain congressional approval before taking such action limits on agricultur sales are defined to be any prohibition restriction or condition on carrying out any commercial export sale of agricultural commodities or on using any us department of agriculture usda program authorized under four speci fied statutes or any us government export financing including credits or credit guarantees to facilitate such sales for medical product sales such limits are fined to be any prohibition restriction or condition on exports of or the provision of assistance consisting of medicine or medical device in immediate and practical terms tsra 1 codified earlier clinton administration decisions to allow agricu ltural and medical pr oduct sales to four countries iran libya north korea and s udan and 2 amended the laws and related regulations authorizing the us embargo on cuba to allow commercial sales of agricultural and medical products exceptions to exemption tsra provides four exceptions to the general principle discussed above these exceptions are relevant when th united states acts against foreign country or entity to im pose sanction that includes these products pursuant to 1 its involvement in mu ltilateral sanctions re gime or mandatory decision of the united nations security counc il 2 declaration of war or specific statutory authorization fo r the use or the imminent or actual involvement in hostilities of us armed forces and 3 its export control to prevent potential military use under the arms export control act the export administration act or other authority president bush tapped this exception authority in issuing executive order 13224 september 23 2001 to prohibit tr ansactions with designated terrorists and their supporters section 4 states the determination that tsra shall not affect the imposition or continuation of any unila teral agricultural or medical sanction on any individual or entity determined to be subject to this order because imminent involvement of us armed forces in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances export licensing requirement under tsras exemption exports of agricultural and medical products to governments and other entitie s in sanctioned countries are allowed only under an approved export license s ection 906a1 requires that this export licensing requirement apply to sa to those countries that the secretary of state exercising authority under three cited statutes has determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism in practice this means that sales of eligible products to governme nts of countries currently so designated cuba iran and sudan or to any other entity in each of th countries must be licensed before any shipment can be made though the secret ary of state has determined that the governments of north korea and syria also are sponsors of inte rnational terrorism section 906a2 explicitly states that the license requirement doe s not apply to sales to these two countries the secretar has discretion to drop this licensing requirement for iran libya and sudan if the determination is made that itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs6 3 in practice the state department under these statutes has rarely changed or reversed sponsor of international terrorism determ ination made with respect to foreign government with the easing of most us sanctions on libya announced in april 2004 and the bush administrations announcement on ma 15 2006 of its intent to rescind listing libya as sponsor of terrorism us exporte rs of agricultural products longer need to secure licenses to sell to libyagovernment longer supports international terrorism3 such discretion is permitted for cuba meaning this licensing requirement is made permanent for eligible sales to cuba relevant provisions in the act seek to streamline and simplify the type of license an exporter must obtain to sell permitted products to sanctioned countries these address concerns expresse d by us agricultural exporters that the treasury regulations governing the licensing of agricu ltural sales to iran libya and sudan had been cumbersome and time consuming differences between the pre2001 licensing rules and the relevant enacted provisions th at modify the earlier rules are described below previous licensing rules for countries covered by the clinton administrations 1999 food and medical exem ption policy iran libya and sudan the department of treasurys ofac issued two types of export licenses general and specific the type required and the relevant conditions and procedures that apply to each depended on the nature of the product the ex porter wanted to sell the end user of the proposed sale the details of the terms of sales contract the date of contract performance and on how the sale would be paid for see payment and financing terms of exempt ed sales for important related conditions general license authorizes certain transactions without the need for an exporter to file an application providing ll the details of each individual transaction specific license is issued on casebycase basis to an individual or company allowing an activity or transaction to take place ofacs food exemption regulations t up two different procedures for obtaining licenses depending on the pr oduct to be sold the conditions that an exporter must meet varied according to which procedure is followed an expedited licensing process applied to pr ospective sales of specified bulk agricultural commodities specific license authorized an exporter to enter into executory contracts ie respond to re quests for bids enter into bi nding contracts and perform against contract terms and covered transactions over specified time period certain conditions had to be met to obtai n this license for sales of all other food products medicines and medical equipment ofac used twostep licensing procedure to review each contract on casebycase basis first an exporter had to obtain general license to enter into an executory contract that made performance contingent upon prior approval by ofac disclose ll parties with an interest in the sale and lay out all terms of the sale second the ex porter had to apply for specific license permitting performance of the executory contract before the sale can be completed ofac issued these re gulations under the authority of the export administration act of 1979 as extended that requires v alidated license to export any good to country determined to be sponsor of international terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs7 cuba through july 2001 commerces bi s administered different licensing rules for cuba applicable to us ship ments of eligible food and agricultural commodities farm inputs and medical products though various statutes and regulations prohibited most ex ports of us origin to cuba these exceptions allowed for the donation and sale of food and agri cultural products to individuals eligible nongovernmental entities and private bus inesses tsra though effectively supersedes these provisions to now allow for the commercial sale of agricultural and medical products to cuba under prescribed terms see below tsras changes to licensing rules section 906a of tsra allows sales of exempted agricultural and medical products to sanctione d countries on terms that are less restrictive than under previ ous policy see above the law stipulates that such exports shall only be made pur suant to oneyear licenses for contracts entered into during the oneyear period of the license and shipped within the 12 month period beginning on the date of the signing of the contract and that such oneyear licenses shall be more restrictive than license exceptions administered by the department of commerce or general licenses administered by the department of treasury the wording appears to require bis and ofac to consider license applications on streamlined and less conditioned basis ra ther than on the present casebycase and highly regulated basis in other words the apparent aim was to move away from complex and time consuming process that may require an exporter to walk through multiple step process to seek approval for the several transactions involved in completing one sale tsra also removes executive branch discretion in determining the time period that applies to transactions covered by an export license by placing defined time parameter on the period during which an pproved license covers eligible product transactions one related provision is intended to ensure that other licensing conditions and procedures cover multiple types of transactions eg an exporter submits one application providing the information required for all of the sales transactions covered by license anot her requires that regulations must ensure procedures that will deny licenses for exports to any entity or end user within an affected country that promot international terrorism debate over proposed licensing regulations in early 2001 bxa and ofac had drafted licensing rules to imp lement the new laws exemption these reportedly differed in some key respects bxa proposed for the countries under its jurisdiction cuba north korea and syria an arrangement to allow companies during oneyear period to export eligible products without the need to secure an individual license for each shipment bxa reportedly would have granted license exception if company agrees to mon itor sales of eligib products using prescribed set of parameters under this exception sales would still be subject to government audit ofac proposed for ll affected countries cuba iran libya north korea sudan and syria casebycase licensing system that includes end use verification its proposal was similar to rule s already in effect for iran libya and sudan this twostep licensing process would involve first approving license to allow an exporter to enter into negotiations to make sales and then issuing another license to cover actual shipments the reported differences in these draft regulations reflected conflicting views on how to in terpret tsras provisions as well as language that some observers suggested wa s unclear and contradictory as thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs8 4 sales on open account refers to transaction in which goods are released to buyer prior to payment or promise of payment because the exporter bears all the risk of non payment by the buyer this type of transaction requires high level of established trust between both parties an exporter however may view sales on these terms as providing continueddifferences became known during february 2001 members of c ongress and interest groups weighed in with their views regulations published biss rule allows for the sale of eligible agricultural products to cuba without an export license subject though to review of written contract if other federal agencies do not object within 11 days in other words bis will administer licensing ex ception with respect to only those products that are covered by the regu lations definitions of agri cultural and medical products ofacs rule requires an exporter to obt ain oneyear export license for sales of agricultural and medical sales to iran and sudan if reviewing agency objects within 11 days the license application is nied if concern is raised ofac has 30 more days to review the license request under the bush administrations libyan sanctions policy change nnounced apr il 23 2004 most us exports to libya longer require an export license some agricultural exporters have since expressed concern that the requirement to have ofac check each time that the end user eg buyer in iran and sudan is not involved in promoting international terro rism slows down the licensing process they have urged that ofac change its rules to reflect the more flexible licensing system implemented under clintons 1999 executive order payment and financing terms of exempted sales us policy seeks to ensure that sancti oned countries do not receive any financial benefit from permitted or licensed transactions it also prohibits such countries from accessing bank accounts and other ssets that their governments or organizations or firms in these countries hold in the united states tsra did not change current policy meaning that us banks cannot offer trade financing to facilitate export sales of exem pted products to such countri with respect to cuba tsra codifies two of the three types of financial transactions that ofac regulations permit to facilitate licensed food and medical product sa to iran and sudan other provisions prohibit us government support of such sales to ll sanctioned countries see prohibition on us governme nt assistance for export sales current prohibition and restrictions ofac regulations specifically prohibit us banks from extending financing to countries subject to us unilateral economic sanctions this policy is reflect ed in the current payment and financing rules that apply to licensed sales of agri cultural and medical products to iran and sudan laid out initially by clinton adminis tration policy and to cuba under embargo regulations with respect to the first tw countries ofac regulations allow only for payment of cash in advance to be made to the us seller for sanctioned countrys purchase of exempted products the two pe rmitted trade financing or credit terms are 1 sales on open account4 with certain limitations and 2 financing by thirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs9 4 continued entry to potential market that outweighs such risk such terms allow buyer to delay payment until the imported products have been examined 5 an example of third country financing would be french bank providing trade finance for us exporters sale of wheat to iran this bank must not be an affiliate of us bank nor of any iranian state financial institution 6 letter of credit lc is used when the importerbuyers ability to pay is uncertain or when the exporterseller needs it to obtain fina ncing lc gives the buyer the financial backing of an issuing bank which makes pa yment within specified time period to the seller via the sellers bank upon presentation of certain documents eg those that reflect the carrying out of sales contracts terms 7 under the bush administrations libyan sanctions policy change announced april 23 2004 tsra requirements longer apply with respect to the financing of sales of agricultural and medical productscountry banks that are neither an overseas office of us bank nor entities of the governments of these three countries5 us banks are permitted to advise or confirm letters of credit6 issued by third country banks but are prohibited from providing any trade financing an exporter must obtain general license from ofac for each of these payment or credit terms ofac so will consider an application from us banks for specific license to participate in financing sales on casebycase basis where such financing arrangements w ould not undermine overall compliance with us sanctions prohibition on us fina ncing of agricultural sales to cuba section 908b of tsra prohibits the financing of agricultural sa to cuba or any person in cuba by us banks any state or cal government the fe deral government or any other us private person or entity this prohibition effectively codifies provision in the cuban embargo regulati ons 31 cfr 515533f that does not allow trade financing for the comme rcial sale of food or ag ricultural commodities to non governmental entities in cuba that bis is authorized to license under 1999 policy change tsra language stipulates that licensed sales can occur only if paid in cash in advance or if financed by third country bank in codifying this financing prohibition the executive branch longer has discretion to re vise the financing rules should it determine the nature of the uscuban relationship is changing in practical terms this financing policy treat s cuba different th an other sanctioned countries under pre 2001 regulations with respect to licensed sales see also legislative developments 109th cong ress debate over cash in advance payment definition prohibition on us private financi ng of licensed exports to other countries the issue of prohibiting any us private financing of agricultural exports to cuba received much attention during the legislative debate however none of tsras provisions require any chan ge in ofac regulations that prohibit us private financing of agricultural nd medical product sales to iran and sudan7 with respect to these two countries ofac will continue to implement its current policy prohibiting us private financing of licensed sales though some thought that tsra would allow these countries to take advantage of us private financing despite the statutory prohibition imposed on cuba provision in the act explicitlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs10 addressed this issue in way that would require change to be made to existing regulations members supportive of the fi nancing exemption argued that since congress did not place in the law any restrictions on commercial financing for these countries new administrative regulations s hould not include restrictions that run counter to the congressional intent to liminate sanctions on those tools eg credit that can facilitate eligible commercial sales ofacs reported view was that since the thrust of us policy is to restrict currency flows to sancti oned countries it would be burdensome to set up mechanism to allow for the financing of agricultural and medical product sales and t hus better not to permit it prohibition on us government assistance for export sales section 908a of tsra prohibits ma king available any us government assistance including foreign aid credit or guarantees and export assistance for exports to cuba or for commercial exports to iran libya north korea or sudan wording grants the president authority to waive this prohibition for humanitarian reasons or if he determines it is in the national interest to do so with respect to iran libya north korea and sudan this wa iver authority does not extend to cuba statutory wording further differentiate s among the 5 abovecited countries by applying this prohibition on all exports nd not just commercial exports to cuba clarifying language also stipulates that this us government assistance prohibition does not alter modify or otherwise affect certain provisions of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity ac t of 1996 that authorizes the president to furnish assistance and provide ot her suppor t for individuals and independent non governmental organizations to support democracybuilding efforts for cuba and that require the president to take all necessary steps to ensure that funds or other assistance is provided to the cuban government in the regulations issued the bush administration chose not to exercise presidential waiver authority on this issu although some members of congress in 1999 and 2000 urged that credit guarantees be made available to f acilitate agricultural sales to iran us policy reaffirmed by tsra is to prohibit any government assistance for permitted commerc ial sales to sa nctioned country listed as sponsor of international terrorism this positi on is primarily based on the statutory prohibition found in section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 22 usc 2371 which tsra reaffirms definition of products covered by exemption compared to ofacs 1999 policy tsra broadens the types of agricultural products covered by the enacted exempti on sections 775 and 9021 such products are defined to include any agri cultural commodity food feed fiber or livestock and any derived product livestock is defi ned to include cattle sheep goats swine poultry including eggproduc ing poultry equine animals used for food or in the

commodities was that they could be used for military purposes ofacs regulations did not detail the other food products nor specify any medical product that could be sold and thus required an exporter to apply for license to ascertain whether product could be sold concern about the use of fertili zer and agrichemicals for military purposes was reflected also in ofac regulations which did not allow

suda n under the clinton administrations 1999 exemption policy were small relative to their total agricultural imports us farmers commodity groups and agribusiness eyed c uba as promising market calling for broadening of us policy to exempt f ood from sanctions in cuba they argued that us agriculture had lost out to foreign competitors in making sales to sizable nearby market total cuban agricultural imports aver aged about 800 million annually in the 20002002 period according to the food and agriculture organization leading commodities imported in 2002 were rice chicken meat and products wheat and flour whole dry milk lentils and corn f ood and agricultural imports in recent years have represented 17 of to tal cuban merchandise imports and have declined as share of total imports since the early 1990s top suppliers in 2002 as cuba took advantage of the us embargo exemp tion under tsra base d on preliminary data were canada the united states france china and brazil in addition cubas tourism industry reportedly imports an additional 100 to 250 million in food products to cover the needs of visiting tourists us agricultural interests argued that exempting agricultural exports from the us embargo on cuba would result in an opening that yields substantial sales various studies projected annual sale s could range from 100 million to over 1 billion depending on the time frame looked at and the extent of liberalization that occurred in uscuban trade these interests also held that such policy change will give us exporters particularly of rice and wheat competitive edge if cuba takes advantage of its proximity to buy from its nearest supplier in order to save the cost of transporting commodities and food from its more distant current suppliers france canada argentina c uba reportedly coul d save up to 100 million in transportation costs if officials decided to buy primarily from us agricultural exporters expectations in 2000 of large immediate us sales to the island were viewed as unrealistic according to other analysts analysts pointed to cubas limited financial resources its re liance on barter and credit transactions to finance agricultural imports its denial of access to us government programs and to all us public and private financing and the possibl application of othe r restrictive rules under current embargo regulations that could hamper such sales they also suggested that it was uncertain that cuba would purchase from the united states pointing out there may be pressure to maintain trade ties with some of its socialist partners supplying such key commodities as rice as well as resistance to relying on just one single supplier some also observed that the cuban government may not have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33499crs13 prepared for or interested in taking dvantage of this possible us trade opening top cuban officials including castro himself initially rejected the enacted measure they strongly criticized its financing travel and other prohibitions as unworkable and insulting they viewed it as tightening rather than an easing of the embargo and stated that cuba will not buy any u s product with such conditions in place sales activity to date notwithstanding this position the c uban government on november 13 2001 signaled interest in buying us agricultural commodities to quickly rebuild food reserves damaged or lost due to the deva station caused by hurricane michelle this move followed an earlier us government ffer of humanitarian assistance to which cuba responded on november 8 with reque st that the united states temporarily suspend tsras licensing requirements to purchase foodstuffs and allow cuban vessels to transport them from us ports the state department agreed only to speed up the licensing process and noted some problems might arise if cuban ships were used in late november and early decembe r 2001 negotiations be tween several us agribusiness firms and alimport cubas food import agency led to the signing of contracts to sell us wheat corn soybeans soymeal soyoil poultry and rice and other food products valued at 35 million the

of state in late november and early december 2004 some members of congress questioned or expr essed opposition to the administrations plans they noted that the change being considered to require seller to receive payment before shipment leaves us port would be mu ch more restrictive than current practice and would impede agricultural sales to cuba one senator argued that more restrictive rule would constitute new sanction that in itself would require congressional approval unde r tsra provisions in order to take effect separately coalition of agricultural groups and businesses in december 8 2004 letter to president bush stated that us exporters have followed explicitly both the letter and spirit of the law in selling food products to cuba they argued the proposed restrictive guideline would run counter to the norms of international trade which simply require payment to be received prior to the shipments release to the buyer eg payment before transfer of title to the buyer even if

opponents of the rule have signal ed their intent to continue to work with congress to overturn it this slight shift in policy prompted nator baucus to lift his hold on six treasury nominees who were
