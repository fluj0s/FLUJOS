unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 4 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information chapter i watchlisting process and procedures i introduction 11 key foundation for terroristrelated screening is the us governments terrorist watchlisting process managed by the terrorist screening center tsc the tsc was established by the attorney general acting through the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi and in coordination with the secretary of state the secretary of homeland security and the then director of central intelligence for the intelligence community ic the tsc is supported by the national counterterrorism center nctc the department of state dos the department of homeland security diis the ic the fbi law enforcement agencies regulatory agencies and diplomatic bureaus the tsc has created and maintains the terrorist screening database tsdb or terrorist watchlist to serve as the us governments consolidated watchlist for terrorism screening information 12 the current terrorist watchlisting process supports the us governments efforts to combat terrorism by 1 consolidating the us governments terrorist watchlist in the tsdb 2 helping screeners and intelligence agencies accurately identify individuals on the terrorist watchlist 3 providing screeners with information to help them respond appropriately during encounters with known or suspected terrorists and 4 subsequently collecting information about the known or suspected terrorist for use in assessing threats and conducting investigations2 the collected information may be incorporated into the terrorist identities datamart environment tide and tsdb to enhance the records of known or suspected terrorists and may be made available to the wider watchlisting and screening communities today the tsdb also includes information about certain foreign nationals who are associated with terrorism terrorist activity or known or suspected terrorists but for whom there is insufficient derogatory information to be independently watchlisted this may include certain immediate family members of known or suspected terrorists or known associates of known or suspected terrorists these additional categories of records also known as exceptions to the reasonable suspicion standard are maintained to support immigration and screening activities primarily conducted by dos and dhs3 see appendix 1 definitions for words or phrases appearing in all capitalized letters throughout this watchlisting guidance 2 screenfr is department or agency that is authorized to conduct terrorism screening to determine if an individual is possible match to known or suspected terrorist in the tsdb the term scrfener is used throughout this document as general reference to government official who compares an individuals information with information in the tsdb to determine if an individual is in the tsdb certain screeners have components which perform both screening and law enforcement duties and law enforcement officials who engage in such activities may normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than screening for ease of reference government officials who compare an individuals information with information in the tsdb will be referred to in the guidance as screeners the internal guidance set forth herein is not intended to create or confer any rights privileges or benefits in any matter case or proceeding see united stales v caceres 440 us 741 see chapter 3 section v infra for more details aside from these limited exceptions references to the tsdb in this watchlisting guidance denote the tsdb as containing information about known or suspected terrorists unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 5 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information 13 this watchlisting guidance has been developed to help standardize the watchlisting communitys nomination and screening processes it is important to remember however that watchlisting is not an exact science there are inherent limitations in any primarily name based system and analytic judgments may differ regarding whether subjective criteria have been met given these realities the us governments watchlisting process attempts to safeguard the american people from terrorist attack while safeguarding privacy civil rights and civil liberties 14 thus when reasonable minds could disagree on record nominator will make determination in favor of sending the nomination to nctc for consideration and additional review the tsc has the final decision authority regarding watchlisting determinations and will add an individuals name to the tsdb consistent with tsc actions and processes as further described in paragraph 156 ii watchlisting authorities 15 on september 16 2003 the president issued homeland security presidential directive 6 hspd6 which directed the attorney general to establish an organization to consolidate the us governments approach to terrorism screening and provide for the appropriate and lawful use of terrorist information in screening processes4 terrorist information was specifically defined to mean information about individuals known or appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting in preparation for in aid of or related to terrorism hspd6 also directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to provide to nctc on an ongoing basis all appropriate terrorist information in their possession custody or control to the extent permitted by law 16 the intent of hspd6 was to consolidate all terrorism information at the terrorist threat integration center ttic whose functions were assumed by nctc in classified database that would then extract unclassified for official use only ufouo terrorist identifiers for passage to the new organization created by the attorney general thus concurrent with the issuance of hspd6 the tsc was established via the memorandum of understanding on the integration and use of screening information to protect against terrorism tsc mou which was signed by the attorney general the secretaries of state and homeland security and the director of central intelligence on behalf of the ic6 4 see appendix 2 hspd6 5 see fn 8 infra see appendix 3 tsc mou see also appendix 4 addendum b to the tsc mou in 2004 the secretaries of state treasury and defense also became signatories to the memorandum of understanding between the intelligence community federal law enforcement agencies and the department of homeland security concerning information sharing dated march 4 2003 information sharing mou hy doing so they agreed that all provisions of the tsc mou and the information sharing mou apply to all entities that are or become part of their respective departments unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 6 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information 17 under hspd6 consistent with the us constitution and applicable laws including those protecting the rights of all americans the tsc was to develop and maintain an unclassified database containing the most thorough accurate and current identity information possible about known or suspected terrorists the tsc created the tsdb to meet these goals7 the tsdb is also known as the terrorist watchlist the tsdb receives terrorist identifiers from two sources nctcs tide provides information concerning known or suspected international terrorists and the tscs terrorist review and examinations unit trex provides the identities of known or suspected domestic terrorists who have link to international terrorism nctcs tide contains identifying and substantive derogatory information on known or suspected international terrorists and the fbis sentinel system contains supporting information regarding purely domestic terrorists 18 pursuant to paragraph 2 of hspd6 the nctc is mandated to provide tsc with access to all appropriate information or intelligence in the nctcs custody possession or control that tsc requires to perform its functions nctc fulfills this function by providing tscs tsdb with ufouo information about known or suspected terrorists from nctcs tide and by providing access to tide online readonly copy of the tide database to those in the watchlisting community who require access 19 nctcs establishment by the president was codified by section 1021 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 irtpa8 pursuant to irtpa nctc shall serve as the central and shared knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups in addition nctc may consistent with applicable law the direction of the president and guidelines referred to in the statute receive intelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic counterterrorism from any federal state or local government or other source necessary to fulfill its responsibilities and retain and disseminate such intelligence9 191 all departments and agencies arc required to provide nctc with all terrorism information due to the amount of information involved only subset of this information is provided in the nctc prescribed format designed to facilitate direct ingestion into the tide nominating departments and agencies however should remain focused on reviewing and watchlisting terrorism information from datasets most likely to contain information about known or suspected terrorists addendum b to the tsc mov which superseded addendum incorporates by reference all provisions of the information sharing mou see appendix 5 7 the tsdb consolidates the us governments terrorism screening and lookout databases into single integrated terrorist identities database 8 nctc initially was created by executive order 13354 august 27 2004 to serve as the primary organization in the us government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the us government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism excepting purely domestic counterterrorism information executive order 13354 was revoked by executive order 13470 july 30 2008 after nctc was codified in irtpa section 1021 9 in addition to the provision of domestic known or suspected terrorists directly to the tsc the tscs trex unit also provides the identities of international known or suspected terrorists to nctc for inclusion in tide unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 7 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information 110 on august 27 2004 the president issued homeland security presidential directive 11 hspd11 which builds upon hspd6 to enhance terrorlstrelated screening to more effectively detect and interdict suspected terrorists and terrorist activities hspd11 defines suspected terrorists as individuals known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting in preparation for in aid of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities 111 to enhance information sharing another key component of the consolidated terrorist watchlisting system the president issued executive order 13388 which provides that the head of each agency that possesses or acquires terrorism information shall promptly give access to that information to the head of cach other agency that has counterterrorism functions10 112 on june 5 2008 the president issued homeland security presidential directive 24 hspd 24 to further build upon the terrorist screening policies announced in hspd6 and hspd i i to protect the nation from terrorists by enhancing the use of biometrics in hspd24 the president directed that agencies shall to the fullest extent permitted by law make available to other agencies all biomctric and associated biographic and contextual information associated with persons for whom there is an articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion that they pose threat to national security emphasis added hspd24 underscores the value of biometrics in achieving effective terrorism screening and emphasizes the need for layered approach to identification and screening of individuals as single mechanism is sufficient 113 the relevant terrorism screening presidential directives use words and phrases to describe known or suspected terrorist subject to terrorist screening without defining them terrorist information hspd6 terrorism hspd6 appropriately suspected hspd6 reasonably suspected hspd11 and articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion hspd24 thus previous watchlisting guidance supplied definitions of key terms and the standard that would apply to terrorist watchlisting decisions 114 neither hspd6 nor hspd11 defines terrorism andor terrorist activities while federal law contains numerous definitions of terrorism for watchlisting purposes under this guidance terrorism andor terrorist activities combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to 1141 involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life property or infrastructure 10 see appendix 6 executive order 13388 11 see 50

or coercion or 11423 to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction assassination kidnapping or hostagetaking 115 this includes activities that facilitate or support terrorism andor terrorist activities such as providing safe house transportation communications funds transfer of funds or other material benefit false documentation or identification weapons including chemical biological or radiological weapons explosives or training for the commission of an act of terrorism andor terrorist activity 116 hspd24 speaks in terms of articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion to describe known or suspected terrorist who should be watchlistcd and represents the presidents most recent explanation concerning us policy regarding the individuals who pose threat to national security and should be screened to better protect the american people accordingly that standard has been adopted and is clarified in this watchlisting guidance in chapter 3 section ii 117 on december 16 2005 in accordance with section 1016 of irtpa the president issued memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies prescribing the guidelines and requirements in support of the creation and implementation of the information sharing environment ise in guideline 5 of that memorandum the president directed as he had earlier in executive order 13353 2 that the information privacy rights and other legal rights of americans must be protected and that guidelines be developed and approved to ensure that such rights are protected in the development and use of the ise in december 2006 the president approved for issuance the ise privacy guidelines by the program manager13 118 second addendum to the tsc mov addendum bl4 which supplements and incorporates by reference all provisions of the tsc mou superseded addendum and became effective on january 18 2007 the directors of national intelligence nctc and the tsc joined as signatories in addendum b paragraph 7 of addendum b introduces the term terrorist identifiers to more clearly describe the type of terrorist identity elements that are deemed 12 see executive order 13353 establishing the presidents board on safeguarding americans civil liberties august 27 2004 13 see guidelines to ensure that information privacy and other legal rights of americans are protected in the development and use of the information sharing environment december 2006 14 see appendix 4 addendum b to the tsc mou unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 9 unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information ufouo without regard to the classification of the source material from which it is drawn terrorist identifiers include those listed in addendum b ie names and aliases dates of birth places of birth unique identifying numbers passport information countries of origin and nationality physical identifiers known locations photographs or renderings fingerprints or other biometric data employment data license plate numbers and any other terrorist identifiers that originators specifically provide for passage to the tsc for example email addresses and phone numbers are increasingly useful for screening purposes originators should mark email addresses and phone numbers as ufouo whenever possible and pass these terrorist identifiers to nctc to forward to the tsc for inclusion in tsdb originators are encouraged to provide all relevant and unclassified information to include social media information when appropriate iii constitutionally protected activities 119 first amendment first amendment protected activity alone shall not be the basis for nominating an individual for inclusion on the terrorist watchlist15 the following arc examples of protected constitutional activities 1191 free speech the exercise of free speech guaranteed by the us constitution includes more than simply speaking on controversial topic in the town square it includes such symbolic or other written oral and expressive activities as carrying placards in parade sending letters to newspaper editor wearing tee shirt with political message placing bumper sticker critical of the president on ones car and publishing books or articles the common thread in these examples is conveying public message or an idea through words or deeds speech that may be repugnant to ideas of the majority may still be protected by the us constitution for the purpose of this watchlisting guidance the right of protected free speech under the us constitution applies to us persons wherever they are located and to non us persons located inside the united states the right of protected free speech however is not unlimited and may not extend to some lawless action 1192 exercise of religion the free exercise of religion covcrs any form of worship of deity even forms that are not widely known or practiccd as well as the right not to worship any deity protected religious exercise also extends to dress that is worn or food that is eaten for religious purpose attendance at facility used for religious practice observance of the sabbath raising money for evangelical or missionary purposes and proselytizing 1193 freedom of the press freedom of the press includes such matters as reasonable access to newsmaking events the making of documentaries and the posting of blogs 15 the first amendment does not apply to nonus persons outside the united states before submitting nominations nominators may consult with their department or agency counsel to determine whether specific person is us person and whether the questioned activity is entitled to first amendment protection unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page 10 unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information 1194 freedom of peaceful assembly freedom of peaceful assembly often called the right to freedom of association includes gathering with others to protest government action or to rally or demonstrate in favor of or in opposition to social cause the right to peaceful assembly includes more than just public demonstrations it includes as well the posting of group websites on the internet recruiting others to lawful cause marketing message and fundraising which all are protected first amendment activities if they are conducted in support of an organizational political religious or social cause 1195 petition the government for redress of grievances the right to petition the government for redress of grievances includes for example writing letters to congress carrying placard outside the city hall that delivers political message recruiting others to ones cause and lobbying congress or an executive agency for particular result 120 equal protection the equal protection clause of the us constitution provides in part that state shall make or enforce any law which shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws the us supreme court has made it clear that this applies as well to the official acts of us government personnel nominations therefore shall not be based solely on race ethnicity national origin or religious affiliation any activities relating to this guidance that are based solely on such considerations are invidious by definition and therefore unconstitutional iv watchlisting policies 121 watchlisting disclosures the general policy of the us government is to neither confirm nor deny an individuals watchlist status in addition to the provisions in addendum b to the tsc mou which require nominator approval before tsdb information can be used in any process that might result in public disclosure the 2007 memorandum of understanding on terrorist watchlist redress procedures redress mou16 requires screeners contact the tsc if it receives request for information or records that might reveal an individuals watchlist status approval would also be required from any entity which provided information used by nominator during nomination per the redress mou originating and nominating agencies are obligated to support screener determinations both at the administrative level and in litigation and provide appropriate information including unclassified substitutes as necessary tsc in conjunction with nctc the nominators and the department of justice doj as appropriate will ensure that representations regarding an individuals potential watchlist status are properly coordinated and approved 122 legal or use restrictions because information in the tsdb comes overwhelmingly from intelligence sources and methods or sensitive law enforcement techniques paragraph 12 of 16 see appendix 8 redress mou unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page 11 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information addendum b to the tsc mou1 requires that any recipient of information from the tsdb seeking to use terrorist identity information in any legal or administrative process or proceeding obtain nominator approval before doing so approval from the entity which provided the information if other than the nominator is also required additionally information from foreign intelligence surveillance act f1sa collections may only be used in proceeding with the advance authorization of the attorney general therefore any screener seeking to use tsdb information in any process or proceeding must contact tsc so that tsc can assist in obtaining approval from the nominator owner of the information or attorney general as required 123 in addition to the foregoing restrictions there are restrictions on sharing information with foreign governments any terrorist identifier as described in addendum b to the tsc mou will be deemed ufouo and shared with the watchlisting community and foreign governments for watchlisting purposes pursuant to the terms of the tsc mou accordingly nomina tors should include as appropriate terrorist identifiers in documents that contain nonreleasable warnings eg report is not releasable to xxxyyyzzz countries unless the terrorist identifiers are restricted by some other authority that limits dissemination if us person information is otherwise authorized for release to the foreign government the non releasable warning is disabled to allow dissemination of the information v watchlisting standard identifying and substantive derogatory criteria 124 before known or suspected terrorist is added to the terrorist watchlist tsc reviews the nomination to determine whether it meets the following minimum identifying criteria and minimum substantive derogatory criteria for inclusion in the tsdb 1241 minimum identifying criteria each nomination must contain minimum identifying criteria for inclusion into the tsdb without this minimum identifying data the nomination is not eligible for inclusion into the tsdb or any of the tscs supported systems chapter 2 sets forth guidance regarding both the minimum identifying biometric and biographic criteria for inclusion into the tsdb although tide accepts records containing less than these minimum criteria such records will not be exported either to the tsdb for watchlisting or to the various supported systems used by the screeners absent an exception described in the watchlisting guidance 1242 minimum substantive derogatory criteria in addition to the minimum identifying criteria nominations to the tsdb are accepted based on reasonable suspicion that the individual is known or suspected terrorist derived from the 17 see appendix 4 addendum b to the tsc mou unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 12 unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information totality of the information reviewed for nomination18 to demonstrate that the nomination has sufficient indicia of reliability to support this reasonable suspicion determination nominating agencies should implement processes designed to ensure that nominations are free from errors that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisionsretractions are made nominating agencies should to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting verify the accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations in some cases the nominating agency may not be able to evaluate the reliability of the information received however in such situations the nominating agency can ensure that the information provided is an accurate representation of the information obtained chapter 3 sets forth further guidance regarding the application of the reasonable suspicion standard to tsdb nominations vi watchlisting process overview 125 the authorities referenced in section ii of this chapter created the framework for the watchlisting enterprise by combining various functions of existing government entities and joining them to new organizations with counterterrorism responsibilities the resulting watchlisting enterprise consists of originators nominators aggregators screeners and encountering agencies that are supported by the communitywide collection nomination and consolidation processes 126 originators nominators aggregators and screeners all executive departments and agencies have responsibility for collecting collating and sharing terrorism information to support the watchlisting process they are called originators because they initially collect and identify information supporting the conclusion that an individual is known or suspected terrorist an originator is the department or agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority and collects terrorism information ie raw information and disseminates it or terrorist identifiers to other us government entities via an intelligence report ie finished intelligence or other mechanism in general when an originator has identified international terrorism information and determines that information should be provided to nctc the originator takes on the nominator role nominator is federal department or agency that has information to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for known or suspected terrorist and nominates that individual to tide and the tsdb based on information that originated with that agency 127 while all nominators have the duty of upholding informational standards the nctc and tsc are distinctly responsible for ensuring data quality and the integrity of their respective repositories nctc and tsc are themselves potential nominators analysts from the 18 please note that there are also certain exceptions to the minimum biographic information and minimum substantive derogatory criteria required for terrorist watchlist nominations that support immigration and visa screening activities conducted by dhs and dos see chapter 2 section 111 and chapter 3 section v unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page 13 unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information nctc may discover an individual who is eligible for watchlisting while reviewing allsource information in these cases nctc analysts will request that the originator submit nomination for inclusion into tide or on limited basis or during exigent circumstances nctc analysts may update tide directly with disseminated report and noticc to the originators in instances where disseminated reporting is used to enhance tide nctc will provide notice back to the collecting agency via tide tsc may also nominate terrorism information received pursuant to terrorism screening conducted by foreign governments 128 nctc and i sc are responsible for reviewing both newly nominated individuals as well as subsets of existing records to determine if additional andor enhancement research is required to locate missing information critical to the watchlisting process in some cases this will require research to locate additional derogatory information to meet the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for watchlisting in other cases this will require research to locate additional biographic or biometric identifiers in order to provide comprehensive record maximizing the probability of confirming positive match to an identity contained in the tsdb 129 aggregators are those who receive and hold terrorism informa hon and certain other nonterrorlsm information they are authorized to receive and retain for example two of nctcs main statutory missions are to serve as the 1 central and shared knowledge bank on known or suspected terrorists and 2 primary organization in the us government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence information possessed or acquired by the us government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism19 130 tsc takes on the role of an aggregator when known or suspected terrorist is encountered and the individuals record is enhanced or updated with encounterrelated information as noted in paragraphs 11 and 17 the tsc manages the watchlisting process and plays key role in helping departments and agencies determine whether an encounter with member of the public is one with known or suspected terrorist additional terrorism information or terrorist identifiers are generated during encounters and the encounter management application ema20 uses that information to update records of known or suspected terrorists 131 screeners vet against the tsdb to determine if an individual is possible match to known or suspected terrorist in the tsdb screeners can include federal state local tribal territorial or foreign governments and certain private entities screening officials include homeland security officers consular affairs officers transportation safety personnel and officials of foreign governments with whom the united states has entered into terrorism screening information sharing agreement pursuant to hspd6 certain departments and agencies have components which perform both screening and law enforcement duties if see 50 usc 404o 30 ema is an application used by the tsc to administer encounter information unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page 14 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information screener believes an individual may be on the watchlist the screener contacts the tscs terrorist screening operations center tsoc the tsoc will determine whether the individual the screener has encountered is in fact positive match to the individual who is on the terrorist watchlist the tsoc may also notify the fbis counterterrorism division ctd that there has been positive encounter with watchlistcd subject tscs terrorist screening operations unit tsou coordinates the appropriate operational response to the encounter based on the terrorism information made available by the originating agency the screener will take action based upon its specific authorities eg requiring additional screening at an airport checkpoint denying visa application determining admissibility into the united states and follow appropriate encounter procedures as set forth in chapter 5 132 collection nomination consolidation and the use of the terrorist watchlist to perform screening processes the following is chart depicting the collection terrorist nomination

inside the tsdb cylinder because not every nomination from nctc for international terrorism or the fbi for domestic terrorism is exported from the tsdb to screeners represented by the multicolored blocks at the far right of the chart21 for example certain categories of individuals that do not meet the minimum identifying criteria see chapter 2 section ii or the reasonable suspicion standard see chapter 3 section ii can be watchlisted to support immigration and visa screening activities by dhs and dos see chapter 3 section v but are not exported to statelocaltribal screeners or foreign partners similarly when originators provide fragmentary information to nctc for inclusion in tide such information will not be exported from tide to the tsdb unless the nominating agency believes there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual is known or suspected terrorist fragmentary information is provided to nctc where it can be further analyzed connected to existing information and added to tide for export to tsdb because nctc and not individual originators has access to all the information available to the us government on known or suspected terrorist vii roles and responsibilites for the watchlisting and screening community 134 delineation of roles and responsibilities of nominating agencies screeners nc tc and the tsc is critical to provide for an effective and efficient integrated terrorist watchlist enterprise while iispd6 describes the broad mandate of developing an integrated watchlist system and the tsc mou provides level of detail needed to fulfill that mandate further clarification is required to ensure there are neither gaps in the nomination process nor wasteful redundancies 135 pursuant to uspd6 departments and agencies in the executive branch are required to the extent permitted by law to provide terrorist information to nctc this process will be accomplished either through direct nomination to nctc or through specific component designated by federal department or agency head for doing so eg all doj components are directed to nominate through the fbi dhs intelligence and analysis has oversight responsibility for all dhs nominations except as detailed in the sections applicable to expedited nominations see paragraphs 158 and 159 nominating agencies will endeavor to provide comprehensive nominations and include the maximum amount of identifying and derogatory information22 nominating departments and agencies should prioritize l the terrorist screening database annex d to the fbi memorandum of understanding with department of defense dod signed february 22 2012 established dod as screening agency customer of the tsc the dashed line in the latter chart represents that dod is finalizing procedures to receive and use information from the tsdb for its screening processes 22 in may 2010 the deputies asked that nominating agencies ensure that nominations are comprehensive and include the maximum amount of identifying and derogatory information in 2012 the interagency policy committee ipc in coordination with nominators screeners nctc and tsc developed prioritized list of data identifiers that arc critical to screening and identity resolution activities this identity resolution and enhancement tiers document is available on nctcs watchlisting community of interest portal on the joint worldwide intelligence communications system jwics unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 16 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information the identification of new known or suspected terrorists who meet the reasonable suspicion standard along with the identifying and derogatory information most useful to watchlisting and screening effort as well as assisting in identity resolution 136 each department or agency that nominates known or suspected terrorist to nctc for watchlisting is under continuing obligation to provide nctc with newly identified derogatory information or exculpatory information obtained by that department or agency each department or agency also has the responsibility to provide nctc with newly identified identifying and derogatory information obtained from their department or agency regardless if they were the original nominating agency 137 with the noted exception of the visa viper program departments and agencies should not nominate known or suspected terrorists to nctc based on information that they do not originate without first coordinating with the originator viii quality control measures 138 in order to produce and maintain the most reliable and accurate information in tide tsdb and screening databases quality control is considered responsibility of all entities nominating departments and agencies must establish and maintain processes including appropriate training and guidance to ensure information transmitted to nctc is consistent with the source of the information 139 hspd6 requirements 1ispd6 requires the tsc to maintain thorough accurate and current information concerning known or suspected terrorists for watchlisting purposes current means information that the nominating agency reasonably believes is valid and accurate the requirement that information be current does not necessarily preclude information that is several years old from being included in the tsdb if there is reason to believe the information may have changed eg information regarding an individuals date of birth or terrorist activity was collected 20 years ago but has not been superseded by additional

executive order 12333 defines us person as united states citizen an alien known by the intelligence element concerned to be permanent resident alien an unincorporated association substantially composed of united states citizens or permanent resident aliens or corporation incorporated in the united states except for corporation directed or controlled by foreign government or governments the watchlisting guidance also contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for terrorist watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by the dhs and dos to determine whether ineligibilities exist for admission to the united states or visa adjudication pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina because the ina defines aliens as any person not citizen or national of the united states the ina admissibility provisions also apply to lawful permanent residents lprs in certain circumstances who are considered us persons under executive order

25 2009 the watchlisting guidance was reviewed to determine whether adjustments were needed the revised guidance was approved by the white house deputies committee on may 25 2010 and issued to the watchlisting community on july 16 2010 after multiagency classification review 32 this chapter of the watchlisting guidance has been updated to reflect the watchlisting communitys experiences with the guidance since issuance in july of 2010 by the deputies committee one of the more notable changes of this updated version of the watchlisting guidance is the restructuring of instances for when par ticularized derogatory information is required another notable change includes the reintroduction of guidance relative to the terrorist facilitators or supporters from an earlier version of the watchlisting guidance and the inclusion of additional exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for terrorist watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities of the dos and dhs ii reasonable suspicion 33 for purposes of watchlisting an individual to the tsdb the nominator should determine whether there is reasonable suspicion that an individual is known or suspected terrorist40 34 reasonable suspicion to meet the reasonable suspicion standard the nomina tor based on the totality of the circumstances must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrants determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting in preparation for in aid of or related to terrorism andor terrorist activities there must be an objective factual basis for the nominator to believe that the individual is known or suspected terrorist mere guesses or hunches are not sufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion that an individual is known or suspected terrorist reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the reasonable suspicion standard set forth herein is not sufficient basis to watchlist an individual the facts however given fair consideration should sensibly lead to the conclusion that an individual is or has engaged in terrorism andor terrorist activities 40 in instances where reasonable suspicion is not found nominators should also determine whether the individual should be nominated to support immigration and visa screening by dhs and dos see chapter 3 section v unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 33 unclassjfiedfor official use onlysensitive security information 35 due weight in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists due weight should be given to the specific reasonable inferences that nominator is entitled to draw from the facts in light of hisher experience and not on unfounded suspicions or hunches although irrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not neccssary to be reasonable suspicion should be as clear and as fully developed as circumstances permit for additional guidance regarding the nomination of us persons see paragraph 315 36 nominators shall not nominate an individual based on source reporting that nominating personnel identify as or know to be unreliable or not credible single source information including but not limited to walkin writein or postings on social media sites however should not automatically be discounted merely because of the manner in which it was received instead the nominating agency should evaluate the credibility of the source as well as the nature and specificity of the information and nominate even if that source is uncorroborated assuming the information supports reasonable suspicion that the individual is known or suspected terrorist or there is another basis for watchlisting the individual 37 criteria and data ouality to demonstrate that the nomination has sufficient indicia of reliability to support reasonable suspicion determination nominating agencies should incorporate processes designed to ensure that nominations are free of errors and to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting have not come from sources known or determined to be unreliable nominating agencies should to the extent possible verify the accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations in addition to ensuring that nominations are free from errors nominating agencies should implement procedures designed to ensure that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisionsretractions are made 38 particularized derogatory information particularized derogatory information is the type of information relied on to determine whether reasonable suspicion is met this is information that demonstrates the nature of an individuals or groups association with terrorism andor terrorist activities that is descriptive and specific to an event or activity and is more than label for example subject x provides false travel documentation for alqaida operatives is particularized derogatory information whereas subject is supporter standing alone is not considered particularized derogatory information 39 potential behavioral indicators in making reasonable suspicion determination nominators should consider behavioral indicators known to be associated with particular known or suspected terrorists the following is list or few examples of those indicators it is not an exclusive list and it includes activity that may have innocent explanations wholly unrelated to terrorism furthermore some activities conducted by us persons or activities taking place within the united states may be an exercise of rights guaranteed by the first amendment

41 on october 21 2004 the deputies committee established the criteria for the fly and selectee lists on january 10 2005 the dhs released the fly and selectee lists implementation guidance implementation guidance to provide direction on how to implement the fly and selectee list criteria the implementation guidance was updated and supplemented on july 25 2006 42 on february 8 2008 the deputies committee approved the addition of third and fourth criterion to the fly list the terrorist screening center policy board working group 9 revised the implementation guidance on march 5 2008 to provide direction on how to implement these new criteria 43 following the attempted terrorist attack on december 25 2009 the president directed that review of the current fly and selectee list criteria be conducted and recommendations be made regarding whether any adjustments were needed the terrorist screening center policy board working group in conjunction with the information sharing access ipc recommended certain changes in the lists criteria and implementation guidance those recommendations were approved by the deputies committee on july 16 2010 11 preconditions for placement on the fly or selectee list 44 generally in order to be included on cither the fly or selectee list two preconditions must both be met 441 minimum identifying criteria absent special situation as

451 threat of committing an act of international terrorism as defined in 18 usc 23311 or domestic terrorism as defined in 18 usc 23315 with respect to an aircraft including threat of air piracy or threat to airline passenger or civil aviation security or 452 threat of committing an act of domestic terrorism as defined in 18 usc 23315 with respect to the homeland72 or 453 threat of committing an

installations as defined by 10 usc 2801c4 us ships us aircraft or other auxiliary craft owned or leased by the us government or 454 threat of engaging in or conducting violent act of terrorism and who is operationally capable73 of doing so 46 detainees at the naval station guantanamo bay cuba any individual who was detainee held at the naval station guantanamo bay cuba unless the president certifies in writing to congress that the detainee poses threat to the united states its citizcns or its allies for purposes of this subparagraph the term detainee means an individual in the custody or under the physical control of the united states as result of armed conflict74 iv further clarification of the fly criteria 47 third fly list criterion prior to the addition of the third fly list criterion see paragraph 453 concern over the breadth of the fly list arose when known or suspected terrorists who posed threat to us military base overseas did not meet the criteria for inclusion on the fly list despite national interests the threat to the overseas military base did not involve either civil aviation as set forth in the first fly list criterion or an act of domestic terrorism to the homeland as set forth in the second fly list criterion domestic terrorism requires that subjects terrorist activities occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states homeland does not include bases and embassies located abroad even in those instances when the ic had identified known or suspected terrorists specific target known or suspected terrorists maintained the advantage of operational flexibility the third fly list criterion addresses 72 domestic acts of terrorism are those that primarily occur within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states see 18 usc 23315c 73 see paragraph 482 infra that defines operationally capable 74 see 49 usc 44903j2cv unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information page i 51 unclassifiedfor

october 12 2000 attack upon the us navy guided missile destroyer uss cole while it was harbored in the yemeni port of aden 48 fourth fly list criterion 481 enable flexibility the fourth fly list criterion see paragraph 454 is intended to enable flexibility for nominations to the fly list of operationally capable known or suspected terrorists who pose threat of committing an act of international terrorism abroad but who do not meet the first second or third fly list criterion because they do not pose threat to civil aviation threat to the homeland or threat to us facilities and their associated or supporting personnel previously the fly list criteria did not prevent known or suspected terrorists from traveling aboard aircraft even though they may have had the intent and opera tional capability to commit terrorist act against us nationals abroad outside of the homeland or against target with nexus to the united states or its nationals the fourth fly list criterion now addresses these two vulnerabilities 482 operationally capable defined an individual is operationally capable if based on credible intelligence he or she acting individually or in concert with others reasonably appears to have the ability knowledge opportunity and intent or is actively seeking the opportunity to engage in violent act of terrorism consistent with 18 usc 2331 or 18 usc 2332b for example attempting to obtain an 1ed would indicate an individual is operationally capable of committing an act of terrorism however simply conducting internet research concerning leds would not be sufficient without additional activity depending on the circumstances and in combination with other facts scouting potential targets or traveling for legitimate purpose to places that have terrorist training grounds regardless of whether the person is presently capable of using an ied might also indicate an individual is operationally capable of committing an act of terrorism 483 possible indicators of being operationally capable in determining whether an individual is operationally capable consideration should be given to the following indicators regarding ability knowledge opportunity andor intent 4831 subject has undergone terrorist training or been provided some instruction to includc receiving military training by designated terrorist group 4832 subject has indicated intent to participate in planningconducting an attack 4833 subject has expressed desire to martyr himherself 4834 subject is in repeated contact with known terrorist facilitator who recruits or

scenarios set forth below serve as some examples of fly list nominations that would fall under the fourth fly list criterion 491 there is credible information that the planning or preparation for terrorist attack against the interests of the united states or foreign government is ongoing and there is an indication that an individual is operationally capable 492 there is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to target us interests the actual target may be unknown but indicated to be commercial facility frequented by us citizens abroad intelligence identifies an operational or preoperational capability of this individual whose cell is planning near term attack on target eg plot to kill us nationals residing in foreign hotel or frequenting foreign nightclub or 493 there is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to target foreign governments the actual target may be unknown but indicated to be foreign government facility such as an embassy consulate mission or military installation intelligence identifies an operational or preoperational capability of this individual whose cell is planning nearterm attack on target eg plot to bomb the british parliament or the march 11 2004 madrid bombing 410 onetime waiver policy 4101 tsa regulations prohibit us flagged air carriers and foreign flagged

review or authorize an otw until such time as an acceptable itinerary is available 41032 in order to facilitate communication with such an individual the us government has determined as matter of policy that us citizens denied boarding on commercial flight returning to the united states should be referred to the consular section of the nearest us embassy or consulate which will facilitate communication with the individual including providing the individual with instructions in the event an otw is authorized in keeping with the us governments traditional policy of neither confirming nor denying whether an individual is on the terrorist watchlist the individual is not informed of his or her watchlist status or that he or she would be traveling under waiver v selectee list criteria 411

boarding an aircraft 414 selectcc expanded selectee and random screening all result in the same operational response of receiving enhanced screening by transportation security officers prior to boarding an aircraft tsa will notify the tsc of all fly selectee and expanded selectee encounters viii implementation guidelines 415 general guidelines the watchlisting community has developed six general guidelines regarding the fly and selectee lists that should be rcemphasied in order to effectively implement the fly list and selectee list criteria the six general guidelines are 4151 when evaluating the significance relevancc and validity of threat careful consideration should be given to the extent to which the threat is current specific and credible 4152 the selectee list is not default position for those who do not qualify for inclusion on the fly list and has distinct elements that must be met before an individual may be included 4153 the purpose of the fly list is to protect against acts of terrorism inclusion on the fly list has consequenccs that arc operational legal economic and diplomatic 4154 except for expedited nominations made pursuant to paragraph 158 of the watchlisting guidance the decision to include person on the fly list or selectcc list must include substantive derogatory information that satisfies the aforementioned criteria and thus justifies inclusion on either list in cases where nominations contain substantive derogatory information or contain insufficient substantive derogatory information the individual will not be included on either the fly list or selectee list 4155 in accordance with determinations made pursuant to paragraph 159 of the watchlisting guidance the white house may direct the tsc to place categories of individuals

information and credible intelligence information or particular threat stream that indicates certain category of individuals may conduct an act of domestic or international terrorism 4156 under exigent operational circumstances when derogatory information may not be widely disseminated or stored in fide individual watchlist status determinations can be made by the director of the tsc in accordance with the relevant criteria76 contained in the watchlisting guidance coordination should occur with relevant nominating agencies and screeners 416 totality of the information the foregoing guidance is neither intended to be determinative nor intended to serve as checklist rather it is intended to guide the watchlisting community in assessing whether the established criteria are satisfied for specific record based on the totality of available information current threat stream andor the current threat environment ix special situations77 417 requirement for full names and complete dates of birth generally terrorist identities nominated to either the fly or the selectee list must have both full name and complete date of birth identities without both will usually not be included on either list dates of birth shall not be fabricated78 4171 there is however narrow exception to the requirement for full names and complete dates of birth for individuals from nonvisa waiver program countries for international terrorist nominations if nonvisa waiver program country7 has issued travel document with only year of birth or verified governmentissued identification document with only year of birth then it is permissible to use only that year of birth the nominating agency however should whenever possible specify the type of document containing the year of birth and the passport number if the document is passport otherwise year of birth alone will not be accepted for nominations to the fly or selectee lists the nominating agency has continuing obligation to attempt to determine the complete date of birth 418 expedited waiver of full date of birth requirement for fly or selectee nominations when necessitated by exigent circumstances nominator may nominate an individual or individuals to the fly or selectee list with only partial date of birth but for whom there is additional identifying information this provision is intended to enable nominations based on current and credible intelligence information or particular threat 7 determinations made under this section apply to the fly selectee and expanded selectee list criteria 77 see paragraph 159 for complete discussion of expedited nomination procedures for temporary threatbased categories 78 the dates of birth of january 1 010ixxxx july i 0701xxxx november 111111xxxx and december 31 1231xxxx are

indicates the subjects may be used to conduct an act of domestic or international terrorism as defined in 18 usc 2331 1 or as federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 usc 2332bg5 the goal of this provision is to fashion watchlisting response that is appropriate to the nature specificity and severity of the threat to achieve this goal in addition to the credibility of the threat intelligence due consideration should be given to 4181 the harm to public safety posed by the threat 4182 the clarity and specificity of the information giving rise to the threat as to time place method and identity of the suspcctcd perpetrators 4183 the anticipated impact on international and domestic travel civil liberties and foreign relations and 4184 the best available screening tools other than the fly or selectee lists given the type and specificity of identifiers and travel data 419 this waiver should be utilized in limited circumstances when extreme derogatory information has been identified demonstrating the threat the waiver should be valid as long as the threat remains x nominations that are ineligiblenot suitable for either the fly or the selectee list80 420 nominations based on

with watchlisted subject as described below all information gathered during an encounter with known or suspected terrorist82 is referred to as an encounter package this guidance does not crcate any new authorities for the collection of any information during encounters with known or suspected terrorists rather it identifies the types of information that department or agency should consider collecting during an encounter with known or suspected terrorist if it possesses the authority to collect such information and should share with the interagency community consistent with their legal authorities and executive policy81 52 definitions 521 encounter an encounter is defined as an event in which an individual is identified during screening process to be positive match potential match or inconclusive match to an individual who has been designated in the tsdb as known or suspected terrorist an encounter can be facetoface meeting with known or suspected terrorist electronic or paperbased encounter eg the known or suspected terrorist has submitted an application for benefit liked visa electronic system for travel authorization application or information is provided to the

terrorists to include providing relevant encounter information84 ntc p and ntcc also provide copy of the examination results to the tsou for dissemination to the appropriate investigating agencies 542 transportation security administration tsa generally encounters known or suspected terrorists through screening commercial aircraft passengers against subsets of the tsdb and during the application process for credential or benefit in the transportation or critical infrastructure environment eg transportation worker identification credential twic when an airline encounters subjects who arc possible matches to the fly or selectee list the air carriers arc required to supply the passengers name and one piece of identifying data in the form of governmentissued photo identification that contains date of birth to the tsas office of intelligence and analysis oia tsa oia submits that information along with information regarding the carrier flight number time of departure and destination to the tsc 5421 absent an arrest warrant or unless probable cause arises during the encounter screeners are reminded that placement on the fly or selectee list is not legal basis to detain known or suspected terrorist to the extent legal authority exists to question known or suspected terrorist encounters with fly subjects at the airport may provide an additional opportunity to lawfully obtain encounter package information for fly subjects who have made domestic reservation dhs will notify tsc in advance as well as when the fly subject presents at the airport ticket countcr tsc will then notify the tsou who will notify both the fbi case agent and the airport liaison agent to coordinate the appropriate operational response 5422 for known or suspected terrorist encounters as result of

means quick review of the encounter package to identify obvious new terrorist identifiers about the known or suspected terrorist 5162 advanced analysis means thorough review of the terrorism information contained in an encounter package obtained as result of the encounter with the known or suspected terrorist advanced analysis includes the adding of terrorist identifiers to existing known

occurs after tsc has confirmed there is positive match to known or suspected terrorist for each positive match to known or suspected terrorist the tscs office of intelligence tscol will generate an iir for dissemination to the counterterrorism community that provides summary about the known or suspected terrorist encounter eg basic facts about the encounter such as date time and place if available at the time the initial iir is prepared tscoi will conduct an initial review of the encounter package and provide thumbnail summary of the terrorism information for example summary might highlight the existence of new known or suspected terrorist known or suspected terrorist was traveling with three other associates not previously identified in the car where the explosives were found in hidden compartment or the possibility that new terrorist identifiers are available approximately 80 pages carried by the known or suspected terrorist were converted to electronic documents ranging

nonterrorlsm information they are authorized to receive and retain c deroga tory information is intelligence or information that demonstrates the nature of an individuals or groups association with

who has been designated in the tsdb as known or suspected terrorist an encounter can be facetoface meeting with known or suspected terrorist electronic or paperbased encounter eg the known or suspected terrorist has submitted an application for benefit liked visa etsa grant or information is provided to the united states by foreign government aircraft operator or other private entity encountering agency is department or agency of the us government with terrorist screening or law enforcement responsibilities that comes into contact with known or suspected terrorist whether in

foreign fighters are nationals of one country who travel or attempt to travel to another country to participate in terrorism andor terroris t activities i fragmentary information is information that suggests an individual may have nexus to terrorism andor terrorist activities but the information available to the nominator does not meet either or both the minimum identifying criteria that will facilitate identification of these individuals or the substantive derogatory information to meet the reasonable suspicion standard but does qualify as information that should be provided to nctc pursuant to hspd6 unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information unclassif1edfor official use onlysensitive security information j inconclusive match is the final determination by tsc that limited information in the subject data set matches tsdb data in tsdb record and additional identifiers are available to verify the match k initial review is quick primary review of the encounter package to identify obvious new terrorist identifiers about the known or suspected terrorist l known terrorist is an individual whom the us government knows is engaged has been engaged or who intends to engage in terrorism andor terrorist activity including an individual who has been chargcd arrested indictcd or convicted for crime related to terrorism by us government or foreign government authorities or b identified as terrorist or member of designated foreign terrorist organization pursuant to statute executive order or international legal obligation pursuant to united nations security council resolution m lone wolf an individual motivated by one or more extremists ideologies who operates alone and supports or engages in acts of violence in furtherance of that ideology or ideologies that may involve direction assistance or influence from larger terrorist organization of foreign actor n nominator or nominating department or agency is federal department or agency that has information to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for known or suspected terrorist and nominates that individual to tide and the tsdb based on information that originated with that department or agcncy andor third department or agency operationally capable as described in chapter 4 an individual is operationally capable if based on credible intelligence he or she acting individually or in concert with others reasonably appears to have the ability knowledge opportunity and intent or is actively seeking the opportunity to engage in violent act of terrorism consistent with 18 usc 2331 or 18 usc 2332b for example attempting to obtain an ied would indicate an individual is opera tionally capable of committing an act of terrorism however simply conducting internet research concerning leds would not be sufficient without additional activity depending on circumstances and in combination with other facts scouting potential targets or traveling for legitimate purpose to places that have terrorist training grounds regardless of whether the person is presently capable of using an ied might also indicate an individual is operationally capable of committing an act of terrorism p originator is the department or agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority and collects terrorism information ie raw information and disseminates it or terrorist identifiers to other us government entities in an intelligence report ie finished intelligence or other mechanism q particularized derogatory information is the type of information relied on to determine whether reasonable suspicion is met this is information that demonstrates the nature of an individuals or groups association with terrorism andor terrorist activities unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security information unclassif1edfor official use onlysensitive security information that is descriptive and specific to an event or activity and is more than label for example subject x provides false travel documentation for alqaida operatives is particularized derogatory information whereas subject is supporter standing alone is not considered particularized derogatory information r positive match occurs when the tsc determines that information about subject encountered by screener exactly or reasonably matches record in the tsdb s potential match occurs when an encountering agency believes it has match with known or suspected terrorist record in the tsdb an encountering agency may attempt to resolve potential matches first through its review process if an encountering agencys review process cannot resolve the individuals status as not match to tsdb record the encountering agency will refer the potential match to tsc for final adjudication t purely domestic terrorism information is defined in the tsc mov as information about us persons that has been determined to be purely domestic terrorism informa tion with link to foreign intelligence counterintelligence or international terrorism u reasonable suspicion is the standard that must be met in order to include an individual in the tsdb absent an exception provided for in the watchlisting guidance to meet the reasonable suspicion standard the nominator based on the totality of the circumstances must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrants determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting in preparation for in aid of or related to terrorism andor terrorist activities there must be an objective factual basis for the nominator to believe that the individual is known or suspected terrorist mere guesses or hunches are not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion that an individual is known or suspected terroris t reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the reasonable suspicion standard set forth herein is not sufficient basis to watchlist an individual the facts however given fair consideration should sensibly lead to the conclusion that an individual is or has engaged in terrorism andor terrorist activities v screener department or agency that is authorized to conduct terrorism screening to determine if an individual is possible match to known or suspected terrorist in the tsdb screeners can include federal departments or agencies state local tribal territorial or foreign governments and certain private entities the term screener is used throughout this document as general reference to government official who compares an individuals information with information in the tsdb to determine if an individual is in the tsdb law enforcement officials who engage in such activities may normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than screening for ease of reference government officials who compare an individuals information with information in the tsdb will be referred to in the watchlisting guidance as screener w suspected terrorist is an individual who is reasonably suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct constituting in preparation for in aid of or related to terrorism andor terrorist activities based on an articulable and reasonable suspicion unclassifiedfor official use onlysensitive security

in identifying terrorist trends and changes to methods tactics and practices encounters for targeted analysis are selected using contemporaneous threat criteria and research in additional repositories contemporaneous threat criteria include association with priority terrorist group eg nipf tier i or ii encounters with known or suspected terrorists designated as fly or associated with violent activity or at the request of any department or agency that identifies need terrorism andor terrorist activities is combination of definitions because none of the federal law definitions of terrorism or terrorist activities were directly applicable to the consolidated approach to watchlisting for terrorist watchlisting purposes under this watchlisting guidance terrorism andor terrorist activities combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life property or infrastructure that may be violation of us law or may have been

entities when appropriate because the failure to coordinate operational activities to preempt prevent and disrupt terrorist threats can create confusion inefficiency and in extreme cases dangerous situations resulting horn conflicting operational activities the parties agree to coordinate operational activities to the greatest possible extent specifically each party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure coordination and deconfliction of homeland securityrelated law enforcement intelligence or national sccurityrelated activities of covered entities under that partys authority with such
