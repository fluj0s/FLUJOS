6612c13 shspec84 scientology definitions part iii scientology is an extension of the work of gautama siddhartha 2500 years ago gautama sought to end the cycle of death and rebirth by showing an individual that he was spirit not dependent on bodies we accomplished his goal of exteriorizing people more successfully in 1952 but the wisdom of buddhism was enough to civilize threefourths of asia it is the oldest and biggest religion on this planet it predates christianity by 500 years probably the shreds of buddhism came into the middle east with the silk and spice merchants who following alexanders ventures to india in about 333 bc discovered that there was europe and made trade contact with europe this sparked religious revival buddha predicted that in 2500 years the entire job would be finished in the west thats in the pali canons well we finished it buddha never pretended to be other than just man and his movement the first international religious movement was open to anyone buddhism has moved in its technology not one inch further than it was pushed in tibet until 1952 when we started exteriorizing people the essence of religion is the fact that man is spiritual being all religions hold this in common but only in buddhism was this ever proven any forward push like buddhism runs into sps who are afraid that if you got better you might knock them off or at least stop their games the basic goal of psychiatry today is to wipe out religion they say anyone who is religious is psychotic if they succeed in knocking out our church they will go after bigger ones this is really all that its all about as long as religion brings solace to man as long as churches stand in any way for the spiritual freedom of man psychiatry will not really be able to progress therefore psychiatry should not be allowed to wipe out small church and then go on to bigger church and bigger church and so take it all over the government has right to comment upon religious beliefs or practice they are telling us that we must not do something we are not doing we are not treating the sick and the insane there is law against increasing peoples ability or intelligence and that is all that we are doing psychiatry is demanding its right to kill or maim any human being after it states that hes crazy if they can do that they can control the planet politically but they will fail because they cant complete cycle of action or choose right target there is law against making people better or more intelligent also when someone tries to cut pure theta line it tends to blow up against him our victory was the victory of the individual over fate and the universe if we win everybody wins crushing the opposition on the way up is hardly worth doing inversion it should go one way and it goes the other way it inverts it collapses in on itself downward when person is introverted he would look in on himself its reverse scale as one factor progresses the other factor degresses it goes backwards exteriorization an action which i have just described as the history of buddhism thetan walks out of or exists out of body exteriorization is the action of moving out of body psychiatrists boobytrap this by claiming that insane people can exteriorize in fact if they do exteriorize they are sane while they are exterior see p above interiorization people who are interiorized interiorization is not the reverse of this it means going into it too fixedly and becoming part of it not just going into your head you could interiorize into work or into most anything exteriorization means the spirit moving out of the body restimulation the reactivation of an existing incident some approximation of the original incident causes it to go into play there is point where it was restimulated the restimulation is usually unknown to the person if it were known he would immediately recover unknown it tends to have an effect upon the person by picking up restimulations you can knock out of action sn engram without running it it is as though the engram sat over in locker undisturbed and not troubling the person then one day he passes truck and the engram drops out of locker and the person doesnt know what it is so he becomes the effect of it if you picked up the moment of its restimulation it would drop back into locker and cease to trouble the person it is upon this fact that the whole subject of releasing depends the erasure that occurs is the erasure of these points of restimulation destimulation destimulate means to take away the restimulation it does not mean the erasure of the original incident it is the knocking out of the point of restimulation genetic entity cytology the study of cells conceives of an endless stream of protoplasm passing through time with branch tracks that are bodies your current body is supposed to have originated from sea of ammonia by the process of reproduction it is supposed to have dome down to pt if that were the case then somewhere along the line blueprint for body would have had to enter the line in the days of dianetics good way to account for past lives was to say that they were incidents on the ge line cf history of man the darwinian theory is an explanation of this unending stream of protoplasm we find that this theory doesnt actually hold good man is spiritual being you should be able to find the blueprint in the body we used to think that it showed up on the emeter actually it doesnt only you do first overt this would be the first on chain of overts if guy has an impulse to commit given overt you could trace back down the chain to the first one and theoretically he would blow the impulse cf expanded dianetics but you should not try to process specific type of aberration its quite fatal because in the first place its an eval for the case also it is condemnatory negativetype process it doesnt validate the person at all you dont validate the person by finding his nasty habits and trying to process them the percentiles of successes when specific aberrations are addressed is too low this procedure is not successful because you are not validating whats right with the person you dont have to find out whats wrong with person to make him right you just get the guy to be able to communicate then you get him to look at his problems and you find out that he has been resolving them by committing overts you get him over doing this then you find that he is very arc broken with life and you get him over that then he gets to where he discovers that he has great solution to everything and every time he has bad break he goes and lies down and is horse or something but we are not interested in his solutions and were not treating him for that reason all of these things are simply increasing the abilities of spirit not healing whats wrong with it entrance point to this universe classified information many times on the time track one has been told that he just entered this universe it is big swindle ot activities those programs conducted by ots to assist scientology anchor points gold balls body is constructed in space framework you can see these things at least some people can when person has dark hollows under his eyes it is all the little gold balls grouped together under the eyes that have caved in and gone black if you could shift the gold ball framework of the body you could probably bend joints backwards etc every once in awhile somebodys face is out of shape or something and you get him to pick up the gold ball and put it back where it belongs or something or you get him to put bunch of balls out there to remedy his havingness of that particular ball this is anchor point processing from way back when all of sudden instead of lying against his face the gold ball goes back where it belongs and the pc reasserts his sense of balance his face will actually change shape this has to do with the structure of bodies and what the space is in which the body is formed it is apparently one of the ways in which bodies are mocked up i wouldnt look for them if i were you its rather fraught with disaster in some cases gold balls are used in mocking up the body in space first and second postulate if you find the first postulate that was made relating to certain situation you can ignore the second postulate about 1952 lrh tried to make an endall of this he looked for the first postulate that one ever made on the track see pp 1415 above on the first and second postulates we now find that its not necessary to have that energy potential of motion or power the modern physics definition is that energy is small waves flowing it is force or flow or potential force or flow from something to something or ability to accomplish work or to accomplish movement rather doubtful idea that we are taught to believe is that if something moves from point to point b 1 you need energy 2 you develop energy if you really know about the system of energy you wont need huge amounts of energy to move particles if person really understands something he can do remarkable things with it modern physics hasnt done that well with rocketry it is not very efficient so energy is potential or actual motion or force flow progress of particles impulses or waves from point to point b or in any direction there is direction to it which rather outlaws the idea of dispersal dispersal is not flow flow has the connotation of being somewhat directional if something flowing off mountain is getting wider and wider it can cease to be flow and become flood energy is flow of particles waves etc in some direction flow is limited and directional progress of particles through space thought not to be confused with life and the spirit thought is spaceless positionless product of thetan containing meaning the greeks confused it with life the original mistake is in the word theta for the greeks theta meant life or thought thought is not life and it is not spirit lambda life in the dianetic axioms dianetic axiom 11 it is an unused symbol today nothing this implies that the thing is but is being noted you couldnt notis something that wasnt in the first place its an assertion against fact counteremotion the emotion which greets the emotion it is point exerting an emotion against point b emotion is normally something that has flow wavelength and meaning mixed up with it any emotion could counter any emotion so counteremotion means any emotion that is countering an existing emotion when you take apart the emotion in bank you can pick out the emotion and counteremotion counteremotion is the emotion that is used to meet situation and which does meet it counteremotion is an interesting study it is related to politics and control of humans for instance the counteremotion to hitlers rage in germany was enthusiasm the advertising field is also very interested in counteremotion the advertising exec comes up against it because he tries to counter want with an emotion but want isnt an emotion so there is counteremotion so you have to know what emotion could create desire for the product and counter that memory and recall there is difference between these two terms thats significant to the auditor recall however implies that you bring it up to present and look at it it has that connotation whereas memory has the connotation that you simply knew it had happened so the two terms have two different connotations but they are very easily interchanged because person doesnt have to bring things up to pt when he is clear he doesnt do this any longer there are lot of things that he doesnt bring up to pt to recall them he can recall them in detail and tell you exactly where they are without having them brought up into the present to review to that extent the modern clear is far in advance of the book one definition of clear the reason one cant recall is totally contained in the fact that his memory is totally surrounded by mass which prevents him from recalling if you got rid of all the mass of the mind you wouldnt have anything to recall correct actually it doesnt work that way at all when you get the mass off recall is easy it is undue duress in the incident that prevents recall so the individual gets picture of the incident to read it because he cant enter the incident where it is the mental energy you used in bailing out of lions cage would prevent you from remembering that you had been in the lions cage therefore amnesia is the situation where person is protecting himself from so many dangers on the track that the mass prevents penetration because the part of the track for which he has amnesia is so heavily charged confidence an expression of trust degree of trust inflation is an expression of confidence in the government money is symbolized idea that goes bad when confidence in the issuer drops that is why they put pictures of kings and presidents etc on money they try to associate money and its issuer trust and distrust is composed of past experience total trust is looked on as total idiocy but it is the only condition under which you can exist we didnt arrive through suspicion certainty the degree of willingness to accept the awareness of an isness it is very conditional thing since in the first place it is questionable whether any mass has mass scientologist does not start out from where did the wall come from but just from is the wall there and if it is there the scientologist can have certainty on it it is possible to generate uncertainty by asking what is brainwashing is the trick of mixing up certainties to unconfuse someone it is only necessary to have him regain some certainties person arc breaks if his certainties get shifted an education can be made hypnotic by qualifying everything so that it becomes sort of generality and definitely an uncertainty generality any unspecific statement tends towards generality its the substitution of plural for singular or greater for lesser this may or may not be intentional dispersed people talk in generalities classifying anything comes under this heading for instance it is not really boys it is boy boy boy etc cf korzybskis general semantics classifying is necessary but it is very dangerous classifications occur in the bank they is always one person you will always find out exactly who they is on meter the generality is the primary tool of the sp it is used to prevent reach as in everything is all covered with germs johnny suppress to squash to sit on to make smaller to refuse to let reach to make uncertain about his reaching to render liquefy by heating or lessen in any way possible by any means possible to the harm of the person and the fancied protection of the suppressor the sp often expresses generalities to the suppressed person thus surrounding him with generalities the invention of germs was bit suppressive the suppressive uses tricks and mechanisms to prevent reach postulate to generate or think concept concept is think thought to postulate implies requirement that something goes stops turns white goes blue or remains blue or that it is something or that it isnt something or that some action is going to take place etc postulate implies conditions and actions rather than just plain thinks postulate is associated more with intention than it is with thought it has dynamic connotation havingness the feeling that one owns or possesses it is possible to wear coat without having coat mere possession does not make havingness confronting ability to front up to confronting is derived from withfronting so there is dim connotation that if you confront the door the door is confronting you coaction is implied but this does not actually exist in our meaning of the word confront is the ability of the individual to face up to look at stand up to stand in front of be near see visualize or otherwise perceive something by extension if you cant confront something you cant handle it thetans have been steamrolled by confronting total confronting is not the total answer there are times to stand up and glare and there are times not to when person can selectively confront or not confront anything then of course he has total power these do go together when thetan doesnt want to confront something he tends to mask it to turn away from it and it tends to make him an effect if he cant make an effect on it it can make an effect on him however in fact to stand in front of an automobile going 60 mph and to let it run over you just to demonstrate that you are not afraid of confronting it is assininity if you ask person whether he can confront an automobile going 60 mph and he comm lags you know that he is down into an obsessive confront and feels that there is some sense in your asking him to do it he has the idea that there is something wrong with him if he wont go and do this willful and knowing confronting or willingness to conceive the idea of or to confront or not to confront these concepts are all contained in the single idea of confronting if you felt that you had to be able to stand up to anything that would be to confess that you couldnt stop anything from occurring im willing to confront putting my arm out to an automobile traveling 60 mph and having it stop to that extent i am willing to confront this is not conditional confronting what are the conditions under which you would be willing to confront this is not fair question one wants to lead life of ruin though some have made it into virtue eg the stoics it is philosophical booby trap they persuade people that they should be willing to live life as dopeaddicts bums and in total ruin in order to demonstrate that they can confront this kind of life that is suppression it has precious little to do with sanity but it is terrific process in that the individual will come up to finding out what he is obsessively confronting as well as what he is willing to confront and what he doesnt have to confront one thing he might find out is that he doesnt have to go on confronting forever in fact he is quite tired of standing there so desire to have challenge concerning existence only relates to being willing to engage in larger game as the power to confront or not arises selectively an individuals selfdeterminism arises accordingly very often thetan who never likes to be moving explains the fact that he got run over by x by saying that he was perfectly willing to confront it he is happy that he got run over by x because now he has had such an experience he says well it was good experience but i never want to do it again when person can control things he can selectively confront when he loses that ability he says well at least i can confront it the thought that you cant do anything about anything is very humanoid and deadly there is suppression at work if person gets the idea that because he has the ability to confront anything he must therefore confront everything this is an invalidation of his ability to control and change undesirable aspects of the environment this is sp talk it is very different from being willing to confront anything it is only when you lose the ability to handle situation that you justify your inability by the thought that you can confront the disaster that thereby ensues weve run out of time i leave you confronting your sins thank you
