that is exempt from federal income taxes under the internal revenue code irc to become ex empt an organization must meet the ircs requirements and usually must file an application with the internal revenue service irs although the code describes more than 30 types of organizations that qualify for exemption the type of organization that people often mean when using the term taxexempt organization is described in irc 501c3 corporations organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable scientific testing for public safety literary or educational purposes or to foster national or international amateur sports competition but only if part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals other types of organizations that qualify for taxexempt status include social welfare organizations labor unions trade associations social clubs veterans organizations and fraternal organizations list of the types of taxexempt organizations appears at the end of this report

the term taxexempt organization is often used interchangeably with the term nonprofit organization this can be misleading taxexempt organization meets the criteria in federal law the irc to be exempt from federal income taxes whereas the status and privileges of nonprofit organization are determined under state law the term nonprofit organization generally means corporation that is not intended to be profitmaking corporation the requirements vary by state but usually take into account the fact that nonprofit corporations typically do not have shareholders or the same business motives as forprofit corporations nonprofit corporation is not automatically taxexempt organization because the qualifications for nonprofit status vary among states it is possible for the term nonprofit organization to be broader than narrower than or identical to the term taxexempt organization for nonprofit organization to be exempt from federal income taxes it must meet the statutory requirements found in the irc and usually must file an application with the irs

irs under which paragraph of irc 501c it qualifies in general this is not difficult to determine because most paragraphs describe discrete categories for example 501c5 describes agricultural organizations 501c8 describes fraternal societies and 501c14 describes credit unions however irc 501c3 and 501c4 describe organizations with some overlapping characteristics 1 specifically both irc 1 irc 501c3 reads corporations and any community chest fund or foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable scientific testing for public safety literary or educational purposes or to continued

organizations operate for charitable purposes and are restricted so that none of the organizations earnings may benefit private shareholder or individual despite these similarities irc 501c3 and 501c4 organizations differ in two significant ways first irc 501c3 organizations are eligible to receive taxdeductible charitable contributions while irc 501c4 organizations are not when contribution is deductible the donor may deduct the amount of the contribution from income subject to the restrictions in irc 170 see question 5 this is an important benefit for the organization because it encourages donors to contribute in order to lower their taxable income and to make larger contributions since the aftertax cost of each contribution is reduced the second difference is that irc 501c3 organizations are substantially limited in their ability to lobby and are prohibited from engaging in political campaigns irc 501c4 organizations are not so limited see questions 6 and 7 these two differences are important when an orga nization is choosing whether to apply for tax exempt status as an irc 501c3 or irc 501 c4 organization if the organizations agenda depends on influencing public opinion or the legislative process it may be appropriate to form as an irc 501c4 organization for other organizations it will usually make more sense to be an irc 501c3 organization in order to have the advantage of taxdeductible contributions finally although an organization must identify itsel f as one type of irc 501c organization it may be linked with another irc 501c organization under certain circumstances for example an irc 501c3 organization may be linked with an irc 501c4 social welfare organization or irc 501c6 trade association it is common to see group that wants to lobby as well as conduct charitable activities set up both an irc 501c4 organization and an irc 501c3 organization it is also not unusual for trade association such as the american bar association or the american medical association to have similarly named charitable foundation that conducts charitable activities in these situations the organizations must be legally separate entities and their activities and funds must be kept separate in addition an irc 501c organization may be linked with another type of taxexempt organization such as an irc 527 political organization see question 7 continued foster national or international amateur sports competition but only if part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipm ent or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation except as otherwise provided in subsection h and which does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office irc 501c4 reads civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare or local associations of employees the membership of which is limited to the employees of designated person or pe rsons in particular municipality and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to ch aritable educational or recreational purposes b subparagraph shall not apply to an entity unless part of the net earnings of such entity inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual the irs recognizes that an organization qualifying under 501c4 may also meet the criteria to qualify under 501c3 see treas reg 1501c41a2i

foundation public charities have broad public support and tend to provide charitable services directly to the intended beneficiaries private foundations often are tightly controlled receive significant portions of their funds from small number of donors or single source and make grants to other organizations rather than directly carry out charitable activities because these factors create the potential for selfdealing or abuse of position by the small group controlling the organization private foundations are more closely regulated than public charities private foundations are subject to penalty taxes for doing things such as failing to distribute certain amount of their income each year making investments that jeopardize their charitable purpose having excess business holdings and failing to maintain expenditure responsibility over certain grants 2 irc 501c3 organizations are presumed to be private foundations and must tell the irs how they qualify for public charity status based on the support and control tests found in irc 509

contribution to taxexempt organization may onl be deducted under two circumstances 1 it is donation that qualifies as charitable contribution under irc 170 or 2 it is dues that qualify as business expenses under irc 162 g5g145g138g155g146g157g138g139g149g142g561g5g152g151g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g156g561 under irc 170 contributions made for charitable purposes are tax deductible when made to qualifying irc 501c3 organizations governmental units veterans organizations fraternal organizations and cemetery companies the irs determines whether an irc 501c3 organization is eligible to receive taxdeductible contributions at the time it considers the organizations application for exempt status list of the organizations eligible to receive deductible contributions is found in irs publication 78 cumulative list of organizations described in section 170c of the internal revenue code of 1986 this publication is available on the irs website at httpwwwirsgov charitable contributions that otherwise meet the requirements of irc 170 are not deductible if the organization provides goods or services in exchange for the contribution if the contribution exceeds the fair market value of the goods or services provided then the excess may be deductible when an organization receives more than 75 in exchange for goods or services irc 6115 requires the organization inform the donor of the amount of the contribution if any that is taxdeductible even if contribution is deductible individual taxpayers may not be able to deduct the entire contribution for example only donors who itemize deductions may deduct their charitable contributions 3 and irc 170 may restrict the amount of the deduction depending on the size and 2 see irc 49404946 3 legislation was introduced in prior congresses that would have allowed taxpayers who do not itemize deductions to deduct portion of their charitable contributions for example provision was included in the care act of 2005 s

certain substantiation requirements including obtaining written acknowledgment from the organization for any contribution that exceeds 250 in value the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 imposes new requirement that any cash donation be substantiated by bank record or written communication from the organization showing its name and the date and amount of the contribution when charitable contribution to taxexempt organization is not deductible irc 6113 generally requires the organization notify the potential contributor of that fact at the time of solicitation thus for example irc 501c4 orga nizations must inform potential contributors that contributions may not be deducted under irc 6710 an organization that fails to provide the notification faces fine of 1000 for each day the failure occurs with an annual cap of 10000 the fines are higher and the cap is eliminated for organizations that intentionally disregard the notification requirement g6g158g142g156g561 dues to some taxexempt organizations such as irc 501c5 labor unions and irc 501c6 trade associations may be deductible as business expenses under irc 162 individuals face restrictions in being able to claim the deduction for example only donors who itemize deductions may deduct the dues and an individual must have significant business expenses ie exceeding 2 of adjusted gross income to be able to claim the deduction in addition if an organization conducts lobbying activities irc 162e disallows deduction for the portion of dues that represents lobbying expenditures irc 6033e generally requires that an organization notify its members of the amount that is nondeductible or be subject to proxy tax on its lobbying expenditures

taxexempt organizations are prohibited from lobbying others are restricted in the amount of lobbying they may do and the rest may conduct unlimited lobbying4 among the organizations prohibited from lobbying are those described in irc 501c2 c17 c18 c21 c22 c24 and c25 most of these are trusts that must use their income exclusively for the purposes for which they are established for irc 501c3

organizations exempt purpose and are not the organizations primary activities the activities may be subject to tax under irc 527f it is important to note that while the irc may allow these organizations to participate in such activities the organizations must still comply with applicable election laws for example election laws ban corporations and labor unions from making any contribution or expenditure in connection with federal elections 8 and these rules apply to taxexempt andor nonprofit corporations in addition taxexempt organizations are generally subject to the requirements in the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 pl 107155 relating to the disclosure of electioneering communications and the prohibition on incorporated entities and labor unions using general treasury funds to finance them 9 one way that corporations and labor unions participate in election campaigns without violating federal election laws is by setting up political action committees pacs pacs are creatures of federal election law but they are subject to the special tax rules for political organizations in irc 52710 other irc 501c organizations may so set up an irc 527

need to register with the appropriate secretary of state to reserve that organizations name and to enable the group to solicit charitable contributions 12 do business and own property in the state if the organization incorporates it will also usually have to file articles of incorporation that include the organizations pu rposes and names of incorporators some states do not have special nonprofit corporation status and the organization will be incorporated under regular corporation laws 8 2 usc 441b 9 electioneering communications are broadcast cable or sa tellite advertisements that refer to
