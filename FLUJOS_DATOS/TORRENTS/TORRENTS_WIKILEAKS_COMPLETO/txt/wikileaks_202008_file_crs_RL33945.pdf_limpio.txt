group of low and middleincome countries have become an increasingly sign ificant factor in us trade flows and trade policy over the last two or more decades their influence is reflected in the issues on the trade agenda of the 110th congress the possible renewal of fast track trade authoritytrade promotion authority implementing legislation for free trade agreements reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance taa for workers and firms review and possible re authorization of generalized system of preferences and other trade preference programs and overs ight of the doha development agenda dda round negotiations in the wto the growth of developing countries ec onomies and foreign trade presents the united states with opportunitie s and challenges the im ports from many developing economies provide us consumers with an ever widening range of choices of products at lower prices raising real incomes and contributing to higher us standard of living number of the deve loping countries have also become robust markets for us exports because of rapi d economic growth and trade liberalization at the same time many us workers ar competing with an expanding pool of lowerwage labor from india china nd other developing countries such competition induces usbased firms to reduce costs by using laborsaving technology moving production offshore or shutting down forcing workers to adjust even workers in the highend services sector are feeling the pressures of competition from some developing countries trade with developing countries also raises set of virtually unique issues regarding labor rights environment prot ection intellectual property rights among others that have become fixtures on the us trade agenda at the same time developing countries are challenging us policies on trade remedies high tariffs on wearing apparel and other im portsensitive products pricing of medicines and the temporary entry of foreign workers if current trade trends hold developi ng countries can be expected to account for increasing shares of us exports and imports and for world trade as result these opportunities and challenges w ill likely continue if not expand the analysis of us trade trends also exposes significant divide among groups of developing countries some countries such as chin south korea mexico and chile have made great stride s and are expanding their role in us and world trade others including most of africa many in south asia and some in latin america lag behind or are losing shares of us and wo rld trade these differences suggest that effective us trade policy may need to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries these differences could play ro in how the united states proceeds on trade preferences regional and bilateral

is both economic and political and is likely to increase developing countries have b een shaping us trade patterns trade policy priorities and policies they are reshaping the international trading system asserting greater influence at bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and challenging the united states and other devel oped countries to reappraise longheld policies at the same time developing countries advancement on the international trade stage has forced them to confront the challenges of international competition and the responsibilities that come with membership in the international trade community developed countries are demanding that developing countries jettison economic policies that protect domestic mark ets for local producers and workers the growing role of some developing c ountries in us and world trade raises sensitive policy issues for members of congress as they consider legislation to implement trade agreements to monitor administration enforcement of agreements and of trade laws and to velop policies many of the us free trade agreements ftas in place or that are under negotia tion are with developing countries furthermore the united states has been engaged with the other 149 members of the world trade organization wto in the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations the vast majority of the wto member s are developing countries who are using the strength of their large numbers to influence the agenda and the pace of the negotiations the dda negotiati ons are now indefinitely stalled because of among other reasons conflicts between developed and deve loping countries on agricultural trade congressional interests and the congressional legislative agenda are filled with issues pertaining to trade with developi ng countries the us generalized system of preferences gsp program and other trade preference programs are subject to periodic reviews and renewals some members of congre ss have suggested that the congress needs to reexamine the rationale for these programs and their eligibility criteria in light of the rapi d economic advancements that some developing countries have made in addition the congress has recently consider ed and passed legislation implementing ftas with deve loping countries and will probably consider number of others in the near future congre ssional debate and fi nal action over these measures will likely be influenced by the perception of the role that developing countries play in us trade the purpose of this report is to assist the congress in asse ssing and developing us foreign

countries includes economies representing many levels of economic development however they share one important quality they are generally technology receive rs rather than technology in novators and so their economies still have room to catch up with i ndustr ialized countries through the increased application of technologyba sed production some of the developing countries have been more successful in catching up than others leading to wide gaps in economic welfare among them fo r the purposes of this report developing countries include all countries except australia new zealand

11 of us imports level of shares that has not changed appreciably over the past two decades latin america has also increased in importance accounting for 140 of us exports in 1985 and 215 in 2006 and for 136 of us imports in 1985 increasing to 179 in 2006 however the shift is largely the result of mexicos surge as us trade partner in 1985 62 of us exports went to mexico share that rose to 129 in 2006 similarly the share of us imports coming from mexico increased from 55 in 1985 to 107 in 2006 among the regional groups the african c ountries particularly those of sub saharan africa have largely stagnated in importance as us trading partners in 1985 us exports to subsaharan africa accounted for 17 of total us exports in 1985 and for 12 in 2006 in 1985 us imports from the subsaharan african countries increased modestly as share of total us imports from 28 in 1985 to 32 in 2006 however 81 of us impor ts from subsaharan africa is oil mostly from nigeria and angola the united

they accounted for 11 of us exports and 08 of u s imports and in 2005 for 06 of us exports and 13 of us imports the mbers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are another important subcategory of developing countries their shares of us trade have remained fairly cons tant with shares of us imports reaching high of 79 in 2006 but largely dependent on world oil prices

that developing countries as group have been making inroads in world trade from 1985 to 2004 latest da ta available they increased their shares of world exports from 254 to 335 and their shares of world imports from 232 to 304 however the data also show th at not all groups of developing countries have experienced the same level of economic in tegration the east asian countries have been the leaders with the four east asian nies among the primary drivers of trade growth in the region their shares of world exports climbed from 58 to 97 but had been as high as at 103 in 2000 be fore declining and their shares of world imports increased as well from 53 to 90 although they had reached as high as 106 in 1995 similarly the ten asean member countries have experienced robust trade growth with their shares of world exports having risen from 37 to 61 and their shares of world imports having grown from 33 to 54 from 1985 to 2004 however chinas emergence on the world trade scene has overshadowed the others with the fastest pace of worl d trade growth in 1985 chinas share of world exports and imports stood at 14 and 21 respectively and 64 and 61 respectively in

exports and imports stood at 26 and 21 respec tively but at 16 and 14 in 2004 causes of the trends specialists and other observe rs have cited range of reasons for the disparity in the rates of developing countries participation in trade the most successful developing countries have dopted policies of economic integration with the rest of the world with an emphasis on exportled gr owth the east asian countries are the most vivid example the four east asia n nies are largely credited with launching these efforts in the 1970swhich resulted in their economies taking off in the 1980s and continuing to grow in the 1990s albeit with some bumps along the way other east asian countries have followed for example thailand and malaysia china is the most recent and largest example of an economy that has moved to become more integrated in the world economy such cas are not confined to east asia chile and mexico have emerged as successful exportoriented economies india has also recently undertaken economic reforms to become more integrated with the rest of the world among the less successful developing countries are ones that have followed import substitution economic development strategies of discouraging imports by imposing high tariffs and other trade ba rriers and trying to develop domestic production of all goods thes policies have proved to be highly costly and have inhibited economic growth6 analysts have also concluded that the most successful developing economies are those that have built successful manufact uring sectors while number of the less successful countries are highly dependent on the production of primary goods such as food agricultural products and natural resources th 50 ldcs are dependent on average on just three primary commodities for 70 of their total exports some ldcs are dependent on single commodity for their exports this is matter of concern because commodity markets tend to be very volatile in addition commodities account for decreasing shares of world trade making it more difficult for commoditydependent countries to gain foothold in world trade7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs8 8 for more analysis of the trade capacity building program see crs report rl33628 trade capacity building foreign assistance for trade and development danielle langtonfurthermore many of the least devel oped countries do not have the sufficient infrastructure customs offices and procedures transportation facilities communications infrastructure to conduct large amounts of trade the adjustment costs from trade liberalization might also be too great for smaller less diversified economies some veloped countries have responde d with tradecapacity building assistance as part of efforts to promote trade liberalization and economic growth in these countries8 us trade policy toward developing countries us trade policy toward developing countri is evolving for many years the policy largely consisted of trade prefer ence programs extended conditionally and unilaterally to various groups of developing countries wh ile those programs are still in place us trade policy is clearly shifting with successive presidential administrations the bush administration especially has negotiated bilateral and regional reciprocal trade agreements with decided emphasis on trade with developing countries observ ers have also pointed out that us trade policy toward developing countries is ambiguous on the one hand encouraging trade liberalization through trade preference programs and free trade agreements while on the other hand applying high import tariffs on products in which developing countries are more likely to have comparative dvantage laborintensive goods and semi finished goods that contai n raw materials us trade pref erence programs us trade preference programs have b een important vehicles for us trade policy toward developing countries thes programs also reflect the ambiguity of us policy the generalized system of preferences the broadest and oldest program is the generalized systems of preferences gsp the us gsp program was first enacted on january 1 1976 as part of an effort to encourage economic growth in developing countries by extendi ng preferences in the form of low or tariffs on the imports from certain developi ng countries the program was partially in response to developing countries criticism that hi gh tariffs on their products prevented their producers from competing on world markets originally considered temporary 10year program us gsp has been renewed on eight occasions most recently through december 31 2008 in section 8802 of pl 109432 while covering broad spectrum of products of developing countries the statutory authority for the gsp program requires count rybeneficiaries to adhere to number of criteria among them protection of specified labor rights and protection of intellectual property rights in addition the statute provides for the graduation of countries that exceed per capita income level and the gradua tion of products that exceed competitiveneed limits also certa in importsensitive goods are excludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs9 9 for more information on the us gsp program see crs report rl33663 generalized system of preferences background and renewal debate by vivian c jones 10 however if measured against dutiable impor ts that is imports that would not otherwise enter duty free under mostfavorednation mfn or normal trade relations ntr tariff rates gsp covered imports accounted for 159 of total imports from gspbeneficiary countries 11 crs calculations based on commerce partment data from usitc databasefrom coverage including so watches footwear gl ass products and electronic products9 some critics of the program have charged that the exclusions limit the programs effectiveness by disqualifying laborintensive products which make up the major part of the production profile of beneficiary countries as evidence they point out that only small portion of impor ts from beneficiary countries enters the united states under gsp in 2005 for example only 96 of us imports from gspeligible countries entered the united states under the gsp program10 see table 3 below another criticism of the us gsp pr ogram has been that only fe w countries have been able to take advantage of its benefits in 2005 839 of g spcovered imports were from only 10 countries11 it is also important to note that gsp has automatic competitive need limits cnl for beneficiary devel oping countries bdcs but not for leastdeveloped bdcs or level above which the prefer ence is longer extended absent cnl waiver while the other preference programs have such limits this is an important distinction between it and the other preferen ce programs and is perhaps one of the reasons that the percentage of total tr ade entering under gsp although the broadest program has remained relatively static and that the preference may be used less than the others table 3 us imports from gsp beneficiary countries 2005 millions of dollars 1 total imports 278029 2 mfn duty free 1093173 imports under

economic concerns and they largely worked through organizations16 for that matter the highly protectionist trade policies th at many developing countri were following would not have been congruent with gatt principles and rules fostering trade liberalization developing countries increased their activity most noticeably during the uruguay round 19861994 as they began to put their imprint on agreements that emerged from the round including the blishment of the wto this trend matched the economic restructuring th at many developing countries were undertaking to integrate their economies w ith the rest of the world and that is reflected in their growing shares of world and us trade the developing countries voi ce in the wto has never been stronger than in the doha development agenda

round in late 19 99 the wto trade min isters had gathered in seattle for the third wto ministerial and their main agenda item was to reach agreement on the launching of new round of wto nego tiations however the large group of developing countries themselves rather diverse and promoting different agendas had nevertheless united against the scope and content of proposed new round the seattle meeting collapsed and some experts assert the concerns of the developing countries not being addressed was an im portant factor in that failed meeting developing countries were pecially concerned that th mechanism for establishing the agenda for the round did not allow them sufficient opportunity to promote issues of interest to them17 the negotiations were eventually launched at the fourth ministerial in november 2001 in doha qatar as the doha development agenda italic s added round to reflect the intention of the wto members to focus on the concerns of developing countries the negotiations moved very slow ly at the fifth ministerial in cancun they came to standstill when the memb ers could not agree on how to proceed among the major participants was the g 20 group of developing countries led by brazil and india at cancun and since that meeting the g20 has emerged as major force on par with the united states and th eu in setting the agenda and pace of the negotiations18 one of the problems of wto pa rticipation for many developing countries is that it is costly to initiate and carry through with disputes in the wto issues in us trade with developing countries the emergence of developing countries as an important factor in us trade has generated range of policy issues that while not unique to developing countries arise more often in us trade with them the issues described below do not constitute an exhaustive list but nevertheless represent the most prevalent issues that have emerged in us bilateral and multilateral negotiations with developing countries some of the issues are developi ng country challenges to the united states that is changes to us laws and practices others are us challenges to developing countries the issues generally cut across us trade relations with most developing countries at all levels of economic development labor rights and wages perhaps issue has dominated debate on us trade policy over the past decade more than the role of trade liberalization in employment and wages the issue results from the increased role of us trade with lowerwage developing countries and the concern that us workers are forced to compete in race to the bottom as us companies are induced to close down or to reduce the wages of or lay off workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs15 19 see for example the federal reserve

fac ilities to lowerwage countries labor and trade as an issue has gained more attention recently as ec onomic studies have focused on the growing income gap in the united states that is even though the us economy continues to grow robustly more of the rewards from that growth are going to more highlypaid workers to higherincome households nd to multinational co rporations many economists attribute the growing gap to dvances in technology that improve labor productivity and increase demand for highs killed labor while diminishing demand for lowskilled labor they also attribute modest role to trade liberalization and globalization19 other economists attribute larger role to increased trade with low wage labor countries and the emergence of large pools of lowwage labor in china and india that cause compression of wage s in developed countries including the united states one study shows that over the past twenty years income inequality in the united states has been rising suggesting correlation with the rise in trade with developing countries in addition they point to more intraindustry trade between the united states and developing countries where us companies shift production to countries w ith lower wage labor20 trade policy responses and proposals in the united states have varied for example some observers argue that trade plays limited role if at all in employment and wages and therefore trade po licy response is required others have suggested that the government should provide safety net to workers who lose their jobs or experience decrease in wages because of trade this safety net might be in the form of an enhanced trade adjustment assistance taa program or wage insurance others have proposed that th united states needs to boost the level of education to better prepare us work ers to compete in the global economy some members of congress ve argued that lower wa ges persist in developing countries in part because of the lack of labor rights protecti on and have called for enforceable internationallyaccepted labor standards to be part of us trade agreements with the governments of devel oping countries developing countries on the other hand consider dema nds for labor rights provisi ons in trade agreements as form of protectionism they argue that their workers wages are lower because their economies have an abundance of unsk illed labor and that low wages reflect the lower level of economic development this issue will likely be part of the expected debate over the renewal of th trade promotion authorityf ast track procedures during the 110th congress and debate over implementing bills for ftas21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs16 22 special 301 refers to statutory require ment under section 182 of the trade act

infectious diseases hivaids tuberculosis malaria and others has been major issue in their trade relations with the united states and other developed countries they claim that the prices demanded by pharmaceutical companies are beyond the means of those in need the pharmaceutical companies respond that the high costs are required for the companies to recoup the research and development costs they have incurred some pharmaceutical companies have made their drugs available to developing countri that face health emergencies but have done so largely on an ad hoc basis in december 2005 wto members adopted as an amendment to the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement provision allowing the use of compulsory li censes for the production of generic pharmaceuticals for certain inf ectious diseases where the developing country lacks the domestic capacity to manufacture those medicines in essence it allows developing country facing health crisis to issue compulsory license for the production of generic drug in third c ountry that has the production capacity and then to import that medicine the provi sion allows for compensation for the patent holder

and nontariff barriers developing countries raise the issue of high us tariff and nontariff barriers on products in which they have compara tive advantage for example textiles and apparel and certain agricultu ral products they claim that these barriers limit their ability to export to the us market par ticularly developing countries cite high tariffs on textiles and appare l one study points out that 627 of the value of apparel imports from veloping countries f ace peak us tariffs tariffs of 10 or greater wearing apparel production is largely laborintensive and therefore advantageous for many deve loping countries with an abundance of lowwage labor to produce and export25 developing countries have ra ised this issue during bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements26 developing countries frequently complain about high us tariffs nontariff barriers and subsidies on some agricultural products us quotas and high outof quota tariffs on sugar have been an issu in us fta negotiations with sugar producing developing countries27 one study has estimated that tariffs quotas and subsidies provide us agricultural producer s with the protection equivalent to an average tariff of 199 the study also notes that the united states is by means the most protectionist in this categor as the tariff equivalents for other industrialized countries are much high er canada 523 eu ropean union 464 and japan 82128 at the same time the united states asse rts that developing countries maintain high tariffs and nontariff barriers on so agricultural produc ts and manufactured goods and barriers to trade in services ch as banking insurance and professional services the united states has pressed the developing countries to reduce these barriers that could offer expanded markets for us exporters but also improve the efficiency of developing economieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs18 29 for more information on the antidumping issue in the wto see crs report rl32810 wto antidumping issues in the doha development agenda by vivian c jones 30 trade act of 2002 section 2102b14us trade re medy practices many developing countries complain th at antidumping actions that the united states and other developed countries initiate against th eir products are protectionist and unduly affect them number of devel oping countries are pa rt of an informal group in the wto called friends of anti dumping in the doha development agenda round they have proposed that veloped countries extend special and differential treatment to veloping countries when initiating antidumping actions against their products such as raising the minimis threshold for ad action that is the level of dumping below which action is to be taken29 developing countries have also raised the issue with the united states as part of fta negotiations pressing for special treatment under the ftas south korea has been doing so congress has gone on record opposing any agreement that weakens antidumping laws or any other us trade remedy statut this position is contained in statute authorizing trade promotion authorityfast track as principal negotiating objective to preserve the ability of the united stat to enforce rigorously its trade laws including the antidumping countervailing duty and safeguard laws and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade 30 rather strong bipartisan consensus in congress supports this principle the bush administration allowed the possibility of changes in trade remedy laws to be put on the table in the doha developmen t agenda arguing that doing so was necessary in order to get developing c ountries to launch the negotiations many members of congress have criticized this step effectiveness of trad preference programs many developing countries argue that while trade preference programs such as gsp are wellmeaning on the surface in practice they do not provide much benefit because of exceptions made for import sensitive products these products tend to be ones in which developing countries have or could ve comparative advantage for example us law prohibits gsp coverage for certain textile and apparel watches importsensitive electronic pr oducts import sensitiv steel articles footwear leather apparel and impor tsensitive manufactur ed glass products developing countries also ar gue that benefits of tariff preference programs are eroding because the united states and othe r developed countries have been entering into free trade agreements that eliminate tariffs among fta partners in addition various rounds of multilatera l negotiations under the ga tt and wto have lowered tariffs for all members and thus have been eroding th effectiveness of trade preference programs for developing countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33945crs19 trends and policy implications developing countries have become an increasingly significant factor in us trade over the last two or more decades and this influence is reflected in the issues on the trade agenda of the 110th congress the possible re newal of trade promotion authority tpa or fast track trade authority implementing legislation for ftas reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance taa for workers and firms review and possible reauthorization of gsp and other trade pr eference programs oversight of the doha development agenda dda round negotiations in the wto and other issues the growth of developing countries fo reign trade presents the united states with opportunities and challenges the imports from many veloping economies provide us consumers with an ever wideni ng range of choices of products at lower prices raising real incomes and contributing to higher us standard of living number of the developing countries have also become robust markets for us exports at the same time us workers are co mpeting with growing pool of lower wage labor from india china and other developing countries some usbased firms are induced to use borsaving technology to move production offshore or to shut down their operations completely even workers in the services sector such as computer programmers are feeling the pressures of competition from some developing countries many economists ar gue however that in the long run that trade affects the composition of j obs but not employment levels trade with developing countries also raises set of virtually unique issues regarding labor rights environment prot ection and intellectual property rights among others that have become fixtures on the us trade agenda at the same time developing countries are challenging u s trade policies on trade remedies high tariffs on wearing apparel nd other importsensitive produc ts pricing of medicines and the temporary entry of foreig n workers among other issues if current trade trends hold developi ng countries can be expected to account for increasing shares of us exports and imports and of world trade as result these opportunities and challenges w ill likely continue if not expand the analysis of us trade trends also exposes significant divide among groups of developing countries so countries such as those in east asia mexico and chile have made great stride s and are expanding their role in us and world trade others including most of africa many c ountries in south asia and some in latin america lag behind or are losing shares of us and world trade these differences suggest that an effective us trade policy needs to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries these di fferences could play role in how the united states proceeds on trade preferences regional and bilateral trade agreements and multilateral negotiations in the wto
