brief overview of jordans government and economy and of its cooperation in promoting arabisraeli peace and other us policy objectives in the middle east this report will be updated periodically to reflect new developments several issues in usjordanian relations are likely to figure in decisions by congress and the administration on future aid to and cooperation with jordan these include the stability of the jordanian regime the role of jordan in the arabisraeli peace process jordans role in stabilizing iraq and usjordanian military and intelligence cooperation although the united states and jordan have never been linked by formal treaty they have cooperated on number of regional and international issues over the years the countrys small size and lack of major economic resources have made it dependent on aid from western and friendly arab sources us support in particular has helped jordan deal with serious vulnerabilities both internal and external jordans geographic position wedged between israel syria iraq and saudi arabia has made it vulnerable to the strategic designs of its more powerful neighbors but has also given jordan an important role as buffer between these potential adversaries in 1990 jordans unwillingness to join the allied coalition against iraq disrupted its relations with the united states and the persian gulf states however relations improved throughout the 1990s as jordan played an increasing role in the arabisraeli peace process and distanced itself from saddam husseins iraq in the last decade annual us assistance to jordan has more than quadrupled from total of 223 million in fy1998 to an estimated 912 million in fy2008 since fy2003 jordans total assistance package has averaged over 700 million per fiscal year this higher figure is due in part to large allocations for jordan in subsequent supplemental appropriations acts total of 178 billion since fy2003 in addition to the preceding funds specifically earmarked for jordan emergency supplemental bills also have contained funds to reimburse pakistan jordan and other key cooperation states for logistical expenses in support of us military operations increased us aid has reflected the bush administrations appreciation for jordans role in combating terrorism and rebuilding iraq it also may be an acknowledgment of jordans vulnerabilities in region made more volatile by instability in iraq and conflict between israelis and palestinians the administrations fy2009 request to congress is 5354 million for us aid to jordan this includes 2635 in economic aid and 235

world war i initially consisted of desert or semidesert territory east of the jordan river inhabited largely by people of bedouin tribal background the establishment of the state of israel brought large numbers of palestinian refugees to jordan which subsequently annexed small palestinian enclave west of the jordan river the original east bank jordanians though probably longer majority in jordan remain predominant in the countrys political and military establishments and form the bedrock of support for the jordanian monarchy jordanians of palestinian origin comprise an estimated 55 to 70 of the population and generally tend to gravitate toward the private sector the hashemite royal jordan in brief family population 6198677 est 2008 area 89213 sq km 34445 sq jordan is hereditary

to the throne king abdullah ii age 46 has won approval for his energetic and handson style of governing however some jordanians notably palestinians and islamic fundamentalists are opposed to his policies of cooperating with the united states on issues such as iraq and the arab israeli peace process according to one former jordanian cabinet official he king abdullah talks about information technology and foreign investment but he doesnt really know his own people1 1 jordans king risks shahs fate critics warn angeles times october 1 2006 crs3 the king appoints prime minister to head the government and the council of ministers cabinet typically jordanian governments last about 15 years before they are dissolved by royal decree this is done in order to bolster the kings reform credentials and to dispense patronage to various elites the king also appoints all judges and is commander of the armed forces parliament constitution and elections jordans bicameral legislature is composed of an elected 110member lower house and an appointed 55member upper house2 building on his fathers legacy king abdullah ii has supported limited parliamentary democracy while periodically curtailing dissent when it threatened economic reforms or normalization of relations with israel overall parliament has limited power in theory it can override the veto authority of the king with twothirds majority in both the upper and lower houses twothirds majority of the lower house can also dissolve the cabinet with confidence vote however since both houses almost always have solid progovernment majorities such actions are rarely attempted once in april 1963 the constitution enables the king to dissolve parliament and postpone lower house elections for two years3 the king also can also circumvent parliament through constitutional mechanism that allows provisional legislation to be issued by the cabinet when parliament is not sitting or has been dissolved the king also can issue royal decrees which are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny overall political parties in jordan are extremely weak as the moderately fundamentalist islamic action front iaf is the only well organized movement most parties represent narrow parochial interests and are composed of prominent individuals representing particular family or tribe there are approximately 36 small parties in jordan consisting of an estimated 4100 total members4 the 1993 election law the opposition in jordan routinely criticizes the law governing national elections after islamists made gains in the 1989 parliamentary elections the government changed5 the rules to one man one vote system that gives citizens one vote regardless of how many parliamentary seats represent their district6 when forced to choose just one representative voters have 2 during the late 1970s and early 1980s the parliament was suspended and legislative powers reverted to the government 3 the king also is allowed to declare martial law and suspend the provisions of the constitution see united nations development program undp programme on governance in the arab region pogar historical background of jordans constitution available online at httpwwwundppogarorgcountriesconstitutionaspcid7 4 crs interview with jordanian lawmakers may 2006 5 the 1993 law was adopted during period when parliament was suspended it has never received the formal approval of parliament raising questions over its constitutional legitimacy 6 under jordans system electoral districts return several members to parliament but voter may vote for only one candidate seats are then awarded to as many of the highestpolling continued crs4 typically chosen candidates based on familial or tribal ties not on ideology reformers would like to see mixed election system that provides for some proportional representation and allows parties to field lists of candidates in addition many reformers have called for changes to jordans electoral map asserting that the government gerrymandered voting districts to favor candidates from rural tribal strongholds over urban areas where islamists typically have more support7 2007 parliamentary elections on november 20 2007 approximately 989 candidates vied for 110 seats in the chamber of deputies parliaments lower house progovernment candidates won an overwhelming majority while the iaf secured just 6 seats it only fielded 22 candidates down from 17 in the 2003 election the official turnout rate was 548 though the opposition believes that voter registration rolls were manipulated ballots were stuffed and vote buying was rampant according to one anonymous voter i gave my vote in exchange for jd10 14 est i voted and all my sisters did and we went back home with jd40 56 in total9 jordanian authorities did arrest several individuals accused of vote buying the authorities prohibited nongovernmental organizations from monitoring the election in the months prior to the election the iaf had announced that despite any significant changes to the electoral law it would participate in the november election when asked why the iaf has decided to participate after boycotting the july municipal elections10 one spokesman remarked that the party that boycotts loses an important forum the islamists want to have the important forum which parliament provides reportedly the iaf decided to participate after the prime minister pledged to hold clean election in exchange for the islamists limiting the number of candidates they would field other reports suggest that some prominent iaf members wanted to boycott the election but were overruled by progovernment moderates approximately 199 female candidates ran in november seven won under quota system six seats are reserved for women nine for christians and three for the 6 continued individual candidates as there are seats allocated to that district 7 according to one study of jordans election law it is coincidence that under represented urban governorates have large population of palestinian origin and that over represented largely rural governorates are considered mainstays of support for the regime see david m debartolo jordan attention turns to electoral law arab reform bulletin published by the carnegie endowment for international peace volume 5 issue 3 april 2007 in amman each legislator represents about 95000 people in certain rural provinces legislator represents as few as 2000 individuals 8 51 minimum turnout is required for legal parliamentary election in jordan 9 disproportionate democracy ahram weekly 2228 november 2007 issue 872 10 the july municipal elections marked the first time that voters elected all municipal council members half of whom were previously selected by the king with the exception of the capital amman where all were elected and support for the iaf is particularly strong the iaf seemed poised to participate in the election only to withdraw hours before the polls opened crs5 circassian and chechen minorities11 only one woman dentist named falak aljamaani won outside the sixseat quota system aljamaani is an incumbent lawmaker who won quota seat in the 2003 polls tujan faisal jordans first female member of parliament served from 1993 to 1997 had her candidacy rejected by the government due to 2002 military court conviction in which the government accused her of slandering jordans image and accusing officials of corruption although king abdullah ii pardoned faisal vocal critic of the royal family her previous conviction was used to justify the rejection of her candidacy faisal responded by saying they do not want lawmakers who enjoy popularity and fight corruption in jordan they want progovernment legislators the authorities are ready to do anything to prevent from running in the elections12 the jordanian muslim brotherhood the jordanian muslim brotherhood has long been integrated into the political mainstream due to its acceptance of the legitimacy of hashemite monarchy although relations between the brotherhood and the palace have fluctuated over the years the brotherhood presence in jordan dates back to the 1930s as it has been tacitly recognized first as charitable organization and later as quasipolitical organization which has openly fielded candidates in parliamentary elections albeit under different name islamic action front iaf the relationship between the brotherhood and the palace has been mutually beneficial over the years successive jordanian monarchs have found that the brotherhood has been more useful politically as an ally than as an opponent as opposed to the brotherhood in egypt as it secured islamist support in countering arab nationalist interference during the 1950s and 1960s and secular palestinian nationalism in the 1970s the brotherhoods educational social and health services have grown so extensive over the years that some experts believe that the brotherhoods budget for services rivals that of the jordanian government like other islamist parties in the region the islamic action front the muslim brotherhoods political wing operates in tight political space wedged between government which seeks to limit its influence and disillusioned constituency impatient for reform in jordans poorer neighborhoods the brotherhood uses its social services to attract support though it must compete with the growing allure of militant islam emanating both from within jordan and from neighboring iraq the iaf markets itself as beyond the culture of corruption found in jordanian politics and while this message may resonate with the average supporter it is unclear what the partys platform is aside from its slogan of islam is the solution government crackdown in 2006 and 2007 the jordanian government took additional steps to curb the brotherhoods influence in domestic politics violence in neighboring iraq the 2005 amman hotel bombings which killed 58 people and the hamas 2007 takeover of the gaza strip all made the jordanian authorities more cautious of the brotherhoods political and charitable activities in june 2006 just 11 in the 2003 election not single female candidate won outside of the quota system 12 jordans first woman mp barred from seeking reelection agence france presse october 23 2007 crs6 days after the death of the terrorist mastermind abu musab alzarqawi four iaf parliamentarians were arrested after making statements praising the late qaeda in iraq leader one iaf deputy reportedly remarked that zarqawi was martyr and holy warrior the government charged13 that such remarks were in violation of article 150 of jordans penal code which bans all writing or speech that is intended to or results in stirring up sectarian or racial tension or strife among different elements of the nation14 several weeks later the jordanian government dissolved the administration of the islamic centre charity society the brotherhoods main vehicle for dispensing social welfare to its supporters some estimate that the charity controls over 1 billion in assets the jordanian ministry of social development mosd appointed sevenmember ad hoc board to run the charity with the government seeking to limit its activities and having performed poorly in the 2007 parliamentary elections the brotherhood reorganized in 2008 and internally elected dr hamam said alt sp himman saidhammam said hamam saidhammam saaed as the movements new general guide press reports have described the new leader as hawk stressing his palestinian origins and possible ties to hamas it is unclear whether the internal electoral victory of dr said law professor and former member of parliament represents change in direction for the brotherhood away from limited cooperation with the monarchy and toward closer ties to hamas as some analysts suggest15 the brotherhoods shura council elected more moderate figure abd allatif arabiyat to serve as its head some experts assert that having more confrontational figure such as dr said as the public face of the brotherhood actually bolsters the international image of the monarchy as moderating force still other observers assert that islamists and the monarchy have actually moved closer together since saids election as the iaf may have facilitated recent jordanhamas dailogue the military and security establishment many tribal east bank jordanians or their descendants form the backbone of jordans armed forces and internal security establishment most observers agree that with the possible exception of syria jordan faces few conventional threats from its neighbors and that the greatest threats to its security are internal and asymmetrical in general counterterrorism and homeland security policies are carried out by 13 after the four brotherhood parliamentarians were arrested one was released and the remaining three stood trial before state security court during the trial several journalists testified that two of the three parliamentarians called zarqawi martyr at the sentencing one member was acquitted for lack of evidence and the two others received sentences of two years and one and onehalf years respectively though their sentences were reduced to 13 months shortly thereafter the case did not draw great deal of international attention according to sarah leah whitson director of the middle east and north africa division at human rights watch expressing condolences to the family of dead man however murderous he might be is not crime and it shouldnt be grounds for prosecution 14 jordan rise in arrests restricting free speech human rights watch june 17 2006 15 yaron eisenberg and malcolm james hardliners assume leadership of jordans muslim brotherhood terrorism focus volume 6 issue 22 published by the jamestown foundation june 10 2008 crs7 number of institutions most notably the security services under direct palace control the military and the interior ministry the general intelligence directorate gid reports directly to king abdullah ii and is responsible for both covert operations abroad and internal security the militarys elite special forces units also are directly involved in countering threats to internal security and were reportedly used to thwart chemical weapons plot in april 2004 the interior ministry controls all civilian police forces and civil defense units through branch agency known as the public security directorate psd reform the reform process in jordan largely comes from the top down as king abdullah ii has worked hard at cultivating progressive image for both himself and the government nevertheless the pace of reforms particularly democratic reform remains slow by western standards for every step forward on issues such as womens rights economic liberalization and education there are steps backward on press freedoms and institutional reforms16 jordanian officials have been adamant in insisting that they be allowed to institute social changes at their own pace asserting that society has changed dramatically over the past century from desert tribal society into modern nation state the jordanian government believes that some portions of its population are suspicious of us intentions in the region and that local leaders would consider some us democratic reform proposals to be antithetical to jordans conservative islamic and tribal social culture overall analysts have widely documented culture of political apathy in jordan where citizens are angry over corruption unemployment and rising inflation but are largely complacent when it comes to taking political action according to one observer most jordanians accept this system or at least do not actively resist or challenge it the vital democratic principle of the consent of the governed has been adjusted to the acquiescence of the governed who do not take political governance too seriously because they appreciate what the system offers them in comparison with many other arab countries the system shuns severe abuses of citizen rights and human dignity mass graves have ever been found in jordan nobody disappears forever in the middle of the night unable to shape policy citizens instead value stability the opportunity to raise their children in safety travel freely work in any field they wish educate themselves profusely and be afforded chance to improve their position in life17 16 according to the us state departments 2007 country reports on human rights practices jordan while the government respected human rights in some areas its overall record continued to reflect problems the government restricted citizens right to change their government domestic and international ngos reported torture arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention impunity denial of due process of law and limited judicial independence remained problems available online at

industrial base has an economy which is heavily dependent on external aid from abroad tourism expatriate worker remittances and the service sector among the longstanding problems jordan faces are corruption slow economic growth and high levels of unemployment nominally around 13 but thought by many analysts to be in the 2530 range19 corruption common in most developing nations is particularly pronounced in jordan use of intermediaries referred to in arabic as wasta connections is widespread and many young jordanians have grown frustrated by the lack of social and economic mobility that corruption engenders each year thousands of jordanians go abroad in search of better jobs and opportunities in recent years jordan has experienced solid economic growth20 though inflationary pressures 15 in 2008 budget deficits and population growth have worked to minimize some of its benefits the londonbased economist intelligence unit forecasts gdp growth to be close to 44 in 2008 decline of 24 from recent years inflation and the prospect of social unrest as oil prices have quadrupled in the last five years and global demand for commodities has soared inflation rates have skyrocketed leading to significant hardships for jordanian middle and lower class families21 for the last several years high global oil prices crippled jordans national budget leading to soaring deficits due to the governments previous policy of subsidizing oil and other derivative products after series of subsidy cuts were enacted between 2005 and 2008 the government abolished the subsidy22 altogether in 2008 and oil and electricity prices subsequently rose more than 55 18 jordan possesses substantial reserves of phosphates and potash significant oil and gas fields have been discovered and its oil tar sands remain commercially unviable 19 one factor that exacerbates the unemployment situation in jordan is the social stigma attached to menial labor jobs referred to as the culture of shame jordanian tribal traditions look down on certain types of employment such as construction in fact the government estimates that there are approximately 300000 to 400000 foreign laborers in jordan working as domestic laborers bricklayers and other tasks 20 though jordan is resourcepoor country high global oil prices can indirectly boost its economic growth oil booms benefit the families of jordanians employed in oilrich nations of the persian gulf as these guest workers have more income to send back home in addition foreign direct investment from the arab gulf states has increased in recent years particularly in the construction and real estate markets 21 other factors also have caused drop in the standard of living the devaluation of the jordanian dinar which is pegged to the dollar has contributed to high inflation rates the influx of hundreds of thousands of iraqi refugees into greater amman has caused housing shortages and led to rising rents and real estate prices by some accounts amman is now one of the most expensive arab capital cities in the region 22 under new pricing mechanism committee of technocrats from various ministries meet monthly and set national oil price that reflects global prices amid some public complaints the government has denied that it profits from fuel sales crs9 although in the past inflationary pressures led to social unrest and rioting there has been violent reaction from the public thus far nevertheless the government is keenly aware of growing dissatisfaction from rising prices and corruption in response public sector wages and unemployment benefits have been increased 1620 for public sector23 and the palace has been forced to address publicly the corruption issue in 2008 critics have alleged that certain government officials received kickbacks from the sale of stateowned land24 in series of high profile media interviews in july king abdullah ii responded to these charges stating the increase in prices has caused lot of discontent with the public and makes for fertile ground for believing lies and rumors and hence different groups are using this discontent to further their own political agendas the debate should focus on transparency and the use of the proceeds of these funds instead of continuing with baseless accusations our culture and national identity will never be for sale as claimed by some malicious rumors25 despite the governments proactive public assistance campaign financial hardship has spread food price increases have sharply reduced jordanians standard of living as many households are now consuming less according to one former minister for many basic products we dont have free market prices we have monopoly pricesoil cement rice meat sugar these are all imported almost exclusively by one importer each here corruption is one thing when its about building road but when it affects my food thats different26 water shortages jordan is one of the ten most water deprived countries in the world and is in constant search of new water resources most of the countrys drinking water is secured from underground wells and excessive pumping over decades has led water levels to drop precipitously series of recent droughts has exacerbated existing shortages and experts have warned that the kingdoms overall water situation is deteriorating in addition the dead sea which abuts both jordan and israel is losing water at an estimated three feet per year and some scientists suggest that without significant action it will be gone by 2050 jordan has been exploring new water development projects including the feasibility of pumping water from the red sea 23 the public sector makes up nearly one third to one half of jordans workforce 24 in september 2008 bassam awadallah the jordanian royal court chief and former minister for international cooperation and planning resigned amid allegations that he received kickbacks from the sale of governmentowned land while these accusations have not been substantiated the pressure on the king to remove awadallah from his post was intense awadallah was leading advocate for economic reform and liberalization policies which have become wildy unpopular amidst record inflation he also is jordanian of palestinian origin background which may have conflicted with the conservative tribal establishment 25

reddead canal israeliarab efforts to restore the dead sea by jeremy m sharp current issues in usjordanian relations promoting peace in the middle east finding peaceful solution to the israelipalestinian conflict is the utmost priority of the jordanian government although jordan joined other neighboring arab states in series of military conflicts against israel between 1948 and 1973 the late king hussein ruled 19521999 ultimately concluded that peace with israel was in jordans strategic interests due to israels conventional military superiority the development of an independent palestinian national movement that threatened both jordanian and israeli security and jordans support for saddam hussein in the first gulf war which isolated it from the west consequently in 1994 jordan and israel signed peace treaty27 and king abdullah ii has used his countrys semicordial official relationship with israel to improve jordans standing with western governments and international financial institutions on which it relies heavily for external support and aid nevertheless the continuation of conflict continues to be major obstacle to jordans development the issue of palestinian rights resonates with much of the population as more than half of all jordanian citizens originate from either the west bank or the pre1967 borders of israel there are an estimated 19 million united nationsregistered palestinian refugees in jordan and while many longer regard their stay in jordan as temporary they have retained their refugee status both as symbolic sign of support for palestinians living under israeli occupation and in hope of being included in any future settlement furthermore for king abdullah ii and the royal hashemite family who are of arab bedouin descent and rely politically on the support of east bank tribal families finding solution to the conflict is considered matter of political survival since the government cannot afford to ignore an issue of critical importance to majority of its citizens the royal family and their tribal constituents vehemently reject periodic israeli calls for the reunification of the west bank with jordan proper dubbed the jordanian option maneuver that could 27 jordan and israel signed peace treaty on october 26 1994 later the two countries exchanged ambassadors israel returned approximately 131 square miles of territory near the rift valley to jordan the parliament repealed laws banning contacts with israel and the two countries signed number of bilateral agreements between 1994 and 1996 to normalize economic and cultural links water sharing recurring problem was partially resolved in may 1997 when the two countries reached an interim arrangement under which israel began pumping 72000 cubic meters of water from lake tiberias the sea of galilee to jordan per day equivalent to 263 million cubic meters per year little over half the target amount envisioned in an annex to the peace treaty crs11 inevitably alter the political status quo in jordan like his father before him king abdullah ii has repeated the mantra that jordan is jordan and palestine is palestine opposition to normalization king abdullahs efforts to normalize relations with israel have faced significant resistance within jordan particularly among islamic fundamentalist groups parts of the palestinian community and influential trade and professional organizations among many mainstream jordanians there is some disappointment that peace with israel has not brought more tangible economic benefits to them so far opponents of normalization have repeatedly called on jordanians to boycott contacts with israel and activists among them have compiled black lists of jordanian individuals and companies that deal with israel the jordanian government has arrested organizers of these lists but courts have upheld their right to publish them in addition iaf parliamentarians periodically propose legislation to prohibit cooperation with israel in various sectors the iaf also has proposed legislation to abrogate jordans 1994 peace treaty with israel reviving the arabisraeli peace process for nearly decade king abdullah ii has attempted to convince us policy makers and congress to become more actively involved in mediating between israelis and palestinians king abdullah ii is strong supporter of saudi initiative dubbed the arab peace initiative which calls for israels full withdrawal from all occupied territories and the establishment of palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip in exchange for full normalization of relations with all arab states in the region in march 2007 address to joint session of congress king abdullah ii pleaded for us leadership in the peace process which he called the core issue in the middle east he suggested that the arab peace initiative is path to achieve collective peace treaty jordanian officials also have repeatedly condemned israeli settlement activities in the west bank especially in jerusalem claiming that they violate international law and heighten tensions in the region king abdullah ii supported the convening of the ussponsored peace conference in annapolis maryland in november 2007 and he has encouraged the united states to push for israelipalestinian negotiations over core issues status of jerusalem refugees and borders he has warned repeatedly that without settlement to the conflict armed islamist movements like hamas and hezbollah will grow in strength and radicalize jordans own islamist movements according to king abdullah ii the process that started in annapolis is from our perspective positive development but it also may be our last chance for peace for many many years to come for us to fully realize the benefits of reform we need to be able to exchange goods and services with our neighbors and facilitate the movement of people so in that respect conflict holds everyone up and the longer we delay conflict resolution the more we risk greater instability down the road28 28 jordans king warns that annapolis conference last chance for palestinians associated press february 10 2008 crs12 jordanhamas relations for two decades jordan has had an onagain off again relationship with hamas the palestinian militant group and us state departmentdesignated foreign terrorist organization fto throughout the 1990s the late king hussein tolerated hamas presence in his kingdom29 upon his accession to the throne in 1999 king abdullah ii perhaps realizing that jordans relationship with hamas was political liability reversed his late fathers longstanding policy of tolerating hamas and closed its jordan offices permanently since then jordan has been strong backer of palestinian moderates such as the fatah party loyal to president mahmoud abbas and has been determined to bolster the capacity of the palestinian authority pa in the west bank in order to prevent hamas from gaining strength there jordan has provided training for several battalions of usscreened palestinian recruits to serve in an overhauled palestinian authority national security force30 the training is conducted by jordanian police at the jordanian international police training center near amman toward the end of 2008 perhaps in order to hedge against the prospect of yet another round of failed israelipalestinian peace negotiations jordan opened dialogue with hamas officials led by general muhammad dahabi jordan reportedly discussed political and security issues with their hamas counterparts muhammad nazzal most analysts have interrupted this limited engagement as pragmatic jordanian maneuver designed to open channels of communication with an emboldened hamas now in firm control of the gaza strip jordan may be seeking pledge from hamas not to interfere in jordanian domestic politics according to one observer hamas wants to talk with jordan and jordan wants to listen to what hamas has to say and it is in jordans interest today to communicate with all and sundry north south east and west without changing the underlying fundamentals of its policies instead of concentrating on an alliance with only two states the united states and israel31 since the 2006 hamas victory in palestinian authority legislative elections the jordanian government has been placed in difficult position much of its citizenry sympathizes with hamas and jordans own islamist party the islamic action front iaf reportedly maintains close ties to hamas the iaf has been careful to downplay these ties according to one recent iaf statement abbas is the legitimate palestinian president and hamass battle should be with the zionist enemy not other palestinians so we ask them to return to policy of dialogue and to restore the 29 in 1997 israeli agents disguised as canadian tourists attempted to poison khaled meshaal head of the hamas political bureau and one of its founding members the agents were captured by jordanian authorities and israel was forced to release number of high profile hamas members in order to secure the return of their operatives king hussein had reportedly threatened to abrogate the israeljordan 1994 peace treaty if israel failed to provide an antidote and release other hamas prisoners 30 palestinian forces enter jordan for training under us program haaretz january

provided logistical support to the usled campaign to oust saddam hussein since 2003 jordanians have repeatedly criticized what they perceive to be the political marginalization of iraqs sunni arab population unlike iraqs other neighbors jordan has limited ability to intervene in iraqs affairs at present and since 2003 jordanian leaders have been far more concerned with iraqs influence on the kingdoms own politics trade and internal security in 2008 as the situation in iraq has somewhat stabilized jordan has moved to normalize its relations with the predominately shiite iraqi government in august 2008 perhaps as response to us demands that arab states end their isolation of iraq king abdullah ii became the first arab leader to visit iraq since the fall of the saddam hussein regime in 2003 earlier in the year jordan announced that it had appointed an ambassador to baghdad the first nation to do so since all arab governments withdrew their ambassadors after the 2005 kidnapping and murder of egypts former envoy33 oil deal as previously mentioned jordanianiraqi relations have historically been strong and jordan has sought to reap tangible benefits from relations with its larger oilrich neighbor during the saddam hussein regime iraq provided nearly all of jordans domestic oil needs half of it free of charge34 after the us invasion in 2003 and until 2008 jordan was forced to receive or purchase its oil elsewhere as its relationship with fledgling shiitedominated iraqi government in the throes of an insurgency and civil war hindered the normalization of bilateral ties the two sides did reach tentative oil deal in august 2006 however security and logistical concerns prevented the resumption of oil shipments after years of delay iraqi crude oil shipments began arriving in jordan in september 2008 under the original terms of their agreement jordan was to receive approximately 10000 barrels of oil per day roughly 10 of their daily consumption 32 egypt and jordan

coalition forces 34 during the decade preceding operation iraqi freedom while iraq was under an international economic embargo jordan imported between 70000 and 95000 barrels per day of oil and oil products from iraq jordan bought the oil at discounted prices and actual payments were made in commodities rather than cash through shipments of humanitarian goods from jordan to iraq these transactions were outside the unapproved oilforfood program however the united nations took note of jordans position that it had other source of oil and us administrations waived legislation that would have penalized jordan for these transactions on this basis crs14 from iraq at price between 1018 per barrel this quantity would increase to 30000 barrels at later stage based on the memorandum of understanding signed between the two countries due to spiraling global oil prices iraq revised the agreement in 2008 to provide crude oil to jordan at 22 per barrel still substantial discount from the international market price for brent crude oil jordan and iraq had discussed the construction of pipeline from iraq to the jordanian port of aqaba but cost projections have scuttled this proposal reportedly the jordanian government is now seeking international financing for the construction of 600mile railroad system to ferry iraqi crude oil directly to jordans sole refinery in the industrial town of zarqa35 qaedainspired terrorism as violence continues unabated in iraq jordan continues to be both source of foreign fighters joining the sunni insurgency and target of qaedainspired terrorist groups the industrial town of zarqa several miles northeast of amman has been well documented as source of sunni militancy as dozens of its young men have traveled to iraq to die as suicide bombers according to one islamist community leader in zarqa most of the young people here in zarqa are very religious and when they see the news and what is going on in the islamic countries they themselves feel that they have to go to fight jihad today you dont need anyone to tell the young men that they should go to jihad they themselves want to be martyrs36 potential threats from transnational terrorism also dominates jordans iraq policy agenda despite the killing of jordanian terrorist mastermind abu musab zarqawi in june 2006 by us and iraqi forces reportedly with assistance from

inflow of iraqis into the capital amman and its environs in addition to concerns over absorbing more iraqis the jordanian government may be treating the steady inflow of iraqi refugees as national security issue jordanian authorities have imposed restrictions on young iraqi males to prevent their entering the country in response to security concerns the jordanian government classifies displaced iraqis living in jordan as visitors or guests not refugees as jordan does not have domestic refugee law nor is it party to the 1951 refugees convention38 iraqis who are able to deposit 150000 in amman banks are granted residency almost instantly while the vast majority of iraqis in jordan have become illegal aliens due to the expiration of their visitor visas39 jordans positive relationships with western donor countries and international organizations have enabled it to receive some outside assistance for coping with its large iraqi refugee population the fy2007 supplemental appropriations act pl11028 provided 45 million to jordan for assistance to iraqi refugees and an additional 103 million in economic assistance for jordanian communities hosting large refugee populations pl110161 the

amman the radisson grand hyatt and days inn killed 58 persons and seriously wounded approximately 100 others the terrorist organization qaeda in iraq formerly headed by zarqawi claimed responsibility for the act many jordanians even some who disagree with their governments support for us middle east policies have condemned the hotel bombings which killed many jordanians and denounced zarqawis actions king abdullah ii has said the attacks were aimed at ordinary jordanians not foreigners noting that the hotels though western owned were frequented by local citizens on november 15 2005 jordans

absentia including zarqawi and two more were executed on march 11 2006 in april 2004 jordanian authorities reportedly uncovered plot by terrorist cell linked to zarqawi which planned to launch chemical attack in the jordanian capital of amman according to press reports in january 2004 one of the wouldbe perpetrators visited iraq where he obtained 170000 which zarqawi had collected from syrian donors to pay for the attack the plot was reportedly foiled by jordanian police and elite special forces units in series of operations in amman on august 19 2005 rockets apparently aimed at two

hands of israeli soldiers during the war in southern lebanon according to the new york times jaoura had worked in israel where he was arrested two years ago for overstaying his visa jordanian security officials believe his incarceration may have further radicalized him41 allegations of torture as media scrutiny over the cias alleged practice of transporting terrorism suspects to detention facilities abroad has grown in recent years jordans general intelligence department gid has been accused of detaining and torturing cia prisoners captured in other countries according to recent washington post article on the gid its gid interrogators had reputation for persuading tightlipped suspects to talk even if that meant using abusive tactics that could violate us or international law42 in july 2006 the human rights group amnesty international accused the jordanian security establishment of torturing terrorist suspects on behalf of the united states government amnesty international identified 10 suspected cases of men subjected to rendition from us custody to interrogation centers in jordan43 second report released by human rights watch in september 2006 claimed that the gid carries out arbitrary arrests and abuses suspects in its own detention facility the report studied the cases of 16 men whom the gid had arrested and found that in 14 of the 16 cases detainees were tortured or illtreated in response the gid denied any wrongdoing finally in january 2007 report manfred nowak the united nations special rapporteur on torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment concluded that the practice of torture persists in jordan because of lack of awareness of the problem and because of institutionalized impunity in april 2008 three prisoners were killed and dozens of others injured during riot at muwaqqar prison according to the jordanian national centre for human rights nchr mistreatment and beatings of inmates by some policemen at the muaqqar prison led to the rioting despite government denials or statements suggesting that reforms are underway international monitoring groups continue to charge that torture in the jordanian prison system is widespread an october 2008 human rights watch report alleged that despite an amendment to the penal code to make torture crime jordans measures have been insufficient and

january 2007 interview with an israeli newspaper king abdullah ii announced his countrys plans to construct nuclearpowered reactor for peaceful purposes most analysts believe that jordan like other arab countries is using the specter of looming iranian threat to generate international support for nuclear program which in jordans case will mainly alleviate electricity and fuel shortages needed to power new desalination plants by 2017 the government aims to have between 20 and 30 of its annual electricity generated by nuclear power nonetheless financing nuclear program may be cost prohibitive

millennium challenge account in fy2006 jordan was listed by the millennium challenge corporation mcc as threshold country in the lower middleincome bracket on september 12 2006 the mccs board of directors approved up to 25 million in threshold program assistance for jordan even prior to the selection the possible choice of jordan had come under severe criticism freedom house the organization whose annual index of freedom is drawn upon for two of the ruling justly indicators had urged the mcc board to bypass countries that had low scores on political rights and civil liberties it argued that countries like jordan that fall below 4 out of possible 7 on its index should be automatically disqualified jordan however did well on three of the six other indicators in this category several development analysts further argued that jordan should not be selected because the mca is not an appropriate funding source they assert that jordan already is one of the largest recipients of us aid has access to private sector capital and is not democracy in selecting jordan the mcc board appears not to have been swayed by these arguments jordans threshhold assistance is being used to accelerate political reforms and allow jordan to qualify for the mccs larger compact funding program according to the mcc the jordan threshold program will among other things provide technical assistance and
