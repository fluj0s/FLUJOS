activity may be transferred from one state ie country to another for arrest detention andor interrogation commonly this is done through extradition by which one state surrenders person within its jurisdiction to requesting state via formal legal process typically established by treaty far less often such transfers are effectuated through process known as extraordinary rendition or irregular rendition these terms have often been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of person from one state to another in this report rendition refers to extraordinary or irregular renditions unless otherwise specified although the particularities regarding the usage of extraordinary renditions and the legal authority behind such renditions are not publicly available various us officials have acknowledged the practices existence recently there has been some controversy as to the usage of renditions by the united states particularly with regard to the alleged transfer of suspected terrorists to countries known to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture purportedly with the knowledge or acquiescence of the united states this report discusses relevant international and domestic law restricting the transfer of persons to foreign states for the purpose of torture the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ca t and its domestic implementing legislation the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 impose the primary legal restrictions on the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture both cat and us implementing legislation generally prohibit the rendition of persons to countries in most cases where they would more likely than not be tortured though there are arguably limited exceptions to this prohibition the state department has taken the position that cats provisions concerning the transfer of persons do not apply extraterritorially though as matter of policy the united states does not transfer persons in its custody to countries where they would face torture us regulations and statutes implementing cat however arguably limit the extraterritorial transfer of individuals nonetheless under us regulations implementing cat person may be transferred to country that provides credible assurances that the rendered person will not be tortured neither ca t nor implementing legislation prohibits the rendition of persons to countries where they would be subject to harsh interrogation techniques not rising to the level of torture besides ca t additional obligations may be imposed upon us rendition practice via the geneva conventions the war crimes act as amended by the military commissions act pl 109366 the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr and the universal declaration on human rights this report also discusses legislation introduced in the first session of the 110 th congress to limit or bar

of terrorist or criminal activity may be transferred from one state ie country to another to answer charges against them1 the surrender of fugitive from one state to another is generally referred to as rendition 2 distinct form of rendition is extradition by which one state surrenders person within its territorial jurisdiction to requesting state via formal legal process typically established by treaty between the countries3 however renditions may be effectuated in the absence of extradition treaties as well4 the terms irregular rendition and extraordinary rendition have been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of person from one state to another generally for the purpose of arrest detention andor interrogation by the receiving state for purposes of this report the term rendition will be used to describe irregular renditions and not extraditions unless otherwise specified unlike in extradition cases persons subject to this type of rendition typically have access to the judicial system of the sending state by which they may challenge their transfer 5 sometimes persons are rendered from the territory of the rendering state itself while other times they are seized by the rendering state in another country and immediately rendered without ever setting foot in the territory of the rendering state6 sometimes renditions occur with the formal consent of the state where the fugitive is located other times they do not7 1 the surrender of persons to requesting state to answer criminal charges was originally guided by principles of comity and reciprocity beginning in the late eighteenth century the surrender of persons to requesting state to answer charges increasingly became governed by formal extradition treaties between states though the practice of extradition can be traced back to antiquity for background see crs report 98958 extradition to and from the united states overview of the law and recent treaties by charles doyle in contrast to earlier practices extradition treaties established formal procedures governing the surrender of persons from one treaty party to another facilitating treaty parties shared interest in punishing certain crimes while providing persons with legal means to challenge their proposed transfer to requesting state by the 20 th century extradition treaties became the predominant means of permitting the transfer of persons from one state to another to answer charges against them for background see id at 13 m bassiouni international extradition united states law and practice 4th ed 2002 2 black s law dictionary 129899 7th ed 1999 3 us extradition procedures for transferring person to another state are governed by the relevant treaty with that state as supplemented by 18 usc 31813196 us law generally prohibits the extradition of individuals from the united states in the absence of treaty 18 usc 3181 4 for example via statutory authorization the us may in the exercise of comity surrender person to foreign country to f ace criminal charges for committing crime of violence against us national if the offense is non political in nature and the person is not us citizen national or permanent resident 18 usc 3181b courts have also recognized that an extradition may be effectuated pursuant to statute rather than treaty see ntakirutimana v reno 184 f3d 419 5th cir 1999 upholding surrender of rwandan citizen to international tribunal when surrender was authorized via executive agreement and implementing statute rather than treaty 5 before the united states may extradite person to another state an extradition hearing must be held before an authorized judge or magistrate during which the judge or magistrate must determine whether the persons extradition would comply with the terms of the extradition treaty between the united states and the requesting state federal statute prohibits the extradition of an individual in the absen ce of treaty even if the magistrate or authorized judge finds extradition to be appropriate fugitive can still institute habeas corpus proceedings to obtain release from custody and thereby prevent his extradition or the secretary of state may decide not to authorize the extradition see crs report 98958 extradition to and from the united states overview of the law and recent treaties by charles doyle supra footnote 1 these protections do not apply in situations where an alien is being removed from the united states for immigration purposes nevertheless separate procedural and humanitarian relief protections do pertain 6 in 2005 khaled elmasri

attempting to enter the united states may be removed to another state under us immigration laws if such aliens are either deportable or inadmissible and their removal complies with relevant statutory provisions8 unlike in the case of rendition and extradition the legal justification for removing an alien from the united states via deportation or denial of entry is not so that he can answer charges against him in the receiving state rather it is because the us possesses the sovereign authority to determine which nonnationals may enter or remain within its borders and the alien fails to fulfill the legal criteria allowing noncitizens to enter remain in or pass in transit through the united states although the deportation or exclusion of an alien under immigration laws may have the same practical effect as an irregular rendition especially if the alien is subject to expedited removal under 235 of the immigration and nationality act in which case judicial review of removal order may be very limited this practice is arguably distinct from the historical understanding of what continued times january 9 2005 at 11 the federal district court dismissed elmasris claim without evaluating

another without that countrys consent extraterritorial apprehension by the federal bureau of investigation 4b p off legal counsel 543 1980 additionally article 24 of the charter proh ibits member states from violating the sovereignty of another state in 1989 the office of legal counsel constrained the 1980 opinion though not on the grounds that such renditions are consistent with customary international law authority of the federal bureau of investigation to override international law in extraterritorial law activities 13 p off legal counsel 163 1989 finding that extraterritorial law enforcement activities authorized by domestic law are not barred even if they contravene unexecuted treaties or treaty provisions such as article 24 of the united nations charter as well as customary international law further while upholding court jurisdiction over mexican national brought to the united states via rendition despite opposition from the mexican government the supreme court nevertheless noted that such renditions were potentially violation of general international law principles united states v alvarezmachain 505 us 655 669 1992 in related case twelve years later however

rendition has occasionally been used by some commentators to describe the transfer of aliens suspected of terrorist activity to third countries for the purposes of detention and interrogation even though the transfer was conducted pursuant to immigration procedures10 over the years number of persons have reportedly been rendered into the united states by us authorities often with the cooperation of the states where such persons were seized to answer criminal charges including charges related to terrorist activity 11 there have been widely reported cases of persons being rendered from the interior of the united states though there have been cases where nonus citizens were allegedly r endered at us ports of entry but had yet to legally enterbe admitted into the united states though such renditions appear to have been conducted pursuant to immigration removal procedures12 noncitizens arriving at ports of entry have recognized constitutional rights with regard to their admission into or removal from the united states more generally noncitizens are only considered to receive those constitutional protections after they have effected entry into the united states13 on the other hand the supreme 9 see b assiouni supra footnote 1 at 183248 discussing deportatio n and exclusion as an alternative to extradition 10 perhaps the most notable case of alleged rendition

tortured and interrogated for susp ected terrorist activities with the acquiescence of the united states arar was allegedly first detained by us officials while waiting in new yorks john f kennedy

from actions taken against them by the united states14 besides receiving persons through rendition the united states has also rendered persons to other countries over the years via the central intelligence agency cia and various law enforcement agencies15 reportedly the rendition of terrorist suspects to other countries was authorized by president ronald reagan in 1986 and has been part of us counterterrorism efforts at least since the late 1990s 16 in testimony before the house foreign affairs committee in april 2007 former cia official michael f scheuer claimed authorship of the cias rendition program and stated that it originally began in mid1995 the initial goals of the rendition program according to scheuer were to ensure the detention of qaeda members posing threat to us security and to seize any documents in their possession17 however after 911 and under president bush rendered alqaeda operatives have most often been kept in us custody the goals of the program remained the same although mr bushs national security team wanted to use us officers to interrogate captured alqaeda fighters 18 in 2002 written statement to the joint committee inquiry into terrorist attacks against the united states thencia director george tenet reported that even prior to the 911 terrorist attacks the cia in many cases with the fbi had rendered 70 terrorists to justice around the world19 the new york times has reported that following the 911 attacks president bush issued stillclassified directive that broadened the cias authority to render terrorist suspects to other states though this allegation has not been publicly confirmed or denied by the white house20 although there are some reported estimates that the united states has rendered more than 100 individuals following 91121 the actual number is not matter of the public record recent controversy has arisen over the united states allegedly rendering suspected terrorists to states known to practice torture for the purpose of arrest detention andor harsh interrogation22 critics charge that the united states is rendering persons to such states so that they will be subjected to harsh interrogation

persons have been rendered to foreign states believed to practice torture officials have denied rendering persons to states for the purpose of torture23 answering question regarding renditions in march 16 2005 press conference president bush stated that prior to transferring persons to other states the united states receives promise that they wont be torturedthis country does not believe in torture24 in testimony before the senate armed services committee in 2005 acting cia director porter goss stated that in his belief we have more safeguards and more oversight in place over renditions than we did before 911 25 secretary of state condoleezza rice stated that the united states has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone to country when we believe he will be tortured where appropriate the united states seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured26 little publicly available information from government sources exists regarding the nature and frequency of us renditions to countries believed to practice torture or the nature of any assurances obtained from them before rendering persons to them to what extent us agencies have legal authority to engage in renditions re mains unclear the only provision within the united states code appearing to expressly permit an agencys participation in rendition is 10 usc 374b1d as amended in 1998 which perm its the department of defense dod upon request from the head of federal law enforcement agency to make dod personnel available to operate equipment with respect to rendition of suspected terrorist from foreign country to the united states to stand trial 27 on the other hand given that the united states apparently participates in renditions there would appear to be legal limits on the practice especially with regard to torture this report describes the most relevant legal guidelines limiting the transfer of persons to foreign states where they may face torture as well as recent legislation seeking to limit the rendition of persons to countries believed to practice torture 23 see eg r jeffrey smith gonzales defends transfer of detainees washington post march 8 2005 p a3

primary legal restrictions on the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture cat requires signatory parties to take measures to end torture within territories under their jurisdiction and it prohibits the transfer of persons to countries where there is substantial likelihood that they will be tortured 29 torture is distinct form of persecution and is defined for purposes of cat as severe pain or suffering intentionally inflicted on person under the color of law30 accordingly many forms of persecutionincluding certain harsh interrogation techniques that would be considered cruel and unusual under the us constitutiondo not necessarily constitute torture which is an extreme and particular form of mistreatment 31 cat also obligates parties to take measures to prevent other acts of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture but this obligation only extends to acts occurring within state partys territorial jurisdiction32 cat also established the committee against torture monitoring body which has claratory but nonbinding authority concerning interpretation of the convention33 state parties are required to submit periodic reports to the committee concerning their compliance with ca t34 the united states ratified cat in 1994 subject to certain declarations reservations and understandings including that the convention was not selfexecuting and therefore required domestic implementing legislation to take effect 35 the express language of cat article 2 allows for circumstances or emergencies where torture could be permitted by convention parties36 on the other hand number of ca t provisions 28 convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat ga res

of persons to countries where they would likely face torture however us courts hearing cases concerning the removal of aliens have regularly interpre ted cat provisions prohibiting alien removal to countries where an alien would likely face torture to be nonself executing and judicially unenforceable except to the extent permitted under domestic implementing legislation see eg castellanochacon v

coextensive as that contained in cat article 2 the following paragraphs describe the relevant provisions of cat and implementing statutes and regulations that restrict the rendition of persons to

are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture the us ratification of ca t was contingent on its understanding that this requirement refers to situations where it would be more likely than not that person would be tortured if removed to particular country standard commonly used by us courts when determining whether to withhold an aliens removal for fear of persecution38 it is important to note that cat does not prohibit state from transferring person to another state where he or she would likely be subjected to harsh treatment that while it would be considered cruel and unusual under the standards of the us constitution would nevertheless not be severe enough to constitute torture 39 continued 36 cat article 22 declares that exceptional circumstances whatsoever whether state of war or threat of war internal political instability or any other public emergency may be invoked as justification of torture according to the state departments analysis of cat which was included in president reagans transmittal of the convention to the senate for its advice and consent this explicit prohibition of all torture regardless of the circumstances was viewed by the drafters of cat as necessary if the convention is to have significant effect as public emergencies are commonly invoked as source of extraordinary powers or as ju

an alien is eligible for consideration for asylum based on wellfounded fear of persecution if transferred to particular country to demonstrate wellfounded fear an alien only needs to prove that the fear is reasonable not that it is based on clear probability of persecution see ins v cardozafonseca 480 us 421 1987 39 according to the state departments analysis of cat the conventions definition of torture was intended to be interpreted in relatively limited fashion corresponding to the common understanding of torture as an extreme practice which is universally condemned state dept summary supra footnote 36 p 3 for example the state department suggested that rough treatme nt falling into the category of police brutality while deplorable does not amount to torture for purposes of the convention which is usually reserved for extreme deliberate and unusually cruel practices such as sustained systematic beating application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain id p 4 presumably police brutality of extreme severity could rise to the level of torture this understanding of torture as particularly severe form of cruel treatment is made explicit by cat article 16 which obligates convention parties to prevent in any territory under their jurisdiction other acts of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to acts of torture continued

person to country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states 41 the act further required all relevant federal agencies to adopt appropriate regulations to implement this policy42 in doing so however congress opened the door fo r administrative action

described in 241b3b of the immigration and nationality act ina43 ina 241b3b acts as an exception to the general us prohibition on the removal of aliens to countries where they would face persecution

been convicted of particularly serious crime is danger to the community of the united states is strongly suspected to have committed serious nonpolitical crime outside the united states prior to

us regulations implementing cat article 3 permit the consideration of diplomatic assurances in removalextradition decisions46 and reportedly in rendition decisions made by the cia concerning persons seized outside the united states and transferred to third country pursuant to removal and extradition regulations person subject to removal or extradition may be transferred to specified country that provides diplomatic assurances to the secretary of state that the person will not be tortured if removed there such assurances must be deemed sufficiently reliable before person can be transferred to country where he or she would otherwise more likely than not be tortured 47 again because cia regulations regarding the transfer of persons are not publicly available the role that assurances play in assessing whether to render someone to another country remains unclear the washington post reports that the cia office of general counsel requires the cia station chief in given country to obtain verbal assurances from that countrys security service that person will not be tortured if rendered there 48 such assurances must then reportedly be cabled to cia headquarters before the rendition may occur49 cat article 3 itself as opposed to us regulations implementing cat provides little guidance as to the application of diplomatic assurances to decisions to transfer person to another country although cat article 3 obligates signatory parties to take into account the proposed receiving states human rights record it also provides that the proposed sending state should take into account all relevant considerations when assessing whether to remove an individual to particular state 50 states assurances that it will not torture an individual would appear to be relevant consideration in determining whether or not it would be appropriate to render him there at least so long as the assurances are accompanied by mechanism for enforcement51 article 3 does not provide guidelines for how these considerations should be weighed in determining whether substantial grounds exist to believe person would be tortured in the proposed receiving state52 in its second periodic report to the committee against torture the united states claimed that it obtains assurances as appropriate from the foreign government to which detainee is transferred that it will not torture the individual being

recommendation that the united states should only rely on diplomatic assurances in regard to states which do not systematically violate the conventions provisions and after thorough examination of the merits of each individual case the state party should tablish and implement clear procedures for obtaining such assurances with adequate judicial mechanisms for review and effective post return monitoring arrangements 54 in addition the united states has an obligation under customary international law to execute its convention obligations in good faith55 and is therefore required under international law to exercise appropriate discretion in its use of diplomatic assurances for instance if state consistently violated the terms of its diplomatic assurances the united states would presumably need to look beyond the face of such promises before permitting the transfer of an individual to that country56

legislation expressly prohibiting torture occurring within the united states as it was presumed that such acts would be covered by existing applicable federal and us state statutes61 such as those statutes criminalizing assault manslaughter and murder the federal torture statute criminalizes torture as well as attempts and conspiracies to commit torture62 the federal torture statute provides that the spec ific intent of the actor to commit torture is requisite component of the criminal offense63 specific intent is the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with64 this degree of intent differs from general intent which usually takes the form of recklessness involving actual awareness of risk and the culpable taking of that risk or negligen ce involving

of cat was to help ensure that one would be subjected to torture66 it is arguably unclear as to whether ca t would in all circumstances bar renditions to countries that practice torture including possibly in certain cases where the rendering state was aware that rendered person would likely be tort ured clearly it would violate us criminal law 58 id art 5 59 pursuant to an amendment made by

via rendition regardless of where such renditions would occur however it is not altogether clear that ca t prohibits the rendering of persons seized outside the united states or whether criminal sanctions would apply to us official who authorized rendition without intending to facilitate the torture of the rendered person as opposed to for instance the harsh mistreatment of the rendered person to degree not rising to the level of torture g20g142g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g155g152g150g561g157g145g142g561g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561 cat article 3 clearly prohibits the rendition of persons from the territory of signatory state to another state when there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be tortured even if it could be technically argued that renditions do not constitute extraditions within the meaning of cat article 3 and the rendition was to country other than one where the person previously resided meaning that the person wa s not being returned to country where he would risk torture such transfers would still violate the conventions requirement that state party expel person from its territory to another state where he is more likely than not to be tortured if the united states were to receive diplomatic assurances from state that it would not torture person rendered there and such assurances were deemed sufficiently credible the rendition would not facially appear to violate either ca t article 3 or domestic implementing legislation us regulations permit the use of assurances in removal and extradition decisions and cat does not discuss their usage as mentioned previously however the united states is obligated to execute its cat obligations in good faith 67 and therefore must exercise appropriate discretion in its use of diplomatic assurances if state consistently violated the terms of its diplomatic assurances or the united states learned that particular assurance would not be met the united states would presumably need to look beyond the face of such promises before permitting the transfer of an individual to that country again neither cat nor us implementing regulations prohibit the united states from transferring persons to states where they would face harsh treatmentincluding treatment that would be prohibited if carried out by us authoritiesthat does not rise to the level of torture indeed the united states could conceivably render person to state after receiving sufficient diplomatic representations that the rendered person could be accorded cruel and inhumane treatment not rising to the level of torture without violating cat or ca timplementing regulations

cat article 3 is matter of debate as general matter the united states has taken the position that human rights treaties apply to persons living in the territory of the united states and not to any person with whom agents of our government deal in the international community 69 in 2006 representatives of the us state department informed the cat committee against torture that the united states does not believe cat article 3 applies to persons outside us territory70 however these representatives also claimed that as matter of policy the united states accords cat article 3 protections to all persons in us custody regardless of whether such persons were found in us territory71 although the scope of human rights treaties may generally be limited to conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of parties it seems clear that at least some cat provisions are extraterritorial in scope most notably cat articles 45 require parties to criminalize all acts of torture regardless of where they occur72 indeed the federal torture statute implementing this obligation expressly covers torture occurring outside the united states73 although several cat provisions limit their scope to acts occurring in any territory under the state partys jurisdiction 74 cat article 3 does not contain similar limiting provision accordingly it could be argued that like cat articles 45 cat article 3 is intended to be extraterritorial in scope nevertheless it could still be argued that the express provisions of cat article 3 do not apply to extraordinary renditions occurring outside the united states at least so long as the person is not rendered to country where he has formerly resided article 3 states that party shall expel 68 the washington post has alleged that us intelligence and

substantial grounds to believe that he or she will be tortured it could be argued however that certain extraterritorial renditions are not covered by this provision seizing person in one country and transferring him to another would arguably not constitute expelling the person if state is understood only to be able to expel persons from territory over which it exercises sovereign authority so long as these persons were rendered to countries where they had not previously resided it also could not be said that the united states returned these persons to countries where they faced torture though persons rendered to countries where they had previously resided would presumably be protected under ca t article 3 in addition if such renditions were not executed via formal process it could be argued they did not constitute extraditions for the purposes of article 3 75 accordingly it could be argued that th united states would not violate the express language of article 3 if it rendered persons to countries where they faced torture so long as part of these renditions occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states76 critics of this view might argue that such narrow interpretation of ca t article 3 would contradict the conventions overarching goal to prevent torture the fact that ca t requires parties to take legal steps to eliminate torture within their respective territories and to impose criminal penalties on torture offenders coupled with the conventions statement that exceptional circumstances whatsoever can be used to justify torture arguably imply that state party may never exercise or be complicit in the use of torture even when it occurs extraterritorially it could be further argued that the drafters of cat did not explicitly discuss extraterritorial renditions because they were either not contemplated or in cases where such renditions might occur absent the consent of the hosting country because these actions were arguably already understood to be impermissible under international law 77 indeed some of the drafters of cat have taken the position that article 3 was intended to cover all measures by which person is physically transferred to another state78 opponents of narrow interpretation of ca t would likely argue that it is contrary to the purpose of cat to interpret the convention as prohibiting formal transfers of persons to states where they 75 see b assiouni supra footnote 1 at 29 extradition in contemporary practice means formal process by which person is surrendered by one state to another based on treaty reciprocity or comity 76 in sale v haitian centers council inc 509 us 155 1993 the supreme court held that the interdiction of haitian refugees by the united states did not violate us obligations under the convention relating to the status of refugees the court concluded that the conventions provisions providing that contracting party shall expel or return refouler refugee facing pers ecution applies only to refu gees within partys rritory and not to those interdicted on the high seas id at 179183 some have suggested that cat article 3s limitation on the transfer of persons should also be interpreted in nonextraterritorial fashion john yoo transferring terrorists 79 n otre dame l rev 1183 1229 2004 given the supreme courts interpretation in sale of identical language in the refugee convention it makes sense to view the torture convention as affecting the transfer of prisoners held outside the united states to another country on the other hand the sale courts interpretation of the refugee conventions prohibition on the expulsion or return of refugees was largely based on this prohibitions interplay with other convention provisions reading this prohibition to apply extraterritorially would create an absurd anomaly with related convention provision that only applied to refugees within convention partys territory sale 509 us at 179 180 in contrast reading cat article 3 as being extraterritorial in scope would not have an incongruous effect on the interpretation of other cat provisions 77 see supra footnote 7 78 j herman burgers hans danelius the united nations convention against torture handbook on the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 126 1988 on the other hand the state department has claimed that neither the text of the convention its negotiating history nor the us record of ratification supports view that article 3 of the cat applies to persons outside the territory of party written

irregular forms of transfer in 1994 the cat committee against torture declared in non binding opinion that article 3 prevents not only the return of person to country where he or she is in danger of being tortured but also prohibits the persons transfer to any other country where he runs real risk of being expelled or returned to his or her country of origin or of being subjected to torture79 more recently in 2006 the committee urged the united states to apply the nonrefoulement guarantee of cat article 3 to all detainees in its custody cease the rendition of suspects in particular by its intelligence agencies to states where they face real risk of torture in order to comply with its obligations under article 3 of the convention80 g7g161g157g155g138g157g142g155g155g146g157g152g155g146g138g149g561g3g153g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g146g151g144g561g5g3g22g561g3g155g157g146g140g149g142g561g345g561 beyond cat it is important to note that given the express language of ca timplementing legislation the united states cannot expel extradite or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states 81 it may be argued that this express statutory language prohibits renditions from outside the united states even if such renditions would not otherwise be in violation of cat obligations82 two possible counterarguments could be made to this position at least in certain circumstances the first and perhaps most compelling counterargument is that although the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 generally prohibits persons from being expelled extradited or involuntarily returned regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states section 2243c of the act makes an exception requiring federal agencies to exclude from the protection of ca timplementing regulations any aliens who inter alia are reasonably believed to pose danger to the united states to the maximum extent such exclusions are consistent with cat obligations 83 accordingly presuming for the sake of argument that cat does not protect persons believed to be security dangers from being rendered from outside the united states the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 would require such persons to be excluded from the protection of any ca timplementing regulations as well second counterargument is that the clause regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states should be read only in reference to the prohibition contained in the catimplementing legislation upon the involuntary return of persons to countries where they would more likely than not be tortured and not be read in reference to the prohibition on the extradition or expulsion of persons ca t article 3 obligates states not to expel return 79 committee against torture communication 13199 3 switzerland 270494 mutombo v switzerland catc12d131993 1994 at 10 80 committee recommendations supra footnote 54 at 20 81 pl 105277 at 2242a emphasis added 82 though it generally could be argued that state can only expel someone from territory over which the state exercises sovereign authority the language of the us legislation implementing cat may suggest an intent by congress to broadly define the prohibition on expelling persons to countries where they would likely face torture so that this prohibition covers not only expulsions from areas over which the united states exercises sovereign authority but also expulsions from all other areas eg rendering persons captured in nonus territory to other states 83 id at 2242c

substantial risk of torture the principle of nonrefoulement is commonly understood to prohibit not simply the exclusion of persons from the territory of the receiving state but also state from turning back persons at its borders and compelling their involuntary return to their country of origin84 unlike cat article 3 ca timplementing legislation enacted by the united states does not use the term refouler however its use of the phrase involuntary returnregardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states appears to reflect the principle of nonrefoulement expressed in ca t it could be argued that the use of the phrase regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states in ca timplementing legislation was only intended to be read in reference to the involuntary return phrase that precedes it reading that reflects the nonrefoulement obligation imposed by cat and not meant also to be read in reference to the prohibition imposed upon the expulsion and extradition of persons to countries where they would likely face torture as this alternative reading would arguably go beyond the nonrefoulement obligations imposed upon the united states by the express language of cat regardless of whether renditions that occur outside of the united states are covered under cat article 3 and ca timplementing legislation and regulations cat article 4 and corresponding domestic law criminalizing all acts of torture and complicity therein would be controlling accordingly us officials could not conspire with officials in other states to render person so that he would be tortured as discussed below however criminal penalties may not necessarily attach to person who renders another with th knowledge that he will likely be tortured

4 and the federal torture statute do not expressly prohibit the transfer of person to state where he is more likely than not to face torture indeed the federal torture statute only imposes criminal penalties for acts or attempts to commit torture and most relevantly to the subject of renditions conspiracies to commit torture clearly if us official rendered person to another country with instructions for the country to torture the rendered individual that official could be criminally liable under the torture statute 85 however it appears unlikely that us official would be found criminally liable for conspiracy to commit torture if he authorized rendition af ter receiving assurances that the rendered person would not be tortured it is generally understood that conspiracy to commit crime requires an agreement between parties for common purpose86 presuming that the united states received 84 for additional background on the concept of nonrefoulement and its development in

transferred person upon notification the transferring power is required to either request their return or take effective measures to correct the situation95 accordingly in order to comply with its convention obligations the united states may only render protected person if 1 the state to which the person was being rendered was member of the convention 2 the united states had received assurances that the person would not be tortured if rendered there and 3 the united states requested the return of the rendered person or took other effective measures if the rendered individual was subsequently tortured in the case of armed conflicts that are not of an international character and occur in the territory of high contracting party each party is obligated under article 3 of each of the 1949 geneva conventions common article 3 to accord minimis protections to persons taking active part in the hostilities including members of ar med forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors combat by sickness wounds detention or any other cause parties are required to treat such persons humanely and are prohibited from subjecting such persons to violence to life and person mutilation cruel treatment and torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment as mentioned previously the geneva conventions apply in limited circumstances besides only applying in armed conflict or in postconflict oc cupied territory the conventions also only protect designated categories of persons though other persons may nevertheless be owed certain protections under customary laws of war at ast since early 2002 the bush administration took the position that the geneva conventions did not apply to members of qaeda 96 reportedly the administration has also concluded that the geneva convention prohibition on the forcible transfer of civilians does not apply to illegal aliens who have entered iraq following the us led invasion or bar the temporary removal of persons from iraq for the purposes of interrogation97 in the 2006 case of hamdan v rumsfeld the supreme court held that common article 3 of the geneva conventions applied to the armed conflict with qaeda and accorded qaeda members certain minimal protections even if such persons were not otherwise covered by other convention provisions ie those covering l awful combatants and civilians common article 3 does not expressly prohibit the transfer of persons to other countries even if such persons might face cruel treatment or torture there some have argued that common article 3 nevertheless prohibits renditions committed to facilitate the rendered persons torture or cruel treatment 98 however it is unclear whether this interpretation is proper99 or that it would cover all renditions continued the transfer of such persons for nondisciplinary reasons 94 third geneva convention art 12 fourth geneva convention art 45 95 third geneva convention art 12 fourth

breaches of common article 3 the president is authorized to subsequently interpret the conventions more restrictively subject to certain limitations 101 under this standard torture and cruel treatment would only be considered violation of common article 3 in cases where the victim was in the custody or control of the united states not in circumstances where the victim was transferred to the custody and control of thirdparty and was subsequently treated harshly as discussed in the following paragraph however this standard might still prohibit us personnel from rendering person covered by common

it is understood as matter of us law that common article 3 covers the conflict with qaeda and accords qaeda members captured in that armed conflict with certain protections 106 accordingly certain continued parties when such persons would face treatment prohibited by the conventions see infra at 1920 it could be argued that these provisions would be made redundant if convention provisions

criminal penalty including torture certain lesser forms of cruel treatment and the intentional infliction of serious bodily injury although the war crimes act imposes criminal penalties for conspiring to subject protected persons to torture or cruel treatment such persons must be in the offenders custody or control accordingly the provisions of the war crimes act covering torture and cruel treatment do not appear to cover the rendition of persons to countries for the purpose of cruel treatment or torture though any us personnel who conspired with officials in other states to render person so that he would be tortured could still be prosecuted under the federal torture statute however the war crimes act may be interpreted as prohibiting some renditions as recently amended by the military commissions act the war crimes act expressly prohibits persons from conspiring to commit such acts as rape mutilation or maiming or causing serious bodily injury against persons protected by common article 3 person may be subject to criminal penalty for these offenses regardless of whether the victim was in his custody or control accordingly any us personnel who conspire with officials in other states to render person so that he would be subjected to serious bodily injury rape or sexual assault would appear to be subject to criminal liability under the war crimes act as practical matter it is unclear whether the war crimes act would prohibit renditions in any circumstance not already prohibited under the federal torture statute 107
