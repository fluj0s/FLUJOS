itted bosnias muslim croat and serb communities against one another nato first deployed an implementation force ifor of nearly 60000 troops to bosnia to enforce compliance with the military aspects of the dayton accord s although ifor successfully carried out the military tasks ou tlined in the dayton agreement the continued need for an external military presence to provide secure envir onment in bosnia led nato to replace ifor with smaller stabilization force sfor initially with about 32000 troops in december 1996 nato extended sfor second time in june 1998 this time without specified enddate instead nato outlined number of benchmarks to measure progress toward selfsustaining peace in bosnia periodic mission reviews by nato of sfor operations assessed an increasingly stable security s ituation and prompted gradual reductions in sfors force strength over time the security council authorized natos originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21774crs2 1 the last resolution authorizing sfor operations was resolution 1551 passed unanimously on july 9 2004 which extended author ization for sfor for further six months and welcomed the eus intention to launch an eu military mission in

earlier plans to close out the ohr entirely by midyear ifor mission in december 1995 the follow on sfor mission one year later and subsequently renewed its au thorization for sfors ope rations on an annual basis1 the united states initially contributed cl ose to 20000 troops to ifor or about one third of the total force in 1995 president clinton justified the us contribution as an appropriate response to the ffering and instability caused by the bosnian war and as demonstration of us leadership in nato although he pledged at the time that the commitment would not exceed one year th bush administration frequently invoked the in together out together policy with th european allies on maintaining transatlantic unity on balkan peacekeeping operations as the smaller sfor drew down over the years so did the us contingent and its sh are averaged about 15 of the total force in the final years for example the us cont ribution was about 1000 out of total of 7000 8000 troops in sfor in late 2004 throughout sfors existence the united states retained command over the nato force in bosnia natos residual headquarters presence also remains under us command about 1500 us troops currently serve in the nato peacekeeping force in nearby kosovo transition to eufor in bosnia concept evolution eu heads of state expressed their willingness and readiness to lead military operation to follow sfor as early as 20022 eu officials viewed the initiative to lead followon peacekeeping force in bosnia as an outgrowth of the eus european security and defense policy esdp as well as logical extension of the eus growing involvement in the western balkans bosnia is in negotiations with the eu on stabilization and association agreement and aspires to eventual eu membership the eu also has experience in fielding police tr aining and advisory mission in bosnia in the esdp framework the eu police mission in bosnia currently comprises just over 150 international police personnel and its mandate was extende d and amended in late 2007 through 2009 the daytonmandated office of the high representative is double hatted as the eus special representative in bosnia and is expected eventually to evolve into an euonly office3 by assuming peacekeeping duties in bosnia eu members aimed to further develop esdp on an operational level as well as complement the broader eu integration strategy for bosnia by the december 2003 nato ministerial meetings some apparent differences between nato and the eu had been worked out and nato members reached consensus on the concept if not yet the details of followon eu military mission in bosnia fundamental principle agreed to early on was that any eu military mission in bosnia should fall within the socalled berlin plus framewo rk berlin plus refers to arrangements finalized in late 2002early 2003 on ins titutional and operational linkshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21774crs3 4 the eu initially planned to deploy an eu force to macedonia in 2002 but had

eus takeover of the small nato mission in macedonia natos allied harmony mission in macedonia was conc luded in march 2003 and replaced by the eus operation concordia small and limited mission of 350 troops that ended in december 20034 planning decisions and handover in 2004 conceptual details of the transition evolved as nato and eu planne rs worked to develop plans for mid2004 summit meetings early agreed concepts included formally concluding sfor and putting in place new and distinct eu mission in seamless transition the eu mission was to emphasize broader reform objectives in bosnia including closer association with the eu5 an issue of initially greater contention centered on the form and function of the residual nato headquarters presence which nato offi cials said would assist with defense reform functions such as training and interoperability exercises in conjunction with bosnias expected future membership in natos partnership for peace pfp as well as intelligence collection counterterrorism and apprehension of persons indicted for war crimes this proposed multifaceted set of tasks for the residual nato presence suggested to some more r obust operational capability than ju st an advisory or support presence some european officials reportedly resisted plans that could have led the nato presence to parallel functions of the eu force and emphasized the need for the eu to maintain full operational control of and autonomous d ecisionmaking authority over the military mission6 in the final arrangement eufor took over the primary military stabilization role while the nato headquart ers presence was to focus primarily on defense reform however bot h share some operational tasks many observers maintain that the unr esolved war criminals issue clouded the transition and the legacy of sfor especially with respect to former bosnian serb leader and wanted war crimes suspect radovan ka radzic despite numerous campaigns by sfor the ohr and local bosnian agencies to increase pressure on karadzic including detaining his close associates and sanctioning or dismi ssing his alleged supporters karadzic as well as former bosnian serb general ratko mladic continues to elude capture prior to the december 2004 handover the ited states appeared to send somewhat contradictory signals at times on the desired level of us engagement in the balkans on the one hand some us officials especia lly in the military expressed an interest in concluding the us military role in the balkans in view of greater or more pressing ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21774crs4 priorities in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere for them handing over operational security matters to the eu in bosnia re presented another opport unity in relatively secure environment in europe for global secur ity burdensharing the larger eu role is also seen to be consistent with us goal s for the western balkan region that include its eventual full integration into the eu on the other hand some us officials may have been initially wary of french and other european longterm aspirations to build up european military structures separate from nato and concerned that successful eu missions such as the one in bosnia could work to diminish natos primacy and possibly us influence on european secu rity matters another perspective has been that an ongoing us military presence has served as key stabilizing factor in bosnia and should not be eliminated entirely the transition from nato to the eu force incurred discernible political impact in bosnia during the eufor planning stage bosnian government officials accepted the concept of european followon force although they emphasized the need for continued nato and us presence bosnian officials often cite the critical role of us leadership in eventually bringing an end to the bosnian war in 1995 especially in the wake of failed peacekeeping missions com prised largely of european forces during the bosnian war after the handover about 200 us forces re mained in bosnia as part of the nato headquarters presence in camp butmir in sara jevo and at the us eagle base in tuzla on the basis of bilateral military agreement the residual us presence at both bases was involved in providing intelligence support engaging in efforts to detain war crimes suspects and working to deny safe havens for islamist extremists and their supporters in bosnia in 2006 the united states announced th withdrawal by the end of the year of its forces at eagle base small number of us intelligence officers continue to serve with the nato headquarters presence which remains under us command eufor implementation and outlook the december 2004 handover ceremony marked an important milestone both for bosnias future and for the eus aspirations to assume greater security responsibilities eufor is seen as an important preceden t for future potential mission handovers from nato to the eu for example possibly in kosovo although peacekeeping functions there remain with nato eu member s have sustained their support for contributing to safe and secure environment in bosnia even while the emphasis has shifted from large military presence to greater political engagement eufor has conducted veral exercises and operations aimed at collecting illegal weapons improving coordination with nato disrupting organized criminal activity and supporting demining programs eufor s worked closely with bosnian law enforcement agencies on combating organized crime including conducting joint anti crime operations and arrests small units of liaison and observation teams lot have been stationed to increase eufor visibility in local communities both eufor and the nato presence remain engaged in the pursuit of war crimes fugitives and in pressuring their support networks in clos cooperation with bosnian aut horities and the international war crimes tribunal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21774crs5 prior to its transition in 2007 eufor comprised some 6200 troops from twenty four eu member states and ten other countries with germany italy france and the united kingdom leading troop contributions the force was divided into three

to provide political guidance and strategic direction eu officials insist that eufor remains an effective military force capable of carrying out its enforcement mandate th roughout bosnia and of quickly adding reinforcements if necessary meanwhile th ongoing nato presence in bosnia serves to reinforce the transatlantic dimension and bosnias aspirations to join nato bosnias admittance into natos partnership for peace program in late 2006 marked the start of expanded engagement with nato outside of bosnia but within the region tensions may increase in conjunction with the anticipat ed resolution of kosovos disputed status in 2008 key dates in eufors history on april 26 2004 eu memb ers endorsed general concept for an euled mission in bosnia including military component of about
