surveillance court graphicav u display popup with the definition of ras as it is discussed tssinf ogc attorney the fisc recognizes the potential counterterrorism advantage gained through analysis of the br and prtt bulk metadata however because there is great deal of us person information included in the bulk metadata the fisc has set strict guidelines on when and how analysts can access the metadata under these authorities the ras standard is one of these guidelines which helps to provide reasonable assurance that only legitimate terrorismrelated identifiers are used to query the bulk metadata this standard must be met before queries can be conducted tssinf so what is ras ras is legal standard that describes the measure of proof required to support decision whether to permit an identifier to be queried from the bulk metadata the reasonable articulable suspicion standard requires just thata suspicion that you can explain in reasonable way it does not require certainty but is more concrete than simple hunch it may be easiest to think of it in terms of other standards with which you may be familiar tssinf many of you may be familiar with legal standards of proof applicable in other situations it may be helpful to understand how the ras standard compares to these other legal standards for example jury in criminal case will not convict an accused unless the evidence of guilt is beyond reasonable doubt this is the highest legal standard of proof jury in civil case such as personal injury case or contract dispute might award plaintiff money damages if the plaintiff proves the elements of his claim by preponderance of the evidence this standard is lower than beyond reasonable doubt lower still is the standard of proof required to justify issuance of search warrant probable cause whether that search warrant is for the suspects home or the content of the suspects communications the ras standard falls below probable cause top secretsinoforn page 4 of 17 top secretsinoforn tssinf the fisc has determined that this lower standard of proof is reasonable for the querying of metadata because communications metadata does not carry with it the same privacy protections as communications content the ras standard falls below probable cause but above mere hunch or guess top secretsinoforn page 5 of 17 top secretsinoforn datepreparer 11092010 sls topic u

and prtt orders ras is suspicion that an identifiershsanldesstelledhtnumber or other identifier type is associated with one of theflforeign powers named in br and prtt orders fisc requires that nsa base that suspicion on certain level of factual evidence and nsa must articulate those facts that connect the identifier with one of the named terrorist organizations the requirement that these facts be articulable effectively provides reasonable assurance that analyst queries of the metadata are based on substantive information meaning more than simple hunches or uninformed guesswork so in order to obtain ras approval for an identifier analysts must provide enough factual evidence that it would lead reasonable person to suspect that an identifier is associated with one of the named foreign powers in the br and prtt orders we will get more into the kinds of facts that may be used and how they can support ras nomination later in this module tssinf in summary based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life determinejifjherejisarasonable articulable suspicion that the identifier is associated with jnamed in the orders there must be at least one qualifying fact

is important to remember that copies of the documents such as court orders or reports are required as part of the nomination process the paper trail should enable an auditor from department of justice

security division attorneys who examine the factual support for our ras decision process they take look at any notes that the hmcs or someone within the nsa ogc may have included and they decide whether or not we have properly applied the ras standard to all of the identifiers that are used to query the bulk metadata so it is critical that we take great cargjhauflhout the process gathering

has legal lifespan of 180 days per the fisc but nsa ct has implemented guidance requiring review and reapproval every 90 days it is the analysts responsibility to monitor the sunset dates and take appropriate actions before the ras nomination expires tssinf hmc character any identifier can be resubmitted for revalidation at any time revalidations require proof of the same categories of information that was required for the original request revalidations should try to validate that the original evidence is still true by presenting any new documentation to demonstrate that the
