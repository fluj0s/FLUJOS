suspected of contributing to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for discussion of policy options and approaches see the related issue brief 92056 chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction current policy issues the issue of chinese proliferation involves three aspects chinas support for nonproliferation efforts chinas transfers that promote proliferation and vertical proliferation modernization of chinas wmd and missile programs since 1992 china has responded to us and other pressures to participate in some parts of international nonproliferation regimes china promised to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr which is not treaty but set of guidelines china also acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and signed the chemical weapons convention cwc however it is not member of the mtcr zangger committee nuclear suppliers group australia group or the wassenaar arrangement the pressures to join nonproliferation efforts that china faced in the early 1990s have weakened while its commitment to nonproliferation is unclear chinese missilerelated transfers have not violated any international treaties since the mtcr is not treaty but have violated chinese pledges and us laws in 1991 and 1993 the us government twice determined chinese violations of the mtcr guidelines and determined both cases to have involved transfers of category ii missile components for the m11 short range ballistic missile to pakistan the administration has not determined violations for chinese missilerelated sales to syria or iran since the 1987 sale of css2 intermediate range ballistic missiles to saudi arabia the executive branch has not determined that china supplied complete missiles to another country nevertheless concerns remain about chinese missile technology transfers although the npt does not ban peaceful nuclear projects certain chinese nuclear transfers to pakistan and iran may have violated the npt andor us laws in 1995 china reportedly sold unsafeguarded ring magnets to pakistan the clinton administration decided that us sanctions were not warranted chemical weaponrelated transfers would not violate any treaty since the cwc has not entered into force however they may defy us laws which may require sanctions transfers of biological agents for weapon programs would violate the biological weapons convention and us laws chinas acquisition of russian or other advanced technology or chinese development of new missiles and wmd would challenge efforts to stem their proliferation there are concerns about possible

destruction background and analysis introduction defining the problem policy issues for congress especially since 1991 congress has been particularly concerned about chinese transfers suspected of contributing to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd this proliferation problem refers to the threat of nuclear chemical or biological weapons and missiles that could deliver them chinese proliferation as policy issue concerns the administrations response including the enforcement of nonproliferation laws and possible legislation to reduce the danger us sanctions have been considered andor imposed in some cases while certain chinese transfers may not violate any international agreements they may violate us laws numerous laws set us policy and aim to enforce nonproliferation regimes with unilateral sanctions if there is determination of chinese violations the most important are the arms export control act aeca pl 90629 export administration act eaa pl 9672 and the exportimport bank act pl 79 173 see the appendix for the most relevant sections in addition to national security interests and implementation of us laws the problem of chinese proliferation has impacts on the bilateral relationship with china us policy toward taiwan us and multilateral export controls and high technology transfers to china international nonproliferation regimes and missile defense policy to assist congressional deliberations on this issue this report sets forth the background on and analysis of chinese transfers suspected of contributing to the proliferation of wmd for discussion of policy options and competing approaches see the related issue brief 92056 chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction current policy issues the following section will review how concerns about proliferation have intensified since 1991 why chinese transfers are particularly dangerous to us regional security interests in the middle east and south asia and define three aspects of the problem of chinese proliferation the report will then discuss chinese support for nonproliferation efforts as well as proliferation activities in detail chinas possible rationales and related policy constraints that affect its proliferation transfers will also be examined finally the last section will draw some lessons learned about crs2 chinese proliferation activities and chinas approach to nonproliferation also see the appendix for relevant sections of us laws proliferation threat president clinton has stated that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security foreign policy and economy of the united states1 cia director john deutch testified in february 1996 that free nations of the world are threatened by rogue states iran iraq north korea and libya that have built up significant military forces and seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological2 main concern is the risk of us or allied troops facing wmd on the battlefield the 1991 persian gulf war against iraq strongly demonstrated the danger posed by secret wmd programs only after the war did the world learn of iraqs wmd efforts despite safeguards and treaties many concluded it is essential to strengthen and expand nonproliferation regimes as one of five declared nuclearweapon powers and supplier of sensitive equipment and technology china has played critical role in supporting nonproliferation efforts as well as the proliferation of wmd and the missiles that could deliver them china especially since 1992 has responded to some extent to us and other pressures to make progress in joining some international nonproliferation efforts china has also maintained that it has not legally violated any international agreements yet there is evidence indicating that certain chinese technology transfers have violated chinas commitment undermined the nonproliferation regimes andor defied us laws heightened concerns throughout the 1980s chinese missile and nuclear technology exports including css2 intermediaterange missiles to saudi arabia silkworm antiship missiles to iran and nuclear technology to pakistan conflicted with us foreign policy goals chinese assurances regarding exports were vague and unsatisfactory but washington moderated its criticism of beijing in part due to chinas strategic importance in counterbalancing moscow several events however dramatically changed us perceptions the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown froze uschina relations and raised human rights as central issue the end of the cold war in 1991 reduced chinas strategic importance and provided openings for arguments favoring tougher us policy toward china on proliferation human rights and trade after the 1991 persian gulf war revelations about iraqs advanced missile chemical and nuclear weapons programs heightened worldwide concerns about the spread of wmd technology and 1 us congress house continuation of the national emergency with respect to weapons of mass destruction message from the president of the united states house document 104131 104th congress 1st session washington gpo 1995 2 us congress senate select committee on intelligence worldwide threats to us national security hearing february 22 1996 washington crs3 dualuse supplies disclosures in the early 1990s about chinese missile and nuclear technology transfers to countries such as algeria pakistan and iran also added impetus to international criticism of china in 1992 after the us imposed some sanctions and threatened others china signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and agreed to abide by the missile technology control regime in 1994 beijing reaffirmed the latter commitment in joint statement with washington and in 1996 issued another statement about selling only safeguarded nuclear technology nevertheless it is uncertain whether china is in full compliance with all of its commitments dangers of chinese transfers chinas transfers of technology are dangerous on several counts technology transfers advance the indigenous capabilities of recipients to manufacture their own missiles or wmd and potentially make sensitive sales to others china has pursued such sales in part because technology transfers or allowing scientists to work with customers do not necessarily violate international treaties china does not appear to recognize missiles as destabilizing and has been willing to supply missile technology if not entire missiles it is troubling that china has been willing to supply dualuse nuclear and chemical components with civilian and military applications to countries suspected of pursuing wmd programs iraq demonstrated that lot of commercially available technology can be applied to wmd programs and clandestine nuclear weapon programs can proceed despite iaea safeguards secrecy has shrouded many of chinas nuclear exports especially to iran and pakistan and its exports of missiles or related technology beijing is believed to be modernizing its wmd and has increasingly bought weapon systems from moscow there are concerns of possible retransfers of more advanced technology three aspects of the issue the issue of chinese proliferation involves three aspects chinas support for nonproliferation efforts chinas transfers that promote proliferation and vertical proliferation modernization of chinas wmd and missile programs first to what extent has china supported international nonproliferation efforts partly in response to us pressure including imposition of sanctions china has crs4 made progress since 1992 in playing role in nonproliferation regimes however there are still gaps in chinas participation in those efforts second how has china contributed to the proliferation danger the evidence is persuasive that china has contributed to the danger of the proliferation of wmd china reportedly has provided equipment and technology related to missiles andor nuclear chemical or biological weapons to pakistan iran syria saudi arabia and others third has china engaged in vertical proliferation modernizing its missile and wmd arsenals as opposed to the horizontal proliferation of weapons knowhow between states vertical proliferation is the creation of new weapon types by declared nuclear weapon state there are concerns about chinese modernization of its strategic missiles and nuclear weapons as well as maintenance of chemical and biological weapon programs support for nonproliferation efforts since 1992 china has responded to us and other pressures to make progress in participating in some parts of international nonproliferation regimes one us goal is to expand chinas participation to other key elements of the missile nuclear chemical and biological nonproliferation regimes3 chinas support is also important for regional nonproliferation efforts focusing on north korea the middle east and south asia table summarizes the extent of chinas participation in nonproliferation treaties or groups 3 regime is set of international treaties multilateral and bilateral agreements and domestic laws of participating countries for more information see crs report 95547f proliferation control regimes background and status us senate committee on governmental affairs nuclear proliferation factbook by the congressional research service december 1994 washington crs5 chinese participation in nonproliferation regimes missile technology control regime made unilateral pledge in february 1992 to observe the original guidelines on october 4 1994 reaffirmed this commitment in joint statement with the united states has not promised to adhere to revised guidelines not member or adherent for purposes of mtcr or us laws international atomic energy agency became member in 1984 nuclear nonproliferation treaty acceded on march 9 1992 zangger committee not member nuclear suppliers group not member comprehensive test ban treaty has supported negotiations but had raised objections regarding peaceful nuclear explosions and onsite inspections declared moratorium on nuclear testing on july 29 1996 chemical weapons convention signed on january 13 1993 but has not ratified australia group not member biological weapons convention acceded in 1984 wassenaar arrangement not member missile nonproliferation regime missile technology control regime in april 1987 canada france west germany italy japan the united kingdom and the united states established the missile technology control regime mtcr as set of guidelines to control the export of equipment and technology that could contribute to missile system capable of delivering nuclear weapons the mtcr guidelines cover missiles capable of delivering 500 kg 1100 lb warhead to 300 km 186 miles the mtcr is not treaty or executive agreement and has organization that monitors compliance like the international atomic energy agency states adhering to the mtcr have agreed to guidelines that call for restraint in exports of items and technologies listed in the mtcr equipment and technology annex category i of the annex covers crs6 complete missile systems major subsystems and related production facilities and equipment category ii lists usable components equipment material and technology the number of members or partners has expanded to 28 countries on january 7 1993 mtcr members issued new expanded guidelines to cover missiles capable of delivering all weapons of mass destruction nuclear as well as chemical and biological weapons the mtcr calls for strong presumption to deny transfers of category i items there is now also strong presumption to deny category ii items as well as any missiles judged to be intended for the delivery of any weapon of mass destruction without that judgment the mtcr calls for restraint in category ii transfers china is not an mtcr member one of chinas complaints has been that it was not invited to be one of the original members which established the guidelines some in policy circles have advocated that china become member in order to increase its commitment in november 1991 thensecretary of state james baker said that china agreed to adhere to the mtcr guidelines as part of an agreement to waive us sanctions on february 1 1992 the chinese foreign minister reportedly sent the pledge as requested in writing but that letter has never been made public on october 4 1994 as part of another agreement to waive second set of sanctions secretary of state christopher and chinese foreign minister qian qichen signed joint statement this time made public and issued by both sides that china will not export groundtoground missiles that are inherently capable of delivering at least 500 kg to at least 300 km4 there is binding commitment in the form of an international agreement between the united states and china concerning chinas adherence china has not agreed to the revised mtcr guidelines established in 1993 nuclear nonproliferation regime international atomic energy agency the iaea is affiliated with the united nations the agency verifies compliance with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and provides peaceful nuclear technology assistance to developing nations the iaea tries to verify that nuclear facilities and materials are not being diverted for nuclear weapon programs by implementing audits and onsite inspections or safeguards since 1991 iraqs and north koreas successes in circumventing iaea safeguards to pursue nuclear weapons programs have shown weaknesses in the safeguards system there have been calls for strengthening iaeas authority china has made nuclear nonproliferation pledges since 1984 while opposing the npt china applied for iaea membership in september 19835 and became member in 1984 at that time china made its first pledge not to contribute to nuclear proliferation in his address to the general conference of the iaea the chairman of the chinese delegation who was also the minister of nuclear industry 4 the chinese term of groundtoground missiles refers to surfacetosurface missiles 5 sweeney padraic china was admitted to the iaea tuesday nucleonics week october 13 1983 p 67 crs7 said that china will take discreet and responsible attitude so as to ensure that nuclear cooperation is solely for peaceful purposes he also said that china will in exporting its nuclear materials and equipment request the recipient countries to accept safeguards in line with the principles established in the agencys statutes6 nuclear nonproliferation treaty the npt entered into force in 1970 and currently has 182 signatories the treaty aims to freeze the number of nuclear weapon states at five united states soviet unionrussia great britain france and china these countries detonated nuclear devices before 1967 all other parties are to remain as nonnuclearweapon states in theory any nonnuclearweapon states perceived security need for nuclear weapons is mitigated by commitment by its rival nonnuclearweapon state not to acquire nuclear weapons to ensure compliance the npt requires that nonnuclearweapon states comply with iaea safeguards7 the npt does not prohibit peaceful nuclear projects for long time china in show of unity with the third world opposed the npt as discriminating against developing countries however when shunned by western countries after the june 1989 tiananmen crackdown and increasingly criticized about its nuclear exports in wake of the persian gulf war premier li peng announced on august 10 1991 that china has in principle agreed to sign the npt china acceded to the npt on march 9 1992 in its instrument of accession china stated that it pursues policy of not advocating encouraging or engaging in the proliferation of nuclear weapons nor helping other countries to develop nuclear weapons8 among the countries which have received chinese nuclear exports pakistan is not party to the npt and algeria was not party until january 1995 iran iraq and syria signed the npt in 1968 china is now bound by the treaty article i of the npt states that each nuclear weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly or indirectly and not in any way to assist encourage or induce any nonnuclearweapon state to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices article iii contains stipulation that each state party to the treaty undertakes not to provide source or special fissionable material or b equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing use or production of special fissionable material to any nonnuclear weapon state for peaceful purposes unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article 6 maclachlan ann china makes strong nonproliferation pledge in iaea conference address nucleonics week

of accession to nonproliferation treaty xinhua news agency march 11 1992 translated in fbischi march 16 1992 p 1 crs8 zangger committee china has not joined the zangger committee or nuclear exporters committee which has established guidelines for export control of nuclear items in article iii of the npt since the 1970s the committee has compiled trigger list or list of nuclear items which if transferred would trigger requirement for iaea safeguards this list helps to prevent diversion of nuclear materials and especially designed or prepared material equipment and facilities to programs making nuclear explosives the committee has legal authority nuclear suppliers group the nsg is voluntary multilateral effort to harmonize and strengthen the export controls of supplier countries on all including dualuse nuclear technology currently 31 members agree on common norms to augment iaea safeguards on fissile materials one gap in international efforts has been the absence of china in the nsg thus china does not join nsg members in requiring fullscope safeguards or iaea inspections of all other declared nuclear materials and facilities in addition to the facility importing supplies comprehensive test ban treaty china detonated its first nuclear weapon in october 1964 since then it has conducted at least 45 nuclear tests the latest chinese nuclear test took place on july 29 1996 on the same day china declared voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing starting on july 30 19969 the statement did not say how long this moratorium would last china was the last of the five nuclear powers to declare moratorium on nuclear testing chinas final nuclear test and announcement of moratorium took place during negotiations to conclude comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt which would ban nuclear testing globally china has participated in the ctbt negotiations and has called for the destruction of all atomic weapons by all states during negotiations at the conference on disarmament cd in geneva china had demanded that so called peaceful nuclear explosions be exempt isolated in this regard china on june 6 1996 withdrew this demand on august 1 1996 the chinese ambassador to the cd raised objections about onsite inspections he insisted that spies cannot be used to trigger inspections in another country china also wanted more than simple majority vote of governing panel to order onsite inspections in country suspected of violations instead china called for twothirds majority or 34 members the united states and china negotiated compromise whereby onsite inspections would be carried out if 30 of the 51 members agreed as part of the agreement china promised to support an effort to bypass indias objections by presenting the treaty text to the united nations general assembly in new york and to encourage pakistan to accept the treaty10 fissile material production on october 4 1994 along with the joint statement on the mtcr the united states and china issued joint statement

cwc would ban the development production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons cw by its signatories and require the destruction of all chemical weapons and production facilities the convention would also control the export of certain chemicals the cwc will come into force 180 days after 65 countries ratify it11 along with more than 120 countries china became signatory to the cwc on january 13 1993 signing for china foreign minister qian qichen said that china has consistently stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all chemical weapons at an early date and it has worked tirelessly along with other countries in making positive contributions to the signing of the convention12 china has not ratified the convention australia group began in 1985 the australia group is an informal gathering of 29 countries to coordinate export controls on chemicals that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons the australia group has international treaty nor organization it established list of chemicals and equipment that are controlled china is not member of this effort biological weapons convention concluded in 1972 the bwc bans the development production and stockpiling of biological agents or toxins which have justification for peaceful purposes the convention also prohibits the development manufacture and possession of biological weapons or delivery systems or the transfer of biological agents or toxins for other than peaceful purposes china acceded to the bwc in 1984 in 1991 at conference to review the implementation of the bwc chinas ambassador for disarmament affairs said that it is chinas consistent position to oppose the proliferation of biological weapons but at the same time we do not agree to any action aimed at restricting or hindering international cooperation and exchange in the peaceful uses of biotechnology13 11 us library of congress congressional research service chemical weapons convention issues for congress crs

regime intended to replace the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls cocom which controlled exports to soviet bloc countries during the cold war the new arrangement would control trade of items that could contribute to weapons proliferation in july 1996 31 countries agreed to implement the wassenaar arrangement china is not member of this group regional nonproliferation efforts chinas role in three key regional nonproliferation efforts will be discussed below there are others eg the southeast asian nuclear weapons free zone north korea clinton administration officials have remarked on the importance of chinas support for international efforts to stop the nuclear weapons program in north korea although specialists disagree as to how much influence beijing has over pyongyang china is thought to have some influence in part because of subsidized exports of food and oil to north korea china has opposed the use of sanctions against north korea but has supported talks to prevent nucleararmed north korea14 arms control in the middle east in 1991 china agreed to join in then president bushs initiative for arms control in the middle east acme or permanent five talks analysts believe that china agreed because it faced pressures to restrain worldwide arms sales after revelations of iraqs wmd programs and some us efforts to deny mostfavorednation mfn trade treatment the acme talks were to include bans on nuclear bomb materials and ballistic missiles in the middle east at the third meeting in may 1992 china refused to include missiles and missile technology in the guidelines on weapons of mass destruction then after president bushs decision announced on september 2 1992 to sell taiwan 150 f16 fighters china suspended its participation in the talks beijing complained that washington violated the usprc joint communique of august 17 1982 on reducing us arms sales to taiwan south asia in 1991 the united states proposed the five party proposal on regional security and nonproliferation in south asia china along with pakistan and russia accepted the proposal india has rejected the proposal and has objected that chinas nuclear forces would not be included in the talks china and india fought war in 1962 and have unresolved border issues 14 see also us library of congress congressional research service north koreas nuclear weapons program issue brief 91141 by larry niksch updated regularly washington crs11 white paper on arms control and disarmament on november 17 1995 china issued its first public defense white paper15 this initial effort at transparency was in part result of the normalization of military ties between china and the united states begun by secretary of defense perry in october 1994 in the white paper the chinese government formally reiterated past statements that it pursues policy of not supporting encouraging or engaging in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and not assisting any other country in the development of such weapons the white paper on arms control and disarmament also continued to say that at the same time china holds that preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons should not proceed without due regard for the just rights and interests of all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy china said that it holds that the safeguard regime of the international atomic energy agency iaea is an important component of the efforts to assure the effectiveness of the npt as for chemical and biological weapons china stated that it does not produce or possess chemical weapons since acceding to the bwc in 1984 china has fully and conscientiously fulfilled its obligations under the convention significantly the white paper did not specifically mention missiles or missile related technology although such items may have been included as military equipment and technology while chinas participation in the iaea npt cwc and bwc were discussed the white paper did not mention chinas policy of adherence to the mtcr chinese policy implementation chinas implementation of its nonproliferation policy is affected in part by beijings rationales for militaryrelated exports any constraints on effective export controls as well as military modernization programs chinese policy implementation has implications for us efforts to restrain dangerous sales rationales china likely has significant rationales for its armsrelated exports several countries that were denied western sales turned to china as supplier of sensitive technology this position likely has provided greater chinese strategic political influence in the middle east and south asia it may also have served beijings policy goals of asserting independent clout and checking us influence on domestic and international policies china has claimed that its sales improve the regional balance of power in south asia and the middle east also some of the recipients 15 information office of the state council of the peoples republic of china china arms control and disarmament november 1995 beijing crs12 of chinese technology may have shared with china advanced technology acquired from the us russia or other countries beijing also has interests in middle eastern oil supplies to fuel its rapid industrialization and limiting any islamic support for ethnic separatists in northwestern china in addition china has expanded its missile and nuclear related sales to earn foreign exchange the huge profits not only have contributed to the chinese goal of defense modernization but also boosted the personal wealth of arms merchants many of whom are related to the top leaders in short in addition to national defense intelligence secret acquisition of technology and foreign policy interests chinese military export policy also reflects the personal interests of the highlevel cadres who oversee arms sales companies export controls some have argued that there are constraints on chinas implementation of effective export controls not all officials in beijing particularly military leaders share western nonproliferation concerns for example china at times has refuted that missiles are more destabilizing than aircraft in addition some analysts believe that chinese arms sales are controlled by certain influential military officials with important family connections to top leaders they do not have to answer to the foreign ministry which primarily negotiates with washington16 some have asserted that decentralization of the chinese economy in general and the defense industry in particular in the name of profits has hampered government export controls strengthening chinese exports controls will require development of the rule of law others argue however that the absence of toplevel approval for arms exports may be true only in cases of less sensitive transfers because of the potential impact on uschina relations and chinese compliance with international agreements the chinese government would exercise restraints over the more questionable exports moreover chinas president jiang zemin is also the chairman of the central military commission which commands the military some observers point out that with private defense firms in china only the military has access to sensitive weapon systems and technology those arguing this view also note that the government has been able to crack down on political criminal economic religious or separatist activities when so desired the white paper on arms control and disarmament contained section called strict control over the transfer of sensitive materials and military equipment on nuclear exports it stated that only specialized governmentdesignated companies can handle nuclear exports and in each instance they must apply for approval from relevant governmental departments all exports of nuclear materials and equipment will be subject to iaea safeguards the white paper also stated that china strictly controls transfers of military equipment and related technologies and has established an appropriate administrative 16 lewis john w hua di and xue litai beijings defense establishment international security spring 1991 crs13 organization and operating mechanism to achieve this goal the state administrative committee on military products trade sacmpt under the leadership of the state council and the central military commission is responsible for the centralized control of transfers of military equipment and related technologies officials from the ministry of foreign affairs the militarys general staff department the commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation mofert and other departments comprise the sacmpt furthermore the white paper declared contracts for transfer of military equipment and technologies require approval before gaining effect major transfer items and contracts must be examined by the sacmpt and approved by the state council and the central military commission missile related transfers despite export controls chinese exports of missile technology and knowhow including complete intermediaterange ballistic missiles have raised concerns in washington and other capitals such transfers have not violated any international treaties since the mtcr is not treaty but have violated chinese pledges and us laws in 1991 and 1993 the us government twice determined chinese violations of the mtcr guidelines and both cases were determined to have involved transfers of category ii missile components for the m11 short range ballistic missile to pakistan not complete m11 missiles there have been determinations of violations for chinese missilerelated sales to syria or iran since the 1987 sale of css2 intermediate range ballistic missiles to saudi arabia china has not been determined to sell complete missiles of any range to another country ballistic missiles are considered destabilizing weapons primarily if they can deliver wmd all potential target countries lack reliable defenses against missiles whereas many countries have defenses against aircraft therefore they may consider launching preemptive strikes against enemy missiles or may seek their own deterrent missiles and unconventional warheads there is also concern about chinese retransfers of advanced russian and ukrainian missile technology according to space news november 17 1993 russia and ukraine sold china rd170 engines used on the zenit space launcher in 1991 and russia also reportedly sold china electronic equipment that could be used to improve missile accuracy the chinese have also reportedly purchased the russian s300 missile defense system on february 24 1993 thencia director james woolsey testified that china continues to obtain missile technology from russia and ukraine china could in turn pass more advanced russian or ukrainianderived technology to other states as beijing has done previously with its own technology17 17 us congress senate committee on governmental affairs proliferation threats of the 1990s hearing 103208 103rd congress 1st session february 24 1993 washington gpo 1993 p 11 crs14 exports of css2 irbms to saudi arabia in 1987 during the iraniraq war china secretly sold an estimated 36 css2 intermediaterange ballistic missiles irbm to saudi arabia for about 335 billion the saudis reportedly approached china for missiles after the reagan administration could not persuade congress to lift the limit of 60 f15 fighters that could be sold to saudi arabia riyadh said it acquired the missiles to deter against possible missile attacks from tehran18 the missiles are named df3 by the chinese df for dong feng or east wind and designated css2 by the united states css for chinese surfaceto surface according to janes strategic weapon systems the css2 irbm is singlestage missile using storable liquid fuel first deployed by the chinese in 1971 it has range between 2500 and 3000 km 15531863 miles depending on the weight of the warhead while the chinese designed the css2 missiles to carry nuclear warheads saudi prince bandar saudi ambassador to washington who secretly negotiated the deal in beijing assured the united states that the chinese had modified the missile to carry large conventional warhead the chinese issued similar assurances thenforeign minister wu xueqian on april 6 1988 said that china sold some nonnuclear conventional surfacetosurface missiles to saudi arabia and that the saudi government made

chinese premier li peng and pakistans prime minister reportedly had agreed on the sale in november 1989 the general manager of the china national nuclear corporation signed the contract li peng attended the signing ceremony and said that the deal is totally for peaceful purposes85 pakistan has refused iaea safeguards on its nuclear fuel cycle program but requested iaea safeguards for the chinese reactor nevertheless the sale raises concerns in part because china unlike other suppliers does not require fullscope safeguards iaea inspections of all declared nuclear facilities of the recipient country moreover many fear that the cooperation provides cover for pakistans weapon program germany and france had declined to sell pakistan reactor despite the western ban on supplies chinese officials claimed construction would be completed in about seven years work reportedly started on august 1 1993 by june 1996 chinese media reported that 310megawatt nuclear power

first disclosed intelligence reports that the china national nuclear corporation transferred to the aq khan research laboratory in kahuta pakistan 5000 ring magnets suspected for use in enriching uranium in gas centrifuges according to the report intelligence experts believe that the magnets provided to pakistan are to be used in special suspension bearings at the top of rotating cylinder in

chinese vice foreign minister li zhaoxing did not deny the sale but argued that it was peaceful nuclear cooperation89 at the end of february 1996 secretary of state christopher instructed the exportimport bank to suspend financing for commercial deals in china for one month secretary christopher reportedly required time to try to obtain more information to make determination of whether sanctions would be required cia director john deutch reportedly said at white house meeting that chinese officials at some level likely approved the sale of magnets this view was said to have been supported by defense secretary perry but opposed by officials from the commerce and treasury departments and the us trade representative office who cited lack of solid proof90 observers note that the latter departments have an interest in promoting trade with china the china national nuclear corporation is under the direct control of the state council which is headed by premier li peng91 by midapril 1996 the clinton administration indicated that china and pakistan would not be sanctioned severely the administration notified congress about the delivery to pakistan of us military equipment sold in the 1980s and the exportimport bank approved loan guarantee for sale of boeing planes to china92 some in congress charged that the administration knew of the magnet sale when the brown amendment was legislated to allow the equipment to be delivered despite the pressler amendment secretary christopher met with foreign minister qian qichen on april 19 1996 in the hague and held very extensive discussion on the magnet sale but did not resolve the issue one dilemma for secretary christopher was the simultaneous need to secure chinese support for us and south korean proposal to hold

said that china promised to provide future assistance only to safeguarded nuclear facilities reaffirmed commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and agreed to consultations on export control and proliferation issues the administration also said that chinese leaders insisted they were not aware of the magnet transfer and that there is evidence that the chinese government had willfully aided or abetted pakistans nuclear weapon program through the magnet transfer therefore the state department announced that sanctions were not warranted and exportimport bank considerations of loans for us exporters to china were returned to normal94 chinas foreign ministry spokesman made statement on may 11 1996 that china will not provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities there was reference to future sales of ring magnets nor sales of sensitive nuclear technology to countries with suspected nuclear weapon programs administration officials reportedly said that china had rejected repeated us requests to publicly make the broader pledges95 in any case china since 1984 has declared that it does not engage in nuclear proliferation and asks countries receiving its transfers to

iranian sites with the chinese calutron and reactor and found proof there at the time that any iranian nuclear activity violated peaceful principles the team found that the chinesesupplied calutron is

not have the expertise and technology to build the reactors china and iran reportedly have disagreed over technical designs financial terms and sites for the reactors some chinese officials may have argued that obtaining us and other cooperation for chinas own troubled nuclear reactors was more important106 according to the clinton administration the chinese foreign minister reportedly told

disclosed chinese construction of nuclear reactor in algeria as part of weapons program generating greater concerns about covert nuclear technology transfers to the middle east112 us intelligence reported that the reactor under construction could be used to produce nuclear bomb fuel some intelligence estimates of the size of the cooling towers suggested possible upgraded power level as great as 60 megawatts113 intelligence experts were also suspicious because the reactor was believed to be larger than required for nuclear research there were electrical power generation facilities surfacetoair missile battery was nearby and the facility was located at remote site ain oussera in the sahara desert114 algeria said april 30 1991 that the reactor would only generate electrical power and produce radioactive isotopes for medical research would be fueled by lowenriched uranium and would have maximum thermal output of 15 megawatts china initially did not acknowledge its nuclear assistance for algeria on april 13 1991 the chinese foreign ministry denied the washington times report without reference to nuclear reactor then on april 30 1991 the chinese issued revised response

involvement in shipping sensitive chemicals first the yinhe incident began in july 1993 when the clinton administration sought to prevent chinese cargo ship called the yinhe from reaching iran the administration believed that the ship was carrying chemicals that could be used for mustard gas and nerve gas specifically thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride one unusual factor in this case was that it was chinese media which disclosed the issue along with extensive details123 china did not agree to allow us representatives to participate in saudi inspection of the ships cargo until august 26 1993124 before the completion of the inspection china acted prematurely to declare that chemicals were found125 after the inspection the state department said that the suspected chemicals were not found aboard the ship there are several theories for what happened first us intelligence was wrong and sensitive chemicals were ever on the yinhe second the chemicals were removed from the yinhe before it docked for the inspection third plans for shipping the chemicals were aborted when the chinese realized the united states had been alerted and beijing allowed the yinhe to continue in order to embarrass washington fourth the incident was set up to discredit us intelligence on this and other proliferation questions in the second recent case german ship the asian senator was inspected in january 1994 in saudi arabia and found to have illegal chemicals for chemical weapons onboard the cargo ship had left china for the middle east the clinton administration said that the chinese

highly probable that china has not eliminated its bw program134 in the discussion of compliance with the bwc in 1995 acda stated that there are strong indications that china probably maintains its

us policy can be drawn from an examination of chinas proliferation activities and approach to nonproliferation issues since 1991 there are cases where china reportedly violated both the letter and spirit of its commitments on nonproliferation international treaties and guidelines china may have violated the npt and the bwc while china has strengthened its assurances to abide by the mtcr there is reported evidence that china breached those voluntary guidelines even if they do not violate any treaties transfers of technology can be more dangerous than transfers of complete weapon systems technology transfers improve the indigenous capabilities of chinas customers to manufacture missiles or wmd on their own beijing faces the challenge of both upholding obligations in international nonproliferation regimes and selling weapon technology the government and premier li peng in particular has been involved in foreign nuclear cooperation contracts companies selling missile technology are governmentowned defense industrial entities among the various issues in uschina relations proliferation is one which china has been willing to negotiate and move toward common international goals given conducive overall relations in 1992 china started to join international nonproliferation efforts likely because of several pressures first beijing was ostracized after the june 1989 tiananmen square crackdown second it faced immense pressure in light of alarming disclosures after the gulf war about iraqs wmd programs third there was real trepidation that mfn status would be revoked fourth the june 1991 sanctions had been imposed and waivers had yet been granted as nuclear weapon power with strategic missile force china had very little to lose and much to gain from acceding to the npt promising to adhere to the mtcr or signing the cwc china has been able to continue its missile and nuclear modernization programs china understands its commitments although some have asserted that china may not have understood the international treaties and guidelines chinese officials have made statements confirming that they do have firm grasp of chinas obligations with such understanding china has not held the mtcr guidelines with the same level of commitment as it does international treaties crs39 like the npt or cwc premier li peng personally committed china to the npt but avoided involvement on the mtcr china does not always shared western nonproliferation concerns china has claimed that aircraft are just as destabilizing as missiles and has not voiced the same western concerns about proliferation of missiles in some cases china has argued that if sales improve the balance of power then there is greater stability china has increasingly linked nonproliferation issues to us arms sales to taiwan then president bushs september 2 1992 decision to sell taiwan 150 f16ab fighters has complicated the sinous dialogue on nonproliferation some analysts believe the chinese even increased proliferation activities in retaliation for the f16 sale aspiring to be global leader china has retreated from positions where it was isolated on an important international issue it generally has preferred to advance an image as responsible world leader the pressures to join international nonproliferation efforts that china faced in the early 1990s have weakened while its commitment to nonproliferation is unclear china has made progress in breaking out of relative isolation and committing to major international agreements and guidelines china has not been reported to have supplied critical nuclear weapon knowhow since giving pakistan nuclear bomb design in the 1980s there has been determination that china transferred complete missiles which exceed mtcr guidelines since the 1987 sale of css2 irbms to saudi arabia or since china first promised to abide by the mtcr in 1992 nevertheless aside from compliance issues there are policy concerns china has not expanded its international commitments to join some significant but informal nonproliferation groups such as the nsg there are reports that china continues to sell sensitive missile nuclear chemical or biological technology and maintains banned weapon programs the prospects for greater chinese cooperation might improve if china realized the benefits of nonproliferation for its interests and us efforts were augmented by multilateral pressures on china such pressures on china to participate fully in strengthening nonproliferation regimes could capitalize on chinas desire to be treated as great power and perceived as responsible world leader what us policy approach should be pursued to promote greater chinese cooperation with nonproliferation regimes and improved compliance what are us
