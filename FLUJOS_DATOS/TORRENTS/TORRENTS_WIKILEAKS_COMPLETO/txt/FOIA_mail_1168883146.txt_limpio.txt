from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re egu date mon 15 jan 2007 124546 0500 replyto mannpsuedu cc raymond s bradley rbradleygeoumassedu thanks phil not suggestion you not cite wegman report just suggesting you make sure the citation makes clear what the report is mike ps wherewhen did tom crowley use it phil jones wrote mike thanks on 1 putting the last few years in zooms the cet curve much higher tim took out the last few years i need to make this clearer in the caption padding is an issue with 50year smoother 2 i agree wegman isnt formal publication this was the highest profile example i could come up to show abuse of the curve if you know of any others then let know even tom crowley shouldnt have used it there is belief in the uk that curve of ukcet past temperatures by summer and winter exists it doesnt but the winter curve from lamb is probably lot better than the summer one ill let you know on timeframe when i hear from few more ive sent the piece to cheers phil at 1410 15012007 michael mann wrote phil the attached piece is very good impressive in the detail youve been able to dig up on this wont pass this along couple minor comments 1 i understand the point of the 50 year smoothing but i think it would still be very useful to show were the most recent decade is on this scale lot of the recent warming is washed out by the padding at the end people will look at this and say see medieval peak was warmer than present but that doesnt follow because so much of the warmning has been over past two decades 2 i would not reference wegman report as if it is publication ie legitimate piece of scientific literature its piece of something else it should be cited in such way as to indicate it is not formal publication wasnt peerreviewed ie could be references as criticism commissoned by joe barton r exxon 3 i think that stefangavin were hoping to do something on rc sooner than the timeline you mention what do you think about this do you want to forward the message to them and tell them the timeline you have in mind talk to you later mike ps thanks very much for the nomination but you flatter i think that someone farther along in their career such as keith is more deserving at this time phil jones wrote ray i have been nominating you for several years as has andre and jean i think not sure how much the last two have been involved recently i havent been for few years so congratulations if as in previous years you get asked about future awards then consider nominating keith andor mike in the past it has alternated between ice cores and others as for presentation something on the lines of where we stand etc will be great gerard seems to be very flexible with the date for cl28 ive idea how many abstracts there are yet havent done anything on publicity for the session later in the week ill check how many we have so suggest the session day you want avoid friday people leave also bit on thursday tuesday and weds tend to have the most people there ill likely put you first in session not the early morning but after coffee or lunch ill liaise with gerard i have to organize everything by next monday as im at the ipcc in paris from jan 23 till feb 2 can you two give your thoughts on the attached i think this is best in the wengen meeting summary certainly after ipcc has met and likely after june when the chapters come out dont pass on to anyone an dont use in vienna cheers phil ps are you two getting loads of press cuttings from mike schlesinger at 1825 13012007 michael mann wrote ray i hadnt heard the announcement this is wonderful news you like phil couldnt be more deserving for this im sorry that i wont be there egu comes at bad time of the penn state semester i owe you drink when next we meet congratulations again mike raymond s bradley wrote i was totally surprised to learn i was selected for the egus oeschger medal this yearso if you had anything to do with that many many thanks i knew hans quite well and so this is especially meaningful for phil got the first oeschger medal so i know i am following in his big shoes but i cant help feeling its all clerical error somehow and correction letter will appear any day now but assuming this is not soi was asked to give talk aimed at nonspecialist audience in one of the sessions i think your session on the last millennium is the obvious session in which to do this so i will prepare something along the lines of climate of the last millennium status and prospect so i can briefly summarise where we are at and what seems to be needed ill submit an abstract online this weekend ray raymond s bradley university distinguished professor director climate system research center department of geosciences university of massachusetts
