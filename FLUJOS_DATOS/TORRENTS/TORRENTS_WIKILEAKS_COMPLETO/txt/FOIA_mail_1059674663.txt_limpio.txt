from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject reconstruction errors date thu jul 31 140423 2003 hi mike weve recently been making plans with simon tett at the hadley centre for comparing model simulations with various climate reconstructions including the mbh98 and mbh99 northern hemisphere temperatures i was stressing the importance of including uncertainty estimates in the comparison and that the error estimates should depend on the timescale eg smoothing filter or running mean that had been applied i then looked at the file that i have been using for the uncertainties associated with mbh99 see attachment which i must have got from you some time ago column 1 is year 2 is the raw standard error 3 is 2se but what are columns 4 and 5 ive been plotting column 4 labelled 1 sig lowf when plotted your smoothed reconstruction assuming that this is the error appropriate to lowpass filtered data id also assumed that the last column 1 sig highf was appropriate to highpass filtered data i also noticed that the sum of the squared high and low errors equalled the square of the raw error which is nice but ive realised that i dont understand how you estimate these errors nor what time scale the lowf and highf cutoff uses maybe 40year smoothed as in the ipcc plots from mbh99 it sounds like post1600 you assume uncorrelated gaussian calibration residuals in which case you would expect the errors for 40year mean to be reduced by sqrt40 this doesnt seem to match the values in the attached file pre1600 you take into account that the residuals are autocorrelated red noise rather than white so presumably the reduction is less than sqrt40 but some factor how do you compute this the reason for my questions is that i would like to 1 check whether ive been doing the right thing in using column 4 of the attached file with your smoothed reconstruction and 2 id like to estimate the errors for range of time scales so i can compare decadal means 30year means 50year means etc thanks in advance for any help you can give here tim
