requesting that the department of justice provide document to the house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsci that describes the bulk collection program conducted under section 215 the business records provision of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa we agree that it is important that all members of congress have access to information about this program as well as similar bulk collection program conducted under the pen registertrap and trace authority of fisa when considering reauthorization of the expiring usa patriot act provisions ffs7 the department has therefore worked with the intelligence community to prepare the enclosed document that describes these two bulk collection programs the authorities under which they operate the restrictions imposed by the foreign intelligence surveillance court the national security agencys record of compliance and the importance of these programs to the national security of the united states we believe that making this document available to all members of congress is an effective way to inform the legislative debate about reauthorization of section 215 and any changes to the fisa pen registertrap and trace authority however as you know it is critical that members understand the importance to national security of maintaining the secrecy of these programs and that the hpscis plan to make the document available to other members is subject to strict rules tof ectjicojjfintnojiorn top secrethcomintnnoforn tgtherefore the enclosed document is being provided on the understanding that it will be provided only to members of congress and cleared hpsci judiciary committee and leadership staff in secure location in the hpscis offices for limited time period to be agreed upon and consistent with the rules of the hpsci regarding review of classified information and nondisclosure agreements photocopies may be made of the document and any notes taken by members may not be removed from the secure location we further understand that hpsci staff will be present at all times when the document is being reviewed and that executive branch officials will be available nearby during certain preestablished times to answer questions should they arise we also request your support in ensuring that the members are well informed regarding the importance of this classified and extremely sensitive information to prevent any unauthorized disclosures resulting from this process we intend to provide the same document to the senate select committee on intelligence ssci under similar conditions so that it may be made available to the members of the senate as well as cleared leadership ssci and senate judiciary committee staff u thank you again for your letter and we look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff as congress continues its deliberations on reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the usa patriot act sincerely ronald weich assistant attorney general fop secret101hnthnoforn 2 fofl secrbffcomllqtffhoforn tshsinf report on the national security agencys bulk collection programs affected by usa patiuot act reauthorization u the information contained in this report describes some of the most sensitive foreign intelligence collection programs conducted by the united states government this information is highly classified and only limited number of executive branch officials have access to it publicly disclosing any of this information would be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to our nations intelligence capabilities and to national security therefore it is imperative that all who have access to this document abide by their obligation not to disclose this information to any person unauthorized to receive it key points tslsif provisions of the usa patriot act affected by reauthorization legislation support two sensitive intelligence collection programs tshsiinjf rhese programs are authorized to collect in bulk certain dialing routing addressing and signaling information about telephone calls and electronic communications such as the telephone numbers or email addresses that were communicating and the times and dates but not the content of the calls or email messages themselves tshsihif although the programs collect large amount of information the vast majority of that information is never reviewed by anyone in the govelluilent because the information is not responsive to the limited queries that arc authorized for intelligence purposes tshsllf the programs are subject to an extensive regime of internal checks particularly for us persons and are monitored by the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisa court and congress tsisihnf the executive branch including doj odni and nsa takes any compliance problems in the and substantial has been those tssif nsas bulk collection programs provide important tools in the fight against terrorism especially in identifying terrorist plots against the homeland these tools are also unique in that they can produce intelligence not otherwise available to nsa top secrettcomintjoforj top secrethcomrhhnofor1 background ts1w since the tragedy of 911 the intelligence community has developed an array of capabilitie s to detect identify and disrupt terrorist plots against the united states and its interests detecting threats by exploiting terrorist communications has been and continues to be one of the critical tools in that effort above all else it is imperative that we have capability to rapidly identify any terrorist threats emanating from within the united states tshsinf prior to the attacks of911 the national security agency nsa intercepted and transcribed seven calls from hijacker khalid almihdhar to facility associated with anal qaida safehouse in yemen however nsas access point overseas did not provide the technical data indicating the location from where almihdhar was calling lacking the originating phone number nsa analysts concluded that almihdhar was overseas in fact mihdhar was calling from san diego california according to the 911 commission report pages 269272 investigations or interrogation of them khalid almihdhar etc and investigation of their travel and financial activities could have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 911 plot the simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan in any case the opportunity did not arise ts1silwf today under foreign intelligence surveillance court authorization pursuant to the business records authority of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa commonly referred to as section 215 the government has developed program to close the gap that allowed almihdhar to plot undetected within the united states while communicat ing with known terrorism target overseas this and similar programs operated pursuant to fisa provide valuable intelligence information u usa patriot act reauthorization legislation currently pending in both the house and the senate would alter among other things language in two parts of fisa section 215 and the fisa pen registertrap and trace or pentrap authority absent legislation section 215 will expire on december 31 2009 along with the socalled lone wolf provision and roving wiretaps which this document does not address the fisa pentrap authority does not expire but the pending legislation in the senate and house includes amendments of this provision t1syh4 the section 215 and pentrap authorities are used by the us government in selected cases to acquire significant foreign intelligence information that cannot otherwise be acquired either at all or on timely basis any us person information that is acquired is subject to strict courtimposed restrictions on the retention use and dissemination of such information and is also subject to strict and frequent audit and reporting requirements tshsifnf the largest and most significant uses of these authorities are to support two critical and highly sensitive intelligence collection programs under which nsa collects data obtained 2 top secretncomllhhtoporn top secrethcomintnoforn the intelligence and judiciary committees it is important that other members of congress have access to information about these two programs when considering reauthorization of the expiring patriot act provisions the executive branch views it as essential that an appropriate statutory basis remains in place for nsa to conduct these two programs section 215 and pentrap collection tshsihnf under the program based on section 215 nsa is authorized to collect from telecommunications service providers certain business records that contain information about communications between two telephone numbers such as the date time and duration of call there is collection of the content of any telephone call under this program and under longstanding supreme court precedent the information collected is not protected by the fourth amendment in this program are served telecommunications on above relating to substantially all of the telephone calls handled by the companies including both calls made between the united states and foreign country and calls made entirely within the united states tshsiinf under the program based on the pentrap provisions in fisa the government is authorized to collect similar kinds of information about electronic communications such as to and from lines in email and the time an email is sent excluding the content of the email and the subject line again this information is collected pursuant to court orders generally 90 under relevant court decisions is not the fourth 3 top secrethcominthnoforn top segretcomhhnoforn checks and balances fisa court oversight tsfsijf to conduct these bulk collection programs the government has obtained orders from several different fisa court judges based on legal standards set forth in section 215 and the fisa pentrap provision before obtaining any information from telecommunication service provider the government must establish and the fisa court must conclude that the information is relevant to an authorized investigation in addition the government must comply with detailed minimization procedures required by the fisa court that govern the retention and dissemination of the information obtained before an nsa analyst may query bulk records they must have reasonable articulable are on long the collected data can be retained 5 years in the section 215 program and 4yi years in the pentrap program congressional oversight u these programs have been briefed to the intelligence and judiciary committees to include hearings briefings and with respect to the intelligence committees visits to nsa in addition the intelligence committees have been fully briefed on the compliance issues discussed below compliance issues tsitsirf there have been number of technical compliance problems and human implementation errors in these two bulk collection programs discovered as result of department of justice reviews and internal nsa oversight however neither the department nsa nor the fisa court has found any intentional or badfaith violations the problems generally involved the implementation of highly sophisticated technology in complex and ever changing communications environment which in some instances resulted in the automated tools operating in manner that was not completely consistent with the specific terms of the courts orders in accordance with the courts rules upon discovery these inconsistencies were reported as compliance incidents to the fisa court which ordered appropriate remedial action the incidents and the courts responses were also reported to the intelligence committees in great detail the committees the court and the executive branch have responded actively to the incidents the court has imposed additional safeguards in response to compliance problems the director ofnsa also ordered endtoend reviews of the section 215 and pen trap collection programs and created new position the director of compliance to help ensure the integrity of future collection in early september of2009 the director ofnsa made presentation to the fisa court about the steps taken to address the compliance issues all 4 top secretcomuhinoforl top 8ecrethcominthnofor1 parties will continue to report to the fisa court and to congress on compliance issues as they arise and to address them effectively intelligence value of the collection t8hsilinf as noted these two collection programs significantly strengthen the intelligence communitys early warning system for the detection of terrorists and discovery of plots against the homeland they allow the intelligence community to detect phone numbers and email addresses within the united states contacting targeted phone numbers and email addresses associated with suspected foreign terrorists abroad and viceversa and connections between entities within the united states tied to suspected foreign terrorist abroad nsa needs access to telephony and email transactional information in bulk so that it can quickly identify the network of contacts that targeted number or address is connected whenever there is ras that the number or address is associated with tsiiith to maximize the operational utility of the data the data cannot be collected prospectively once lead is developed because important connections could be lost in data that was sent prior to the identification of the ras phone number or email address nsa identifies the network of contacts by applying sophisticated analysis to the massive volume ofmetadata communications metadata is the dialing routing addressing or signaling information associated with an electronic communication but not content the more metadata nsa has access to the more likely it is that nsa can identify or discover the network of contacts linked to targeted numbers or addresses information discovered through nsas analysis of the metadata is then provided to the appropriate federal national security agencies including the fbi which are responsible for further investigation or analysis of any potential terrorist threat to the united states tsifsiittf in conclusion the section 215 and pentrap bulk collection programs provide vital capability to the intelligence community the attacks of911 taught us that applying lead information from foreign intelligence in comprehensive and systemic fashion is required to protect the homeland and the programs discussed in this paper cover critical seam in our defense against terrorism recognizing that the programs have implications for the privacy interests of us person data extensive policies safeguards and reviews have been enacted by the fisa court doj odni and nsa 5 top secrbticomihitioforn
