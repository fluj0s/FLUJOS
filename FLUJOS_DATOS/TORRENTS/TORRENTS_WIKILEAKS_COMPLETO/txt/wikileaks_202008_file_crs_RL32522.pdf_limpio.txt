the commission is often focused on the last war and not future one and suggest that the commi ssion consciously avoids tackling some of the more complex yet pressing issues for example the commission as its first recommendation stresses the need for id entifying and prioritizing terrorist sanctuaries with focus on failed states some assert however that terrorists are increasingly returning to their politically stable home countries for sanctuary where they blend into local communities where th eir training camps are in civilian housing complexes and where their bomb factories are in

httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html 3 note that in contrast to the 911 co mmissions recommendations the national strategy does not deal with the issue of government or ganizational structure to combat terrorism us antiterror strategy and the 911 commission report introduction central to global strategy for combating terrorism is defining the threat and understanding who the enemy is terrorism as generic concept is too vague and amorphous to design strategy against moreover terrorism t hough often perceived as threat is perhaps better characterized as tactic or process an important point made by the 911 commission is that the strategic threat faced by the united states and its allies is from an enemy consistin g of certain groups and with specific ideology and with stated objectives in the words of the commission the enemy goes beyond qaeda to include the radical ideological movement inspired in part by qaeda that has spawned other terro rist groups and violence thus our strategy must match our means to two ends dism antling the qaeda network and in the long term prevailing over the ideology that contributes to islamist terrorism1 comprehensive national antiterror strategy must address many issues included are the appropriate roles for military force law enforcement intelligence diplomacy economic development educa tion promotion of social and political equality and nation and institution building within the context of policies promoting national security tactically in the short term how does one employ the wide portfolio of tools available to policymakers to reduce pressing and immediate threats strategically in the long term how does one win hearts and minds in addition strategy ideally attracts allies how does one both maximize international buyin and nationa l effectiveness the national strategy for combating terrorism addresses these issues2 the recommendations of the 911 commission as th ey relate to strategy content and implementation appear cons istent with and supportive of the national strategy3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32522crs2 4 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html 5 the outermost ring consists of

httpwwwwhitehousegovhomelandbooknat_strat_hlspdfnational strategy for combating terrorism framework on february 14 2003 the white house released the national strategy for combating terrorism 30pa ge interagency document4 the intent of the strategy is to stop terrorist attacks against the united states its citizens its interests and us friends and allies around the world as well as to create an international environment inhospitable to terrorists and their supporters the strategy emphasizes that all inst ruments of us power diplomatic economic law enforcement financial in formation dissemination intelligence and military are to be called upon in combatin g international terrorism the strategy fits into the wider strategic concept of defenseindepth which projects four concentric rings of defense against terro rist attacks against the united states5 the national strategy for combating terrorism is designed to complement other elements of the national security strategy6 including substrategies for homeland security weapons of mass destru ction cyberspace cr itical infrastructure protection and drug control while the national strategy for homeland security7 focuses on preventing terrorist attacks within the united states the national strategy for combating terrorism focuses on identif ying and defusing threats before they reach us borders incorporated in the national strategy for combating terrorism is strong preemptive component st rong focus on reducing proliferation of weapons of mass destru ction and defenseindepth framework while preemption and military force remain important com ponents the strategy recognizes that the war on terror will not be won on the military battlefield and gives policy emphasis to strategic longt erm policy components earlier bush administration draft versions of the stra tegy had placed even heavier emphasis on international law enforcement cooperation as policy pillar httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32522crs3 8 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147html introductionthe strategy details desired end state where the scope and capabilities of global terrorist organizations are downscaled to such an extent that they become localized unorganized unsponsored and ra re enough that they can be almost exclusively dealt with by criminal law enforcement to accomplish this mission emphasis is placed on international action by working with the willing enabling the weak persuading the reluctant and compelling the unwilling8 one aspect of the strategy is that economic development is formally enumerated as an important factor in reducing conditions that terrorists exploit the strategy also raises the priority of using information programs to delegitimize terrorism strategy elements the administrations 2003 national stra tegy for combating terrorism is founded on four pillars defeating denying diminishing and defending together with us allies defeat ing terrorists by attacking their sanctuaries leadership command control and communications material support and finances components include 1 identifying and locating terrorists by making optimal use of all intelligence sources foreign and us and 2 destroying terrorists and their organizations by capture and detention use of military power and through employment of specialized intelligence resources as well as internati onal cooperation to curb terrorist funding denying terrorists state sponsorship support and sanctuarysafehavens central strategy objective is to ensure that other states take action against such elements within their sovereign territory elements include 1 tailoring strategies to induce individual state sponsors of terro rism to change policies 2 promoting international standards for combating terrorism 3 eliminating sanctu aries and 4 interdicting terrorist ground air maritime and cyber traffi c in order to deny terrorists access to arms financing information wmd ma terials sensitive technology recruits and funding from illicit drug activities diminishing underlying conditions that terrorists exploit by fostering economic social and political development market based economies good governan ce and the rule of law emphasis includes 1 partnering with the international community to alleviate conditions leading to failed states that breed terrorism and 2 using public information initiatives to delegitimize terrorism and defending us citizens and interests at home and abroad to include protection of physical and cyber infrastructureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32522crs4 9 for example the usa patriot act was passed and signed the interagency terrorist threat integration center ttic was formed as was the 911 commission

to 24 other frontline states in the global war on terror since september 11 2001 inherent in these four pillars are the following components first and foremost is an intelligence component counterterrorism requires sound intelligence since 911 the united states has sought to identify and implement measures designed to better merge domestic with foreign intelligence9 increasingly us counterterro rism strategy incorporates law enforcement component subject however to restricti ons found in the posse comitatus act and the homeland security act that limit invol vement of the military in domestic law enforcement10 central to the national strategy for combating terrorism is law enforcement cooperation for example since september 11 2001 the fb i has initiated cooperative pr ograms with singapore ma laysia thailand indonesia and other nations aimed at appreh ending suspected terrorists and has shared expertise and technology with the law enforcement agenci of these nations an increasingly important component of law enforcemen t cooperation involves curbing terrorist financing11 us counterterrorism policy also has strong economic component with both defensive and preemptive characteristics on the defensive side much attention is being given to minimize disruption of the american economy by protecting economic infrastructures major function of the department of homeland security dhs is to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructures supporting such efforts is growing use of risk analysis and threat matrices on the preemptive side of the econo mic component since 911 combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of us foreign assistance12 the bush administration has launched new foreign aid program the millenniumchallenge

and has dramatically enhanced efforts to limit and seize sources of terrorist funding14 this has spawned renewed focus on the narcotics trade as source of funding for such groups even in instances where groups do not actively work together the synergy of thei r separate operations and shared efforts at destabilization pose an increasing threat15 in addition there is military component this military component is reflected in the war in iraq16 us operations in afghan istan deployment of us forces around the horn of africa to dji bouti and the former soviet republic of georgia and ongoing military exercises in colombia the us is also undergoing shift in overseas base locations to t actically support more flexible strategy allowing for extended global military reach17 on the home front us policy increasingly has homeland security focus the department of homeland security was the biggest reorganization of the federal government in americas history incor porating 22 government agencies and some 179000 people into single organization ch arged with coordinating the nations domestic response to terrorism the budget of the new department is roughly equal in amount to 10 of the nations defe nse budget for fy2003 approximately 44 of federal law enforcement positions nd 48 of federal law enforcement funding were transferred to dhs18 central to the us government approach to

counterterrorism center in the view of the commission should be the central office for intelligence gathering analysis and overall counterte rrorism operations mirroring commission recommendations on august 2 2004 president bush urged congress to create the position of national intelligence director position separate from that of cia director to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and to serve at the pleasure of the president the director would serve as the presidents pr incipal intelligence advisor overseeing and coordinating the foreign and domestic

intelligence on the september 11 commission recommendations 29 for variety of material relating to the 911 commission report see the crs website httpwwwcrsgovproductsbrowseisterrorismshtml for the 911 commission report seehttpwwwgpoaccessgov 911indexhtml note that the 911 commission recommendation on p 391392 of the 911 report re fers to hard choices in allocating limited resources and refers to use of risk based priorities for evaluating and identifying transportation assets needing protection moreover the recommendation on p396 begins with the wording homeland s ecurity assistance should be based strictly on assessment of risks and vulnerabilities such recommendations are based however on the premise that threat based vulnerability assessment methodologies exist or can be developed which are able to assess terrorist riskof objective intelligence from administration policy goals27 as the proposed national intelligence director would ve access to both domestic and foreign intelligence another concern is the overa ll power wielded by the proposed position and its potential for abuse28 issues regarding the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission report given the potential access by terrorists to wea pons of mass destruction designing effective responses to terrorism may well be the greatest challenge facing governments today bedeviling policymakers is how to combat effectively this growing global phenomenon with sufficient intelligence support and at sustainable level of economic social and political cost inherent in this policy debate are two overarching issues 1 how to ensure pr otection of civil liberties while enhancing security and 2 how to deal with th seemingly unending costs of enhancing security29 critical to both these issues is the development of methodology to measure the adequacy of an titerrorism efforts an issue not addressed in the 2003 national strategy or in the 9 11 commission report recommendations in this regard some raise concern that creation of positions or structures in government where domestic and foreign intelligence are coordinated or fused such as the national intelligence director and national counterterro rism center will result in encroachments on civil liberties clearly as nation they say the united states does not seek to defend freedom ab road and ignore it at home on the other hand others counter that providing security in todays increasingly borderless world is basic responsibility of governments to their citizenry without in telligence gathering and analysis that adequately tects an increasingly intertwined continuum of threats of both foreign and domestic origin they say policymakers may find themselves at major disadvantage in implementing strategies to counter such threatshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32522crs9 30 see 911 commission recommendations on pages 391992 and 396 31 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302200302147htmlconcern also exists over the potentia l for seemingly limitless economic costs of security associated with homeland defense sizeable nation can afford the cost of fortifying every square inch of its territory from terror attacks so as the 911 commission recommends both strategy and implementation policies must wisely prioritize allocation of resources for counterterrorism and homeland defense30 complicating these efforts governments and terrorists may be fighting different wars policymakers often view success against terrorism in terms of minimizing physical damage death injury and destruction of property and concentrate their energy and resources in this area on the other hand terrorists while seeking physical damage may also view success in abstract or ideological terms for example what is the impact of an action on recruitment how does it affect government policies or the stability of the government in power what is the impact of an act of terrorism on the economy of nation or on global economic networks what is the impact on behavioral patterns of target population might the public pressure government to pursue policies that appease terror the question arises how long can democratic government s pursue policies that pressure terrorists if such policies are seen as bringing on terrorist retaliation breaking or weakening this political will is likely to be central terrorist goal some well thought out strategies pr omote holding the line on terrorism or setting it back but potential danger in formalized strategies such as the national strategy for combating terrorism31 is that the strategy may rigidly dictate the response instead of the threat dictating the response as the threat is often rapidly evolving one option for policymakers charged with combating terrorism is to design flexibility into strategies organi zational structures nd funding utilization while strategies or changes in governme ntal organizational structures such as those recommended for the intelligence community by the 911 commission may accelerate success against global terrorism ot her factors are equally critical as well strong national leadership and high quality of rankand file personnel and technology are central as is the strong po litical will of leadership and the general population hence one poten tial pitfall of relying on strategies and reforms involving restructuring of government orga nizations is that focus on implementing strategies or administrative changes may overshadow other important factors such as quality of personnel and technol ogy in particular this human factor may warrant more attention in an environment where organizations may feel pressed to find personnel to fill plethora of newly cr eated counterterror related positions overall the 911 commission recommenda tions share many features of the administrations national strategy for combating terrorism the theme of using portfolio of all elements of national power resounds in both documents both documents emphasize the core importance of timely and actionable intelligence both emphasize need for preemptive strategy for attacking terrorists and their organizations for interna tional cooperation for foreig n economic

vulnerable to law enforcement activity while in tran sit to exploit this vulnerab ility targeting travel is given special emphasis in the 9 11 commissions recommendations 33 see generally 911commission recommenda tions under the heading prevent the continued growth of islamist terro rism pp374383 of the commission report 34 conversation with peter probst vicepreside nt and director of research for the center for the study of terrorism and political violence august 8 2004 35 crsprobst conversation august 8 2004 that commission indicates that an important purpose of targeting terror financing is to gather information on terror networks and coalitions and to raise the costs of raisin g money in terms of financial expenditures and organizational energy to qaeda and ot her groups moreover the report p283 suggests that if qaeda is replaced by smaller centralized groups the assumption that terrorists need financial support network may become outdated another benefit of targeting financing not mentioned in the report is th at it may prove useful as coalition building tool 36 see generally commission recommendations pages 374379 and specifically the recommendation relating to the us relationship with saudi arabia p374 attacking terrorist financing for denyin g sanctuaries and for border security32 pursuit of government policies that draw potential recruits away from terrorist agendas is core recommendati on of the 911 commission report33 some however see certain commission recommendations as incomplete if not flawed they suggest that the commission is often focused on the last war and not future one and liken the commissions recommendations to picking the low hanging fruit on the tree while avoiding going after the higher more difficult to reach yet richer clusters34 for example the commission as its first recommendation suggests identifying and prio ritizing terrorist sanctuaries with focus on failed states some assert however that terrorists increasingly return to their politically stable home countries fo r sanctuary where they blend into local communities where their training camps are in civilia n housing complexes and where their bomb factories are in private residences in anot her recommendation the commission suggests that vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing remain front and center yet does not addr ess the prickly and growing issue of use of the hawalah system by terrorist networks35 number of the commissions recommendations fall within the category of preventing the growth of islamist extre mism and both the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission report to large degree equate the terrorist threat with qaeda and affiliated groups ho wever valid question is the degree to which if at all such singleminded approach detract s attention from individuals or groups with other motivations that may soon appear on the horizon another issue central to combating islamist extremism not addressed in the 2003 national strategy or the 911 commission recommendations is that of confronting incitement to terrorism when promoted countenanced or facilitated by the acti on or inaction of nation states36 although the 2003 national strategy and the 911 commission both support the use of foreign assistance as means of taking away fertile breeding ground forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32522crs11 37 the question
