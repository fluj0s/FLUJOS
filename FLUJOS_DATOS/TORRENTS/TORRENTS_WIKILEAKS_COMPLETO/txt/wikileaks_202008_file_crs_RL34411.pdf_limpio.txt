performance rights act of 2007 hr 4789 and s 2500 summary the transmission of copyrighted sound r ecordings to the public by overtheair amfm radio stations is an activity that implicates the right of public performance under the copyright act however under cu rrent law terrestrial radio broadcasters who play copyrighted music need only co mpensate songwriters for the performance of their musical compositions and not th holders of the copyright in the sound recording who may include the recording artist musicians and record label yet if music is publicly performed by digital udio transmission such as by internet radio stations webcasters or satellite digital radio companies both the songwriter and the recording artist are entitled by law to receive royalty payments from the transmitting entity sound recording copyright holders assert that there is justifiable reason for the copyright law to treat sound recordings differently from other categories of performable copyrighted works they maintain that recording artists deserve to be fairly compensated by broadcast radio fo r public performance of their works just as songwriters and music publishers are currently being paid for such activity they also believe that the copyright law should require the same royalty obligations for terrestrial broadcasters and digital music services so as not to advantage some of these commercial competitors over others the broadcast radio industry however has defended its statutory exemption from paying royalties to recording artis ts for nondigital public performances by arguing that radio broadcasts serve as free publicity and promotion of the sound recordings and that performers and record producers are compensated through sales of compact discs or mp3 music download files concert ticke ts and merchandise furthermore the broadcasters are concer ned that any new royalty obligation imposed on radio stations could result in less copyrighted music being performed either because stations may change their format to talk radio or they may need to broadcast an increased number of advertisements or that the additional royalties could adversely impact the financial health nd existence of smaller radio stations the performance rights act of 2007 h r 4789 and s 2500 would amend the copyright act to expand the public perform ance right of sound recording copyright holders to include analog audio transmissi ons change that w ould require terrestrial radio stations to begin making royalty payments to performers in contrast resolutions have been introduced in both houses the supporting the local radio freedom act hconres 244 and sconres 82 that express that congress should not impose any new performance fees royalties or other charges for overtheair broadcasts of sound recordings by local radio stations these opposing legislative measures reflect the contenti ous debate between the reco rding industry that desires compensation from amfm radio stations for performers and producers of sound recordings and the broadcast industry th at opposes changes to the status quo httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34411contents introduction 1 background 2 history of the sound reco rding

4789 and s 2500 introduction the scope of the public performance right granted by the copyright act is broader for musical works than for sound recordings this difference accounts for the current structure of the royalty obliga tions of terrestrial radio stations that publicly perform copyrighted music wher eas the musical work copyright holders songwriters and music publishers are entitled to receive royalty fees from the radio broadcasters the sound recording copyright holders singers musicians and record labels lack any right to demand payment fo r overtheair broadcasts of their work however since 1995 sound recording copy right holders have possessed limited public performance right the right to c ontrol public performance of their work by means of digital audio transmission thus the royalty obligations for internet radio broadcasters satellite radio broadcasters and cable television operators that transmit copyrighted music to their audiences are different than those of terrestrial amfm radio stations entities that digitally transmit music to their listeners must pay royalties not only to the songwriters but also to the recording artists several hearings have been held in the 110th congress examining whether the performance right should be expanded for sound recordings to encompass nondigital audio transmissions in order to allow performers and record companies to receive compensation when broadcast radio st ations play their sound recordings1 this report offers information regarding this issue and legal analysis of two bills currently pending hr 4789 and s 2500 the perform ance rights act of 2007 that would amend the copyright act to provide sound r ecording copyright holders with right to receive royalties from terrestrial radio st ations that publicly

report rl33631 copyright licensing in musi c distribution reproduction and public performance by brian t yehbackground copyright is federal grant of legal protection for certain works of creative expression including books m ovies photographs and music2 copyright holder possesses several exclusiv legal entitlements under th copyright act which together provide the holder with the right to determine whether and under what circumstances the protected work may be used by third parties3 generally party desiring to reproduce adap t distribute publicly display or publicly perform copyrighted work must either 1 obtai n the permission of the copyright holder usually granted in the form of license agreement that establishes conditions of use and an amount of monetary compensation known as royalty fee 2 comply with the terms of compulsory licenses established by law4 or 3 assert that such use falls within the scope of certain statutory limitations on the exclusive rights such as the fair use doctrine but the validity of such claim may be subject to the judgment of federal court5 the unauthorized use of one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder constitutes infringement6 federal law recognizes copyright protecti on for two separate categories of works in the musical realm musical works and sound recordings7 musical work refers to the notes and lyrics of song while sound recording is recorded version of musician singing or playing musical work as that rendition is captured in tangible medium of expression such as compact disc cassette tape vinyl album or mp3 file thus there are potentially two different creative artis ts and two different copyrights when it comes to single piece of recorded music the holder of the copyright in the underlying musical work embodied in the sound recording and the holder of the copyright in the sound record ing itself the musical work copyright holder is typically the individual who wr ites the notes and lyrics of musical composition or music publisher who purch ases or licenses copyrights from song composers the sound recording copyrigh t holder may include the recording artist the background musicians and the record bel that helps with the production of the sound recording it is possible that one individual can be both the sound recording copyright holder as well as the holder of the copyright in the musical work for example someone who is both singer and songwriter may hold two independent copyrights to piece of recorded music however many songwriters are not performers and many perform ers are not songwriters httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34411crs3 8 according to the copyright ac t to perform work means to recite render play dance or act it either directly or by means of any device or process 17 usc 101 9 17 usc 1066 10 broadcast transmission is defined as transmission made by terrestrial broadcast station licensed by the federal communica tions commission 17 usc 114j3 while both musical works and sound recordings are eligible for copyright protection the copyright act does not provide the same degree of public performance8 protection to sound recordings that it grants to the underlying musical composition contained in the sound recordin g the holder of copyright in the musical work has more robust right to c ontrol public performance in wide variety of situations while the sound recording c opyright holder has far more limited right to control public performance of sound reco rdings only when the sound recording is transmitted to the public through digital means9 the difference in the scope of the public performance right under the copyrigh t act for these two copyright holders and its impact on royalty obligations for third parties wishing to publicly perform sound recordings may be illustrated by the following scenarios an entity that wants to broadcast sound recording for the public through nondigital transmissions such as terrestrial amfm broadcast radio station10 must pay royalties to the musical work copyright holder eg the songwriter for the right to publicly perform the musical work but the radio station does not have to pay royalties or otherwise get permission from the sound recording copyright holders the recording artis t musicians and record label in contrast if the music is tran smitted to the public through digital means the two music copyright holders public performance rights and the transmitting entitys royalty obligations are different if the public performance of the sound reco rding involves digital audio transmission as used by an internet radio broadcaster or webcaster satellite digital radio company or traditional amfm radio station offering s imultaneous internet stream of its overtheair programming then both the songwriters and recording artists have the legal entitlement to be paid for that activity stated differently the webcasters and satellite radio companies because they transmit audio using digital technologies are required to pay royalties to both the musical work copyright holder and the sound recording copyright holder history of the sound recording performance right review of the history of the performance right in the copyright act is helpful in understanding why the scope of public performance protecti on differs for sound recordings and musical works while musical works have enjoyed full right of public performance for over 100 years the copyright act did not offer any legal protection to sound recordings until 1971 when congress enacted law that granted exclusive rights to reproduction and distri bution to sound record ing copyright holdershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34411crs4 11 sound recording amendment pl 92140 85 st at 391 1971 by its terms the law was effective on february 15 1972 and applies to sound recordings made on or after that date 12 internet streaming of radio broadcasts balancing the interests of sound recording copyright

to gr ant sound r ecording copyright holders the right to control pub lic performance partly due to opposition by television and radio broadcas ters and jukebox operators who resisted any changes to the copyright act that would require any additional royalty payments beyond those already mandated for songwriters and music publishers and also because congress considered the rights to control reproducti on and distribution to be sufficient enough to address the immediate problem of record piracy12 in the most recent general revision of the copyright act in 1976 cong ress directed the us copyright office to submit report by january 8 1978 th at would recommend whether congress should grant public performance right for sound recordings in that report the register of copyrights believed that public performance right for sound recordings was warranted broadcasters and other users of recordings have performed them without permission or payment for generations users today look upon any requirement that they pay royalties as an unfair imposition in the nature of tax however any economic burden on the users of recordings for public performance is heavily outweighed by the commercial benefits accruing directly from the use of copyrighted sound recordings to leave the creators of sound recordings without any protection or compensation for their widespread commercial use can longer be justified13 however at the time congress took ac tion in response to the advice of the register technological advances in music tr ansmission methods in the early 1990s helped persuade congress to reexamine th issue of public performance rights for sound recording copyright holders r ecord companies were concerned that consumers would use certain new technol ogies such as ondemand digital cable music services and other interactive services to listen to music and potentially record the digital audio transmissions thereby eliminating their need to purchase physical sound recording media14 in response in 1995 congress passed th digital performance right in sound recordings act15 which for the first time ever gr anted copyright owners of sound recordings an exclusive right to perform their

the committee in reviewing the record befo re it and the goals of this legislation recognizes that the sale of many sound recordings and the careers of many performers have benefitted considerably from airplay and other promotional activities provided by both noncommercial and advertisersupported free overtheair broadcasting the committee also recognizes that the radio industry has grown and prospered with the availability and use of prerecorded music this legislation should do nothing to change or jeopardize the mutually beneficial economic relationship be tween the recording and traditional broadcasting industries17 in 1998 with the passage of the digital millennium copyright act18 congress clarified that the digital performance right also applied to sound recordings performed by noninteractive nonsubscr iption internet radio broadcasters webcasters19 as result of these two laws webcasters satellite radio broadcasters and cable broadcasters are now required to pay royalties to sound recording copyright holders when they digitally transmit their recordings in addition to the royalties that are due to the musical work copyright holders terrestrial radio stations that stream simulcast their programming on the internet also are required to pay royalties to sound recording copyright holders because that activity involves digital audio transmission radio stations

with respect to royalty obligations for public performance of sound recordings becau of important differences in the intellectual property law of all countries as well as the fact that many foreign

that recording artists deserve to be compensated for public performance of their works by broadcast radio just as songwriters and music publishers are currently being paid for such activity27 they point out that simple fairne ss requires terrestrial radio to pay them for performing their work as the artists are the ones who bring the music to life who attract listeners to station and who make it possible for radi to make money by selling advertising28 second they claim that the prom otional value offered by terrestrial radio for the performance of their sound recordings has been diminished

allows foreign broadcasters to deny paying royalties to us performers when they play th eir works in their countries31 industry estimates suggest that the loss to us artists in potentia l foreign performance royalties is about 70 million32 the register of copyrights has also offered congress her opinion on this issue asserting that there is legal justifi cation for why the copyright law should treat sound recordings differently from other cat egories of performable copyrighted works such as books plays and movies33 she also believes that the copyright law should require the same royalty obligations for both terrestrial broadcasters and digital music services to provide more level playing field for these commercial competitors34 legislation in the 110th congress performance rights act of 2007 legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress that would expand the scope of the public performance right for sound recording copyright holders the ch anges proposed by the performance
