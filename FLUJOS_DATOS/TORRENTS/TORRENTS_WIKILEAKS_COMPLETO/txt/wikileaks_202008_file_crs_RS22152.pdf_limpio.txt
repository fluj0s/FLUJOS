legislators alike have shown increasing interest in pale ontological fossil re sources large tracts of federal lands possess va luable fossil resources1 and some are concerned that current law is inadequate to protect and ma nage these federal resources properly there is comprehensive management po licy or statute for the management and protection of fossil resources on federal lands such mana gement authority that now exists may be derived from statutes dealing with the protection of public properties and from statutes related to the protection of specific sites2 for example the

archeological and historic pres ervation act of 19744 also may have some limited applicability to fossil management and protection the archaeo logical resources protection act of 19795 specifically excludes paleontological resources from its definition of archaeological resources and may have very limited application to fossil protection and management the federal cave res ources protection act6 may provide for some protection if the fossil resource is located within the context of protected cave resource related issue is that there are not consistent statutory or regulatory definitions for such key terms as fossils paleontologial resources federal lands and related terms the general criminal theft provisions of 18 usc 641 which prohibit the conversion theft sale or dis posal without authorization of anything of value belonging to the united states may be applied to the unauthorized removal of fossils from federal lands7 person who steals government prope rty or receives stolen property knowing that it has been stolen can be fined under t itle 18 imprisoned for up to ten years or both in addition it may be possible to protect foss il resources by bringing trespass action for the unauthorized use of lands and resources certain federal statutes address specific types of trespass and provide for associated penalties8 only few reported cases have dealt with fossil resources located on federa l lands and related issues the cases do not provide consistent or dispositive analysis of the applicability of existing federal preservation laws to fossil resources9 several federal agencies ve management authority for the protection of fossil resources on lands under their jurisdiction four agencies within the department of the interior exercise such authority bureau of land management bureau of reclamation fish and wildlife service and national park rvice the us fore st service an agency of the department of agricu lture has certain fossil manage ment duties in addition
