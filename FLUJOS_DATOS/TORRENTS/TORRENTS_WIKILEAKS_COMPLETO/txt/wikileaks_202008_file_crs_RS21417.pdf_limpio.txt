columbia the pe rson offering it for sale is potentially liable for fraud under 18 usc 1343 fraud by wire radio or television since the columbia disaster the national aeronautic and space administration nasa has had this statement on its website all debris is united states government property and is critical to the investigation of the shuttle acci dent any and all debris from the accident is to be left alone and reported to government author ities unauthorized persons found in possession of acci dent debris will be prosecute d to the full extent of the law4 the organized search for debris whic h stretched from san francisco california to lafayette louisiana is winding down still several individuals have been arrested for stealing debris prosecutions tinue and others may yet arise title 18 usc 641 provides in part th at whoever embezzles steals purloins or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another or without authority sells conveys or disposes of any thing of value of the unite d states or of any agency thereof or any property made under contract fo r the united states or any partment or agency thereof shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both but if the value of such property does not exceed the sum of 1000 he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year or bot h title 18 usc 3571 authorizes fines for felonies of not more than 250000 and fi nes for misdemeanors of the type in 641 of not more than 100000 the supreme court has held that criminal intent is necessary element for conviction under 18 usc 641 even thoug h the statute does not provide specific level of intent for conviction of crime within its scope ot her than knowingly converts morrissette v united states 342 us 246 1952 consequently anyone acting with criminal intent to embezzle steal purloin or knowingly convert to his use or the use of another property of the ited states in the form of debris from the space shuttle columbia could thus be convicted of cr iminal offense under 18 usc 641 and fined according to the scheme at 18 usc 3571 for example there are recent newspaper reports of persons allegedly offering columb ia debris for sale on the world wide web auction site ebay5 if the alleged seller intentiona lly stole or knowingly converted the debris to his use or without authority sold or conveyed debris those actions could fall within the liability established by the statute and so could result in fines and imprisonment under 18 usc 641 3571 section 641 of title18 also provides that w hoever receives conceals or retains the same with intent to convert it to his use or gain knowing it to have been embezzled stolen purloined or converted shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both but if the value of such property does not exceed the sum of 1000 he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year or both thus anyone who knowingly receives debris of th columbia from someone else for personal use or gain could also be vulnerable to substantial criminal penaltieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21417crs3 6 john m broder
