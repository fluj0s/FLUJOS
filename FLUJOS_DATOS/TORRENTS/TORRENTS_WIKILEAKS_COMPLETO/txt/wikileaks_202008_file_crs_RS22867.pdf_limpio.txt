the purpose of the earmark and 5 certification that neither the senator or senators immediate family has financial interest in such an earmark6 when submitting earmark requests it is important to note that individual committees and subcommittees often have their own additional administrative requirements beyond those required by senate rules eg prioritizing requests or submitting request forms electronically the senate appropriations committee for example has stated that it will require members requesting earmarks to post information regarding their earmark requests on their personal 6 for

posted at the time of the request and must include the purpose of the earmark and why it is valuable use of taxpayer funds7 they may also establish relevant policy requirements eg requiring matching funds for earmark requests or restrictions eg not considering earmark requests for certain appropriations accounts or disallowing multiyear funding requests in addition committees and subcommittees often have deadlines especially for earmark requests in appropriations legislation for this reason it is important to check with individual committees and subcommittees to learn of any supplemental earmark request requirements or restrictions 8 the committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in the legislative text and any accompanying reports therefore when it is not clear whether senatorial request constitutes an earmark the committee of jurisdiction may be able to provide guidance when submitting an earmark request it may be relevant whether the senator wants the earmark to be included in the text of the bill or the committee report accompanying the bill committees may make an administrative distinction between these two categories in terms of the submission of earmark requests and there may be policy implications of an earmarks placement in either the bill text or the committee report for example under executive order 134579 issued in january 2008 executive agencies are directed not to commit obligate or expend funds that were the result of an earmark included in nonstatutory language such as committee report10 if during consideration of measure senator proposes an amendment11 that contains an additional earmark12 the senator shall ensure that list of earmarks and the name of any senator who submitted request to the senator for each item included is printed in the congressional record as soon as practicable g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g156g561 under the
