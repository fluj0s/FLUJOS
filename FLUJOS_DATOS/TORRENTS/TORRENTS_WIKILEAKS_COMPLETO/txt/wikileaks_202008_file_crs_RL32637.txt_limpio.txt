far below the more standard 90 and paying only 2630 of the debts net present value to most bondholders nearly half the historical minimum of 50 sovereign defaults are typically worked out in what amounts to consensual understanding between creditors and debtors with the assistance of the imf in setting macroeconomic targets that form the basis for mutual understanding of countrys ability to repay in this case argentina argued that its debt was simply too big to repay and rebuffed both private creditors and at times the imf even suspending its agreement at one point in the end mutually agreeable resolution failed to materialize leading to default that was not only unprecedented for its lengthy resolution over three years low recovery rate 30 of npv and large residual holdout 24 of creditors but for the process that stretched creditors would say flaunted the guidelines of sovereign debt negotiations this applied to both informal negotiation guidelines understood to be in play by bondholders and more formal understanding as embodied in the imfs policy of lending into private arrears other countries may look to argentina as model for reneging on sovereign debt but the cost of argentinas financial collapse in longterm social and economic terms has been devastating for investment firms and individual holders of argentinas debt the huge loss taken on the default is also

washington dc 2003 pp 67 3 debt restructuring implies formal change in the contractual arrangements of the debt such as reducing the face value of the debt and issuing new bonds with lower interest rates and longer maturities usually at sizable loss to bondholders crs2 first performing debt refers to debt that continued to be serviced or was never in arrears second nonperforming debt yet to be restructured refers to debt not included in the restructuring effort but that has not been serviced either third restructured nonperforming debt comprises the multitude of bonds that were subject to the restructuring offer this third category included principal and socalled past due interest pdi or interest that accrued but had not been paid historically pdi in sovereign debt workouts has been repaid in full either up front or as new bond issue separate from the principal due often referred to as pdi bond how pdi is handled is an important part of any sovereign debt restructuring table 1

national government bonds performing debt included all debt owed to the international financial institutions ifis bodens or bonds issued to compensate banks and depositors for the peso devaluation guaranteed loans for sovereign debt previously restructured during the final attempts to avoid default in 2001 and provincial debt that the federal government assumed after the crisis except for the obligations owed to international organizations most of this debt was held by argentines and has been fully pesified this means that the nonifi bondholders already reduced their claims when in 2001 their bonds were restructured and again in 2002 when their dollardenominated bonds were converted to devalued pesos pesified4 the government of argentina reasoned that both the ifis which continued to lend to argentina and those creditors who participated in the voluntary restructuring and pesification of debt should not have been further penalized because they were actively engaged in helping argentina solve its financial problems in fact there was little room for restructuring this debt without reigniting crisis defaulting on the ifis was not realistic option their debt is considered senior 4 credit suisse first boston emerging markets daily latin america march 7 2003 p 2 crs3 to all other and is always repaid in full except under the rarest of circumstances such default would have placed argentina in small group of countries completely shut off from external capital nor was there much room to restructure most of the domestically held bodens many were placed with depositors and financial institutions under some government pressure so default or writedown could have jeopardized the banking system restructuring bodens held by public sector pension funds would have been politically unfeasible for similar reasons5 this left two categories of nonperforming debt that had to take the brunt of the writedown the smaller of the two was 67 billion of mostly bilateral debt owed directly to countries paris club and some commercial bank loans argentina has yet to deal with the paris club the important figures for understanding the debt workout are those summarized in the third group restructured nonperforming debt this involves 818 billion worth of bonds at nominal or face value that argentina did not honor after the december 2001 default and accrued interest of 214 billion therefore for purposes of discussion in this report the total value of the restructured debt to be evaluated is 1032 billion 818 214 billion or only 53 of total public debt figure 1 global

the us dollar yen euro lira and deutsche mark resolving sovereign defaults when country becomes insolvent and defaults on its debt general framework for analyzing its options points to three critical responses first the country must adjust policies this includes correcting fiscal and current account deficits as well as structural imbalances which in argentinas case involved the banking sector utility regulation and federalprovincial fiscal relations second emergency financing is needed third debt must be restructured to achieve longterm financial sustainability6 traditionally the imf has played decisive role in all three table 2 argentina selected economic indicators 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 real gdp growth 34 08 44 109 88 90 92 primary budget surplus 08 04 13 06 30 51 37 of

provincial accounts first as seen in table 2 argentina dealt with the fiscal adjustment by increasing taxes and reducing expenditures which combined with the return of robust economic growth in mid2002 allowed argentina to move toward large primary budget surpluses this is the surplus that exists after all public expenditures have been met except for interest on debt the primary surplus is direct measure of countrys fiscal capacity to service its debt and theoretically is available entirely for debt service it may be increased by raising taxes or reducing spending in other areas of the budget the correction of the current account balance from deficit to surplus points to the reversal of borrowing abroad and the generation of foreign exchange available to repay foreign obligations and rebuild international reserves 6 roubini nouriel and brad setser bailouts or bailins responding to financial crises in emerging economies institute for international economics washington dc august 2004 p 119 crs5 structural adjustments proved to be more elusive usually the imf helps define the macroeconomic framework for achieving these policy adjustments as third party the imf can lend credibility to the targets from which both debtors and creditors should be able to develop realistic expectations regarding the debt workout7 the imf cannot dictate policy but theoretically it can exert leverage through its lending authority with the imf involved in setting policy goals the hardship linked to adjustments especially fiscal may be politically more palatable for the debtor country if promoted as necessary measures to achieve longterm recovery rather than simply appeasing creditor demands for greater repayment in addition creditors may be more accepting of the implied recovery rate on debt second the imf is the last source of emergency financing for country in default specifically imf policy allows fund lending into sovereign arrears to external private creditorsin circumstances in which prompt fund support is considered essential for the successful implementation of the members adjustment program and b the member is pursuing appropriate policies and is making good faith effort to reach collaborative agreement with its creditors8 imf assistance provides breathing room for financially troubled country as it attempts to recover third the imf also has role to play in restructuring the debt although it does not participate directly in debt restructuring negotiations by setting the policy adjustment guidelines and providing emergency financing the imf acts as an official arbiter and obviously has an influential role in encouraging consensual and expeditious negotiations it also has interest in quick resolution as creditor and in the case of argentina was one of the largest the major dispute between the argentine government and its creditors involved differing perceptions of the countrys ability versus willingness to service its debt argentina insisted that not all residual financial resources available for debt the primary surplus should be so used the countrys massive economic downturn resulted in 50 poverty rate with real per capita gdp retreating to levels not seen for 30 years argentina deemed social programs and domestic investment critical for its economic recovery and political stability under these circumstances it is serious political some would say moral decision to determine the percentage of public resources that should be spent on social programs versus debt reduction decision that also hinges on defaulting countrys bargaining power9 this is where argentina and its creditors were unable to come to terms while it was widely understood that argentina would not be able to repay its debt in full 7 roubini nouriel and

further consideration of the good faith criterion july 30 2002 pp 6 15 and 1920 9 for sympathetic view of argentinas dilemma see roubini and setser the reform of the sovereign debt restructuring process p 182 crs6 the question remained what amount and conditions would satisfy both creditors and the argentine government this problem was never satisfactorily resolved in part because the traditional arbitration role of the imf was compromised countries in default come to an agreement with creditors or like argentina risk costly prolonged litigation and ostracization from financial markets there are formal rule books for how to proceed but all parties are usually best served by avoiding protracted and confrontational negotiation negotiations may include formal meetings between creditor committees and government advisory groups less formal consultation arrangements or even less structured communications part of the process is assessing the market value of the defaulted debt one important benchmark the process can be lengthy and in some respects may resemble more of an exchange of views than true negotiation historically this has resulted in timely resolutions and greater than 90 bondholder participation rate with argentina clearly being the exception widely accepted basic guidelines suggest that creditors should be treated equally in terms of taking losses although domestic and foreign debt tend to be treated differently and that the government in default should make every reasonable effort to pay as much as it can these generalities obviously allow for great deal of leeway for interpretation in individual debt negotiations10 sovereign debt workouts typically involve issuing new debt for old under more lenient conditions that allow country eventually to recover its financial standing in the international community recovery rates have varied depending on the circumstances of each case since 1990 for example sample of nine latin american sovereign debt restructurings indicates that the reduction in the value of the debt often referred to as the haircut ranged from 0 to 45 with an unweighted average of between 3540 considerably more generous than argentinas final offer of 7074 reduction see below11 clearly there is room for different resolutions but the important goal to achieve for argentina was longterm debt sustainability this may be defined as an overall debt burden being consistent with the countrys overall capacity to make payments12 the concept implies that the debt payment schedule must be reduced smoothed out and extended so that the country can afford payments under reasonable economic assumptions it is in the creditors interest to get country to pay as much as possible within this constraint to ignore it is to risk future default and starting over again 10 roubini and setser bailouts or bailins pp 167 and 174 and global committee of argentina bondholders gcab roadshow presentation july 2004 pp 1213 this document may be found at httpwwwgcaborg pp 1213 11 ibid gcab 12 roubini and setser bailouts or bailins pp 20 and 172 the authors note that in addition to the debt size important factors include the coupon rate countrys ability to adjust policies and the amount of debt issued shortterm and in foreign currencies crs7 argentinas debt restructuring strategy argentinas default was unprecedented in size leading to highly complex and contentious debt restructuring process significantly because only 53 of argentinas debt carried the burden of restructuring the writedown had to be huge for argentina to achieve its debt sustainability goals notwithstanding argentinas predicament creditors argued that argentina was not absolved of its responsibility to negotiate and devise restructuring plan that would allow argentina to reduce its overall debt treat multiple creditors in nondiscriminatory fashion and minimize the potential for lengthy and costly law suits restructuring over 100 bonds denominated in seven currencies and governed by the laws of eight legal jurisdictions greatly complicated the task for example debt falling under british and japanese law operates under collectiveaction clauses which makes for relatively easier resolution by allowing majority of bondholders to make binding decisions for all collectiveaction clauses did not apply to debt governed by us new york german or italian law the result was multiple class action and individual law suits filed in the united states and european countries13 argentina initially juggled its debt dilemma by putting off private bondholders to negotiate with the imf in fact bondholders did not have their first real contact with argentine authorities until march 2003 15 months after the crisis began at that time argentina intimated that all debt would not be treated equally with foreign bondholders expected to take the largest debt writedown details of argentinas offer however would not surface for another six months while negotiations with creditors remained stalled on september 10 2003 argentina entered into new controversial threeyear 126 billion imf standby arrangement replacing recently expired sevenmonth interim arrangement following tense negotiations the imf with strong support from the united states acquiesced to what some characterized as soft agreement with argentina after it missed 29 billion payment putting it technically in arrears with the imf for one day14 the imf agreement provided the necessary policy framework for formal negotiations with private bondholders to begin importantly this framework was limited and included accepting argentinas formal offer to commit to primary fiscal surplus of 3 of gdp for 2004 although it would devote slightly less than that to actual debt payments15 the imf interpreted this effectively as minimum for argentinas commitments to debt service but in retrospect creditors correctly saw it as more of longterm maximum that signaled they should expect larger debt writedown than initially anticipated in setting what many viewed as low primary surplus target the imf lost credibility with creditors who thereafter cast doubt on 13 pruitt angela argentinas debt

comparison brazil has operated with 425 or higher primary surplus in recent years to deal with its large sovereign debt crs8 the imfs ability to serve as catalyst for timely and collaborative debt restructuring process the dubai proposal shortly after the imf program was in place argentina turned to bondholders making an initial offer on september 22 2003 at the imfworld bank annual meetings held in dubai the united arab emirates it was widely interpreted as an offer to pay 25 cents on the dollar of the principal value of the debt with recognition of past due interest an unprecedented stand on net present value npv basis financial institutions estimated this to be 90 rather than 75 reduction in the value of the bonds16 argentina argued from the outset that this was consistent with the 3 primary surplus target controversial position given that strong economic growth supported much larger surplus by december 2003 even the imf recognized that argentina could muster higher primary surplus and make good on greater portion of its defaulted debt17 the dubai proposal met with resistence from creditor groups their governments and the imf initial speculation that the offer was only bargaining ploy soon gave way to sense that argentina was sincere and unlikely to change its position bondholder groups immediately rejected the dubai offer and the imf delayed the first quarterly imf program review over the lack of movement on debt negotiations imf reviews are required for country to remain in good standing and to receive the next disbursement of funds great britain italy japan and other members representing 35 of imf votes then registered their dissatisfaction formally in highly unusual move they abstained from what is typically pro forma vote to continue lending to country that has met its economic targets18 nonetheless argentina had enough votes to survive the first imf review but the second was also problematic because of 31 billion payment due to the imf on march 9 2004 argentina continued to meet its macroeconomic targets as set out in the imf arrangement but the imf pressured argentina over its lack of good faith effort in debt restructuring negotiations and its failure to make headway on microeconomic reforms especially on utility pricing banking regulation and restructuring the provincialfederal fiscal arrangement that had contributed to the 16 the net

imf vote put argentina under pressure january 29 2004 crs9 crisis in the first place the imf also required that argentina negotiate final debt agreement acceptable to at least 80 of the bondholders by september 200419 despite imf pressure creditors complained that argentina continued to meet with them only on its own terms effectively dictating its position rather than offering an exchange of terms many meetings were held in buenos aires which increased creditor costs and ran counter to historical precedent in response many refused to meet with the argentine debt consultation groups others pressed for injunctions in us courts to have liens placed on argentineowned property in the united states argentina also took hard stand with the imf declaring it would refuse to make the scheduled 31 billion payment unless it could be assured that the imf would approve the second review and the related disbursement of funds needed to cover that payment20 these events led to an unusual standoff and highlighted not only the fact that large debtor like argentina wields its own leverage against lenders but that the imf with 15 billion invested in argentina had its own interests at stake in keeping argentina from falling into arrears to the extent that this was motivating factor for imf actions it worked against private bondholders who had hoped that the imf standby arrangement would be an effective inducement for argentina to improve its debt restructuring offer in the end compromise was reached in which argentina agreed to negotiate formally with all creditors but it did not change its fundamental offer with respect to the depth of the debt writedown or increasing its financial commitment beyond the 3 primary budget surplus the imf was criticized in the press and by investment firms for failing to deal more strictly with argentina which again became the central issue of the third review scheduled for june 2004 the final buenos aires offer argentina began seemingly earnest negotiations with bondholder groups in april 2004 but bondholders again contested this process in the middle of series of meetings which bondholders again characterized more as presentations than negotiations argentina unexpectedly canceled further talks and tabled its final offer on june 1 2004 formal 18ka filing was made with the us securities and exchange commission sec on june 10 outlining the provisions of this agreement21 bondholders rejected this unilateral offer even before it could be fully analyzed arguing that argentina had failed once more to live up to its imfimposed commitment to make good faith effort to reach collaborative agreement the buenos aires offer differed by recognizing past due interest through the end of december 2001 provided at least 70 of the bondholders agreed to the arrangement in addition gdplinked payments were attached to all bonds which 19 reuters news imf gives argentina debt ultimatum march 7 2004 20 thomson adam argentina on the edge the

daily credit suisse first boston june 15 2004 crs10 stipulated that argentina would increase payments should economic growth exceed predetermined baselines this provision was predicated on strong and sustained growth of the argentine economy which could not be guaranteed and in any case bondholder groups found it to be marginal increase at best and unattractive for those unwilling or unable to wait years for the full valuation of this option to be realized22 many features of the dubai proposal were retained so that the debt write off still amounted to 75 of outstanding debt but on present value rather than nominal basis this arrangement would have allowed president kirchner to save face by still claiming 75 writedown in debt while improving the offer to bondholders considerably over the dubai proposal the huge loss to bondholders however would still have been unprecedented and the offer was widely rejected the timing of the offer was also interesting coming before the june 2004 imf review argentina needed to represent itself as making good faith negotiations with creditors in order to remain in good standing with the imf while the june offer was undeniably more generous than the dubai proposal creditor groups led by the global committee of argentine bondholders gcab complained that it was unilateral proposal presented as final ultimatum and lobbied to have argentina declared in breech of imf conditions they also returned to the courts and responded with counter proposal that would have 1 shortened maturities 2 included down payment and 3 raised the overall recovery rate from 25 to 5560 of the original debt value23 this action was based on the robust growth of the argentine economy that the gcab argued should allow for higher payments on debt imf program suspension the imf has policy of remaining neutral in debt negotiations but through its review process effectively served as an arbiter between argentina and its bondholders whose respective assumptions regarding argentinas ability to repay creditors proved irreconcilable the imf and any leverage it had was sidelined in august 2004 however when argentina announced it would suspend its imf agreement thereby giving up temporarily access to further borrowing24 it was clear at that point that argentina was out of compliance with the imf arrangement including the commitment to enter into good faith negotiations with creditors argentina was effectively playing off against each other the three pillars of crisis resolution policy adjustment imf financing and debt restructuring it reasoned that for the short term it needed the time and freedom from imf conditionality to finish negotiations with creditors more than it needed imf financing 22 ibid p 2 23 gcab reportedly represented 75 of foreign bondholders see httpwwwgcaborg 24 argentina used this term and it may be said that both the review process and imf disbursements were suspended but technically the agreement was still in effect and argentina knew it could restart the review process as have other countries in the past crs11 in addition argentina requested and was granted on september 17 2004 an extension by the imf on payments amounting to 11 billion of some 25 billion due in the final quarter of 2004 further relieving it temporarily of imf pressure25 argentina pledged nonetheless to stay current with its other imf payments which was not burden in 2004 given its improved international reserves position this strategy however could not be continued indefinitely argentina needed to conclude an agreement with bondholders that would allow it to deal with the imf concluding the restructuring agreement after securing sec approval argentina opened the bond exchange on january 14 2005 allowing sixweek window for bondholders to respond to an offer that was only slightly better than the one made in june 2004 the argentine government made clear that this would be the only offer and that holdouts risked remaining permanently in default the argentine legislature codified the point on february 9 2005 when it passed law prohibiting the government from reopening the exchange offer or making any kind of future private settlement argentine officials were prepared to accept as little as 50 participation rate much below the 90 historical minimum usually strived for and even farther below the 9598 standard actually achieved in recent restructurings26 the offer closed on february 25 2005 and the government of argentina announced on march 18 2005 that 76 of creditors had agreed to the terms although the actual settlement was scheduled to occur on april 1 last minute legal efforts by holdout creditors delayed the transfer of bonds and cash payments until june 2 2005 of the 818

payment to the imf clearing its account in march 2006 the interamerican development bank idb approved 500 million loan for argentina the first loan from an international financial institution ifi since the imf program was suspended in 200431 argentina is now proceeding with its own economic policy agenda free from unwanted guidance by the official sector although the economy has been growing rapidly rising inflation and continued lack of progress on structural reforms raise many questions regarding its longterm prognosis in hindsight with the possible exception of some socalled bottom feeders who purchase highly discounted debt prior or during defaults it is hard to identify any real winners in argentinas financial crisis raising more questions than answered in four major policy areas countrys decision to default on debt the role of the imf us policy options and codes of conduct for developing country debt restructurings32 these are issues that congress has repeatedly explored in hearings on international financial crises argentina argentina is living in the shadow of the most costly sovereign default in history it made reasoned case that its debt was simply too big to repay and combined with its lack of progress on structural economic reforms there was reason to believe that 29 for more information see httpwwwworldbankorgicsid 30 global committee of

argentina policy briefs in international economics institute for international economics washington dc september 2005 p 7 crs14 the economy would have trouble achieving levels of prolonged growth in output and revenue needed to achieve debt sustainability without huge writedown even after the restructuring which provided argentina with significant debt relief the stock of public debt exceeded 80 of gdp although debt service has been greatly reduced by the lower interest rates and lengthened maturities of the new bonds33 debt sustainability is still not assured but has been buttressed by other factors such as continued strong economic performance and tax collection as well as the beginnings of renewed financial relationships with the international financial markets the need for sustained fiscal discipline is another key challenge to argentine public policy the default was not only unprecedented for its lengthy resolution over three years low recovery rate 30 of npv and large residual holdout 24 of creditors but for the process that stretched creditors would say flaunted the guidelines of sovereign debt negotiations this applies to both broadly understood informal guidelines and more formal understanding as embodied in the imfs policy of lending into private arrears other countries may look to argentina as model for reneging on sovereign debt but the cost of argentinas financial collapse in longterm social and economic terms has been devastating under the best scenario argentina faces decades of foreign debt repayments while it tries to rebuild an economy that has suffered through high levels of poverty unemployment and crime for investment firms and other holders of developing country debt the mere thought that others might follow argentinas example reinforces their belief that such default is highly negative precedent creditors vilified argentinas negotiating tactics but the financial markets appear willing to return to argentina it will also be interesting to see if argentina can avoid any future borrowing from the imf it had an imf arrangement in place continually from 1984 until january 2006 but appears determined to remain free of imf influence the imf there are important questions related to imf decision making first an imf audit of its own actions found that prior to the crisis surveillance was ineffective and conditionality weak while assumptions about economic growth and debt sustainability were overly optimistic so the fund lent too much for too long into an untenable situation thereby hurting more than helping argentina34 the imf struggled with the difficult task of defining clear threshold for insolvency doing so earlier would have helped argentina in not cutting argentina off sooner the additional imf lending only increased argentinas debt problem displaced other creditor debt for seniority in repayment and left fewer financial resources to be used in assisting argentina postcrisis this severely constrained argentinas debt workout options 33 by comparison brazil is also considered to have high level of public indebtedness amounting to slightly over 50 of gdp but which carries much higher interest rate 34

money kept rolling in p 199 and elsewhere crs15 second although the imf was virtually assured of being repaid argentina repeatedly threatened to default on the fund lending the appearance of having undue leverage when it came time for discussing quarterly reviews and imf debt rollover third the imfs leverage proved insufficient to persuade argentina to negotiate truly consensual understanding with creditors and so the imf lost some credibility as the official arbiter of debt restructuring in fact the imf was critical factor in supporting the 3 primary surplus target repayment ceiling creditors found unacceptable creditors and analysts further criticized the imf for not weighing in clearly on argentinas debt repayment capacity fourth argentina also demonstrated the now wellknown lesson that imf financial assistance without policy reforms is insufficient to resolve serious debt problem experts on international financial crises including those at the imf understand that imf lending should be available to countries dedicated to policy reform and with the political will and strength to see the reforms through in the alternative investor confidence and their money does not return and the financial crisis only tends to deepen35 in practice policy reform can be politically difficult but argentina presents clear case where the ultimate costs were much higher for lending too long to country incapable of achieving it since argentinas restructuring the imf has sought to modify its policies to limit the possibility of repeating such prolonged and painful debt workout it seeks to provide clearer rules for 1 limiting borrowing from the fund 2 providing better oversight and monitoring 3 improving options for policy support without lending and 4 reevaluating the good faith criterion in the context of resolving sovereign debt arrears36 us policy the argentine situation points to the evolution of an interesting policy dilemma for the united states as well the united states government including the congress is concerned with the treatment of us investors abroad but in the case of argentina the official us response was limited mostly to communications through the imf this is consistent with philosophy supporting market solutions particularly in light of the moral hazard criticism made against earlier bailouts it may also reflect priority for concerns over international financial stability and imf liquidity which may be at odds with supporting the interests of private bondholders historically this too is an interesting outcome during the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s the solvency of us creditors was of paramount concern for the us government and so they had the upper hand in negotiating sovereign restructurings by the 1990s however congress in particular began to raise concerns over the large financial assistance provided to 35 eichengreen barry financial crises and what to do about them new york oxford university press 2002 pp

2006 p a12 crs16 financially troubled countries by the time argentina defaulted the pendulum appears to have swung in the opposite direction with little interest in the official sector and particularly the united states directly intervening in debt workouts37 since taking office the bush administration has made clear that the united states would longer support large sovereign bailouts but instead allow markets to resolve these financial disruptions this commitment however proved easier to articulate than enforce although the bush administration did not jump to the bilateral rescue of argentina as the clinton administration had with mexico in 1995 it has made smaller efforts with uruguay for example more to the case at hand when argentina repeatedly sought help from the imf the united states proved to be one of the strongest voices of support despite the silence emanating from the us treasury therefore any criticism of the imfs response to argentina cannot be divorced from us policy which when faced with this serious developing country financial crisis was not in position to steer the parties away from costly and prolonged resolution and which has been criticized for its overall lack of leadership38 the us congress also chose not to exercise its voice strongly paying more attention to the economic crisis in argentina than the actual debt restructuring in the one hearing on argentinas debt us investors were afforded little sympathy by members and witnesses alike and much more concern was directed at the potential loss of credibility in international financial markets and the role of the imf little doubt was left that the time had passed when official government action would be sanctioned to support us private investors in cases like this39 emerging markets and debt restructurings investors paid heavy price in the argentine default including those in the united states who sought bigger role from congress and the us treasury in seeing that their rights and investments were honored us bondholders hoped to have the united states weigh in officially on the restructuring agreement either through its voice at the us treasury or the imf the united states carries much weight at the imf and can send strong signal as to whether imf reviews will be supported given the limitations of litigation against sovereigns this was the primary leverage available to influence argentinas decisions and the united states was not perceived as pursuing this option with any zeal the message sent was that the creditors were on their own to deal with the argentine government some analysts 37 for discussion of the 1980s debt crisis and the role of banks governments and the imf see crs report rl30449 debt and development in poor countries rethinking policy

sovereign debt restructurings the process is already changing given litigants lack of success when faced with determined defaulting country the markets have already adjusted by adopting collective action clauses as standard provisions in emerging market debt other changes are being discussed in the financial community to evaluate options for imposing some form of enforced guidelines or code of conduct on countries reluctant to meet their contractual obligations41 as far as designing and creating an international bankruptcy agency there remains little enthusiasm for resurrecting this idea after the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism sdrm promoted by the imf failed to take hold42 the fact that debt workouts are being completed even if not always smoothly or in timely fashion may suggest that the market system with imf assistance approach is still preferable to again trying to reinvent the international financial architecture with some type of statutory sovereign bankruptcy option but the argentine case was not resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties with quarter of the bondholders opting for costly litigation despite the uncertainty of outcome the success of this litigation may yet influence the future of debt workouts because as argentina has shown once insolvency occurs and debt becomes far too large to manage there may be little incentive for countries to work within the existing unenforceable system in finding quick and consensual solution leaving all parties worse off 40 porzecanski ibid pp 33032 41 for example the institute for international
