foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division may 8 2008 abstract concerns about potential disruptions in us trade ﬂows due to global health or security crisis are not new the possibility of an avian ﬂu pandemic with consequences for global trade is concern that has received attention recently although some experts believe there is little cause for alarm experts disagree on the likelihood of an avian ﬂu pandemic developing at all this report considers possible trade disruptions including possible impacts on trade between the united states and countries and regions that have reported avian inﬂuenza infections these trade disruptions could include countries banning imported goods from infected regions at the onset of pandemic facto bans due to protective health measures or supplyside constraints caused by health crises in exporting countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs224531 for more information on the avian flu see crs report rl33219 us and international responses to the global spread of avian

potential impact of trade disruptions danielle langton analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary concerns about potential disruptions in u s trade flows due to global health or security crisis are not new the possibility of an avian flu pandemic with consequences for global trade is concern that has recei ved attention recently although some experts believe there is little cause for alarm expe rts disagree on the likelihood of an avian flu pandemic developing at all this report considers po ssible trade disruptions including possible impacts on trade between the united st ates and countries and regions that have reported avian influenza infections thes trade disruptions could include countries banning imported goods from infected regions at the onset of pandemic facto bans due to protective health measures or supply side constraints caused by health crises in exporting countries background this report examines scenarios in which international trade could be heavily controlled or limited due to an avian flu pandemic1 each of the scenarios presented depicts the possibility that imports of goods into the united states could be curtailed due to the avian flu some experts argue that th scenarios are not likely to occur because they believe that the united states would probably not implement general ban on the importation of goods from affected regions it is believed that such ban would not prevent transmission of the avian flu to the united states because there is little evidence that inanimate objects could transmit the dis ease furthermore opponents to general ban on imports argue that such actions c ould unnecessarily cause economic and social hardship the united states depends on globa l trade for necessities such as food energy and medical supplies also some observers point out that the nature of the justintime global economy is such that the united st ates does not stockpile these and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22453crs2 2 influenza pandemic risk assessm ent and preparedness in africa world health organization regional office for africa brazzaville 2005 3 see crs report rl33795 avian influenza in poultry and wild birds by jim monke and m lynne corn 4 warwick j mckibben cited in john reichard models show pandemic could be devastating but flight curbs could buy valuable time cq healthbeat news october 19 2006necessities finally the world health organization does not recommend quarantining any individual country or closin g international borders at any phase of an avian influenza pandemic2 if international borders are not clos ed to human passage then it follows that there will probably not be direct trade restrictions while some experts believe that genera l ban on imports either globally or from affected regions is highly unlikely others c ontend that the strategy cannot be totally ruled out particularly since there is already us ban on imports of poultry products from certain h5n1 highly pathogenic strain of avian influenzaaff ected countries and regions3 some experts argue that it may be possible to transmit the virus through any object that has had contact with infected f eces blood or other bodily fluids some policy analysts predict that if the h5n1 virus were to become pandemic with humantohuman transmission then the united states might control the movement of people across its borders to slow the virus arrival on us soil this could involve limiting airline passenger flights into the country but it c ould also mean limiting entry of cargo ships due to fear of transmission from ship operato rs or stowaway birds these types of restrictions may result in facto import ban some experts belie ve these restrictions are unnecessary and potentially harmful but they might nevertheless be implemented to give the appearance of strong preventative actions in response to public concerns or political factors many believe that if such restrictive meas ures were adopted they would likely be shortlived once the pandemic reach ed the united states such measures would appear to serve little further purpose and could be abandoned more likely scenario is that supplyside constraint in the exporting country would limit us imports pandemica ffected countries could cu rtail their exports either voluntarily or involuntarily government s may nationalize asse ts and stop export operations an outbreak may also constr ain production and key export infrastructure through excessive worker absences to the point where exporting becomes difficult and is involuntarily slowed or halted such slowdown in commerce could cause price increases or temporary shorta ges in certain goods within the united states depending on the duration and breadth of the slowdown it could exacerbate the effects of slowed production and distribution netw orks within the united states leading to decreased demand and supply and recession several studies have been undertaken to estimate the effects of pandemic on the us and global economy according to one study mild pandemic could reduce global economic output by 330 billion or 08 of gl obal gross domestic product gdp the same study estimates that pandemic of the worst case scenario severity could reduce global economic output by 44 tr illion or 126 of global gdp4 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that severe influenza pandemic might cause decline in us gdp of about 425 and that mild er pandemic might cause decline of abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22453crs3 5 potential

depending on the methodology and data used different studies also disa gree on the extent to which international trade would be disr upted by an avian flu pandemic potential impact of trade disruptions with avian flu affected countries and regions this section considers the potential economic and trade effects on the united states of import disruptions from count ries affected by avian flu either as result of border closings in the united states or supply side constraints in the exporting country or region only countries with human avian flu cases confirmed by the world health organization who from january 2004 to january 2008 are c onsidered because these countries are arguably more likely to experience trade disruptions due to avian flu the relative likelihood of import disruptions from one country or region over another is not considered because it is too difficult to ascertain table 1 us trade with avian fluaffected countries country confirmed human cases 2003

ptargs_0_2_2043_271_0_43http3bremotevhacom publicnewsreleases060316aspchina as seen in table 1 the united states imports far more from china than any other country that has thus fa r reported confirmed human cases of the avian flu in fact china is the largest source of us imports overall accounting for over 16 of total us imports in 20076 therefore if imports from china were disrupted on large scale over long time period it could have significan t effect on the us economy however shortlived disruption in imports from china may not cause an immediate crisis forty four percent of us imports from china are in the category of machinery or electronic machinery and include items such as comput ers televisions and pa rts disruption in imports of these items could have implications for the dom estic electronics market but it may have less seve re effect on the us economy as whole one import category of special concern is medical supplies the united states imported over 5 billion in optical and medical instruments from china in 2007 representing 10 of such us imports many but not all products in this category are considered essential medical equipment for example china was the secondlargest supplier after mexico of respirator equi pment to the united states supplying over 13 of us respirator equipment imports china has also been an important supplier of bandages 41 of us imports in 2007 boxed first aid kits 53 clinical thermometers 50 orthopedic appliances 9 and syringes 137 some observers recommend that us hospitals stockpile essential supplies to take possible avian flu pandemic into account especially considering that medical supplies are sourced from potential avian flu hot spots many of these essential medical supplies are reportedly not manufactured in the united states8 almost 15 about 15 billion of fish nd seafood imports into the united states are from china second only to canada 19 b illion it is not clear whether trade disruption with china alone would have gr eat impact on the us food supply since the united states also imports food from other c ountries and regions in addition to having domestic production although the united states imports great deal from china many of these products originate elsewhere and only their final stage of production takes place in china for some items production could possi bly be shifted to another cation if longterm trade disruption were to occur however shif ting production in the global supply chain may have great costs or not be feasible for other reasons thailand indonesia and vietnam thailand indonesia and vietnam have similar patterns of exports to the united states although in different volumes among countries with confirmed human avian flu cas thailand is the second largest supplier of us imports however thailands total 2007 exports to the united states were just under 23 billion and it ranked 18th out of all exporters to the united states with 12 of the us import market i ndonesia and vietna m were ranked 26th and 31st respectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22453crs5 9 for more information on potential effects on the us agricultural economy see crs report continuedwith 14 bi llion and 11 billion in 2007 us imports like china thailands main exports to the united states are electrical machin ery and machinery comprising about 44 of thailands exports to the united states thaila nd indonesia and vietnam all export large quantities of fish to the united states thailand is the largest exporter of prepared crustaceans and mollusks the second largest is china and the second largest exporter of fresh crustaceans to the united stat after canada indonesia and vietnam are the third and fifth largest suppliers of prepared crustaceans and the fourth and third largest suppliers of fresh crustaceans to th united states thailand and indonesia also export optical and medical instrument s to the united states ranking 21st and 28th respectively in 2007 us imports the unite d states imports medical supplies such as dialysis instruments diagnostic instrument s syringes needles and ultrasound devices from thailand and indonesia in analyzing the trade data it appears that if trade were disrupted between the united states and any one of thailand indonesia or vietnam the effects would probably be minimal however if us trade was disr upted with all three countries and china considered more likely under flu pandemic the us supply of seafood and medical supplies could be impaired reduced seafood imports could increase not only the price of seafood but it could cause increased dema nd and possible price increases in substitute goods the impact of reduced medical supply imports could be more severe possibly resulting in shortage of certain medical supplies since substitutes are generally not readily available iraq oil comprised 95 108 billion of us imports from iraq in 2007 representing 3 of us oil imports iraq is the ninthlargest oil exporter to the united states if oil imports from iraq were to stop the reduced supply of oil could cause domestic energy prices to increase however there are many factors determining domestic energy prices and other events could overshadow exacerbate or offset any disruption of trade with iraq due to an avian flu pandemic other avian flua ffected countries egypt turkey and azerbaijan all primarily export oil to the united states thoug h not in significant amounts relative to total us oil imports in 2007 azerbaijan egypt and turkey ranked 27th 33rd and 49th respectively in exports of oil to the united states turkeys main export to the united states was stone for monuments and construc tion with 14 of the us import market cambodias and azerbaija ns overall exports to the united states are relatively small and would likely have little impact on the us economy if they were to be disrupted poultry trade the united states is the larg est global producer and exporter of poultry and the secondlargest global producer and exporter of eggs in 2005 us farm sales of poultry were 233 b illion while us imports of poultry were only 130 million in 2007 the us exported 33 billion in poultry up from 22 billion in 2006 poultry exports to china have increased exponentially from 157 million in 2004 to 5784 million in 2007 china is the secondlargest importer of us poultry after russia almost all us poultry and egg imports are from canada which has not been affected by the highly pathenogenic avian influenza h5n19 some observers argue that as long ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22453crs6 9 continued rl33795 avian influenza in poultry and wild birds by jim monke and m lynne cornthe united states remains unaffected by avia n influenza the us poultry industry may be positively affected by outbreaks of avian influenza elsewhere as it may increase demand for us poultry exports on the other hand news about avian influenza cases in other countries could reduce consum er demand for all poultry even if it is considered influenzafree potential impact of global trade restrictions if the united states were to shut its borders to trade completely the impact could range from moderate to severe depending on how long the restrictions were in place very shortterm trade shutdown of just fe w days may not have significant long term effects as an example in the days following september 11th 2001 shipments to the united states were slowed dramatically though not stopped entirely because of tightened security at the borders once the borders were effectively reope ned business resumed with little if any economic impact from the slow down in trade longer trade shutdown could have greater implications both domes tically and globally much would also depend on how wall street reacted sharp fa ll in financial markets would be likely but the question is how resilient the us econom would be many countries rely on the united states as an export market the loss of that market even temporarily could cause economic hardships around the world and contri bute to the beginning of possible global economic slowdown the united states is large economy and doe s not rely on trade to the same extent as smaller economies but it is not selfsufficien t there could possibly be an oil shortage and energy prices could increase oil might not be available to all who need it this would have implications for the rest of the economy as transportation costs increase and cause price increases for goods across the economy also many us businesses rely on imports both for intermediate goods and consumer products it is difficult to determine which individual products could be in short supply because many consumer goods that are generally not considered imported products depe nd on imports at some stage of their production also some consumer goods that are imported have s ubstitutes that may be produced in the united states finally trad disruptions would account for only part of the economic impact of an avian flu pande mic other domestic and international economic events could have more severe impacts which could be compounded by disruptions in global trade
