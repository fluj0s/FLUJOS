policy environment and natural resources policy division summary since 1972 the united states has participated in the man and the biospher program mab coordinated by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as part of the us mab program 47 biosphere reserve s have been established in the united states these sites are part of network of 324 such areas worldwide in which scientists conduct research and communicate about thei r findings biosphere reserves are nominated by the country in which they are located and change in jurisdiction or sovereignty occurs as result however controversy has arisen over the past 3 years over the connection to the united nations and fears by some commentators and organizations that us sovereignty may be affected th american land soverei gnty protection act hr 901 was introduced to address these concerns by imposing extensive conditions on the program it has been reported by the resources commit tee and is likely to be considered by the house in october another bill would authorize the program to operate very much as it currently does while others would restrict appropriations for agencies participating in the programs background biosphere reserve is term denoting an area that has bee n nominated by the locality and the country in which it is located for participation in th worldwide biosphere reserve program under the us man and the biosphere program mab and accepted for such recognition by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco areas ar nominated by country and recognized by unesco on the basis of their significance for research and study of representativ biological regions of the world the united states has 47 biosphere reserves part of worldwide network of 324 biosphere reserves in 82 countries biosphere reserve recognition does not c onvey any control or jurisdiction over such sites to the united nations or to any other entity the u nited states andor state and local communit ies where biosphere reserves are located continue to exercise the sam jurisdiction as that i n place before designation areas are listed only at the request of the country in which they are located and can be removed from the biosphere reserve list at any time by request from that country httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96517crs2 following controversy over conce rns raised about the connection of this program to the united nations legislation has b een introduced to require congressional authorization of all nominations of biosphere reserve sites and to assure that commercial uses of such sites would not be restricted by their inclusion in the program in addition amendments have been passed to the interior department and several other appropriations bills t prohibit obligation or ex penditure of funds for the mab biosphere reserve program and the world heritage program the biosphere reserve system the biosphere reserve network was established in 1968 as one program area of the man and the biosphere program of unesco which operates through independent national committees in each of the 114 participatin g countries the us mab program operates under the us national mab committee which coordinates six directorates studying various kinds of environmental an d biological regions and issues one of these six directorates is the biosphere reserv directorat the us mab committee is composed of scientists from universities government agencies and other members from entities such as private conservatio n organizations the purpose of the biosphere reserve program is to promote cooperation an d commun ication among worldwide network of areas that would include all the majo r ecosystem types globally with sites identified as areas where research on ecologica l concernsespecially the impacts of human activity on ecological systemscould b performed major goal of the network is to allow comparative work in variou s countries in similar or dissimilar reas to assess how the systems work and how they can be used productively without destroying their essential ecological properties and life support potential criteria for biosphere reserves in order to facilitate research on ecosystems in various stages of protection nd development biosphere reserves meet these criteria 1 they have legally protected core area relatively free from outside or human activityin the united states usually an already designated park wilderness or wildlife refuge area 2 there is buffer zone or zones surrounding or contiguous to the core area where human activity is carried out but generally at lowrural intensity and types of activity that are comp atible with conservation objectives and 3 transitional areas outside the buffer zone where human activity is more intensified but presumably with some cooperativ effort underway in these adjacent communities to achieve sustainable development i n which conservation and economic development are jointly pursued according to th values and guidance of the local community when local community state or national mab committee begins to pursu recognition of the area as biosphere r eserve these criteria are usually already being met it is not expected that steps will have to be taken to create core areas or change activity patterns after recognition however local communities are encouraged to develo p cooperative mechanisms to maximize opportuniti for the research and information focus of the biosphere reserve program designation process for biosphere reserves an area to be considered fo r recognition as biosphere reserve is nominatedonly with the support of the loca l communit yand the nomination is considered by the us national committee documentat ion on the recommended area and how it meets the criteria of the biospherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96517crs3 reserve system is assembled locally and forwarded by the us mab program to th international coordinating council icc of the mab programme in paris whic h considers the recommendation and makes d ecision which is conveyed to the us mab program polic implications of designationrecognition there are legally bindin g requirements on countries or communities regarding the management of biospher reserves full sovereignty and control over the area continues as it was befor recognition the main effect of recognition is to publicize the inclusion of an area in the biosphere reserve netwo rk thus making it known that research on the areas ecosystem type and impact s of adjacent human development on the area is appropriate as part of an international network of such research it is expected that research in such areas conducted mainly by private andor government scientistswill be shared through th biosphere reserve program in order to maximize benefits of information exchange funding for the us biosphere reserve program is provided by pooled resource s from several participating fede ral agencies totalling some 225000 in fy 1996 funding goes almost entirely to us programs and local organizations with some relatively small amounts supporting research by us scientists in other countries or assisting developing country scientists to attend mab meetings us legis lation both the mab biosphere reserve program and the worl d heritage program due to their unesco connection have raised the suspicion of number of commentators and organizations who are concerned that designation coul d result in impingement of us sovereignty or could result in unacceptable limitations on uses of the land see also crs report 96395 f world heritage convention and us national parks responding to these concerns hr 901 the american lan d sovereignty protection act was introduced in february and has more than 170 co sponsors this bill much like its predecessor hr 3752 in the 104th congress provide s conditions that apply to nomi nations of sites to the biosphere reserve or world heritage programs in particular it would prohibit federal officials from nominating any lands in the united states for designation as biosphere reserve under the mab program and would require that all existin g biosphere reserves would cease to be in effect unless they are specifically authorized by law before december 21 2000 it would also require that biosphere reserves should consist solel of lands owned by the united states and subject to management plan that specifically ensures that the use of intermixed or adjacen t nonfederal property is not limited or restricted as result of that designation additional reporting requirements would be imposed for instance to account for money expended and to describe disposition of complaints it appears that passage of thi s legislation would significantly limit or possibly effectively terminate us participatio n in the mab biosphere reserve program hr 901 was marked up and reported to the house on june 25 1997 h rept 105245 the bill is expected to be considered by the house during october an alterna tive bill hr 1801 was introduced june 5 1997 to authorize th united states man and t he biosphere program and for other purposes this legislation would provide statutory authority for the mab program providing for its operation muchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96517crs4 as it is currently constituted with designation by the president of lead agency an d
