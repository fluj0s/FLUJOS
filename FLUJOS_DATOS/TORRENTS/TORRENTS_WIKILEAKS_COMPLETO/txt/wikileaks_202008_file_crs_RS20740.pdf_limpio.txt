slaves who had been used in the war were freed lincoln in 1861 proposed co lonizing freedpeople on thousands of acres of land in panama but his plan did not materialize in 1863 lincoln established five man commission to determine what lands c onfiscated under the second confiscation act3 the government should use for charitable edu cational and other purposes he instructed these commissioners to sell 20acre lots to africanamerican families at 125 per acre4 during the civil war general william tecumseh sherman issued special field order number 15 on january 16 1865 which rese rved for

walter r vaughan white businessman from alabama started an ex slave pension and bounty organization and drafted pension bill that was introduced in the 51st congress by representative william j connell of nebraska hr 1119 this bill and others were introduced to provide pensions to exslaves on sliding scale accord ing to age but none became law congress rejected these bills primarily because they were considered too expensive they would have cost millions of dollars12 generally the bills provided that exslaves who were at least 70 years old would have been entitled to and would have r eceived lump sum of 500 in addition to 15 per month for the rest of their lives persons between the ages of 60 and 70 would have received payment of 300 and 12 per month until they reached the age of

received 12 per month all exslaves younger than age 50 would have received 4 per month until 50 years old at which time their monthly payments would increase to 8 per month the pension bills provided

americans he prefers to address real problems that america faces today as result of racial disparity by focusing on improving education21 reportedly president clinton disagreed with paying reparations to african americans claiming too many years had passed since slavery and that current problems that stem from it need to be addressed22 he stated that he would consider an apology to african

introduced resolutions on reparations that were referred to their respective committees but saw further action pro and much discussion has occurred on the issue of reparations to african americans for the enslavement of their ancestors in the ited states and the subsequent racial and economic discrimination they have suffered proponents of reparations argue that blacks must be compensated for th robberies and exploitation that occurred during slavery and for the lingering negative effects of slavery since the civil war including jure and facto discrimination practiced today against blacks within the private and public sectors individuals practiced slavery but society perpetuated and supported the oppression of african americans many members of the larger society regardless of whether they are or arenot descendants of slave owners benefitted and continue to benefit especially economically from the oppression of african americans the society guilty of establishing and protecting slavery persists today and must pay for its historical wrongs and japanese americans success in obtai ning federal money and an apology for their internment during world war ii created precedent for compensating african americans24 opponents of reparations for african americans argue that persons who committed wrongs against slaves have been dead for years and people living today are not respons ible for those historical wrongs african americans living today have never been enslaved and therefore are not entitled to wages for slave labor performed by their ancestors the prevalence and impact of racism in the united states today isminimal and african americans who ar victims of racism should seek redress through existing antidiscrimination laws any person guilty of violating antid iscrimination laws can and should be held individually responsible determining who is eligible for individual reparation payments is toodifficult and the economic costs of reparation pa yments would be too expensive25
