recognize the importance of the proposed visit by politburo member and ccp organization department beijing 00001176 002 of 005 head li yuanchao it would be easier to arrange successful visit if li could postpone his travel to less busy time the charge said xxxxxxxxxxxx replied that the visit of li future leader of china was very important so china hoped the united states would provide full schedule of meetings with senior leaders despite the fact that those leaders recently met with state councilor liu the charge urged xxxxxxxxxxxx to arrange useful schedule for speaker of the house nancy pelosi including trip to tibet or tibetan areas noting that the speaker was also particularly interested in climate change and environmental issues china would treat speaker pelosis visit as type of state visit xxxxxxxxxxxx replied nevertheless given her tight schedule the speaker would likely not have time to visit tibet xxxxxxxxxxxx said 6 c reviewing the upcoming meetings between presidents obama and hu this yearxxxxxxxxxxxx noted that over the past 30 years the uschina relationship had been driven by highlevel visits to greater degree than other bilateral relationships with these meetings between our two presidents in mind both sides should be careful and act in ways that benefit the longterm interests of the bilateral relationship our two presidents would meet several times in the coming months including at the g8 g20 and apec summits after which china anticipated president obama would visit china we should plan our work for the bilateral relationship in the year ahead with the presidents visit to china in mind g20 dates and topics 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that xxxxxxxxxxxx he would ask to meet with nscs michael froman in washington and was considering

chinese positions had been close closer even than the united states and europe xxxxxxxxxxxx noted views on major issues such as the need for fiscal stimulus and reform of international financial institutions were similar leading up to the london summit xxxxxxxxxxxx felt that the usukchina troika had been effective beijing could persuade the developing countries washington could influence japan and south korea and london could bring along the europeans 9 c the first two g20 summits according to xxxxxxxxxxxx had succeeded in boosting confidence and agreeing on measures to help international financial institutions cope with the crisis now the g20 had entered an implementation period he outlined four objectives that he intended to discuss with froman establish what stimulus and macroeconomic policy coordination the g20 economies needed to implement to ensure economic recovery b strengthen the message against protectionism so that leaders did not break their promises as soon as they returned home c set clear timetable for imf reform establishing whether the new arrangement to borrow nab decisions had any relation to future quota and d reforming the international monetary system visavis the dollar and an alternative reserve currency such as special drawing rights sdrs 10 c expounding on this last topic xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that stable us dollar was good for china and beijing had interest in destabilizing the system the system however was not perfect and needs reform he said china had huge stake in how the united states managed the dollar further

practical change 11 u note xxxxxxxxxxxxs comments on the strategic and economic dialogue will be reported septel vfm hes washington visit dprk iran afpak beijing 00001176 003 of 005 12 c xxxxxxxxxxxx reviewed several issues he hoped to discuss during his upcoming visit to washington including north korea iran and afghanistanpakistan on north korea xxxxxxxxxxxx hoped to hold informal consultations in washington on how generally to approach the north koreans not just through the sixparty talks washington and beijing nevertheless needed to discuss how to maintain momentum in the sixparty talks so as to preserve our common interest in stability of the korean peninsula north korea wanted to engage directly with the united states and was therefore acting like spoiled child in order to get the attention of the adult china therefore encouraged the united states after some time to start to reengage the dprk in this regard it was good that the new york channel remained open xxxxxxxxxxxx observed noting that special representative for north korea policy stephen bosworth would visit beijing in may xxxxxxxxxxxx said that if the sixparty talks would be on hold for an extended period then the six parties needed to find ways to continue to engage the dprk and each other either bilaterally or even perhaps trilaterally the charge noted that we should be careful not to reinforce pyongyangs bad behavior 13 c xxxxxxxxxxxx also hoped to discuss the iranian nuclear issue in washington beijing appreciated the bold steps taken by washington china had told tehran that this represented good opportunity for iran to resume playing positive role in the region though such an iranian role made moderate arab countries jittery xxxxxxxxxxxx said this should be matter the united states could manage what was essential was to get iran involved positively in the region again 14 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said he also hoped to discuss afghanistanpakistan the charge stated that even though xxxxxxxxxxxx was unable to announce new money for afghanistan at the april 17 pakistan donors conference china still had an opportunity to contribute to the security and stability of both afghanistan and pakistan one way to do so would be to agree to resupply route via china for us forces in afghanistan on the resupply route question xxxxxxxxxxxx said china would like to see list of items that would be transported on the proposed route noting that nonlethal is broad and vague term tibet and taiwan as core interests 15 c xxxxxxxxxxxx raised concerns over chinas core interests of tibet and taiwan which he said could derail bilateral cooperation on tibet china had heard rumors that the dalai lama would attend seminar in the united states in late september or early october and that president obama was likely to meet with him then noting that there was need for both sides to reiterate our respective positions on tibet xxxxxxxxxxxx said the critical question was whether both sides would agree to take care of each others core interests when considering such sensitive issues in the context of the bilateral relationship they could be viewed either as obstacles or as core interests it did not matter whether one side liked or disliked such matters rather in mature close and important bilateral relationship such as ours the question was whether the key interests for each side would be accommodated the united states had its core interests xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted such as us naval vessels that had operated near the chinese coast both sides agreed to step down over that issue despite the strongly held views of the chinese public regarding the dalai lama china hoped the united states would deny him visa and if not then agree to hold official meetings with him including meeting with president obama 16 c the charge expressed concern with chinas defining tibet as core issue with the apparent expectation that others would step back instead our two sides should agree to continue to discuss the issue in an attempt to resolve our differences the united states recognized that tibet is part of china nevertheless the dalai lama is respected religious leader and nobel laureate and us officials meet with him in that capacity future meetings by us officials with the dalai lama could not be ruled out moreover there were serious concerns among the us public the administration and congress over the situation in tibetan areas of china china should take steps to address tibetans legitimate grievances and engage the dalai lamas representatives in productive dialogue denying visa to the dalai lama was not being contemplated beijing 00001176 004 of 005 17 c another issue that could derail relations was arms sales to taiwan xxxxxxxxxxxx said china had long opposed us arms sales to taiwan especially advanced weapons sales china was concerned by reports of possible very important and potent arms sales to taiwan including 60 blackhawk helicopters and f16 cd fighter aircraft

deployments aimed at taiwan human rights liu xiaobo gao zhisheng 18 c the charge raised two human rights cases inquiring as to the status location and treatment of dissident writer and charter 08 signatory liu xiaobo and rights lawyer gao zhisheng xxxxxxxxxxxx replied that as sign of the maturity of our bilateral relationship he had repeatedly listened to our concerns regarding these two cases both cases would be handled according to law and in accordance with chinas legaljudicial system such cases were sensitive and should be handled carefully xxxxxxxxxxxx said pledging that he nevertheless would look into the cases to the extent possible north korean guests 19 s the charge emphasized the importance of expediting exit procedures from china for two north koreans who had entered the embassy compound and asked for xxxxxxxxxxxxs assistance in doing so xxxxxxxxxxxx said he would look into the matter us journalists detained in dprk 20 c the charge urged china to press the dprk to release the two american journalists detained in north korea xxxxxxxxxxxx replied that the united states could rest assured that china would do so unsc reform 21 c china was concerned by momentum that was building on security council reform which was not good for the p5 xxxxxxxxxxxx said china wanted the united states to maintain its position on unsc reform and not be proactive on the matter which the prc feared could result in general assembly resolution on the subject the p5 club should not be diluted xxxxxxxxxxxx said if we end up with p10 both china and the united states would be in trouble moreover it would be difficult for the chinese public to accept japan as permanent member of the unsc the charge replied that the administration had not completed its policy review on unsc expansion so we do not yet have position on specific proposals nonetheless the united states believed that members should be allowed to state their positions freely and openly without undue p5 influence regarding japan the charge said that while decision had been made about which countries to support for permanent membership on the unsc it was hard to envision any expansion of the council that did not include japan which was the secondlargest contributor to the budget coca ii avoiding trade war 22 c the charge expressed concern that differences regarding conditions of construction agreement coca ii for our new consulate general in guangzhou had begun to leak into other areas the charge asked xxxxxxxxxxxx to speak with the appropriate prc officials to stop this trend before significant damage was done the coca ii team from washington held good discussions in beijing last week with mfa dg for administrative affairs li chao regarding the new cg guangzhou complex the us embassy today had formally invited dg li to washington in may for further talks one serious problem the charge noted was the chinese having moved to block new housing leases for the us embassy in
