countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic s cientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this pol icy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it special message the fol lowing policy letter means what it says it was true in 1965 when i wrote it it was true in 1970 when i had it reissued i am reissuing it now in 1980 to avoid again slipping back into period of omitted and quickied fundamental grade chart actions on cases thereby denying gains and threatening the viability of scientology and of orgs scientology will keep working only as long as you do your part to keep it working by applying this policy letter what i say in these pages has always been true it ho lds true today it will still hold true in the year 2000 and it will continue to hold true from there on out matter where you are in scientology on staff or not this policy letter has something to do with you all levels keeping scientology workin g hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and all new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the tech nology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only wh ere there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the tas k of the assoc or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the tec hnology three knowing it is correct four teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out i ncorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in an area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the not toobright have bad point on the button self importance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate t he bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evo lve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basi c suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destr uction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will d ream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical an d undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorses degraded novels self abnegation has filled the southeast asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had not supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there rem ains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuable only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defense of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is fact the group left to its own vices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatizations of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technol ogy he did evolve psychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seve n eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth nj wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involv ed them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so structive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bank agreement has been what has made earth hell and if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselves thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructiv when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that game do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of our road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end audi tor b q andaed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all tootypical example the instructor should have done seven eig ht nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained their certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to ve worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet the were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on th course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertaken because nobody at levels 0 to iv is going to get that m uch ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an meter ta dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it ne eded to go to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that mom ent could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncompr ehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree t he most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so prop er instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone m ay yet someday be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enroll who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to s low progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyl l have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrolls consider he or she has joined up for the dur ation of the universe never permit an open minded approach if theyre going to quit let them quit fast if they enrolled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be half minded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one namby pamby bunch of panty waist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it em mild but only the tigers survive and even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct half mindedly and are afraid to offend s cared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs patty cake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in her eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humor her an d we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead than incapable fit that into the economics of the situ ation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high pries ts its our possible failure to retain and practice our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man wo man and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another ch ance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and

calculated to lose the technology of dianetics and scientology to use or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application reason the effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing m aterials or deleting processes from grades the pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using two way comm and applyi ng the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use and delivery of dianetics and scientology is the answer to any recovery the product of an org

start says good without new start if the command is received or says flunk if the command is not receiv ed start is not used again thats it is used to terminate for discussion or to end the activity

underacknowledgment let student do anything at first to get acknowledgment across then even him out teach him that an acknowledgment is stop not beginning of new cycle of communication or an encouragement to the precle ar to go on and that an acknowledgment must be appropriate for the pcs comm the student must be broken of the habit of robotically using good thank you as the only acks to teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgment across or can fail to stop pc with an acknowledgment or can take pcs head off with an acknowledgment patter the coach says start reads line and says flunk every time the coach feels there has been an improper acknowledgment the coach repeats the same line ea ch time the coach says flunk thats it may be used to terminate for discussion or

unit of t ime not as blur with other questions and to acknowledge it to teach that one never asks second question until he has received an answer to the one asked commands do fish swim or do birds fly position student and coach seated comfortable distance apart training stress one question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before the student must learn to give command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time the student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked if he or she fails to repeat the exact question if he or she q andas with excursions taken by the coach patter the coach uses start and thats it as in earlier trs the coach is not bound after starting to answer the students question but may comm lag or give commenting type answer to throw the student off often the coach should answer somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to q and or upset the student example student do fish swim coach yes student good student do fish swim coach arent you hungry student yes coach flunk when the question is not answered the student must say gently ill repeat the auditing question and do so until he gets an answer anything except command acknowledgment and as needed the repeat statement is flunked unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked poor command is flunked poor acknowledgment is flunked q and is flunked as in example student misemotion or confusion is flunked student failure to utter the next command without long comm lag is flunked choppy or premature acknowledgment is flunked lack of an acknowledgment or with distinct comm lag is flunked any words from the coach except an answer to the question start flunk good or thats it should have influence on the student except to get him to give repeat statement and the command again by repeat statement is meant ill repeat the auditing command start flunk good and thats it may not be used to fluster or t rap the student any other statement under the sun may be the coach may try to leave his chair in this tr if he succeeds it is flunk the coach should not use introverted statements such as i just had cognition coach divertive statements should all concern the student and should be designed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing the students job is to keep session going in spite of anything using only command the repeat statement or the acknowledgment the student may use his or her hands to prevent blow leaving of the coach if the student does anything else than the above it is flunk and the coach must say so flunks are given if the student does more than 1 understand 2 acknowledge 3 return pc to session coach may throw in remarks personal

dianetics and scientology from washington dc more confronting l ron hubbard that which person can confront he can handle the first step of handling anything is gaining an ability to fac it it could be said that war continues as threat to man because man cannot confront war the idea of making war so terrible that one will be able to fight it is the exact reverse of fact if one wishes to end war the invention of the longbow gunp owder heavy naval cannon machine guns liquid fire and the hydrogen bomb add only more and more certainty that war will continue as each new element which man cannot confront is added to elements he has not been able to confront so far man engages hims elf upon decreasing ability to handle war we are looking here at the basic anatomy of all problems problems start with an inability to confront anything whether we apply this to domestic quarrels or to insects to garbage dumps or picasso one can ways trace the beginning of any existing problem to an unwillingness to confront let us take domestic scene the husband or the wife cannot confront the other cannot confront second dynamic consequences cannot confront the economic burdens and so we have domestic strife the less any of these actually are confronted the more problem they will become it is truism that one never solves anything by running away from it of course one might also say that one never solves cannonballs by baring his b reast to them but i assure you that if nobody cared whether cannonballs were fired or not control of people by threat of cannonballs would cease down on skid row where flotsam and jetsam exist to keep the police busy we could not find one man whose ba sic difficulties whose downfall could not be traced at once to an inability to confront criminal once came to whose entire right side was paralyzed yet this man made his living by walking up to people in alleys striking them and robbing them why he struck people he could not connect with his paralyzed side and arm from his infancy he had been educated not to confront men the nearest he could come to confronting men was to strike them and so his criminal career the more the horribleness of cr ime is deified by television and public press the less the society will be able to handle crime the more formidable is made the juvenile delinquent the less the society will be able to handle the juvenile delinquent in education the more esoteric and difficult subject is made the less the student will be able to handle the subject when subject is made too formidable by an instructor the more the student retreats from it there were for instance some early european mental studies which were so complicated and so incomprehensible and which were sown with such lack of understanding of man that student could possibly confront them in scientology when we have student who has been educated basically in the idea that the mind is so formidable and so complicated that none could confront it or perhaps so bestial and degraded that one would want to we have student who cannot learn scientology he has confused scientology with his earlier training and his difficulty is that he cannot be mad to confront the subject of the mind man at large today is in this state with regard to the human spirit for centuries man was educated to believe in demons ghouls and things that went boomp in the night there was an organization in southern europe w hich capitalized upon this terror and made demons and devils so formidable that at length man could not even face the fact that any of his fellows had souls and thus we entered an entirely materialistic age with the background teaching that one can confront the invisible vengeful religions sought to move forward into foremost place of control naturally it failed to achieve its goal and irreligion became the order of the day thus opening the door for communism and other idiocies although it mig ht seem true that one cannot confront the invisible who said that spirit was always invisible rather let us say that it is impossible for man or anything else to confront the nonexistent and thus when nonexistent gods are invented and are given moral r oles in the society we discover man becomes so degraded that he cannot even confront the spirit in his fellows much less become moral confronting as subject in itself is intensely interesting indeed there is some evidence that mental image pictures occur only when the individual is unable to confront the circumstances of the picture when this compounds and man is unable to confront anything anywhere he might be considered to have pictures of everything everywhere this is proven by rather intere sting test made in 1947 by myself when it was discovered that if an individual could be made to run lock of something he had just seen run another lock on something he had just heard and run an additional lock on something he had just felt he would at length be able to handle much more serious pictures in his mind i discovered although i did not entirely interpret it at the time that an individual has further pictures when he can confront all pictures thus being able to confront everything he has done he is longer troubled with the things he has done supporting this it will be discovered that individuals who progress in an ability to handle pictures eventually have pictures at all this we call clear clear in an absolute sense wo uld be someone who could confront anything and everything in the past present and future unfortunately for the world of action it will be discovered that one who can confront everything does not have to handle anything in support of this is offered that scientology process problems of comparable magnitude in this particular process the individual being processed is asked to select terminal with which he has had difficulty in that the definition of terminal is live mass or something that is c apable of causing receiving or relaying communication it will be seen that terminals are quite ordinarily people in the problem category of anyones bank the person is then asked to invent problem of comparable magnitude to that person he is asked to do this many many times it will be found midway in the process that he is willing to do something now about the problems he is having with that person but at the end of the process new and strange thing is found to occur the individual longer fee ls that he must do something about the problem indeed he can simply confront or regard or view the problem with complete equanimity now an almost mystic quality enters this when it is discovered that the problem in the physical universe about which he h as been worried often ceases to exist out there in other words the handling of problem seems to be simply the increase of ability to confront the problem and when the problem can be totally confronted it longer exists this is strange and miraculous it is hard to believe that an individual who has drunken husband could cure that individual of drink simply by processing out the problem of having drunken husband and yet this has occurred i am not saying here that all the problems of the world c ould be vanquished simply by running problems of comparable magnitude on few people but neither am i saying that all the problems of the world could not be handled by problems of comparable magnitude on few people and indeed i am at this time underta king an experiment in this direction on the subject of the atomic bomb it is an oddity that the longer this experiment is continued the less responsive these bombs are to test firing perhaps it could be said however that if there existed one person i n the entire universe who could confront the entire universe the problems of the universe for all would deintensify enormously mans difficulties are compound of his cowardices to have difficulties in life all it is necessary to do is to start runni ng away from the business of living ness after that problems of unsolvable magnitude are assured when individuals are restrained from confronting life they accrue vast ability to have difficulties with it there are many other things about confront ing which are intensely interesting but these we will take up in later issue an earlier issue of ability carried in it full resume of training 0 the name of which is confronting this drill done for great many hours will be found intensely efficacious in the handling of life wife and husband whose way has not been too smooth would find it extremely interesting in terms of resolution of domestic difficulties to co audit with this training drill alone each one running it upon the other for t least 25 hours this would have to be done of course on turnabout basis of not more than 2 hours on one and then switch from coach to auditor to run confronting in this fashion and with considerable gain it would be necessary to have some derstanding of what coach is and in one of these coauditing teams what an auditor is much fuller understanding of this will be contained in the student manual the team sits in straightbacked preferably uncomfortably upright chairs the coach nd auditor sit facing each other short distance apart it is the task of the coach to keep the auditor on the ball the auditors feet must be flat on the floor his hands must be in his lap his head must be erect and he must not use any system or m ethod but must simply confront twitching muscle jittering finger alike would be reproached by the coach the coach has several terms he uses the first of these is start at which moment the session begins every time the auditor falls from grace does not hold his position slumps goes anaten unconscious twitches starts his eyes wandering or in any way demonstrates an incorrect position the coach says flunk and corrects the difficulty he then says start again and the session goes on when the person in the role of auditor has been extremely successful over period of time the coach can say win and then again start when the coach wishes to make some comments or give some advice the coach says thats it straightens up this p oint and then again says start in the coaching itself only these terms are employed start flunk win thats it anything else the coach does or says is disregarded by the auditor unless the coach has said thats it and has then advised n point and then has started again the coach would be at liberty to do anything he wished short of physical violence to make the auditor nervous or upset him the coach could say anything he wished between start and another command as above and t he auditor would flunk if he paid any attention or did otherwise than simply confronted ordinarily all the coach does is make sure that the auditor goes on confronting that is very adequate for the first 25 hours of confronting however it should be understood that the drill can be toughened up considerably the coach can do anything to throw the auditor off the simple business of confronting if the auditor so much as twitches smile looks embarrassed clears his throat or in any other way falls off from plain and ordinary confronting it is of course always flunk it should be understood that drill sessions are not auditing sessions in drill session the entire session is in the hands of the coach who is only in vague way the preclear of the session in an auditing session the entire session is in the hands of the auditor there is basic rule here anything which the auditor or student as he is called in the drills is holding tense is the thing with which he is confronting if th auditors eyes begin to smart he is confronting with them if his stomach begins to protrude and becomes tense he is confronting with his stomach if his shoulders or even the back of his head become tense then he is confronting with the shoulders or the back of his head coach who becomes very expert in this can spot these things at once and would in this case give thats it straighten the auditor out on it and would then start the session anew it is interesting that the drill does not cons ist of confronting with something the drill consists only of confronting therefore confronting with is flunk various nervous traits can be traced at once to trying to confront with something which insists on running away nervous hand for insta nce would be hand with which the individual is trying to confront something the forward motion of the nervousness would be the effort to make it confront the backward motion of it would be its refusal to confront of course the basic error is confron ting with the hand the world is never bright to those who cannot confront it everything is dull gray to defeated army the whole trick of somebody telling you its all bad over there is contained in the fact that he is trying to keep you from confr onting something and thus make you retreat from life eyeglasses nervous twitches tensions all of these things stem from an unwillingness to confront when that willingness is repaired these disabilities tend to disappear of course tumultuously marr ied couples may encounter some knock down and dragout moments in doing this confronting drill however it should be kept in mind that it is the coach in these training drills who is bound by the instructors code and that the only harm that can result would come about if the auditor were permitted to blow leave the session without the coach even with manhandling getting the auditor back into the drill it will be found that these blows occur most frequently when the person being coached in othe r words the auditor is being given too few wins and is being discouraged by the coach of course things he does wrong should be flunked but it will be found that the way is paved to success with wins therefore when he does it well for period of the auditor should be told so go into this drill expecting explosions and upsets and simply refuse to give up if they occur and you will have it whipped in short order go into it expecting that all will be sweetness and light and everyone should be little gentleman and little lady and disaster will loom neither i nor the management are responsible for cuts contusions violent words or divorces resulting from attempts to run confrontingness drills by husbands and wives on each other may you n ever be the same l ron hubbard founder hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 4 january 1973 remimeo study series 9 confront there are several choices in english on the meaning of confront these include the right one to face without flinching or avoiding an example in sentence the test of free society is its capacity to confront rather than evade the vital questions of choice there is another meaning to stand facing or opposing esp ecially in challenge defiance or accusation english is pretty limited language in many ways i imagine the thought of facing something which is what the word came from and originally meant way backfrons being face was so horrifying to the type s who write dictionaries they knew it would be bad in essence it is an action of being able to face if one cannot if he avoids then he is not aware awareness is the ability to perceive the existence of in the dictionary it also fails to confront tha t and says awareness the quality or state of being aware and aware means marked by realization perception or knowledge so these chaps couldnt confront and so conceived awareness to be figure figure we are moving out of the range of languag when we want to say he could stand up to things and wasnt always shrinking back into himself and avoiding so he could be fully conscious of the real universe and others around him and thats what confront means if one can confront he can be awa re if he is aware he can perceive and act if he cant confront he will not be aware of things and will be withdrawn and not perceiving thus he is unaware of things around him thats the tech of it l ron hubbard founder lrhntm jhgm hubbard c ommunications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 3 february 1979 issue ii confront tech has to be part of the tr checksheet the inability to confront is basically caused by withholds and where person cannot be drilled into confronting he has to have his withholds pulled that he has committed overts and doesnt want them exposed apparently causes him to withhold his attention and the result is his ability to confront is lessened also where person has overts on subject and is withholding he has tendency to complicate that subject and cannot get down to its basic simplicities the world looks very complicated to him probably because his attention is wrapped up in his withholds instead of on his real problems or the subject the new discovery here is that person who has overts and withholds on subject cannot perform in that area and introduces complexities for of course they cant confront it where person cannot take responsibility for his withholds and he is not benefiting casewise from giving them up he is half dead as being it is vicious circle he began to commit overts because he couldnt confront things and then withheld what he had done he became half dead as being because of his overt s and withholds because he had withholds and could not confront he began to take heavy drugs and alcohol these pushed him toward deadness and further worsened his ability to confront and even caused him to commit further overts which he then withheld nd this further deteriorated his ability to confront and all this traces back to the fact that he couldnt confront in the first place there is nothing more irresponsible than dead man and when confront drops and withholds enter in one has entered th death slide as being this vicious circle can be handled in processing at various levels and will unsnarl and the person will become alive and able to confront but the first steps of it and ones which could carry him well up the ladder are the dril ls of the trs course if done properly and over and over in rotation each time to win on each particular drill truly the world begins anew by regaining the ability to confront l ron hubbard founder lrhjkgm pab 147 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via the hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london wl 1 november 1958 communication course i want to welcome you to the communication course it seems that communication course is necessary as the first step to an auditor and if an auditor doesnt successfully pass the communication course then to the end of any curve he has as an auditor there will be something wrong with his auditing it is very odd that one of the highest levels of indoctrination tone 40 on an object is most often unsuccessfully approached by student at the hpa or hca level when he has flunked the one i am going to talk about right now which is newcomers first look inside the academy at communication and that is dear alice part it would have amused you the other day to have found former director of training of an organization being sent back by the hco board of review coach in his coaching to dear alice so that he could get good enough to pass tone 40 on an object but it was absolutely necessary that this happen because he had for some reason or another being an old timer and having been in it for long time never hit dear alice it had been omitted from his tr aining in spite of all the auditing he had done and all the experience he had had at the end of this time we find him sit ting up in the coaching room good as gold perfectly comprehensible doing dear alice part aa man who has probably audited two r three thousand hours worth but everywhere he had difficulty with preclear that difficulty stemmed from an inability to do dear alice part which is in effect to deliver an auditing command in unit of time as completed cycle of action he deliv ered an auditing command well now you have to get up to step 2 and even step 3 before you can call it full cycle of action but as far as the auditor is concerned in dear alice part only his job is done when he has delivered an auditing command t preclear he didnt deliver it over the hills and far away or to the window he delivered it to being and he delivered it from where he was to where the preclear was and its so easy anyone to whom this was described briefly insufficiently out in the street would flunking it at the same time tell you of course i can communicate to people well yes theres nothing to it im salesman you know i run the atomic energy omission im big man of course i communicate to anyone we look in t hat mans vicinity and nobodys heard anything hes said since the days of noahs ark he never said it to anybody in the first place he sort of throws things out you know and he just hopes they land well thats what passes for communication and it i snt by long ways he throws out statement of some sort or another and he thinks hes communicating with somebody its great oddity but i must confess to you at this moment that the dynamic is simply an agreement it is an agreement which people ve agreed to and therefore it has an existence and we certainly cannot live in this world without it but its violation of the communication formula violation of it the only thing that you can talk to in the final analysis is living being and all third dynamics are composed of individual dynamics and you can summate them and you can say this is third dynamic and that is the agreement on which we go and it is quite factual and they are quite actual unless we stress them with the communication formula so that you dont talk to all preclears you talk to preclear there was fellow by the name of franklin delano roosevelt that never talked to the nation he never talked to the nation he talked to an individual citizen and therefore he communi cated there was another fellow who spoke the most beautiful english i have ever heard almost incomprehensibly parsed perfect would have passed any oxford english professors most critical look and that was herbert hoover and i dont think herbert hoo ver ever said hello to dog i dont think in his whole life he ever said anything to anybody anywhere and when this man uttered pronunciamentos they pronounced nothing to anybody anywhere and therefore he couldnt lead nation out of depression he couldnt lead anything for an excellent reason he had concept in the final analysis of talking to an individual of getting his communication to land right there now this is touchy point that i open up you say well how about you ron you talk to an awful lot of people well thats the whole secret of scientology i dont talk to an awful lot of people i talk to you i havent any concept of large multitude that reads my books or listens to my lectures i can get multiple concept of talkin g to great many at the same time by talking to every one of them individually therefore i perhaps add little conceit to the line but i do communicate therefore someone wanting to know how to speak to crowd would first begin with dear alice part so it is very very far from an unimportant step it is not just the entrance step that you have to get through to get your communication course over so you can really learn something that is not what it is it is the first door that opens and that doo r opens when it opens and it opens when you can communicate statement from you to person we wont worry about preclear because really the person in dummy auditing who is sitting there as preclear is really coach you know but youve got to get something across from you to that person and it has to be from you to that person it has to be communication and when you can do that well youre all set i once told somebody that if he had very difficult student not you but if he had very very difficult student the thing to do with this difficult student would be to put him through seven weeks of dummy auditing and then teach him in the last week to remedy havingness and turn him loose with certificate and it would be safe investment we w ould be perfectly safe in doing that but to give him one week when he needed two or three on dummy auditing and then try to cram him full of data and hope that the processes would carry him through somehow didnt make an auditor it made liability both to himself and to preclears so this first step is not just an easy ne it is toughest step youll perform in scientology and thats why its right at the beginning its to say something to somebody with the full confidence that they will receive it nd thats quite trick all right how exactly is this done we give person book the book is alice in wonderland why alice in wonderland well thats just because it is further significance we give him this book and he is supposed to find an sentence in that book that he cares to find these people who just want to read the book consecutively to the preclear are not doing dummy auditing they again are not in communication with the preclear he is supposed to find line now he doesnt pu t alice said or the queen said or something like that on the line he just puts the statement itself you see why do they run so fast well the book says why do they run so fast the queen asked well we dont use the queen asked we just sa why do they run so fast all right he picks that up out of the book why out of book why not out of his head oh remember remember something in using the english language you are not using your own ideas you did not invent the words you only helped invent the words that compose the english language you are already using somebody elses ideas now there is nothing wrong with your composing these into new ideas of your own but remember you are already using somebody elses ideas when youre s peaking english all right now lets get it little bit further we are given set pat process oh i know i dreamed it up i found it one way or the other but an awful lot of auditors worked with this its had lot of looking at and its become ph rased in certain way and that certain way might very well be taken by you out of the textbook and given to the preclear and it wont ever work if you do do fishes swim is not therapeutic procedure its not the repetition of it can be very good f or an auditor but its not therapeutic procedure but the statement do fishes swim is not yours really at the beginning is it you got it from the instructor or off of book and then you used it well when does it become yours well any idea is yours that you make yours we wont go along with dialectic materialism and say that ideas are new because thats not true there can be new ideas but if you get an idea from someone else it is not still their idea its your idea there is nothing wrong with misowning ideas theres mass in them to get you confused you take an idea out of book it becomes your idea and then as your idea you relay it to the preclear and that is all there is to it it is coached this way it is not from the boo k to the pre clear it is from the book to the auditor and then the auditor making it his own idea expresses that idea to the preclear in such way thane arrives at the preclear so its from the auditor to the preclear but we give him the book as the third via because most of the material he is going to handle in communication is from source outside himself youve just got to get used to the idea that there is nothing wrong with using another persons ideas i always know what someones state of arning is in scientology when they speak of scientology as your ideas they say ive been reading your ideas i know at once this person cant communicate its great oddity its quite wonderful because they reveal at once that they cannot take th is first basic step of taking an idea and then communicating it to someone else they are standing back looking at the world in some large sense and they are not any part of it because they cant own any of the worlds ideas if they cant own any of the worlds ideas then they wont own any of the world because the easiest thing to own is an idea mass to impede it so we coach just exactly in this way we want the person to find phrase in alice in wonderland and then taking that as his own idea communicate it directly to the preclear and he can say it over and over the same phrase if he wishes in any way he wishes to say it until the preclear who is really coach tells him that he thinks it has arrived now sometimes the preclear the firs t day feels just little bit strange about these communication lines too and sometimes has his entire criticism based upon the erudition the pronunciation the way the auditor holds his little finger while he announces the phrase this has nothing to d with it it is the intention that communicates not the words and when you have the intention to communicate to the preclear and that intention goes across it will arrive if you broadcast that intention matter if youre saying it in chinese if ure scientologist it will arrive one of the steps of the much higher indoctrination level tone 40 8 c consists entirely and completely of saying things in funny voice tones while one is communicating an intention using very odd voice tones well th is is not part of dear alice the voice tones are unimportant pronunciation is unimportant its whether or not the person could take that idea out of that book own it and then communicate it and the intention must communicate and it must be communicat ed in one unit of time that is to say it isnt repeated from the last time it was repeated it is new fresh communicated in present time the fifty fifth command of do fishes swim is the fifty fifth not the first repeated so we have one unit of one command and the intention and when we have those things relayed across then he can find another phrase and communicate that and that is the way we do that and i hope you find it helps communication l ron hubbard founder hubbard communicati ons

bored etc just in life and livingness this makes them rath er hard to live with but in an auditor it is fatal the mood of an auditor particularly if fixed and chronic can color the session and the results he obtains trs are matter of sound not how an auditor feels when an auditor has stuck or fixated m ood such as monotony timidity dullness showing up in his tr drills or in session this can slow up pcs progress or rough up or upset pc the auditors trs should sound live and interested and natural mood drills have been developed to handle fix ed uncontrolled or unsuitable tone levels in an auditor these drills consist of drilling tr 1 over and over at each tone level of the full tone scale hcob 25 sept 71rb rev 1478 tone scale in full you start low on the scale and do trs at each ton level in that tone then up to the next tone and the next ie tr 1 done over and over at dying then at the tone of useless and so on up the scale the coach simply has the student do tr 1 at the particular tone level so that the coach and the s tudent are both satisfied that the student has conveyed that tone and the student has win technical fact is that moods or emotions are usually automatic which means they are not necessarily under control but tend to control the person himself it is as if he is under other determinism technically you can take over the automaticity and put it under beings control just by having him consciously do it over and over you can also change chronic tone level by shifting persons attention from i t by making him do something else ref ability 36 and ability straightwire body position voice tone facial expression and attitude are all part of conveying the mood or tone level for example the student doing mood drills is on tr 1 working on the tone anger he gives line from alice in wonderland and it sounds bit weak coachs patter thats it it sounds bit gentle lets get some more g rrrr in it start student repeats the line but smiles bit although he sounds more angry coa ch thats it it sounded more angry but you smiled do it again you feel angry start student gives the line again this time frowning fiercely and in very snarly tone of voice leaning forward aggressively coach good do you feel you did it co ach continues until the student is certain he can do it easily the coach must be able to identify the various emotions and if he is in question about it the dictionary should be resorted to until both student and coach are in agreement on what the tone is or means and that it is being accurately and demonstrably expressed student drilling these must beware of us and the coach must make sure that he and the student both understand each mood tone any moods that are too easy to do should be spot ted by the coach and repeated until the automaticity is broken if mood is too hard for the student to master have him do tr 1 in different beingnesses eg timid student who is trying to sound antagonistic could be asked to do tr 1 as panther lion villain etc if you had him do it as timid bird or some such timid thing that would never be antagonistic you would probably have your student where he lived again do such things to student win and dont use it to harass him the whole poi nt is to get him to do tr 1 antagonistically these shifts of beingness help to shift his attention to an emotion he cannot easily do once begun mood drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the auditor doesnt get stuck on the tone s cale but can do any mood easily and without strain when an auditor is upset about his voice you can have him try speaking melodiously boringly enthusiastically until he can change his voice mood about at will mood drills should be done when the audi tor sounds mechanical or his tone is brushoff not interested or some set emotion an auditor can be drilled on assessments in the meter drill book with mood drills when his assessment is dull or monotonous any set emotion like sweet light and airy fairy or sad dreary deadly serious indifferent can be handled by drilling with mood drills fifty foot mood drills fiftyfoot mood drills can be used to cure fixed mood that doesnt seem to budge with regular mood drills student and coach go to an area where they can do some shouting without disturbance the coach and student are at least fifty feet apart and the mood drill is done as

theres the way of it if the pc is not sure he has answered and that the auditor has accepted the answer the pc will get benefit from the auditing and thats how important that is you can always spot bad auditor he does two things he talks too much to the pc and he stops the pc from properly answering add all the above to all training of students l ron hubbard founder lrhmdrdgm pab 149

dummy auditing step two acknowledgment compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard dummy auditing step two acknowledgment is the second part of the communication cycle now the actual fact is when you have gotten thought over to preclear it is customary to prove it the whole stress of acknowledgment is entirely and com pletely upon making sure that the preclear receives the auditors acknowledgment that is the entire stress now why all this stress on acknowledgment well acknowledgment is control factor ill just let you in on secret right here at the beginning if you acknowledge preclear well you will have the preclear under much better control now why the formula of control is start change and stop and thats just it an acknowledgment is stop if you said to him keep going or keep talking you would not be acknowledging him the perfect acknowledgment communicates only this i have heard your communication thats all there is to it i have heard what you said it signalizes that the preclears or persons since scientology applies to life not just to an auditing room communication to you has been received but when you use it as an auditor you use it also as control factor and it says this your communication has been received and that is all there is to it and that is the end of that cycle of action thank you thats what it says and you have to put that whole intention into yes or an okay or anything else you use it isnt the word its the intention that ends it your communication has been received and i have now decided to stop that cycle of communication and your communication is therefore under my control those things which you stop very crudely are things which you control you have to be able to stop things if you control them if you cannot control preclears communica tion line you cant control the preclear ill give you an example of this lets say were auditing mrs gotrocks the wife of the executive manager of fleabite dustpowder or something and she is bored the only thing wrong with her and shes crazy t hats the only other thing wrong with her and she never had anything to do and shes just been lying around and she has ailments she comes into the auditing room and she starts to talk to you she says oh ive been to this specialist and that speciali st and it cost this much money and that much money and ive been here and ive been there and whats really wrong with and what you really should take up is so and so rah rah rah its none of your business the longer you let such person talk t he less havingness they have you can watch them go straight down the arc tone scale if you keep on letting them talk obsessive communication obsessive outflow and the first major use that you will make of this the first time you really understand what this acknowledgment is all about is when somebody starts this on you and starts talking talking talking talking and you want to get session started and you get the intention real good and you say to them good and they stop talking your intent ion was such that they knew that you had received their communication and if you can do this very well if you can get that acknowledgment just right and if it does exactly what it is supposed to do very often the person will look at you fixedly and say you know i dont think anybody has ever heard before why is this person talking obsessively they are trying to make up in quantity what they lack in audience theres nobody listening to them they are not talking to anyone and you all of sudde n come up with an acknowledgment and say hey i heard you i heard that you have communicated to and thats it now and they say wow i dont think ive ever talked to anybody before its quite amazing i have seen an auditor on an obsessive ou tflow case get down in front of the preclear fix him with an eye move his finger back and forth just in front of the preclears nose and say good i heard that and have the preclear all of sudden say ooooh geeeeee you are there arent you so good acknowledgment can actually wind up the entire goal of the process and find the auditor thats how important it is now that is specialized use stopping compulsive outflow its general use is putting period to the communication cycle it nds the moment of time in which you gave the command you learned how to give we hope in dear alice part you said something the preclear heard it and we understood then that the preclear had heard it and we said good now the exact way dear alic part b which is dummy auditing step two is done is this the coach or person acting as preclear takes alice in wonderland and reads random phrases out of it and reading the phrase in any old way we dont care how were not disciplining the p reclear you know we never do that we merely control them within an inch of their lives in this particular case this person says something out of alice in wonderland and the auditor has to say good fine okay i heard that anything in such way as actually to convince the person who is sitting there acting as the preclear that he has heard it now there is specific way to do this that is to intend that the communication cycle ends at that point and to end it there anything that you do to make that come about is of course legitimate unless it utterly destroys arc but it finishes cycle of communication so what could the auditor in this case do you see there sits the auditor book there sits the preclear with book and the preclear is reading and the mad hatter dipped his watch into the teapot and the auditor says good but that ends that you see now in view of the fact that the preclear is reading continued story which goes on sentence after sentence after senten ce the auditor will have tendency to treat this as in passing and that is not an acknowledgment the auditor could say well read some more thats not an acknowledgment it didnt stop it did it continue go ahead thats not an acknowledg ment at all an acknowledgment says stop whoa air brakes period end heard you youve communicated thats the end of that moment of time final cycle thats ityouve had it you get that so the auditor has to say good fine okay in such way as to receive the communication in the preclears eyes the preclear has to know that the auditor has received the communication and thats the only point on which they are coached at first then we could start to bear down and s ay as an instructor well did you acknowledge that preclears communication did you and the auditor says well uhh did you do perfect acknowledgment well certainly and the answer to that would be the preclear is still reading st ill got the book in his hands still going on with it still sitting in the chair and hes still not in this universe what is this all about what are we actually trying to do well we are not trying to reach the ultimate in an acknowledgment because t hat would be the end of the universe if somebody could say yes good or okay with enough intention behind it all communications of this universe from the moment of its beginning would then be acknowledged totally except that this would violate t he communication formula because they werent all addressed to him although lots of people think they were but what does the auditor actually feel called upon to do well he feels called upon to put period to that cycle of communication it actually started you see with the auditors phrase to the preclear then the preclear signified with some kind of wince or grunt or something that it had been heard and then the auditor says well thats the end of that good fine that finished that you but an acknowledgment ends the cycle of the communication which you read about in dianetics 55 and that is the bill joe cycle good says the auditor this is fantastic if you got good enough at this traffic cop would drive up and say something to you and you would acknowledge the fact that he had spoken and he would simply get back on his bike or go back to the station house and turn in his badge and retire you see that would be the end of that that would be it as matter of fact it actual ly staggers people to have an acknowledgment come to them it staggers them really to get it through people who are having hard time particularly its good thing and its very therapeutic for person to know that he has been acknowledged i know t hat you will be around in the local stores maybe stopping pedestrian on the street and suddenly looking at him and saying good acknowledging him and you will have some fantastic things occur if you do an acknowledgment is very very powerful six teeninch gun in the communication formula and you shouldnt use it sparingly you should use it to end cycles of communication i hope

15 december 1958 dummy auditing step three duplication compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard this interesting interesting dummy auditing step has villainous and vicious goal it makes somebody duplicate way back in 1950 we found out that auditors in order to be inter esting would vary their pattern and every time the pattern was varied every time the auditing command changed the preclear received little jolt there was an upset because of it long time ago we would have considered it fairly legitimate for an au ditor using the auditing command do fishes swim to say by the way do finny creatures wiggle in the water and next time to say say does the finny tribe bathe and the next time to say what brands of fishes are there that progress from point to point b in liquid habitats that possibly would have been legitimate then but we dont do that today we do horrible thing the auditor says do fishes swim and just to vary it he then says do fishes swim and just for good wild variation h then says do fishes swim this is where we learn why we were so insistent on one command in one moment of time back in dear alice part because we dont repeat the first do fishes swim another thousand times auditing command should ever depe nd for any of its meaning on any other auditing command ever uttered each one exists theoretically and purely in its own moment of time and is uttered itself in present time with its own intention now this is quite important do you know that the basi c auditing process of cch does not work unless each command is in separate unit of time if you run it this way give your hand thank you give your hand thank you give your hand thank you its not very therapeutic and nothing happens to the pre clear why well weve got machine which is simply repeating the first give your hand over and over again were not saying it ther intention there do you know that if you told somebody to give you his hand with enough intention behin d it his body would respond without any via through the thetan the body doesnt obey the words the body obeys the intention to extend hand therefore when you are asked to express an auditing command with the same words over and over and over each you must express it in present time as itself with its intention it isnt just long duplication of it just duplicating something over and over and over is sometimes so trying that people wonder how auditors ever arrive at all nobody could sit in chair and say each time with new intention do fishes swim for seventy five hours its beyond human possibility according to some people but the trick is that if its always uttered in present time it could be said for thousand and seventy five hou rs its only when it is r epeated only when the first command is repeated over and over and when new intention arrives that it becomes very arduous only when it goes onto machine does it become almost impossible to do communication is reached by control plus duplication at first you find that to make each utterance of the command different in its own unit of time you use different voice inflections but as you come up the line on this you find out that you actually can pattern the same tone and each time have it entirely new it would be very very incorrect to teach this to have the auditor each time duplicate his own voice tones as they were the last time because that is making an auditing command depend on the last auditing command we could nt care less and after while you couldnt care less either what voice tone youre uttering but each intention is new and fres h the intention is to ask and get an answer to this question do fishes swim and each time you utter it it is uttered n ewly and in its own area of time thats really the only stress there is one command per unit of time each command separate and each command containing the words quite incidentally do fishes swim here we learn great deal about the duplicative fac tors of communication we find out that in having to duplicate we think we actually lose some of the communication at first its utterly idiotic how could you possibly maintain arc and therefore of course interest asking person over and over again this silly question do fishes swim who could do this well interest in communication has everything to do with the intention to be interesting and very little to do with text furthermore it is not the auditors job to be interesting being interesti ng is part of the communication formula but to an auditor the least possible part as far as the preclear is concerned hes not there to interest and intrigue the preclear right away people think they are place two people in chairs facing each other nd each one of these two people feels the compulsion to be interesting to the other thats not auditing thats being interesting thats being social and so on so if person had any difficulty doing step three do fishes swim the instructor would be perfectly in order if he simply told the person to sit in that chair and told some other student who wasnt doing too well or just some other student to sit in the other chair and told them just to sit there and look at each other without saying thing or being embarrassed or anything else interesting drill if you think of it we do have variation and therefore interest in the first and second dummy auditing steps but now we reach this one and it is utterly devoid of interest were saying the same thing over and over and over and over and if person cant do this he probably has compulsion to vary to alter is to be interesting and he wouldnt find it easy just to sit in chair and face another human being and not say word and not do thi ng but just sit there and look at the other human being and if i were coaching someone that had difficulty in repetition of steps i would do that for an hour or two that day all right it is absolutely necessary that an auditor be able to duplicate bu t answer this is person who is saying something in present time each time really duplicating the last moment of time he really isnt is he and so this duplication that we do in scientology means only the ability apparently to duplicate while being in present time the greatest motto of experience and the life we have lived is this i wont ever do that again this is the one thing your mama wanted you to promise if you did nothing else if you lived completely sinful life why mama still wante d you to learn by experience which is to say that when you did something wrong or did something you werent ever to do it again she hoped perhaps you would eat enough candy to make you so sick that you wouldnt wolf candy again that you would eat enough ice cream so that ice cream would make you so green that you wouldnt make pig of yourself over ice cream again that you would become so embarrassed and lose so many friends that you would not do that evil thing again whatever it was you did and thus learn by experience never to do it again and this is experience talking one thing you must understand that experience teaches you is never to do anything the second time this doesnt necessarily mean that all experience is painful but people who re having hard time tend to believe that it is and when they begin to depend upon experience and stand by this lesson of never doing it again they can longer duplicate and what do you know they cant communicate also their bank jams all sorts f interesting things occur all moments become one moment one moment becomes all moments identification occurs all over the place and just the action of repeating something like do fishes swim as an auditor with full intention has tendency to u njam the time track you should know that this is what this step is up against it is violating all of that hard won experience that you have accumulated in the last seventy six trillion years if you believe an meter youre seventy six trillion years ld and all that hardwon experience all that wonderful wonderful lot of mess that you got into added up completely to never do it again and so youve been taught not to live which is what happens when you get experience and when you can duplicate an auditing command over and over again you will find out that auditing does not become painful experience person who can do this well by the way never gets restimulated why should he hes not in the moment of time in which the restimulation took pl ace there is more basic step to this particular one by the way this is to pat the wall five times and then distinguish one of the pats from the rest an instructor can do that on student with some profit pretty soon the student can tell all five p ats apart and when the student can tell them all apart even though they sounded all the same he can also duplicate an auditing command in present time all the way ive broken cases with that one l ron hubbard founder hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 7 april 1964 cenocon all levels q and great number of auditors q anda this is because they have not understood what it is nearly all their auditing failures stem not from using wrong proce sses but from q and accordingly i have looked the matter over and redefined q and the origin of the term comes from changing when the pc changes the basic answer to question is obviously question if one follows the duplication of the comm formula completely see philadelphia congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully later definition was questioning the pcs answer another effort to overcome it and explain qa was the anti q and drill but none of these reached home the new definition is this q and is failure to complete cycle of action on preclear cycle of action is redefined as start continue complete thus an auditing comm cycle is cycle of action it starts with the auditor asking question the preclear can understand getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging that answer process cycle is selecting process to be run on the preclear running the tone arm action into it if necessary and running the tone arm action out of it prog ram cycle is selecting an action to be performed performing that action and completing it thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle before it is complete is q andaing this could be done by violating or prevent ing or not doing any part of the auditing cycle ie ask the pc question get an answer to different idea ask the different idea thus abandoning the original question an auditor who starts process just gets it going gets new idea because of pc cognition takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is q andaing program such as prepcheck this pcs family is begun and for any reason left incomplete to go chasing some new idea to prepcheck is q and unfinished cycles f action are all that louse up cases since time is continuum failure to carry out cycle of action continuum hangs the pc up at that exact point if you dont believe it prepcheck incomplete actions on pc what incomplete reaction has bee n suppr essed etc cleaning the meter for real on every button and youd have clear or pc that would behave that way on meter understand this and youll be about ninety times as effective as an auditor dont q anda means dont leave cycles of

publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via the hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london wl 1 january 1959 dummy auditing step four handling originations compiled from the research material and tape lectures of l ron hubbard the fourth thing an auditor has to do in that order is to handle an origin from the preclear it is actually true that when you are handling tone 40 processes you do not handle the preclears originations but if you will look on the hpahca chart you will find that these tone 40 processes are in the minority amongst processes and in all processes not tone 40 preclears originations are handled remember that dont let anybody talk you out of it if you are handling tone 40 which is just pure positive postulating you of course are not worried about anybodys opinion origin dition or anything else you simply want him to do certain things and he finds out that his beingness can be controlled and therefore that he can control it what do we mean by an origin of the preclear he volunteers something all on his own and do you know that is very good index of case whether the per volunteers anything on his own an old time auditor used this as case index he said this fellow isnt getting any better he hasnt offered up anything yet you see he didnt originate he d idnt originate communication do you know that that is the hardest thing to get an organization to do to originate communication you actually could work in the direction of getting preclear to originate communication in spite of the fact that you just previously were running him on tone 40 processes he originated the communication that his arms and legs felt like they were just going to fall off and you said give your hand thank you preclear says my heads coming off now i know its going to fall on the floor auditor give your hand thank you good tone 40 but on control of person the first two processes are tone 40 but book mimicry and the next process up the line from it hand space mimicry are not tone 40 and originati ons by the preclear are not only handled but encouraged so remember that we have not lost out of the galaxy of processes the fact that the preclear is as well as he can originate communication that means he can stand at cause on the communication formu and that is desirable point for him to reach you see in controlling people we are really only showing them that they can be controlled that it is possible for their possessions to be controlled and then they eventually decide that these are contr ollable and that people are controllable and that things are controllable and their bodies are controllable and they say wonderful look ill try and before that they didnt even try so we are controlling persons possessions or body only until this person then himself decides to take hand in it too and then he finds out that control is possible but most people dont originate circuits originate computers originate compulsive outflows originate and when you first start to use tone 40 on person you will apparently see originations but they are not originations they are restimulations being dramatized there is big difference between restimulation being dramatized and an origination its whether or not the thetan said it did he say it or was it just circuit starting up well you can start up circuits and actually throw them into being and you will see that these are not originations but when an origination appears in anything but tone 40 process you handle it and you must handle it well and conclusively there are preclears who have had astonishing things happen to them who have tried to communicate them to the auditor who have failed to do so and have then sunk into apathy and just gone right on out of session because t heir communication origination was not handled properly by the auditor there are instances of this and many of them tone 40 processes do not particularly violate this an understanding of what they are takes place rather rapidly with the preclear and he doesnt expect you to but if he has graduated into being human being and hes getting up there and he originates something and you answer it now hes liable to say the most astonishing things to you and if you dont handle them hes liable to drop i nto apathy about the whole thing so you must handle them well because theyre always unexpected i would say that unexpectedness actually should be part of the definition of an origination because they are quite often completely off the subject they ta ke you completely by surprise they are apparently not at all what you expected him to say the fellow says huh im eight feet back of my head well what do you do in the old days we might have gone right onto route one but we dont today we handle the origination by the way this used to be an old technical phrase he q andaed in other words he did what the preclear did any time the preclear changed the auditor changed that is the deadliest crime in auditing the preclear changes because he is being processed and the auditor changes the process q and the preclear changed the auditor changed well that isnt what you do he says you know the whole back of my head feels like its on fire once upon time we might have handled this we might have gone right in there and said oh thats very good we had finally gotten somatic on this fellow and we would have handled it in some fashion or other and questioned him about it and audited it and so on but we found out that this stu ck people on the time track therefore we do not do that any more so what do we do when he says the back of my head is on fire do we ignore it well if we are running tone 40 processes we ignore it but if we are auditing any other process of whic h there are many in cch we handle the origin and an auditor who has not been trained to do this will often find himself very embarrassed but how about in the walk away world the world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly or noisily as the case may be do you ever have to handle an origin in it well i dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not handle an origin every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody you can trace it back along the l ine you didnt handle if person walks in and says whee ive just passed with the highest mark in the whole school and you say im awfully hungry shouldnt we go out and eat youll find yourself in fight he feels ignored he originated com munication to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents dont handle their originations properly handling an origination merely tells the person all right i heard it youre there you might say it is form of acknowledgment but its not it is the communication formula in reverse but the auditor is still in control if he handles the origin otherwise the communication formula goes out of his control and he is at effect point longer at cause point an auditor continues at cause point so lets look this over the handling of an origin has great deal of use and until recently it was the least pat step in scientology how did you handle an origin and we f inally found out i finally had cognition myself i tried for long time to communicate this to people and they still blundered on it occasionally and i finally found out something that did seem to communicate there are three steps in handling an orig in here is the setup the preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear and the auditor is saying do fishes swim or do birds fly and the preclear says yes here is the factor now entering do fishes swi m the preclear doesnt answer do fishes swim the preclear says you know your dress is on fire or im eight feet back of my head or is it true that all cats weigh 18 kilograms you see wog wog where did this come from well although it is us ually circuitry or something like that at work when its that far off beam it is nevertheless an origin how do you handle it well you dont want the preclear to go out of session and he would if you handled it wrongly so 1 you answer it 2 you maintain arc you dont spend any time at it but you just maintain arc and 3 you get the preclear back on the process one two three and if you spend too much time in 2 youll be doing wrong what is an origin all right he says im eight fe et back of my head its an origin what are you supposed to do with it well youre supposed to answer it in this particular case you would say to him something in the order of you are you mean something like ive heard the communication its m ade an effect on now in maintaining arc you can skimp that second one if you handle the third one expertly enough the least important one is the second one but the most deadly thing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining ar c thats deadly but you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one which is to say get him back into session so he says im eight feet back of my head and you say you are what he said really hit you know hes kind of wog wog about this hes not sure what this is all about you say you are and the fellow says yes well you say what did i say that made that happen oh you said do birds fly and i thought of myself as bird and i guess thats the way it is bu t i am eight feet back of my head well thats pretty routine you say reassure him maintain the arc now what was that auditing question oh you asked do birds fly and you say thats right do birds fly back in session you see you cant do this you cant put it into can and put label on it and say this is how you do it always because its always something peculiar but you can say these three steps are followed i will give you another example you say do birds fly and he says i have blinding headache you do you say is it bothering you thats the arc too much to carry on with the session and youve reached number three at once oh its pretty bad though well lets go on with this shall we u say maybe itll do something with it maintaining arc he says well all right and youre right back onto it again do birds fly one of the trickiest of these is what in my question reminded you of that the fellow says well so and so and he explains it to you and you say well good do birds fly and youre right back in session again three parts and that is the important thing you have to learn how to handle these things at the same time that we are doing this we can get much more complicated particularly toward the end of the session by just trying out communication bridge communication bridge from do birds fly to do fishes swim and from do fishes swim back to do birds fly communication bridge is very easy thing it simply closes off the process you were running maintains arc and opens up the new process on which you are about to embark if you could look at it as two vs the points facing each other with line between the bottoms of the two vs you wou ld see that one process which you have been running is closed on down to nothing easily by gradients you say how about running this just three or four more times and then well quit okay we give him warning you see that were closing the process off and we do run it three or four more times then we say how are you doing we never ask people by the way how do you feel this as ises havingness we say how are you doing and he says oh not too badly and so on well did anythin g happen there while we were running do fishes swim and he says i dont know i got little bit of reality i felt like fish for couple of moments there auditor says how do you feel about that and so on is it okay are you doing all right now the preclear says not too badly you say well lets go over onto do birds fly its an interesting process and it just goes like this i ask you do birds fly and you answer how about running that and he says well all right okay you establish agreement again and away we go actually it is three contracts in row the first contract is to stop the process we are running the next contract is we are in an auditing session binding this as continuing auditing session and the th ird contract is simply we have new process we would like to run and i want your signature on this dotted line that you will run it that actually is communication bridge the reason we do this is so preclear will not be startled by change for if we change too rapidly in session we stick the preclear in the session every time we give him some warning and that is what communication bridge is for the handling of origins however is most important learn how to handle origins and youll never be taken by surprise by preclear youll be right in there pitching and the session will keep on i have seen an auditor sit with his mouth open for twenty or thirty seconds after some preclear said something fantastic he just didnt know what to make f it well you answer it you maintain arc and you get him back in session l ron hubbard founder hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 october

your goal when you are coaching that the student is going to get the training drill correct be purposeful in working toward obtaining this goal whenever you correct the student as coach just dont do it with reason with purpose have the purpose in mind for the student to get better understanding of the training drill and to do it to the best of his ability 2 coach with reality be realistic in your coaching wh you give an origination to student really make it an origination not just something that the sheet said you should say so that it is as if the student was having to handle it exactly as you say under real conditions and circumstances this does not mean however that you really feel the things that you are giving the student such as saying to him my leg hurts this does not mean that your leg should hurt but you should say it in such manner as to convey to the student that your leg hurts ano ther thing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with be inventive in present time 3 coach with an intention behind all your coaching should be your intention that by the end of the session your student will be aware tha t he is doing better at the end of it than he did at the beginning the student must have feeling that he has accomplished something in the training step matter how small it is it is your intention and always should be while coaching that the studen t you are coaching be more able person and have greater understanding of that on which he is being coached 4 in coaching take up only one thing at time for example using tr 4 if the student arrives at the goal set up for tr 4 then check ov er one at time the earlier trs is he confronting you does he originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really intend for you to receive it are his acknowledgments ending the cycles of communication etc but only coach these thin gs one at time never two or more at time make sure that the student does each thing you coach him on correctly before going on to the next training step the better student gets at particular drill or particular part of drill you should deman d as coach higher standard of ability this does not mean that you should be never satisfied it does mean that person can always get better and once you have reached certain plateau of ability then work toward new plateau as coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coaching never allow yourself to do sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your student disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice if you are ever in doub t about the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing then the best thing is to ask the supervisor he will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct materials in coaching never give an opinion as such but always give our directions as direct statement rather than saying i think or well maybe it might be this way etc as coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are obtained on the student this does not mean of course that ou are totally responsible but that you do have responsibility toward the student and the session make sure you always run good control on the student and give him good directions once in while the student will start to rationalize and justify what he is doing if he is doing something wrong he will give you reasons why and becauses talking about such things at great length does not accomplish very much the only thing that does accomplish the goals of the tr and resolves any differences is doing th training drill you will get further by doing it than by talking about it in the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under training stress and purpose on the training sheet these training drills occasionally have tend ency to upset the student there is possibility that during drill student may become angry or extremely upset or experience some misemotion should this occur the coach must not back off he should continue the training drill until he can do it wi thout stress or duress and he feels good about it so dont back off but push the student through whatever difficulty he may be having there is small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when he has gotten the drill right or he has done good job on particular step besides correcting wrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness you very definitely flunk the student for anything that amounts to self coaching the reason for this is that the student wil l tend to introvert and will look too much at how he is doing and what he is doing rather than just doing it as coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and dont become so interested in what you yourself are doing that you neglect the student and are unaware of his ability or inability to do the drill correctly it is easy to become interesting to student to make him laugh and act up bit but your main job as coach is to see how good he can get in each training drill and th at is what you should have your attention on that and how well he is doing to large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coaching being good coach produces auditors who will in turn produce good results on their precl ears good results produce

then make case gain when an auditor has smooth usual trs does his metering expertly and without attracting the pcs attention when he follows the auditors code particularly regarding evaluation and invalidation and when he is interested not interest ing as an auditor the pc cognites and makes case gain further according to the axioms bank straightens out by as ising its content if the pcs attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so as ising cannot occur the definition of in session is interested in own cas and willing to talk to the auditor when this definition describes the session in progress then of course the pc will be able to as is and will cognite by dianetics the original thesis the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pcs bank when the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc it is this situation which gives pc low tone arm an auditor who cant be heard doesnt ack doesnt give the pc the next command fails to handle origins s imply has out trs the auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc who overacks who laughs loudly is pulling the pcs attention onto himself so the pcs attention not being on his bank doesnt as is or cognite the auditor whose metering bypa sses fns or calls fns at wrong points or who tells the pc that reads that blew down etc or who any other way uses the meter distractingly the pc knows when he is being under or overrun and knows when he is being mismetered is of course violat ing the definition of in session the pcs attention goes to the meter not his bank so he doesnt as is or cognite auditor invalidation and evaluation is just plain villainy it interferes with pc cognitions other code breaks are similarly distractive perfect session if you understand the exact definition of in session if you understand the pcs necessity to have his attention on his bank so as to as is it and work out what is really going on in session that brings about cognition as ising berration with realization about life you will then be able to spot all the things in trs metering and the code that would prevent case gain once you see that out trs mismetering and code breaks would prevent the in session definition you will see what would impede pc from as ising and cogniting when you have this figured out you will then be able to see clearly what are intrs correct metering and correct code application there can be an infinity of wrongnesses there are only few rightn esses recognition of right trs right metering and right code use depend

became all too obvious through review of the video taped trs of special corps of auditors as well as those from piloted t rs courses that students seemed to have become incapable of mastering the trs this presented mystery as i have always been able to teach trs effectively in about weeks time give or take few days once the student has his basics in its done by simply getting the student to do it as trs are neither think action nor subjective action theyre practical drills on the comm cycle theres nothing subjective about them trs are doingness but we suddenly had entire corps of student auditors unable to master these drills what had happened to the teaching of trs good many months were spent in isolating exactly what had gone wrong and it has now all been boiled down to very few factors 1 hard trs had been dropped out 2 doing the commun ication formula in clay had been omitted those were the two major points of change and when these two were omitted that was it that was the end of anybody being able to do trs one cant master trs without familiarity with the comm cycle one cant ma ster trs with permissive patacake drilling trs are gotten in by drilling them hard it is one thing to try to teach hard trs to raw public and it is quite another to make an auditor people studying to become auditors have to be made into auditors its all right to teach mild trs course in division 6 and one should but when it comes to making auditors there is substitute for hard trs somewhere along the line doing the communication formula in clay as the beginning part of the trs course was dropped out this left the student with slightest concept of why he was doing trs the communication formula is scientology discovery and when you omit teaching it the student suffers from out basics so the omission of doing the communication formu in clay on trs course was fatal there were also three additional factors found to be further influencing the scene 3 student auditors had real understanding of the arc triangle thus their communication was stuck because their affinity and reali ty and therefore their understanding were deficient 4 the lack of bona fide trs checksheet had opened the way for all kinds of false data to be entered into the subject 5 ignorance of the end phenomena of trs course or why they were doing trs the r esult of this past years study and piloting and the isolation of these factors has now culminated in full and final trs course which will be issued very soon in unalterable book form meantime this bulletin is being issued as holding action to make these errors and omissions in the teaching and drilling of trs broadly known so that they can be remedied at once wherever auditor trs are being taught omitted checksheet and false data since the cancellation of hco pl 24 may 71 the professional tr course there has been real trs checksheet complete with the basics of communication and the theory of communication which underlie the trs that was huge out basic right there trs as drills appeared on various checksheets sometimes with several acc ompanying bulletins but omitted was any thorough preliminary insequence study of the theory upon which the trs are based here we had course without checksheet which made it possible for false data to spring in from various quarters and so it did it wasnt that people were willfully entering false data into the subject it was simply that there was standard checksheet which took the student through the true data and only the true data on the simple basics the arc triangle and the communicati on formula underlying the trs and then the trs drills themselves with that situation you can get all kinds of false data coming into an area and that is exactly what was found almost one for one the students coming onto the special piloted courses cond ucted this past year were ridden with false data various types of think and figure figure and alter is of the tech of the trs number of btbs and bpls on the subject contributed to this scene and actually perpetrated outtech in the area and these h ave now been cancelled by specific title by hcob 8 aug 83 cancellation of issues on trs which lists and corrects the outnesses these issues introduced further handling is to give the student the true data on communication and trs as covered in the chapters on arc in the problems of work and scientology the fundamentals of thought the chapters on communication in dianetics 55 and hcob 16 aug 71r training drills remodernized as he studies this one then digs up and strips off the false data ccumulated on the subject or drill using hco pl 7 aug 79 false data stripping where false data on subject exists it hits immediately and directly up against the true data and until this conflict is blown by false data stripping the person can be untrainable on the subject thus this brand new tech tool false data stripping is and has been tremendously useful in correcting tr outnesses and ensuring correct training on the trs it might be noted in passing that the most false subject on the plan et at this time is psychology because the mission of psychologist is government one to make the population into controllable zombies the subject is being taught earlier and earlier in schools and lot of your students and even supervisors have been subjected to this propaganda and false data about man and the mind i recall that the people it took longest to get through trs courses were professional psychologists the basis of this is false data they are loaded with it it is not that psychology teaches anything about communication they never heard of the subject until we came along but that they simply have so many false data about life that they actually cant study or drill in life subject such as scientology and you may find it necessary to clean this up this prevents horrible slows on trs courses its not an action that would be done in the course of course but would be done in review the communication formula in clay the trs are drills on the various parts of the communication formul this basic datum seems to have become obscured in recent years it appeared that to many trs were considered to be drills that were done for the sake of doing drills with only some vague accompanying idea of their actual use or application or how th ey related to auditing and an auditing session the truth of the matter is that trs are simply the drills that enable person to polish and perfect his comm cycle but if one doesnt know what the cycle of communication is to begin with if one isnt to tally familiar with the various parts of the communication formula the trs as drills are not going to make much sense to him drilling becomes struggle because he doesnt even know what it is hes trying to handle so one of the first things trs stud ent needs is sound understanding of the communication formula the way to learn the communication formula is to do it in clay that defines it puts it there in the physical universe for him by demonstrating the communication formula all of its parts in clay he will actually see how it works it becomes real to him now he knows what it is hes drilling unfortunately with the cancellation of the 24 may 71 trs checksheet the basic action of demonstrating the communication formula in clay was dropp ed out and with that real understanding of the use of trs was obscured for many representing the comm formula in clay is now reinstated firmly as vital preliminary step to drilling trs use of the arc triangle even below an understanding of the co mmunication formula comes an understanding of the arc triangle now we are getting more basic this turned up as very interesting technical factor in reviewing countless tr video tapes this past year it was actually very interesting technical bug i studied and studied these flunked video tr sessions to find the common denominator of all of them and i finally nailed it what i found was that they were specializing in c communication on the arc triangle they were specializing in c but what was out was their affinity and r reality and their c was being pegged it would go up just so far because they werent anywhere up the line on their and r as result they couldnt understand anything the other guy was saying most of the f lubs were on this basis they didnt have any pc there they werent listening to what the pc said the arc was out the bottom the person gets stuck without full use of the arc triangle you can raise the communication level but then you have to raise t he reality and then you have to raise the affinity and then you get some understanding only then can you continue to improve each point of the triangle on most of those videos they were stuck with the communication being raised just bit and that was that because they werent raising the affinity and reality levels along with it so they did not advance or improve handling is to make sure the student gets very sound understanding of the arc triangle and its use before he tackles the trs this c an be accomplished by having him represent it in clay using the chapters on arc in scientology the fundamentals of thought and the problems of work and chapter 7 of dianetics 55 when he knows how and r and c interrelate and how theyre used to bring about understanding hes then prepared to really grasp the communication formula and when he has good familiarity with the communication formula he can drill the trs and polish up his own communication cycle and improve with comparative ease trs the hard way when trs the hard way slipped out of use and permissive trs entered the picture the results were less competent auditors and less case gain for pcs auditor trs must be taught rough tough and hard this does not mean invalidative drilling or coaching or supervision it does mean you get the student to do the trs hes got to drill the trs not figure figure on them or dive into his case to avoid them trs the hard way means stringent spot on coaching and supervision on the proper gradient each button found on the student is flattened before it is left flunks are given when the student flunks and when he flunks he goes right back in again and he drills it until hes got it the trs are taught and drilled per the 16 aug 71r bulletin trai ning drills remodernized and per the advices in hcob 8 aug 83 cancellation of issues on trs the student is coached to wins not losses you make sure he understands the drill and after that its matter of his doing it its matter of keeping him t it getting him through it regardless of what buttons crop up to be flattened until hes mastered each tr and can handle any comm cycle with ease permissive namby pamby pat acake trs have place in the training of an auditor or on bona fide tr s course student who hasnt mastered his trs wont master any of the training that follows them the way to master trs is to drill them the hard way it is hard trs that make an auditor more gradient approach to trs would be taken on the has course where the new scientologist is getting his first taste of how to handle communication in his everyday life and livingness given sound training on the basics arcu and the formula of communication with any false data stripped off and the student then d rilled on trs the hard way to perfection youll find he comes through with flying colors to smooth flubless comm cycle and it doesnt take year or even months to accomplish it end phenomenon of trs as the students really had idea of the commu nication formula as such due to the omission of the requirement that they do it in clay and learn it they of course didnt know where they were going surprising number of students were heard making stupid remarks like i would never use the trs in au diting which is about the same as saying i would never use food when i eat practically students on trs courses had any idea why they were doing trs or what had to be achieved in order to be finished product on trs course this unfortunately included the supervisors and of course the coaches so one got all sorts of silly invalidative evaluative teaching and coaching if they didnt know where they were going and what the end phenomenon of trs course was of course they couldnt train student toward it and so trs courses which would only involve week or two turned into months and months of floundering around due to miscoaching and mainly destructive criticism which had purpose instruction and coaching are not based on opinion they should be based on producing the end phenomenon the primary valuable final product of trs is professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor the secondary valuable final product of trs is person with the session and social presence of professional auditor and that presence can be summed up as being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation matter how rough the end phenomenon of trs is being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out thats the ep and thats the direction all instruction and coaching must take each tr must be in against the standard above as we know the communication formula and as the trs are parts of it the end phenomenon can be achieved relatively rapidly it is that we know for the first time in mans history the communication formula that makes it possi ble to drill people on it and produce the above end phenomenon this was major point that was being missed that one was trying to produce something if you dont know what youre trying to produce it can take forever cant it prerequisite

other end as any kind of product until hes had his drugs handled you now have the purification rundown to handle that along with objectives and the drug rundown with this fantastic new rundown which is an undercut to all training and processing we have the means to make even the seemingly untrainable trai nable summary i wanted to let you know what has been happening in regard to trs study and training over the past year and what bugs have now been uncovered each of the points taken up in this bulletin have now been solved you will have very complete professional trs course released in book form in the near future meantime the materials exist and are available on which to train students in trs and do so very effectively therefore this issue is your license to include on any current

supervisors cycling through trs on pro fessional tr course cycling through trs on professional tr course has been given new definition and action newly defined cycling on trs means student drills the trs each to pass until he sticks and then he is put back on the lower tr he didnt pass one reason for this is it has been found conclusively that when student is flunking on lower tr he cannot do an upper tr the obvious handling then is to get him standardly through the lower tr and then graduate him up to the next one originally cycling through trs meant the student went up through the trs one by one getting familiar with them and getting little bit of win on each tr before going to the next one then he went back to the beginning and cycled through the trs in this fa shion again and again until he achieved full pass on all the trs the gradient of toughness was supposed to be increased each time through that system however opened the door to permissiveness and resulted in students taking interminable lengths of t ime on tr courses permissiveness has place on any professional tr course nor does it require months to learn to do trs correctly the time honored way it was done even earlier when trs were being rapidly passed was to simply get student through eac h tr itself students do make it when hammered through each tr in turn until they get full pass on that tr before going on to the next tr that is the rough tough way it was done earlier with success and it has also proven successful more recently there is another vital factor upon which this hinges however and that is that the student must have an understanding of the arc triangle and the cycle of communication and he must have done the full comm cycle in clay with those basics in and each tr then drilled and passed in turn we get results thus we arrive at new definition for cycling through trs and we arrive at the following rules on professional trs done the hard way students drill each tr to pass one at time if student has tro uble and hangs up and cant pass an upper tr he hasnt made it on lower tr put him back on the lower tr he didnt pass and get through it to real pass he then re drills each tr from that point up each competently to pass if student hangs up on the lower trs put him all the way back to restudy arc and the cycle of communication as there is something there he hasnt grasped
