enforcement act calea pl 103414 47 usc 10011010 enacted october 25 1994 is intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement officials to conduct electronic surveillance effectively and efficiently despite the deployment of new digital technologies and wireless services that have altered the character of electronic surveillance calea requires telecommunications carriers to modify their equipment facilities and services wherever reasonably achievable to ensure that they are able to comply with authorized electronic surveillance actions since 2004 the federal communications commission fcc has been considering number of questions as to how to apply calea to new techno logies such as v oice over internet protocol v oip in august 2005 in response to march 2004 petition by group of law enforcement agencies the fcc released notice of proposed rulemaking and declaratory ruling which required providers of certain broadband and interconnected v oip services to accommodate law enforcement wiretaps the fcc found that these services could be considered replacements for conventional telecommunications services already subject to wiretap rules including circuit switched voice service and dialup internet access the order is limited to facilitiesbased broadband internet access service providers and v oip providers that offer services that use the public switched telephone network interconnected v oip providers in may 2006 the fcc addressed several outstanding issues regarding calea implementation among other clarifications the fcc 1 affirmed its may 14 2007 compliance deadline for facilitiesbased broadband internet access and interconnected v oip services and clarified that the date applied to all such providers 2 explained that the fcc does not plan to intervene in the standardssetting process in this matter 3 permitted telecommunications carriers the option of using trusted third parties to assist in meeting their calea obligations 4 restricted the availability of compliance extensions to equipment facilities and services deployed prior to october 25 1998 5 found that the fcc may enforce action under section 229a of the communications act against carriers that fail to comply with calea and 6 concluded that carriers are responsible for calea development and implementation costs for postjanuary 1 1995 equipment and facilities and declined to adopt national surcharge to recover calea costs in june 2006 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the fccs decision concluding that v oip and facilitiesbased broadband internet access providers have calea obligations similar to those of telephone companies

federal bureau of investigation fbi asked congress for legislation to assist law enforcement agencies to continue conducting electronic surveillance the fbi argued that the deployment of digital technologies in public telephone systems was making it increasingly difficult for law enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance of communications over public telephone networks as result of these arguments and concerns from the telecommunications industry1 as well as issues raised by groups advocating protection of privacy rights2 the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea was enacted on october 25 1994 47 usc 10011021 in the final days of the 103rd congress calea is intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement officials to conduct electronic surveillance effectively and efficiently despite the deployment of new digital technologies and wireless services by the telecommunications industry calea requires telecommunications carriers to modify their equipment facilities and rvices to ensure that they are able to comply with authorized electronic surveillance these modifications were originally planned to be completed by october 25 1998 since that time the federal communications commission fcc issued two additional orders establishing june 30 2002 as the date by which telecommunications carries must have upgraded all their systems 3 equipment manufacturers have fulfilled their obligation to provide calea solutions and carriers are implementing them the fbi and fcc continue to monitor and review the implementation of this program

electronic surveillance has become more complex and legal ambiguities have been introduced as background to understanding the problems associated with calea implementation the definitions of several terms are necessary electronic surveillance refers to either the interception of communications content as in conversation also known as wiretapping or the acquisition of callidentifying information the number dialed the latter activity is accomplished through the use of pen register devices which capture callidentifying information for numbers of outgoing calls from the location of lawful interception and traps and traces which capture information for numbers received at the location of lawful interception much like consumer caller id systems under current federal law law enforcement ie police or the fbi must obtain court order before conducting any of these activities however wiretap requires higher evidentiary burden than pen register or trap and trace including showing 1 in this report the telecommunicati ons industry includes common carrier telephone companies mobile wireless telecommunications providers telecommunications equipment manufacturers and other entities that provide telecommunications services to the public 2 privacy rights groups involved in the calea debate include the electronic privacy information center the electronic frontier foundation advocacy groups which both support online privacy rights of individuals the center for democracy and technology which also advocates electronic privacy and is funded primarily by the telecommunications computer and media industries and the american civil liberties union aclu which represents broad array of civil rights based on the first and fourth amendments 3 united states department of justice

committing one of list of specific crimes4 under traditional analog technology it was easy to separate the above categories of electronic surveillance however the advent of digital signal transmission technologies has made that distinction less clear information signals voice or data can be transmitted over telephone networks in one of two ways circui tswitched and packetswitched modes5 in circuitswitched systems communications path is established between the parties and dedicated exclusively to one conversation for the duration of the call in packetswitched systems the information is broken down into smaller pieces called packetsusing digital process each packet contains small part of the message content along with callidentifying information called header that indicates the origination and destination points of the information each packet is transmitted separately and is reassembled into the complete message at the destination point the packetswitched mode is the signal transmission technology used in all internet communications packet switching is considered more efficient use of network than circuit switching because the same line can be used for multiple communications simultaneously although the circuitswitched mode was historically used in all voice telephone calls the packet switched mode is increasingly being used for voice and data transmissions over telephone networks g5g3g14g7g3g514g156g561g15g138g146g151g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 calea requires telecommunications carriers to assist law enforcement in performing electronic surveillance on their digital networks pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization the telecommunications industry privacy rights groups and law enforcement agencies agree that calea was not intended to expand law enforcements authority to conduct electronic surveillance on the contrary calea was intended only to ensure that after law enforcement obtains the appropriate legal authority carriers will have the necessary capabilities and sufficient capacity to assist law enforcement in conducting digital electronic surveillance regardless of the specific telecommunications systems or services deployed calea 47 usc 1002 directs the telecommunications industry to design develop and deploy solutions that meet certain assistance capability requirements for telecommunications carriers to support law enforcement in the conduct of lawfullyauthorized electronic surveillance pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization carriers must be able within certain limitations to 1 expeditiously isolate all wire and electronic communications of target transmitted by the carrier within its service area 2 expeditiously isolate callidentifying information that is reasonably available on target 3 provide intercepted communications and callidentifying information to law enforcement and 4 carry out intercepts unobtrusively so targets are not made aware of the electronic surveillance and in manner that does not compromise the privacy and security of other communications 4 see crs report 98326 privacy an overview of federal statutes governing wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping by gina marie stevens and charles doyle 5 switches are network devices that select path or circuit for sending data to its next destination over the telephone network switches may also include functions of the router device also used in computer networks that determines the route and adjacent network point for data to be sent

wiretaps calea 47 usc 1003 requires the attorney general to determine the number of simultaneous interceptions law enforcement agencies estimate of their maximum capacity requirements that telecommunications carriers must be able to support to maintain privacy rights of individuals ca lea 47 usc 1004 requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that any interception of communications or access to callidentifying information that is conducted within their premis can only be done with court order it also requires the specific intervention of an officer or employee of the carrier acting in accordance with regulations prescribed by the federal communications commission fcc calea 47 usc 1005 directs telecommunications carriers to consult with telecommunications equipment manufacturers to develop equipment necessary to comply with the capability and capacity requirements identified by the fbi for efficient industrywide implementation of the above requirements calea 47 usc 1006 directs the law enforcement community to coordinate with the telecommunications industry and state utility commissions to develop suitable technical standards and establish compliance dates for equipment in its eighth annual report the fbi stated that to date most manufacturers have either complete or nearly complete calea solutions available for their carrier customers 6 calea 47 usc 1008 gives the attorney general subject to the availability of appropriations authority to pay telecommunications carriers for all reasonable costs directly associated with the modifications performed by carriers in connection with equipment facilities and services installed or deployed on or before january 1 1995 known as the grandfather date

nationwide effort on behalf of federal state and local law enforcement agencies fbi officials initially anticipated that it would take year for standard to be developed and agreed upon by law enforcement the telecommunications carriers and the equipment manufacturers telecommunications consultants estimated that it would take the industry another three years to design build and deploy new systems to comply with calea instead industry and law enforcement became involved in protracted dispute over what should be required for law enforcements wiretapping capabilities by march 1997 the completion of the capability standard was overdue by 16 months the fbi attempted to expedite the industrys implementation of calea by releasing regulations that included cost recovery plan for the federal governments payment of costs associated with calea as well as capability and capacity requirements for the industry to meet the plan required more extensive upgrades to networks than the telecommunications industry believed were necessary for law enforcement to preserve its wiretapping capabilities industry groups and 6 eighth annual report p 5

was attempting to expand its surveillance capabilities beyond the congressiona l intention of calea and was attempting to unfairly shift costs and accountability away from the federal government onto private industry furthermore the industry argued that without an adopted capability standard it could not begin designing manufacturing and purchasing the equipment to achieve calea compliance in december 1997 the telecommunications industry association tia representing telecommunications equipment manufacturers adopted over the objections of the law enforcement community technical standard jstd025 also known as the jstandard this standard prescribes upgrades to network devices to meet caleas assistance capability requirements for local exchange cellular and broadband personal communications services pcs although the fbi claimed that the jstandard did not provide all of the capabilities needed the industry asserted that caleas language stated that telecommunications carriers would be compliant if they met publicly available standards adopted by the industry privacy rights groups on the other hand protested two aspects of the jstandard that they asserted would make information beyond what is legally required available to law enforcement one was feature enabling the telecommunications network to provide location information for users of mobile wireless telecommunications services the location information protocols in jstd025 allow law enforcement agencies to obtain information on the physical location of the nearest cell site ie the receivertransmitter antenna and base station of mobile phone handsets at the beginning and end of each call wireless carriers are now deploying another technology called triangulation that will enable the carriers and law enforcement to track wireless telephone users more precisely potentially within few meters the other was feature enabling the network to access packetmode data from telephone calls using more advanced systems privacy rights groups argued that these capabilities would violate the fourth amendment rights of individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures despite these objections telecommunications manufacturers began designing new switches and upgrades to existing switches according to the jstandard currently equipment manufacturers have successfu lly incorporated the jstandard into their new equipment and carriers are now well underway w ith their efforts to upgrade their systems

enforcement officials claimed they needed to facilitate digital wiretapping as result in march 1998 the fbi petitioned the fcc to require the telecommunications industry to adopt eleven additional capabilities industry and privacy rights groups protested that the fbis plan would unlawfully expand enforcement capabilities eventually the punchlist 7 included the following six8 items 7 the punch list was named as such by the telecommunications industry which believed the fbi was improperly forcing industry to comply with the fbis requirements 8 the additional capabilities originally requested

fbi announced its estimated capacity requirements for local exchange cellular and broadband pcs 10 the industry protested the fbis estimates arguing that it would require telephone carriers to accommodate thousands of wiretaps simultaneously an impractical and unnecessary burden in july 1998 the fbi developed guidelines and procedures to facilitate small carrier compliance with its capacity requirements and asked carriers to identify any systems or services that did not have the capacity to accommodate those requirements in december 1998 the fbi began proceeding to develop capacity requirements for services other than local exchange cellular and broadband pcs asked additional questions of interested parties in june 2000 11 these technologies and services included paging mobile

communications 2 ensure that authorized interceptions are performed 3 maintain secure and adequate records of any interceptions and 4 determine what entities should be subject to these requirements whether the requirements are reasonable and whether to grant extensions of time for compliance with the requirements in response to the nprm telecommunications carriers privacy rights groups and the fbi submitted comments to the fcc to attempt to influence the final decision then in april 1998 the fcc released public notice requesting comments on issues raised in those petitions concerning the dates that carriers were required to comply with calea and the dispute over the jstandard based on comments it received the fcc extended the implementation deadline until june 30 2000 stating that without standard the necessary equipment would not be available in time 13 in october 1998 the fcc initiated proceeding to review the technical capabilities prescribed by the jstandard14 the goal of that proceeding was to determine whether telecommunications carriers should be required under calea to meet the fbis punch list items the fcc addressed these issues in several documents released over the following year in march 1999 the fccs first report and order established the minimum capability requirements for telecommunications carriers to comply with calea 15 telecommunications carriers were required to ensure that only lawful wiretaps occur on their premises and that the occurrence of wiretaps is not divulged to anyone other than authorized law enforcement personnel on august 2 1999 the fcc decided to allow carriers to decide how long they would maintain their records of law enforcements wiretap pen register and trap and trace interceptions 16 on august 31 1999 the second report and order established definition for telecommunications carrier to include all common carriers cable operators electric and other utilities that offer telecommunications services to the public commercial mobile radio services and service resellers17 the definition did not include internet service providers isps which were explicitly excluded under the calea statute the fccs third report and order released august 31 1999 adopted technical requirements for wireline cellular and broadband pcs carrie rs to comply with calea requirements18 the ruling adopted the jstandard including the two capabili ties that were opposed by the privacy rights groups ie the ability to provide location information and packetmode data to law enforcement as described above the fcc also adopted six of the punch list capabilities requested by the fbi to be implemented by telecommunications carriers the order required all aspects of the jstandard except for the packetmode data collection capability to be

technology evol ves the rules are limited to facilitiesbased broadband internet access service providers and v oip providers that offer services permitting users to receive calls from and place calls to the public switched telephone networkthese providers are called interconnected v oip providers in making its ruling the fcc found that the definition of telecommunications carrier in calea is broader than the definition of that term in the communications act and can therefore include providers of services that are not classified as telecommunications services under the communications act calea contains broader definition of telecommunications provider that authorizes the fcc to classify an entity telecommunications carrier if it finds that such service is replacement for substantial portion of the local telephone exchange the fcc established deadline of 18 months from the effective date of the order for providers to achieve full compliance and adopted further notice of proposed
