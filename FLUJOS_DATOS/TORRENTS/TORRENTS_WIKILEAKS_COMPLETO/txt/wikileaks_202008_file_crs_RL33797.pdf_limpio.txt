the broadcast video flag summary in november 2003 the federal comm unications commission fcc adopted rule that required all digital devices capable of receiving digital television dtv broadcasts over the air and sold after july 1 2005 to incorporate technology that would recognize and abide by the broadcas t video flag contentprotection signal that broadcasters may choose to embed into digital broadcast transmission as way to prevent unauthorized redistribution of dtv content however in october 2004 the american library association and eight organizations representing large number of libraries and consum ers filed lawsuit that challenged the power of the fcc to promulgate such rule in may 2005 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled in american library association v federal communications commission that the fcc had exceeded the scope of its delegated authority in imposing the broadcast flag regime and the court thus reversed and vacated the fccs broadcast flag order parties holding copyright interest in content transmitted through dtv broadcasts in particular broadcasters and televisi on program creators remain concerned about the unauthorized distribu tion and reproduction of copyrighted dtv content and thus continue to advocate the adoption of broadcast video flag however several consumer educational and technolog groups raise objections to the broadcast flag because in their view it would place technologi cal financial and regulatory burdens that may stifle innovation limit the consumers ability to use dtv broadcasts in accordance with the copyright acts fair use principles and possibly frustrate the use of digital televi sion content by educators and librarians in distance education programs this

usc 309j14a 4 for more information on dtv see crs report rl31260 digital television an overview by lennard krugercopyright protection of digital television the broadcast video flag introduction technological advances looming statut ory deadline and the need to reclaim analog spectrum occupied by television broadcasters have put digital television dtv on fast track at the same time development of digital television has necessitated balancing the competing intere sts of content holders and consumer and technological industries reconciling thes interests has led to the development of broadcast video flag to combat unauthor ized redistribution of content broadcast through digital television signals1 the move to protect digital content has been given urgency by the federal communica tions commissions fccs determination that broadcast transmissions be digital by december 31 20062 the 105th congress in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 made this date statutory3 however the lack of widespread purchas and adoption by consumers of digital television equipment prompted the 109th congress to extend the 2006 deadline provision of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 established firm deadline of february 17 2009 for the digital transition what is dtv digital television is new television service representing the most significant development in televisi on technology since the advent of color television in the 1950s three major compone nts of dtv service must be present for consumers to enjoy fully realized highdefinition television viewing experience first digital programming must be available digital programming is content assembled with digital cam eras and other digital pr oduction equipment second digital programming must be delivered to the consumer via digital signal third consumers must have digital television equipment capable of receiving the digital signal and displaying digital programming for viewing4 developing protocol for transmitting nd receiving digital television in way that accommodated competing interests has proved challenging digital content likehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs2 5 however it should be noted that while duplica tion is fairly simple distribution especially of high quality digital content can be quite timeconsuming for example over broadband connections while music file may take matter of minutes television shows in standard analog format take number of hours digita l programs such as an hour of highdefinition television programming in turn may take upwards of 1015 hours to successfully download 6 fifth report at 12811 5 7 this collaboration was open to any group or i ndividual wishing to participate with the exception of the press bpdg final report of the cochairs of

media can be relatively easily duplicat ed and distributed especially with the aid of the internet5 unlike other types of content duplication of digital information does not degrade the original whereas the quality of vhs tape degrades after successive copies dvd may be copied lmost infinitely with effect on the quality of the medium it is because of the ease and inexhaustible potential of copying digital media coupled with the pro liferation of internet peertopeer file sharing services that content providers ve greeted this new technology with some trepidation the broadcast video flag the broadcast video flag is combinati on of technical specifi cations and federal regulations designed to combat unauthoriz ed redistribution of content broadcast through digital television signals its doption was prompted largely by the fccs determination that broa dcast transmissions be digital by december 31 20066 deadline that has since been extended by congress to february 17 2009 the fcc imposed transition to dtv in part to capitalize on the sharper images cdquality sound and wider screen angles that are av ailable from advanced digital technologies however in addition to the technological impetus the fcc also has been motivated by the knowledge that broadcasters upon r eceiving digital spectrum allotments must relinquish their analog spectrum allotments to the fcc the analog spectrum will in turn be auctioned for other commercial and public interests content providers fearing widespread piracy that would enda nger aftermarket sales such as cable re broadcast and dvd sales urged the fcc to provide for means to protect their assets meanwhile consumer electronics and information technologists as well as consumer rights groups came together in an effort to minimize the possible negative outcome that widescale re gulation might have imposed the technical specifications behind the broadcast video flag were compromise measure premised on an understanding that more restrictive approaches such as encrypted signals created at the source of transmission imposed economically or technologically infeasible conditions the compromise came after consortium of content providers and consumer electroni cs and information technology groups came together forming the broadcast protection discussion group bpdg7 the result of this consortium was final report published in june 2002 which was delivered to representative billy tauzin thenchairman of the house committee on energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs3 8 fcc in the matter of digital broadcast c

potentia l for variability for instance content provider such as cspan could decide that copy protection is necessary and would set the flag to an offposition digital content would therefore be available wit hout any restrictions to the user however broadcas ter who sought to show payperview digital content might choose to set the flag to an onposition which would disallow any form of copying and would potentially add setting to restrict the amount of time user has to watch the program after purchase alternatively content provider may decide that individual copying is permitted provided user views that copy on secure compliant device 10 report and order at 23561 11 report and order appendix b at 23592 and commerce the report suggested t of robustness and compliance rules for devices capable of demodula ting digital television signal s which would require that such devices protect flagged content fro m being recorded by unauthorized devices however the flag itself would not require that all machines recognize it and would act only as means to halt unauthorized us in machines capable of detecting it in november 2003 the fcc published report and order that required all digital devices capable of receiving digital broadcast over the air and sold after july 1 2005 to incorporate standard contentprotection technology that would recognize the broadcast video flag and limit redistribution when the flag is recognized8 the fccs regulations apply the flag mark to all devices and receivers capable of receiving digital content such devices include but are not limited to televisions computers digital videorecorders eg vo and dvd players the broadcast flag itself is optional for broadcasters allowing them to determine how much copy protection they wish to impose on their digital broadcast content9 because the flag does not prevent the distribution of content to noncompliant devices consumer who continues to use an older television set or theoretically noncompliant demodulator will still be able to receive and copy television programs in nondigital form in addition digital television sets made prior to july 1 2005 will still enjoy digital content with obstr uction in citing its support for flag based approach over encryption or other means the fcc noted concerns over the implementation costs and delays ssociated with other solutions10 in addition to the compliance requirements imposed on receiving devices the fcc also imposed robustness requirem ent that forces makers of consumer devices to ensure that circum vention is difficult the sta ndard of care adopted by the fcc was that of an ordinary user using generally available tools or equipment11 fcc authority the fcc derives its regulatory authority over digital television from both direct and ancillary statutory authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs4 12 47 usc 336i1 13 47 usc 336b4 and 5 14 47 cfr 73624 2004 see also httpwwwfccgovmbpolicydtv for an overview of the fccs

ancillary jurisdiction see id at 178 concerning the fccs ancillary authority congress has given the commission comprehe nsive mandate with expansive powers which has led the courts to conclude that the communications act of 1934 provides the commission with ancillary jurisdiction over matters that are related to the provision of radio or television service though not specifically enumerated in the act historically the fcc has exercised its ancillary jurisdiction to promulgate regulations in number of areas see id at 173 177 us v midwest video corp 406 us 649 1972 in addition to this historic authority the fcc relies on the defi nition of wireradio communications which includes all incidental instrumentalities fac ilities apparatus and services that are used for the receipt forwarding and delivery of ch transmissions as basis for its authority over television receivers r eport and order at 23563digital television implementati on under the telecommunications act of 1996 the telecommunications act of 1996 directed the fcc to promulgate regulations regarding the licensing of adva nced television servi ces the act defined advanced television services as televisi on services provided us ing digital or other advanced technology12 in prescribing such regulations the commission was authorized to adopt such technical and other requirements as may be necessary or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced television services and prescribe such other re gulations as may be necessary for the protection of the public intere st convenience and necessity13 pursuant to the telecommunications act of 1996 the fcc has issued regulations regarding spectrum allocation for digital television stations and has established time line for the implementation of digital broadcasting by licensees14 at least one court has agreed that in re gard to television digital tuners the fcc possessed reasonable authority to act ba sed on an unambiguous command of an act of congress15 copyright protection while copyright protecti on generally lies outside the scope of the fcc the commission may exercise jurisdiction over matters not explicitly provided for by statute if the exercise is reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the commissions various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting16 the fcc has asserted that television receivers generally and digital television receivers specifically fall within the scope of that authority17 under the fcc report and order pursuant to the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction we adopt use of the flag as currently defined for redistribution control purposes and establish compliance nd robustness rules for devices with demodulators to ensure that they respond nd give effect to the flag however the fcc initially put off deciding on permanent mechanisms for approving content protection and recording technologies to be used in conjunction with device

primer december 2003 available on january 10 2007 atlater time and estab lished an interim certification process for currently proposed devices18 in addition to the need to regulate television broadcasting the fccs action arguably protects broadcasters from any unreasonable loss in advertising revenue that may result from unauthorized sharing of copy righted digital television broadcasts however the fcc was careful to note th at the scope of our decision does not reach existing copyright law and that its rulemaking established technical protection measure that did not chan ge the underlying rights and remedies available to copyright holders in addition this decision is not intended to alter the defenses and penalties applicable in cases of copyright infringement circumvention or other applicable laws19 possible implications of the broadcast video flag while the broadcast flag is intended to prevent the indiscriminate redistribution of digital broadcast content over the internet or through similar means the goal of the flag was not to impede consumers ability to copy or use content lawfully in the home nor was the policy intended to for eclose use of the internet to send digital broadcast content where it can be adequately protected from indiscriminate redistribution20 however current technologi cal limitations have the potential to hinder some activities that might normally be considered fair use under existing copyright law21 for example consumer who wishes to record program to watch at later time or at different location timeshifting and spaceshifting respectively might be prevented when otherwise approved technologies do not allow for such activities or do not integrate well with one another or with older legacy devices in addition future fair or reasonable uses may be precluded by these limitations for example student would be unable to email herself copy of project with digital video content because current secure system exists for mail transmission in addition some consumer electroni cs and information technology groups contend that the licensing terms for approving new compliant devices are limiting and may potentially stifle i nnovation especially with rega rd to computer hardware22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs6 22 continued http wwwcdtorgcopy right20031216broadcastflagpdf 23 report and order at 23578 24 id at

used to evaluate new content protection and recording technology it has stated an inten tion to take up these issues in the future23 finally consumer rights and civil lib erties groups worry about the possibility that such content protections will limit the free flow of information and hamper the first amendment this concern is expressed most prominently regarding news or public interestbased content or works th at have already entered the public domain despite suggestions raised by consumer rights groups the fcc has so far declined to adopt language to prevent content provi ders from using the broadcast flag on such programs largely because of the practi cal and legal difficulties of determining which types of broadcast content merit protection from indiscriminate redistribution and which do not24 legal challenges to the broadcast video flag in october of 2004 the american librar association ala association of research libraries american association of law libraries aall medical libraries association and othe rs petitioned the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to review the fccs report and order bringing challenge on behalf of libraries libra rians and educators and television viewers and computer users the petitioners as parties to the agency proceedings questioned the fccs statutory authority to establish the broadcast flag system under the communications act of 1934 on may 6 2005 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted the alas petition for review and reversed and vacated the commissions or der requiring dtv reception equipment to be manufactured with the capability to prevent unauthorized redistributions of digital content25 in american library association v federal communications commission the court of appeals determined that the fcc lacked the authority to regulate apparatus that can receive television broadcasts when those apparatus are not engaged in the process of receiving broadcast transmission26 the court noted that in adopting the broadcast flag rules the commission cited specific statutory provision giving it authority to regulate consumers use of television receiver apparatus after the completion of the broadcast transmission27 the commissions reliance on its ancillary jurisdiction under title i of the communicati ons act of 1934 was rejected by the court the court found that alt hough the jurisdictional grant under title i plainly encompasses the regulation of appara that can receive television broadcasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs7

does not extend beyond the actual receipt of such content by the apparatus in question the cour ts decision was limited to resolving whether the commission had the authority to impose the broadcast

american library association decision two bills were introduced in the 109th congress that would have expressly granted statutory authority to the fcc under the communicati ons act of 1934 to implement the fccs report and order in the matter of di gital broadcast content protection these legislative proposals represent appro aches that may be taken in the 110th congress for authorizing broadcast video flag sy stem the digital content protection act of 2006 was introduced by senator ted stevens in the 109th congress as part of two bills s 2686 and hr 5252 s reported in the senate28 section 452 of s 2686 as introduced w ould have required the fcc to modify its report and order to permit the following transmissions short excerpts of broadcast dig ital television content over the internet broadcast digital tele vision content over home network or other localized network accessible to limited number of devices connected to such network and redistribution of news and public affairs programming not including sports in which the primary commercial value depends on timeliness as determined by the broadcaster or broadcasting network the senate version of hr 5252 would have prohibited levision broadcast stations from using the broadcast video flag to limit the redistribution of news and public affairs programming the primary commercial value of which depends on timeliness however the bill expressly allowed each broadcaster or broadcasting network to make the determination as to whether the primary commercial value of particular news program depends on timeliness the bill also authorized the fcc to review any such determination by broadcaster or broad casting network if it receives bona fide complaints alleging or otherwise has reason to believe that particular broadcast digital television content has violated this limitation concerning timeliness and commercial valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33797crs8 29 the broadcast and audio flag hearing

consistent with fair use principleshearings on the broadcast flag held by the 109th congress revealed that educators and librarians who us digital materials in education are concerned that broadcast video flag regime could frustrate the utilization of digital television in distance education29 both bills contained provisions that sought to preserve this statutory right under the technology
