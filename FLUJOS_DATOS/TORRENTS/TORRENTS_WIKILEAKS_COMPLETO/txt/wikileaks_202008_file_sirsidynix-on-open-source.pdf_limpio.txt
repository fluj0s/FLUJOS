page 2 introduction caveat emptor on february 18 1815 hector m organ purchased 111 hogsheads 111000 pounds of tobacco from peter laidlaw and company it was the same day that the news broke of the signing of the treaty of ghent between the united states and brit ain which ended t he war of 1812 and lifted the naval embargo that had drastically depr essed the price of american tobacco by 30 to 50 percent organ who had spoken of the news of the treaty with his brother speculated that the price of tobacco would rise within the ne xt two days but laidlaw was unaware of the news at the time of the sale during the discussion of the contract laidlaw asked organ i f he was aware of any reason for the price to be higher but organ re mained silent over the news of the embargo lifting and kept hi s price low the next day when prices rose laidlaw incurred large loss on the sale relative to the previous days price and repossessed the tobacco by force lawsuit ensued which eventually reached the supreme court and unanimous ruling from the john marshall court establishing caveat emptor or let the buyer beware doctrine in the united states under this ruling the buyer cannot recover from the seller for defects on the property that re ndered the property unfit for ordinary purposes while this ruling happened almost two centurie s ago some buyers ignore some of the most critical facts of their purchases today we see that happening when libraries get into talks about moving their integrated library systems to open source platfor ms systems what we have found is that they often are not aware of the heavy drawbacks of what open source systems cannot offer at this point in time therefore to help buyers become aware of t he limitations of open source we set out to clarify what open source is how it is different from proprietary software platforms and why integrated library systems ils are not ready for open source at this point so what is open source the concept of open source is fairly misun derstood and quite vague most organizations courting the idea of open source develop ment do so because they feel they can project their dreams and desires onto blank slate and have the features they want sitting at their fingertips quickly and easily this is misunderstanding of how open source software develo pment works by definition open source is an approach to the des ign development and distribution of software offering practica l accessibility to softwares source code more technically correct term to define what open source is would be peer production development meaning that the open sou rce model allows concurrent input of differing agendas and ideas to the development of software essentially anyone can join the collaboration effort with the goal of maki ng it stronger and more featurerich some of the most successful open source developments include the linux operating system apache http servers the internet address system internet protocol and mozillas firefox internet browser the open source community repeatedly points to these efforts as the poster children of how successful open source can be howev er each of these developments has major issue in common they were developed because the public demanded itthey each had critical mass nevertheless it should be noted that it is rare for completely open source projects to be successful rather than focusing on bestin class software choice decisionmaking these projects often end up being archipelagos of systems driven by philosophical prin ciple that is antiproprietary page 3 how are open source developments an d proprietary platforms different there are number of assertions that proponents of open source claim as t he strengths of open source including total cost of ownership tco opportunity costs software as service saas features and functions customization security networking open formats necessary expertise testing integration communitydriven scalability speed reliability there are many more arguments on behalf of the open source commu nity but we will focus our attention on these subjects due to the importance of these assertions total cost of ownership tco the real price the open source proponents state that it has much lower price and much lower to tal cost of ownership tco what they tend to leave out however are the entry costs of switching systems especially in the librar market the two main open source player s havent been around long enough nor do they have enough clients to provide evidence for this argument there is difference between price and tco open source proponents tend to focus on t he free license that commits them to th software and if it is free they are not committed to keepi ng it since costs are out of pocket they can even switch freel if it does not work out for them however all software has true tco which includes the sales pr ice initial implementation time and costs any hardware and s oftware upgrades hosting costs maintenance and tec hnical support upgrades and training or retraining it is important to determi ne the overall costs of adopting new mode it is very unlikely that an open source so lution is any less expensive than proprietary solution in fact in all of the data sirsidynix has collected we are not seeing quotes t hat conflict with this assertion indeed there are very few green fields in the ils marketplace most libraries already have an ils and receive upgrades as part of their maintenance contract from us or other proprietary vend ors these maintenance contracts are smal l percentage of the initial price to convert to an open source option like evergreen or koha using vendors like equinox or liblime the library must start over wi th conversions and implementations usually payi ng another vendor or consultant to acco mplish these as open source companies asse rt it is free like kittens not free like beer generally there will be significant limitat ions to the hardware and operating system options this limits the ability to cooper ate consortially or share resources with host cities or institutions that may use different standar d the library is at risk of b eing an island in the community page 4 sirsidynix offersand has offered for many decadesa wide variet of options for servers operat ing systems and plugins open source ils offerings do not offer the diver sity of choices that sirsidynix offers open source proponents and proprietary companies disagree on the total cost of ownership page 5 proponents claim that even if open source requires more expertise the tco is ultimately lower companies claim that the requir ed expertise is daunting and the other costs of proprietary solutions are exaggerated these charts illustrate concepts not actu numbers opportunity costs some software isnt compatible with open source choosing any so lution may foreclose on other software this opportunity cost m ay not be apparent for years when the need for the other software emerges in many markets there are major systems in accounting intranets elear ning and so on that must tie in to the ils in many c ases open source is still the minority solution because for example the number of linux desktops is meager compared to microsoft windows desktops by choosing linux desktop user closes the door on some software because it may never be created for or ported to linux add to this the major changes in allied sy stems that require an adaptation for the ils and the issue grows exponentially so for libraries that choose an open source system the opportunity to integrate differe nt systems into the solution is limited at best saas real cost savings in the ils come from improving the architectu re of the whole system this can be done through software as solution saas where proprietary software developer like sirsidynix hosts librarys ils and takes over responsibility for upgrades to hardware updating backup and hosting activities the emergence of saas is growing very fast across all types of technologydependent industries it is cost effective more flex ible and delivers significant benefits than traditional so ftware installations with few downsides this can result in total cost of ownership savings of nearly 50 percent with the best professional hosting facilities availabl sirsidynix operates on global basis from the point of view of the end user the ils work flows and the online public access catalogue pac are invisible and are truly adaptable to the internet while some open source ils companies are offering hosted solutions these solutions are not at the scale or professionalism of proprietary saas solution nor do they provide the service level agreements or service expectations that sirsidynix commits to some open source saas services are hosted on servers in small ve ndors office which are not professional hosting solutions and co with extremely high risk to the library features and functions when one is evaluating the differences between open source ils and proprietary ils the theories need to be overridden by pract ical applications it is one thing to subscribe to belief system when one is talking philosophy it is quite another when the discussion turns t provable issues like specific ils programs features reliability security power speed and ease of customizing the software for speci fic needs the use of agreed international standards is essential to using the wide range of thirdpar ty products used in libraries as wel l as any that may be considered in the future generally the available open source ils platforms have less than hal f of the features and functions of any sirsidynix ils som of these features and functions may not be essent ial to some clients some will be however on this order of scale and with that potential number of needed features sirsidynix has the ability to offer lib raries the most robust feature set on the market it becomes incumbent page 6 on the librarys decisionmaking process to clearly outline what they are giving up or planning to develop on their own if they choose to go open source when we compare where we are today with proprietary platforms versus where we are with open source systems the development priorities for evergreen and koha are the same priorities that si rsidynix had in the 1980s how many years will it take for the m to achieve full feature set if ever proprietary software has more features peri od proprietary softwa re is much more userfriendly sirsidynix has been building t his ils for more than 30 years it has feature set second to none it is important to note t hat sirsidynix ils has two main user groups the library workers who process the resources for the library as acquisitions cataloguing circulat ion ill etc and the enduser s who use the opac features and ot her addons like selfcheck open source software devel opers are spending the majority of their time an d resources on getting the back room operations right 30 years after we already completed the process customization probably the most attractive claim by the open source community is its ability to be customized by anyone for anyone this cla im is technically true much of the desire for cu stomization comes from innovat ive interfaces inc iii clients however iii has long history and tradition of not allowing its clients to writ apis to the underlying data and fields in the ils meanwhile sirsidynix consultants have written custom api programs since the co mpany introduced the application programming interface api nearly 20 years ago other proprietary software co mpanies like liblime and equinox have always offered customiz ation to their clients however it should be stated that customization is not without risk extensive customization especially with potentially littl or documentation can make upgrades and changes increasingly difficult sirsidynix mitigates this with our api training as well as the option to have our consultants to review apis for errors and bugs in the open source world anyone can make significant changes to open source code this is oft presented as great option to management who dont completely understand the consequences of too much customization too much source code change can result in completely new versions that are neither forward nor backwar ds compatible with the innovati ons of the overall open source community rogue programming teams may decide to create better vers ion while exclaiming damn the torpedoes the result is that the relationship to the core kernel of the software can be broken or made odd in some of the big open source communitie s there is an individual or group who gives permission to make change in the software for example linus torvalds the genius behind t he linux platform is materially involved in every linux code addition to protect the kernel customization can be risky undertaking again customization comes with the caveat emptor warning libraries considering an open source ils should seriously review ho w they handle version control and customization as well as who handles the responsibilities and contracts for customization if they dont they may end up being an outlier or be forced into proprietary environment like red hat security open source is often represented as more secure this too is debatable some of the most securityconscious entities like th united states department of defense restrict the use of open source software for fear that it could pose terrorist opportunity it is not an accident that sirsidynix ils sy stems and saas operations are the choice of the us military possibly the most s ecurity conscious environment in the entire world page 7 in open source anyone can release code but extensive testing is needed to ensure those codes are secure the three big open source applicationsfirefox apache and linuxhave communities rge enough to do this to find and isolate threats it would b naive for the library market to think that the ils community of open source programmers is large enough to create this assuranc eit isnt even close to date the ils has not been target for security threats though associated systems for servers and communication have thi s may change if large installed base of open source ils platforms emerges networking some open source vendors claim that open source is more netwo rkfriendly and relies on the internet and other networks for its performance unfortunately for the ils community this is grossly overstated exaggeration the proprietary ils market currently utilizes largescale netw orks that work at speeds and per formance measurements that far ex ceed any open source ils installation anywhere in fact sirsidynix sa as solutions are world class and our references in consortia and large complex accounts demonstrate the ability of sirsidynix il s to perform on network scale at excellent performance open formats an open format is published specification for storing digital data which basically can be us ed and implemented by anyone fo r example the format is interoperable among divers internal and external platforms and applications the argument by the open source community is simply that open formats are better sirsidynix agrees we try to use open formats and international standards as much as possible ideally this woul d be all the time but the reality is that open formats are not always the most open to formats that host city or institution uses it is our opinion that the ils works with the formats that are nee ded by their clients rather than engaging in missi onary work for greater openness data management and migration highlight num ber of these issues open formats are helpf ul in this area but even accepted stand ards like marc have many legacy issues data quality repair issues and company like sirsidynix has infinitely more experience in migration and implementation issues than any new vendor open sour ce or not if you wanted to argue that liblime or equinox do not respect the skills and depth at sirsidynix just ask why they have hired so many alumni from sirsidynix necessary expertise is open source harder to deploy all software solutions require some expertise to deploy secure and maintain some open sourc software is technically challenging and requires considerable expertise this is particularly important point in the library market where there is rarely large systems department with variety of programming levels and skills quickly available internally libraries considering open source should clearly evaluate the skills required this might involve hiring an expensive consultan t libraries would be well advised that they have long tradition of working with application software and that the management of proprietary ils involves different skill set than managing an il s that must be extensively customized to assure performance application programming is differ ent than development programming the employment market for development programmers is different th an application programmers it also requires different type and level of project manager and software leadership these people ar extremely rare and cost more and most libraries cannot cove r the salaries required to reta in the talent they need moreover these programme rs wont necessarily be in the library programming s pace meaning that libraries will have to compete with larger development market than the lim ited library programming space page 8 indeed it is an interesting strategy for some library programm ers to upgrade their skills in the library open source environmen t and leave as their worth increases testing sirsidynix has rigorous testing procedures these are brought about through large in vestments in automated professional testing programs and procedures regression testing mature beta testing process managed prot ocols and testing with partners we ce rtify some third parties using actual tests to ensure that the customer experience is as seamless as possible we test for scalabilit and for the stress of large numbers of users we test for all major brow sers we test on all supported servers and operating systems w test aggressively and well we test at every st ep of the development process we do all of this before we have actual clients partne r with us to beta test the prerelease candidates over the past few years our product has arrived in new releases with higher standard of performance and more features than ever before we have released 20 major releases and upgrades in the past two years on time this is not the pattern that open source initiatives follow sting is the responsibility of the original programmer and their buddies then the philosophy is caveat emptor or installer beware and the testi ng heavily falls on the early adopters yet when reviewing the list of bugs in the open source ils software as compared to the same bugs for the proprietary software investigators have to go back decades in the list to find the same bugs open source platforms are fixing today this is evidence of very young development program and the ck of real management in the pr ocess the open source process is too organic and lacks tight priorities and strong management oversight integration some argue that its difficult to integrate open source with proprietary solutions its always professional ta sk to make sof tware work well the truth is that the software world will always be one of hybrid solutions sirsidynix has long tradition of using open sour ce in our solutions properly tested and integrated as well as ensuring t hat our apis and portal solutions allow for integration of any desired solution we also ensure that these work with all of our ils solutions multiple platforms operating systems servers and brow sers communitydriven open source exists because large community of motivated gen erous programmers work together some are corporate employees but open source development thrives on volunteers even users wi thout programming or other technical skills find ways to help b filing bug reports writing documentation or answering questions on email lists there is difference between this assertion about open source and the sirsidynix approach indeed we have many decades of experience in tracking development suggestions and requests and testing reviewing and replicating bug reports from programmers and users alike sirsidynix also has history of participation in the care and feeding of community of users and programmers tha t share and collaborate with us and with each other for the common good scalability some open source system vendors describe their software as consor tially aware or having been built for consortia from the gro und up this is fairly weaselly language yes this software can be consortially aware without any of the attendant performance one didnt even support the z3950 international iso st andard until recently having been designed for single consortium such as pines does not guarantee that the software will work for another consortias needs particularly with the diversity of needs and variety f system architectures that exist in fully dimensional marketplace page 9 if clients are concerned about their ability to scale they should check the actual performance of the ils in actual complex and consortia environments the pines system is actually very poor performer at its current scale of small public libraries for example ll large library systems in georgia have generally decided to stick with sirsidynix in fact several library systems in georgia have clined the use of the evergreen system spec ifically due to scalability and response times ne tester of that system wrote slow response time in evergreen staff client this includes unexpected crashes and frozen screens which may or may not be due to response time g this problem causes extreme delay and long lines at cir c desk and results in both major staff and patron frustration sirsidynix encourages libraries to visit our largescale client s and see the subsecond search performance on 10s of thousands of users such sirsidynix symphony clients as the toronto public library alliance library system angeles county public libra ry and more enjoy very strong and stable performance this is not t he case with the small libraries of georgia who are captive to sub optimal open source systems indeed despite stating that they were built for consorti simple consortia features are not avai lable or supported add to this the even better performance and tco impr ovements of the sirsidynix saas solutions and we offer much better solution with significantly superior performance speed endusers are not satisfied with subgoogle performance the expectation has been set outside of the ils market and the ils mar ket doesnt get by without meeting it therefore sirsidynix is focused on speed our stress testing is done on the professi onal stress testing facilities at sun micr osystems microsoft and unix servers we st at 50000 users per configuration for over we ek we use advanced automated testing proced ures that cost mone but deliver defi nite positive result and tell us where to invest time in improving the performance of our software in addition we also test for all major brow sers and try to ensure compliance with all standards and browsers evident in our mar ket this includes pc and macintosh this has not been the case in the open source ils systems if anyt hing one of the major complaints by users and clients is tha t it is so slow simple searches in pines can hang for minutes resulting in the searching bar popping onto the screen to encourage use r patience this is unacceptable in ils software which is why we test our system so rigorously reliability finally one of the biggest claims of open source proponents is that it is more reliable they argue that since any programmer can find and fix bugs the software will be repaired and improved more quick ly there is however guaran tee that the bug you want fi xed will engage member of the community to fix it bug fix can work in one environment and not others and the testing is up to each individual organization in open source with open source the advantage depends on the participation of enough competent progr ammers who are deeply committed to the entire development process wit hout enduring sufficient talented interest an open source project is doomed to fail and many do unfortunately for the open source proponents in the ils community there currently isnt critic mass that is demanding the development of open source software at this point in time the open source community for ils software is tiny therefore the reliability of ils software developed on an open source platform is questionable just like proprietary software the reliability of an open source program depends on clear feedback afte r rigorous use in variety of environments but that simpl cannot be the case at this point in time because the variety of envir onments is small and the critical mass needed has not been reach ed page 10 open source and libraries although many in the ils industry are taking an indepth look at the viability of open source development over the long run we believe the movement is premature moreover we are joined in our opinion by none other than cliff lynch the head of the coalition for networked information and leading thinker in the library space cliff called the development of the open source ils by ole pines et c one of the stupidest strat egies ever undertaken in th library world at time when libraries should be investing in systems to improve the priority issues in the endusers research disco very and learning experience here we have cadre of libraries investing in the reinvention or at least recreation of something they already have and have at cheaper cost than the redevelopment effort in addition these projects do not have compelling vision of wh at the end result will be and appear to be driven by library w orkers desires rather than institutional strategies or enduser needs as such they are tying up resources in an open source ils effo rt at time when budgets are constricted and other prio rities are much more important and strategic sirsidynix on open source sirsidynix is not facto against open source we use open source software great deal in our development efforts in our sof tware and in our company we easily support clients using the poster child ren of open source software linux apache and firefox w have done so for many decades simply put its good so lution when it matches the needs of our clients sirsidynix has been an early leader in building more open libr ary management systems and indeed being more open to even greate r integration this is especially true in t he user experience end of our products where clients have added hundreds of applicatio ns onto our opac easily using our api strategy we also have very ng track record in being open to our customers with beta tests discussion forums user groups feedback mechanisms and more however sirsidynix has also been in the ils industry since 1979 and has developed the bestinclass solutions yearin and year out weve led the development of some of the most advanced features and capabilities of ils platforms so we know thing or two ab out what it takes for library systems to be successful while we encourage the development of open formats we must di scourage libraries from jumping headlong into an open source platform to operate their ils sy stem on at the current production cycle jump ing into open source would be dangerous at best caveat emptor page 11 for more information on
