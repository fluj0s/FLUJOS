system fcs or system is national network of cooperatively owned lending institutions that provide credit and other services to farmers and ranchers the fcs is federally chartered institution created in 1916 by congress in the federal farm loan act it has statutory mandate to serve agriculture as permanent reliable source of credit current statutory authority is in the farm credit act of 1971 as amended the most comprehensive recent changes were enacted in the agricultural credit act of 1987 pl 100233 federal oversight by the house and senate congressional research service the library of congress crs2 agriculture committees in conjunction with regulations and examinations by the farm credit administration fca are designed to provide for the safety and soundness of system institutions as governmentsponsored enterprise gse the system has been given by congress certain exemptions from taxation and other benefits that presumably allow it to overcome barriers that might prevent purely private lenders from serving agriculture in the manner congress envisioned unlike the housing gses which are secondary markets the fcs is direct lender the system is composed of four regional farm credit banks fcbs and one agricultural credit bank acb each of which has chartered territory for serving farmers nationwide1 funds from the sale of bonds flow through these five banks to 97 fcs lending associations the secondlargest of which in terms of assets is farm credit services of america fcs lending associations are cooperatives governed by directors elected from the borrowers who are also cooperative stockholders they lend to farmers either directly or through their subsidiaries for more information on the structure of the farm credit system see crs report rs21278 farm credit system the ability to leave the farm credit system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21919 section 416 of the agricultural credit act of 1987 pl 100233 amended the farm credit act of 1971 to allow institutions to leave the farm credit system these provisions originated in the senate bill and were adopted by the conference committee hrept 100490 the statute 12 usc 2279d is implemented through detailed fca regulations 12 cfr 61112001290 that specify the types of information that must be provided to fca and the institutions shareholders throughout the termination process by law fca must approve the plan before shareholders can vote to leave the system the main requirements of the termination procedure are as follows commencement resolution the association notifies fca and stockholders of the plan to terminate and its effect on stockholders plan of termination the association submits detailed plan to fca including proposed stockholder information statement evidence of new charter to be granted if fcs status is revoked and an estimate of the exit fee the exit fee is capital exceeding 6 of the associations assets fca approval or disapproval if fca disapproves it must explain one reason mentioned in the regulations is an adverse effect on the ability of remaining system institutions to fulfill their statutory purpose stockholder vote if fca approves the plan majority of stockholders in the association who vote must approve the plan reconsideration petition if the plan is approved by stockholders petition by 15 of stockholders may force second and binding vote termination if approved by stockholders the association pays its debts and deposits the exit fee in escrow fca revokes the charter posttermination fca determines the exact exit fee 1 for directory of institutions in the farm credit system and map of the five regional banks see the farm credit administration website at httpwwwfcagovappsinstitnsf crs3 the timeline for the above steps requires at least seven months from the date the resolution is submitted the association must wait at least 30 days to submit the termination plan once submitted fca has 60 days to consider the plan if fca approves stockholders have 30 days to review the information statement before voting if majority approve 35day period is allowed for petition to revote termination can occur sooner than 90 days after stockholder approval pending termination fca would issue new lending charters so that the system could maintain presence in the affected region in this case fcsas plan did not proceed beyond the commencement resolution after releasing its resolution on july 30 2004 fcsa never submitted its termination plan before the board canceled the agreement on october 19 2004 the exit fee is payment required in statute by the farm credit act the exit fee serves to reimburse the system for the capital earned from the benefits of being in the system and is defined as capital exceeding 6 of assets over multiyear period fca may review the associations records and make adjustments in calculating the final exit fee this prevents an association from manipulating its capital to reduce the exit fee fcsas attempt to leave the farm credit system was unprecedented in two ways httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21919 size and purchase by an outside entity only one system institution has used the termination provisions in 1991 the california livestock production credit association 14 million in loans became stockmans bank after becoming dissatisfied about making payments to prop up failing system institutions congress approved that termination in the 1990 farm bill and waived some fees pl 101624 sec 1838 it is not clear that congress intended for system institution to be purchased by an outside company the offer on october 19 2004 the board of directors of farm credit services of america fcsa voted to terminate its july 30 2004 agreement with rabobank to be purchased for 600 million payable to stockholders and projected 800 million exit fee payable to the farm credit system insurance corporation the board also voted on october 19 to reject merger within fcs and to initiate patronage payment plan for its borrowers the offer generated significant controversy and congressional hearings over the financial terms and future of fcs rabobank had increased the stock offer to 750 million following 650 million offer from neighboring fcs institution see next section fcsa would have given up the benefits of membership in the farm credit system including the tax exemption on its real estate loan portfolio and access to system funds shareholders would have owed capital gains taxes on the stock payment and fcsa may have owed taxes on the exit fee attributed to the taxexempt real estate portfolio background on fcsa as the secondlargest of the systems 97 lending associations fcsa is headquartered in omaha nebraska and has 43 offices and 51000 crs4 shareholders in 2003 its 73 billion loan portfolio was distributed geographically with 42 in iowa 39 in nebraska 16 in south dakota and 3 in wyoming2 within the farm credit system fcsa is one of the 18 lending associations in the agribank farm credit district one of the systems five large regional banks in march 2004 fcsa represented 63 of total combined system assets of 1205 billion in terms of loans to customers fcsa held 8 of the systems 91 billion loan portfolio and about 25 of the agribank districts loan portfolio3 historically fcsas fourstate territory was the omaha district one of the twelve original farm credit districts in 1994 the farm credit bank of omaha merged with the farm credit bank of spokane to become agamerica farm credit bank and the omaha district consolidated into fcsa on january 1 2003 agamerica dissolved into two parts and farm credit services of america became part of the agribank district background on rabobank rabobank is private dutch banking cooperative with long history of agricultural lending in the netherlands rabobank has 500 billion in assets with operations in 35 countries rabobank has 25year history in the united httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21919 states generally financing larger agribusinesses and cooperatives in recent years rabobank has moved into farmlevel lending in the us with the purchases of valley independent bank california in 2002 lend lease agribusiness st louis for 45 million in 2003 and ag services of america cedar falls iowa for 47 million in 2003 alternative offer within the system before the fcsa board accepted rabobanks offer on july 30 agstar financial services an fcs association in minnesota made an undisclosed offer to merge with fcsa and keep it in the system on august 18 2004 agstar submitted another offer to purchase fcsa for 650 million 50 million more than rabobanks initial offer agstars territory is adjacent to fcsa and includes the southern and eastern halves of minnesota and the northwestern portion of wisconsin with 12000 stockholders and 24 billion in loans agstar is smaller than fcsa the agstar offer was meant to be competitive with rabobank in terms of the stockholder payment but rather than buyout the agstar offer was merger of two system institutions the 650 million payment would be more of patronage or dividend distribution rather than stock buyout and shareholders would continue to be owners in the merged association agstar stated that it would make patronage payments to fcsa shareholders something that current fcsa management had not done exit fee would be required with an agstar merger allowing 800 million in capital to remain in the association rather than being transferred to the nationwide fcs insurance corporation4 2 fcsa 2003 annual report httpwwwfcsamericacomcompanyar99fcsapdf 3 agribank fcb 2003 annual report

httpwwwfarmdocuiucedufinancepublicationsfcsa20rabobank20agstar 20choicespdf and understanding the proposed sale of farm credit services of america by continued crs5 implications for the future of the farm credit system regional implications with fcsa terminating its bid to exit the system service to fcs customers in the region should continue uninterrupted through fcsa however if fcsa had been purchased by rabobank fca would have issued new charters and the farm credit system would have needed to rebuild physical infrastructure of offices and employees as well as its portfolio of loans and customers thus even though issuing new charters could have maintained system presence in the region the magnitude of that presence could have been significantly smaller for some time depending on employee and customer loyalties national implications although the rabobank agreement directly affected service to only fraction of the system the implications for the entire system have been greater fcsas acceptance of rabobanks offer has given opponents of the system additional reasons to question the rationale supporting the systems existence when congress passed the federal farm loan act in 1916 credit was frequently httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21919 unavailable or unaffordable in rural areas many lenders avoided agricultural loans due to the inherent risks thus congress created the farm credit system and provided certain financial benefits to assure permanent reliable source of credit to american agriculture for more than decade credit has been available to most farmers from variety of sources including commercial banks life insurance companies farm input suppliers the us department of agriculture usda and the farm credit system furthermore the reliability of government commodity payment programs has given agricultural lenders extra assurance that most farm borrowers will be able to repay their loans these factors have caused some observers to question whether the same need exists today for fcs as in the early part of the 20th century such critics of fcs say preferential treatment is not warranted since agriculture longer faces credit constraint and other industries do not receive such treatment5 thus the attempt by farm credit services of america to voluntarily become private is being seen by some as an indicator that the system may longer need its government sponsorship the american bankers association has asserted for many years that the fcs longer warrants its gse status and is now citing this buyout offer as further evidence for that position6 such commercial lenders are among the only groups that did not express opposition to the sale provided that taxpayer interests were adequately addressed 4 continued neil harl et iowa state university

bankers association press release july 30 2004 at httpwwwabacom pressroom073004statementhtm crs6 the system counters arguments over its gse status by asserting its statutory mandate to serve agriculture through both good times and bad the farm credit council the systems lobbying arm was opposed to the rabobank purchase and contended that farmer borrowers would be better served under the status quo or under the agstar merger7 most farm groups expressed concern over the proposed sale to private and foreign company issues for congress congress had statutory role in the termination process however some members of congress took an interest especially given concerns by some farmers over the future of the farm credit system generally and more specifically in the fourstate region some members offices in states outside the affected region received constituent mail about the future of their loans and whether the rest of the system is for sale house agriculture subcommittee on conservation credit rural development and research held hearing on the issue on september 29 2004 the farm credit system asked congress to remove the statutory language allowing institutions to leave the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21919 system commercial bankers asked for better access to fcs funding and testified that institutions should be allowed to exit the system if they want more lending authorities than allowed under the farm credit act in the senate senators daschle and johnson of south dakota introduced s 2851 to require fca to hold public hearings on the implications of the proposed purchase and to increase fcas review period from maximum 60day period to minimum sixmonth period in conclusion the option for fcs institutions to terminate their status in the system is allowed in statute and regulation despite aborting its attempt to leave the system farm credit services of americas decision to be bought by private firm may affect the agricultural and lending industrys view of the farm credit system into the future the agreement served to highlight certain provisions in the farm credit act that both proponents and opponents of the system say need attention future efforts to address these issues may be affected by these recent events 7 see farm credit council press release july 30 2004 at httpwwwfccouncilcompress fcsofamericapdf
