allegrone for reas ons 14 b d 1 c summary on august 21 french elysee advisor boris boillon and mfa as for eurasia roland galharague who traveled with fm kouchner to the region provided us with consistent interpretation of the arrival of osce monitors the new monitors are responding to the emergency situation they are not the new international mechanism referred to in point 5 and do not prejudge the eventual international arrangements galharague welcomed reftel demarche pol mc emphasized the need for russia to respect its commitments to retreat and encouraged active consideration of what will happen on august 22 if russian forces have not fully withdrawn post will remain seized of these and related questions in the days to come end summary 2 c on august 21 french elysee advisor boris boillon middle east advisor with acting responsibility for this portfolio explained that the arrival of the osce monitors in the coming days are part of the security measures mentioned in point 5 of the six point document but only in the sense of meeting the immediate emergency the 500 russians who will continue their patrols will be in contact with work with the osce monitors and others undefined in the zone but this is just preliminary measure to meet the urgent conditions there still needs to be an international discussion to find an international mechanism to put in place until then these other temporary measures will be needed to meet the emergency 3 c later on august 21 mfa asequivalent for eurasia and the balkans roland galharague described the coming days as critical and decisive for the situation in georgia as well as relations with russia whether this crisis is oneoff for russia or the beginning of new dynamic is not yet fully clear frances current goal is to advance the political process for implementation of the sarkozybrokered sixpoint plan he said that beyond longterm stop to hostilities and russian retreat the key priority is establishing international arrangements as soon as possible to deny russia pretext for maintaining its presence in georgia galharague stated that the eu gaerc conclusions created mandate to pursue security council resolution but that france is further motivated to pursue one due to the belief that it would create the best basis for protecting georgian interests in order to implement point 5 of the ceasefire one and only one international mechanism is needed and one to which russia is not third party 4 c galharague said the french mission to the is working on revised draft unscr today that would cite in extenso the sixpoint plan and refer to an international mechanism to establish more clarity on the ground in georgia as quickly as possible existing mandates such as the osce monitoring one should be taken advantage of and can be followed by missions that first require new mandates both our current ground information and the signs coming from the russian government are contradictory and often unverifiable it is not clear whether they are taking steps to withdraw by the 22nd he said the primary european and allied interest is to establish new international dynamic permitting the rest of the international community to regain some control over russias actions he said france had not established any concrete benchmarks for russias retreat from georgia in the belief that more flexibility meant more opportunity to exert political pressure on russia he noted that russias goal would be to consolidate their positions while changing their force posture to peacekeeping mode regarding frances definition of point 5 he referred us to president sarkozys letter stating that while awaiting an international mechanism russian forces can remain in the immediate proximity of south ossetia he reiterated the need for unscr this time to replace the 1992 ceasefire agreement and 1999 understanding that russia currently uses as its point of reference for 500 troops and to give the international community more flexibility he pointed out that the same 1990s agreements posit similar number of georgian and south ossetian patrols and noted thats obviously mandate georgia cant fulfill now and another reason to supercede it he said that strengthened osce paris 00001616 002 of 002 monitoring mission would be due to urgency only and would not prejudge the political process or the eventual international arrangements for longterm resolution comment galharagues interpretation was fully consistent with what we heard from boillon shortly beforehand end comment 5 c regarding the eus role galharague said that whether european council might be convened would depend on developments he said there was more consensus than expected at the gaerc as france had not planned to issue conclusions he said the eu has consistent objective to gain more control of russias actions in the international arena and that that shared basis for action would remain unanimous 6 c galharague hypothesized that russias strategy for georgia was to produce kosovo in reverse only accelerated with saakashvili in the role of milosevic russia in the role of nato etc however he said it was too early to speculate about whether the crisis in georgia was just tit for tat for kosovo he said in his view russia viewed the situation as winwin regardless of the outcome of the status of south ossetia and abkhazia russia has had its revenge for kosovo he noted that russia will have more presence and operate more easily in more tense international climate galharague welcomed reftel demarche while expressing interest in further information regarding us strategy in the crisis including at the pol mc emphasized the need for russia to respect its commitments to retreat and encouraged active consideration of what will happen on august 22 if russian forces have not fully withdrawn please visit paris classified website at httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalfran ce pekala
