station ownership in general and minority and female ownership in particular as means to achieve that goal the courts have reinforced the notion that minority ownership is valid concern that should be addressed by the fcc when constructing its media ownership rules1 but also have set restric tions on how programs can be structured to foster that goal2 the fcc has issued second fu rther notice of proposed rulemaking sfnpr seeking comment on ne w broadcast ownership rules3 and two bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would revive tax incentive to aid certain businesses seeking

minority ownership of broadcast stations and make reco mmendations to the fcc5 the bills also would prevent the fcc from acting on any other ownership rules before taking action in response to the independent panel s recommendations legislation in the 110th congress that would reinstitute tax incentive for certain sales of telecommunications proper ties seeks to address the concerns the previous program raised by placing cap on the amount of gain that could be deferred by single sale and by length ening the amount of time that buyer must hold the property furthermore hr 600 would

however the fcc is seeking further comment on whether the definition of eligible entity may be expanded24 judicial review of racial classifications in broadcast ownership policies in 1995 the supreme court decided adarand construction v peña which held that all racebased classifications by the federal government must withstand strict scrutiny as discussed in the following section25 new tax incentives or other broadcast ownership policies that give pr eference to racial minorities therefore would need to withstand close judicial analysis strict scrutiny in adarand the supreme court declared that any racial classification by government at any level state local or federal must comply with strict scrutiny26 strict scrutiny is the most exacting revi ew court will undertake and requires the government to prove the measure is necessary to achieve compelling government interest and that the program is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest27 the court reasoned that this requirement was in line with the intentions of the fifth and fourteenth amendments which prot ect individuals and not groups from discrimination based on race28 government action that distinguishes between individuals based on membership in racial or ethnic group is inherently suspect and warrants the most exacting review29 compelling interest law or regulation that would attempt to define sdbs using the race or ethnicity of the business ow ners as factor in determining eligibility would have to meet strict scrutin as mandated by the court in adarand the first question reviewing court would ask is whether the interest the legislation or regulation seeks to achieve is compelling in the context of tax provisions and fcc programs that encourage sdbs to own broadcast proper ties the government interest that has been articulated is to promote broadcast viewpoint diversity30 the theory underlying this interest is that di verse ownership creates diversity of

supreme court has acknowledged that diversity of viewpoint in public discussion benefits the populace32 and that the government has an interest in encour aging such diversity over the broadcast airwaves33 however whether that interest is sufficiently compelling to survive strict scrutiny remains matter of debate prior to adarand the supreme court decided metro broadcasting v fcc and upheld the fccs minority broadcast owners hip policies after pplying intermediate scrutiny34 intermediate scrutiny is less exacting standard than strict scrutiny and requires the government to prove only that the relevant classification is substantially related to an important government intere st the court agreeing with congress and with the fcc held that enhancing broadcast diversity is at the very least an important govern ment interest35 the metro broadcasting majority grounded their im portant interest analysis in the scarcity of electromagnetic spectrum and the governments duty to distribute that spectrum to encourage the availability of the widest array of information sources and viewpoints36 the court noted that it is axiomatic that broadcasting may be regulated in light of the rights of the viewing and listening audience and that the widest possible dissemination of informa tion from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public37 according to the court it is the right of the public to receive diverse array of viewpoints and programming over the publicly owned broadcast airwaves and it is the dut of congress and the fcc to safeguard that right38 against this backdrop the metro broadcasting majority concluded that the diversity of viewpoints on the broad cast airwaves serves important first amendment principles and that this was sufficient basis for the minority ownership policies39 though metro broadcasting can provide some guidance as to the arguments that would be advanced in fa vor of finding that broadcast viewpoint diversity is compelling government inte rest because the court applied lower standard of scrutiny to what it termed b enign racial classifica tion deeper analysis is required to determine if the

strict in theory but fatal in fact41 justice oconnor noted the unhappy persistence of both the practices and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate r eality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it42 this language suggested to some that in order to survive strict scrutiny racial classifications would be permissible only to remedy the effects of past discrimination such an interpretation probably would have ruled out the legitimacy of all other justifications for classificati on of individuals based on their race the dissent in metro broadcasting in fact would have app lied strict scrutiny to the ownership rules at issue in that case43 the dissenters would have determined that broadcast ownership diversity was not compelling interest and noted that only one compelling interest supporting racebased classification d ever been recognized to remedy past discrimination44 in light of recent decisions however it is possible that diversity of broadcast viewpoint could be classified as compelling interest45 in grutter v bollinger the court made clear that remedial classifications are not the only racial classifications that will survive strict scrutiny46 in grutter the court held that diversity within student body is compelling interest fficient to withstand strict scrutiny47 the court relied heavily upon the reasoning of justice powells opinion in regents of university of california v bakke for its determination that student body diversity is compelling government interest48

fulfillment of its mission50 the grutter majority adopted this analysis and further justified its determination by according deference to the university administration in the selection of it students51 the court noted that sel ection of diverse student body is at the heart of the schools proper institutional mission and that good faith on the part of the university should be presumed52 because the educational benefits that diversity provided we re supported by the evidence the court accorded the universitys judgment of compelling inte rest in student body diversity degree of deference53 arguably there are number of similarities between the compelling interest found in creating diverse student body and that found in creating diversity of broadcast programming the majority in metro broadcasting equated the interest in the creation of diverse student body w ith the interest in creating diversity over the broadcast airwaves54 both interests have as their foundation the first amendment principles encouragin g the robust exchange of ideas55 both interests serve the important purposes of public education and freedom of speech56 both interests also serve wider range of people than the minority groups who would benefit ostensibly from any implemented policy57 the entire student body benefits from exposure to diverse people and ideas58 likewise the entire audience benefits from diverse viewpoints aired over broadcast regardless of their race or ethnic background59 consequently it appears that case could be made based on these similarities for finding that broadcast diversity is compelling interest narrow tailoring assuming that viewpoint diversity in broadcasting is compelling governmental interest the government then must prove that the program is necessary and narrowly tailo red to achieve that intere st the supreme court has yet to decide the parameters of narrowly tailored program in this context however examples of narrow tailoring in other contexts and the courts analysis in metro broadcasting may provide guidance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34269crs8 60 metro broadcasting 497 us at 578579 61 id at 553554 62 id at 564 63 id at 617619 64 id

interestthe government must first show that diversity of broadcast ownership is necessary to increase diversity of broadcast viewpoint the metro broadcasting majority gave weight to the findings of congress and the fcc that minorityowned broadcast stations produced programming that was qualitatively different from their counterparts and the finding that this programming contributed to broadcast programming diversity60 the court also deferred to the findings of congress and the fcc that many minority viewpoints were underrepresented in broadcast programming and that racene utral methods of increasin g that representation had failed repeatedly61 with these conclusions in mind the court found that increased diversity of broadcast prope rty ownership is substantially related to increased diversity of broadcast programming62 conclusion however that policy is substantially related to the achievement of an interest does not mean that the program is necessary to achieve that interest the concerns of the dissenting justices in metro broadcasting could provide guidance for the required nexus between broadcast property ownership and divers ity of programming that would support finding of necessity the dissenting justices in metro broadcasting found supporting evidence for the concept that increased diversity among owners increased diversity of viewpoint much less that policy favoring minorit ownership was necessary to increase diversity of viewpoint63 the dissenters observed that the ownership policies were based on the assumption that minorityowned stations provide desired viewpoints and that stations not owned by norities do not or cannot provide these viewpoints64 the dissenters opined that th fcc was barred by congress from examining the factual basis for the asserted nexus between broadcast programming diversity and diversity among broadcast property owners and that the evidence purporting the existence of nexus was too weak to support finding of necessity65 without stronger evidence that this assu mption was correct the dissenters could not conclude that increased minority ownership was necessary to achieve increased diversity of broadcast programming66 the metro broadcasting dissenters opinion could suggest closer examination by th court of the factual basis supporting the minority ownership program than the deference accorded to congresss fact finding by the metro broadcasting majority consequently an future minority ownership policies that use race as factor may need to be supported by evidence that demonstrates tighter

ownership leads to diversity of broadcast viewpoint the government must also show that other raceneutral met hods of achieving the goal of broadcast viewpoint diversity were considered in grutter the court held that narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable alterna tive but does require serious good faith consideration of workable raceneutral alternatives68 the government likely would be required therefore to consider racene utral options for fostering diversity before adopting program that takes race into account assuming that court found that diversity of ownership is necessary to achieve diversity of viewpoint the government ag ain must then prove that the program encouraging diversity of ownership is narrowl tailored to achieve the stated interest again looking to the higher edu cation cases and the dissent in metro broadcasting could inform the analysis of whether particular minority broadcast ownership program would be narrowly tailored in metro broadcasting the dissent took particular issue with the fact that the policies at issue in that case were geared solely towards benefitting certain minorities calling the policie s 100 set aside which placed impermissible burdens on nonminorities69 the dissenters concluded that the fcc was attempting to allocate certain li censes based on race an action prohibited by the constitution70 quotas or

in grutter however the court provided guidan ce for the types of permissible school admissions policies th at use race as factor73 the court held that taking race into account when making graduate school admission decisions is permissible so long as strict quota system is used74 admissions decisions made on an individualized basis may take race into acc ount among the many other factors used when deciding how particular individual would contribute to the diversity of the educational environment75 the court noted that many other variables were considered when deciding whether or not to admit an individual applicant and that race was only one factor included in determining the extent to which an individual would contribute to student body diversity76 the individualized nature of the determination seemed to assuage the c ourts constitutional c oncerns because the applicants were not evaluated or aw arded admission based solely on their membership in certain group77 furthermore because the admissions program was based on individual assessments of contributions to diversity the program did not place an undue burden on nonminority applicants78 similarly when encouraging diversity of broadcast ownership it appears that court would be more likely to uphold as narrowly tailored program that accounts for the race of the owners if the program uses race as but one of number of factors that could contribute to diversity of viewpoint79 in addition consideration may need to be given to the amount of diverse programming already available in individual
