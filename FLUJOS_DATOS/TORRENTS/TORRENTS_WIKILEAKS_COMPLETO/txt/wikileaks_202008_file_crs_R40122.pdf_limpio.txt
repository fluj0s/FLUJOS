t loan programs the federal family education loan ffel program authorized under title iv part b of the higher education act hea and the william d ford federal direct loan dl program authorized under title iv part d of the hea these programs make available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students to help them finance the costs of postsecondary education together these programs provide more direct aid to support students postsecondary educational pursuits than any other single source in fy2009 it is estimated that these programs will provide 74 billion in new loans to students and their parents under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders against loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy under the dl program the federal government provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital ie funds from the us treasury the two programs rely on different sources of capital and different administrative structures but essentially disburse the same set of loans subsidized stafford loans and unsubsidized stafford loans for undergraduate and graduate students plus loans for graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students and consolidation loans through which borrowers may combine their loans into single loan payable over longer term which varies according to the combined loan balance the loans made through the ffel and dl programs are lowinterest loans with maximum interest rates for each type of loan established by statute subsidized stafford loans are unique in that they are only available to students demonstrating financial need the secretary of education pays the interest that accrues on subsidized stafford loans while borrowers are in school during sixmonth grace period and during authorized periods of deferment unsubsidized stafford loans and plus loans are available to borrow ers irrespective of their financial need and borrowers are responsible for paying all the interest that accrues on these loans ffel and dl program loans have terms and conditions that may be more favorable to borrowers than private and other nonfederal loans these beneficial terms and conditions include interest rates that are often lower than rates that might be obtained from other lenders opportunities for repayment relief through deferment and forbearance loan consolidation and several loan forgiveness programs numerous changes were made to the ffel and dl programs under the college cost reduction and access act pl 11084 the ensuring continued access to student loans act pl 110227 and the higher education opportunity act pl 110315 this report describes the terms and conditions of loans currently available to borrowers it will be updated as warranted to reflect programmatic changes

government operates two major studen t loan programs the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford federal direct loan dl program2 these programs can trace their roots to the guaranteed student loan gsl program originally enacted in title iv of the higher education act hea of 1965 to enhance access to postsecondary education for students from low and middleincome families by providing them access to lowinterest student loans the ffel program formerly named the gsl program is authorized under title iv part b of the hea under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders against losses due to borrower default the federal government also provides private lenders variety of incentives designed to ensure that private capital will consistently be available to support ffel program student loans 3 private lenders originate ffel program loans and state and nonprofit guaranty agencies receive federal funds to play the lead role in administering the federal loan guarantee the dl program established in 1993 and authorized under title iv part d of the hea was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings originally it was intended to gradually expand and replace the ffel program the dl program provides the same set of loans as the ffel program but uses different administrative structure and draws on different source of capital under the dl program the federal government essentially serves as the bankerthe federal government provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital ie funds from the us treasury and owns the loans under the dl program schools may serve as direct loan originators or the loans may be originated by contractor working for the us department of education ed ed also hires contractor to service the loans while the original authorizing language for dl program called for the program to expand its share of new loan volume over series of years the higher education amendments of 1998 pl 105244 ultimately removed the provisions of the law that referred to phasein of the dl program and those which specified the proportion of new student loan volume to be made through the dl program in particular academic years currently both programs are authorized institutions of higher education ihes may apply to participate in one program or in both borrowers obtain loans annually under one program and the program they borrow under is determined by the ihe they attend 1 this report is adapted from crs report

common feature of all of these loans is that the federal government as either the guarantor or lender assumes the risk for losses that may occur through borrower default and pays for the discharge of loans in cases of borrower death disability and other limited instances another common feature shared by these loans is that for each type of loan maximum interest rates and fees that may be charged to borrowers are established by statute g21g158g139g156g146g141g146g163g142g141g561g21g157g138g143g143g152g155g141g561g14g152g138g151g156g561 these loans are needbased loans and are available to

for undergraduate students progression to higher grade level for purposes of awarding stafford loans does not necessarily correspond to the start of new academic year for instance student who continues to make satisfactory academic progress but does not progress to the next grade level could for instance receive stafford loans more than once as firstyear student once the student accrues enough credits to progress to the next higher grade level the student would become eligible for the higher borrowing limits available to secondyear students to be eligible to borrow stafford loans or

fulltime study at an ihe and must not be concurrently receiving title iv aid as an undergraduate student 17 dependency status and grade level are important because they determine the type of borrowing available to students and their families which in turn affects the borrowing limits discussed below available to them of particular importance with regard to undergraduate students is the fact that

the history of the federal student loan programs including changes between fixed interest rates and variable interest rate formulas this section discusses the interest rates that are applicable to the majority of loans currently in repayment loans that are currently being disbursed and loans to be disbursed in future years stafford loans disbursed on or after october 1 1992 and before july 1 2006 are variable rate loans on which rates adjust annually23 the formula used to calculate the variable interest rate for these loans many of which are still outstanding is determined by statute and stays in effect from the time the loan is disbursed through the life of the loan provided that the loan is not consolidated into fixedrate consolidation loan24 the rates for these stafford loans are determined every june 1 and become effective july 1 for the following 12month period the variable rate is calculated based upon the bond equivalent rate of the 91day treasury bill plus premium which differs depending on whether the borrower is in school or in repayment25 for loans made from july 1 1998 through june 30 2006 the borrower interest rate is based on the 91day treasury bill plus 17 percentage points for borrowers who are in school and the 91day treasury bill plus 23 percentage points for borrowers who are in repayment 26 the maximum interest rate that may apply to stafford loans disbursed during this period is capped at 825 stafford loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after july 1 2006 are fixed interest rate loans for all subsidized stafford loans and unsubsidized stafford loans disbursed on or after july 1 2006 and before july 1 2008 68 interest rate applies lower fixed interest rates apply to subsidized stafford loans made to undergraduate students on or after july 1 2008 and before july 1 2012 during this period the 68 fixed interest rate continues to apply to subsidized stafford loans to graduate and professional students and to all unsubsidized stafford loans also under current law the 68 fixed interest rate will apply to all stafford loans disbursed on or after july 1 2012 interest rates on stafford loans first disbursed on or after july 1 2006 are presented in table 2 22 these interest rates are maximum authorized rates the statutory rates are generally the rates charged to borrowers although lenders may voluntarily make loans with lower interest rates 23 for all stafford loans first disbursed on or after july 1 1994 the applicable interest rate and whether the rate is fixed or variable depends on the date the first disbursement of borrowers loan is made previously applicable interest rates depended largely on whether borrower had outstanding loans at the time of borrowing an additional loan 24 if variable rate loan is consolidated into new consolidation loan the interest rate becomes fixed at present the interest rate on consolidation loans is the weighted average of the interest rates in effect on the underlying loans at the time of consolidation rounded up to the nearest higher oneeighth of 1 and capped at 825 previously other rate setting formulas applied to consolidation loans see table in appendix b 25 interest rates are adjusted annually based on the bond equiva lent rate of the 91day treasury bill at the final auction held prior to june 1 26 differential rate is provided for those in

proportionately from each disbursement of the loan proceeds to the borrower the principal amount borrowed is often referred to as the gross disbursement amount and the amount the borrower actually

above statutory and regulatory provisions of the ffel and dl programs establish the maximum interest rates and fees that may be paid by borrowers in the ffel program the lender is required to pay the origination fee to the federal government and the lender can choose whether or not to pass the entire fee on to the borrower within certain limitations 35 the default fee which defrays federal default costs is paid to the guaranty agency for the guarantors locally held federal reserve fund if the default fee is paid by the borrower it must be deducted proportionally from the proceeds of the loan prior to payment to the borrower the default fee may also be paid by other nonfederal sources eg by the lender or the guarantor lenders in the ffel program have often competed for borrowers by offering different packages of interest rate and fee discounts to attract borrowers lenders might pay origination fees or default fees without passing on the cost to students similarly to attract loan business guaranty agencies might opt to pay the default fee the practice of waiving fees may have started as the ffel loan industry began experiencing competition from the dl program although lenders also compete with each other for business likewise under the dl program the secretary is authorized to offer borrowers interest rate reductions as means of encouraging ontime repayment 36 any such reductions made under the dl program must be cost neutral to the government this section briefly describes examples of the types of loan discounts and interest rebates that have commonly been offered to borrowers of loans made under the ffel and dl programs37 35 ffel lenders that charge an origination fee must generally assess the same fee to all borrowers an exception to this rule is that lender may assess lesser origination fee for borrower whose efc is equal to or less than the maximum qualifying efc for pell grant see 34 cfr 682202c 36 hea 455b8 34 cfr 685211b 37 the student loan discounts

offer loan discounts and in how they structure these benefits wide variety of student loan discounts have typically been offered by lenders making loans under the ffel programfor example paying fees on behalf of borrower or offering interest rate reductions some benefits might be structured such that they may only be realized if the borrower successfully makes specified number of consecutive ontime payments eg 12 24 or 36 benefits that are not provided until well into the repayment period however may not be beneficial to borrowers who desire to pay off their loans early or who consolidate their loans as in such instances these benefits may be lost some of the most common types of loan discounts offered by ffel program lenders are described below 38

sometimes lenders pay the loan origination fee on behalf of borrowers and sometimes either lenders or guaranty agencies also pay the 1 default fee this allows borrowers to apply greater percentage up to 100 of the amount borrowed toward their education expenses otherwise as described above when borrowers are required to pay origination and default fees on their loans their net disbursement or the amount of loan proceeds that may be applied toward education expenses is less than their gross disbursement or the total amount borrowed which must be repaid

increase over the duration of the repayment period thus when repaying according to graduated repayment plan borrower makes smaller payments at first and larger payments later on the range of monthly payment amounts is limited so that payment may be more than 3 times the amount of any other 49 this is to avoid offering very low initial payment amounts and excessively high ending payment levels which could contribute to borrower default for stafford loans and plus loans monthly payments may be less than the greater of 50 or the interest that accrues between payments and repayment must occur

amounts due on borrowers loans may range from 0 for borrowers with incomes at or below the poverty line to maximum of onetwelfth of 15 of any amount by which their agi exceeds 150 of the poverty line if borrowers repaying according to the ibr plan longer demonstrate partial financial hardship or longer desire to repay according to the ibr pl an then their maximum required monthly payment amounts may not exceed the initial monthly amount due as calculated according to standard 10year repayment period based on their loan balance at the time of their election to begin repaying according to the ibr plan accordingly repayment periods for such borrowers may exceed 10 years for married borrower who files joint federal income tax return payment amounts under the ibr plan will be based on the applicable borrowers student loan debt and both spouses combined agi however for married borrower who files separate federal income tax return payment amounts under the ibr plan will be based solely on that individuals student loan debt 57 34 cfr 685209c7 58 for additional information on poverty guidelines see us department of health and human services 2008 hhs poverty guidelines at
