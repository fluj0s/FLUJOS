the consequences of specified attack on particular asset the vulnerability of that asset to that particular threat and the threat to that asset11 the dhs risk formula is to c onsist of two risk calcualtions assetbased risk which uses threat values derived from us intelligence community assessment of threats to specific critical infrastructure and geographicbased risk which uses values based on inherent risks associated with geographic areas ie states or urban areas taking into account such factors as international borders terrorism reporting and investigati ons and population

include should states and us insular ar eas receive guaranteed minimum or guaranteed base of shsgp and letpp funding should homeland security grants be distributed solely on the basis of risk or risk and need does delaying the announcement of state and urban area allocations adversely affect their ability to plan and execute homeland security activities does dhss intention to group urba n areas into regions hamper the development of their homeland security planning minimum versus base18 dhs has decided to provide guaranteed base to every state dc and each us insular area from shsgp and letpp funding congress authorized dhs discretion in determining if the 075 of total appropriations guaranteed to states dc and puerto rico is to be either minimum or base19 if dhs were to use 100 riskbased fo rmula in determining state allocations minimum is the smallest allocation each state would receive were the riskbased calculations to result in any state allocation less than the statutorily defined minimum the allocations for states receiving more than the minimum would be reduced proportionally so that all stat would receive at least the minimum base is an amount guaranteed to each state without regard to risk or need after allocation of base am ounts states might receive further funding based on risk and need policy options for the method of grant allocation could include guaranteed base guaranteed minimum or neither that is policymakers may choose to decide whether 1 to provide every state with the same amount of base funding and then allocate the remainder of total appropriations based on risk and need 2 to allocate total appropriations based on risk and nee d and then if state does not receive certain amount or percentage minimum provide additiona l funding to the state to meet this amount or percentage with pr oportional reduction of f unding to the otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33241crs6 20 in fy2003 allocations were announced in jan 2003 in fy2004 allocations were announced in dec 2003 and in fy2005 allocations were announced in nov 2004states or 3 to allocate funding to stat based 100 on risk and need congress however would not be addressing the critics eg the 911 commission of its present funding formula by continuing to pr ovide states with guaranteed base or minimum risk versus need dhs has elected not to us 100 riskbased formula for allocating the remainder of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp following the distribution of state base amounts and total appropriations for uasi instead dhs has developed twopart approach to determining state and urbanarea allocations this approach consists of dhs risk assessment and state and urban areas justification of need for funding dhs has not informed states and urban areas through its fy2006 guidance what per centage of funds will be allocated based on risk and what percentage of f unds will be allocated based on need one could argue that by not allocating strictly on risk dhs has not addressed the critics such as the 911 commission in its 2004 report who advocate purely riskbased allocation of homeland security funding by coupling need with risk dhs might be providing funding to states and urban areas that do not have high risk of terrorism additionally some mig ht argue that less uasi funding will be distributed based on risk in fy2005 dhs distributed uasi funding based purely on risk using credible threat presence of critical infrastructure vulnerability population population density law enforcem ent investigative and enforcement activity and the existence of formal mutu aid agreements as funding formula factors in fy2006 dhs has added urban area homeland security needs to the uasi distribution formula conversely by allo cating funding based on both risk and need dhs is arguably addressing not only terrori sm risk but also state and urban areas capability to address that risk congress may c hoose to address the issue of risk and needbased funding by reviewing fy2006 state and urbanarea allo cations once they have been announced by dhs at later date and determining if the new distributi on formula meets the homeland security needs of the nation as w hole if congress were to determine that this new distribution method does not addr ess the national needs it might consider imposition of distribution method beyond th present statutory requirement of guaranteed amount of 075 to every state this distribution method might include risk criteria and benchmarks for deter mining national homeland security needs delayed awarding of state and urban area allocations in fy2003 fy2005 states and urban areas were inform ed of their homeland security grant allocations early in the fiscal years20 states have been notified of their fy2006 base allocations approximately 713 million each however because of dhss decision to wait until states and urban areas complete their enhancement plans and justifications states and urban areas will not be notified of their total grant allocations until sometime in the late spring of 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33241crs7 21 us department of homeland security ho meland security secretary michael chertoff press conference jan 3 2006 available at httphomelandcqcom visited jan 4 2006it is possible that states and urban areas lacking an indication of how much funding they will receive will not know how to accurately plan or develop homeland security activities for fy2006 it is possible that state or an urban area will develop an enhancement plan and investment jus tification that relies on certain amount of federal homeland security funding and then be notified following dhss risks and needs assessment that it will not be receiving the desired amount of funding or any funding beyond its base shsgp nd letpp allocation this in turn might result in the state having to adjust or rework its homeland security planning and implementation activities dditionally if the announcemen t of state allocations is delayed localities could be further delayed in being informed by states of any fy2006 shsgp and letpp funding they might receive conversely by delaying the announcemen t of state allocations dhs might be afforded an extended period for more accurately determining state and urbanarea homeland security risks and needs dhss requirement for an enhancement plan and investment justification could also result in states and urban areas more accurately determining their risks capabilities and needs which could facilitate dhss overall national risks and needs assessment congress may choose to address the issue of delayed allocati ons by reviewing the fy2006 state and urbanarea allocations following their announcement and the effect on state and urbanarea homeland security plans if congress were to determine that this delay in allocations does not suit the states and urban areas needs it might consider requiring dhs to announce allocation amounts early in the fiscal year for future dhs homel and security grant distributions regional urban area security initiative allocations dhs has announced its intention to group individua l jurisdictions into super uasi groups and to reduce the number of jurisdicti ons from 50 urban areas to 35 with an additional 11 urban areas that received f unding in fy2005 eligible to apply for sustainment money for ongoing homeland security projects see table 2 acting director of gt mathew mayer stated th at it would be the responsibility of the individual jurisdictions within the super uasi regions to determine allocations within the regions the uasi regional juri sdictions are required within 60 days to develop an enhancement plan and investment justification to be eligible to receive funding additionally uasi regions can pply for funding to support some dualuse activities such as evacuations and search and rescue operations which assist with not only terrorist incident s but also natural disasters 21 this grouping of individual jurisdicti ons into super uasi regions coupled with the new needs portion of the method for distributing uasi funds might result in jurisdictions with higher threat of terrorism receiving less funding additional funding might be directed to the 11 urba n areas eligible for sustainment funding which could reduce the amounts for the ot her 35 super uasi regions also uasi regions that have greater need for dua luse capabilities might receive more funding than those with higher terrorism threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33241crs8 on the other hand the identificati on of uasi regions over individual jurisdictions urban areas comprising num erous jurisdictions could increase the security of individual urban areas by incr easing the security of the regions overall arguably terrorists do not recognize political or geographical boundaries when planning attacks within the united states dhss intention to authorize dual use of uasi funding might make urba n areas better able to re spond to terrorist attacks because whether the crisis is terrorist attack or natural disaster an urban area could still need the ability to evacuate all or portions of its citiz ens or conduct search and rescue operations the uasi regions however seem not to reflect great change from the fy2005 uasi urban area designatio ns with such exceptions as the combination of jersey city and newark and the inclusion of yonkers with new york city regional uasi allocations for fy2006 may not become point of contention until dhs announces them late in the spri ng of 2006 at that time congress may choose to review the allocations and th eir effect on the uasi regions homeland security plans should congress determin that regional allocations do not address individual jurisdictions requirements it might consider directing dhs to allocate uasi funds to individual jurisdictions instead of regionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33241 crs9 table 2 fy2006 urban area security initiative
