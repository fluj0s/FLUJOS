standing to challenge the constitutionality of public law the court in raines recognized the separation of powers problems posed by congressional plaintiﬀ suits but did not clarify the extent to which such problems may limit the ability of members to sue in federal court the court was of the view that congressional plaintiﬀ may have standing if he has suﬀered either personal injury or an

overview summary standing is threshold procedural question which turns not on the merits of the plaintiffs complaint but rather on whether he has legal right to judicial determination of the issues he raises the law of standing is blend of constitutional requirements and prudential considerations the constitutional component of standing is rooted in the separation of powers doctrine and in particular on the limitation of the federal judicial power granted by article iii of the constitution to cases and controversies to satisfy constitutional standing requirements plaintiff must allege personal injury that is fairly traceable to alleged unlawful conduct by the defendant and that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief raines v byrd 1997 case was the first ruling of the supreme court on the issue of the standing of members of congress when they assert an injury to their institutional authority as legislators the suit was filed by six members of congress who had voted against the line item veto act against the secretary of the treasury and the director of the office of management and budget alleging that the act unconstitutionally increased the presidents power by authorizing him to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after he signed them into law without complying with the requirements of bicameral passage and presentment to the president the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing and thus the suit was dismissed the court in raines recognized the separation of powers problem s posed by congressional plaintiff suits and addressed them as part of the constitutional standing analysis but did not clarify the extent to which such problems may limit the ability of members to sue in federal court the court in raines was prepared to recognize members standing based on personal injury to private right but considered an injury to legislators voting power to be an official injury the court in raines was willing to find an institutional injury to be sufficient if that injury amounted to nullification of particular vote and if the plaintiffs votes would have been sufficient to pass or defeat particular bill the court in raines may have insisted that congressional plaintiffs allege either personal injury to private right or an institutional injury amounting to nullification of vote because it is in such cases that the injury is concrete particularized and thus presents case appropriate for judicial resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30280contents what is standing 1 congressional standing before raines v byrd 2 the

turns not on the merits of the plaintiffs complaint but rather on whether he has legal right to judicial determination of the issues he raises3 the law of standing is mixture of constitutional

of powers6 and in particular on the limitation of the federal judicial power granted by article iii to cases and controversies7 to satisfy constitutional standing requirements plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief8 in addition to the immutable constitutional requirements the federal judiciary has also adhered to set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing like their constitutional counterparts these judicially selfimposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction are founded in concern about the properand properly limitedrole of the courts in democratic society but unlike their constitutional counterparts they can be modified or abrogated by congress 9 the prudential components of standing doctrine require that 1 plaintiff assert his own legal rights and interests rather than those of third parties 2 plaintiffs complaint be encompassed by the zone of interests protecte d or regulated by the constitutional or statutory guarantee at issue and 3 courts decline to adjudicate abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to general ized grievances pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches10 congressional standing before raines v byrd the cases which have presented the issue of the standing of members in their official capacities as legislators have generally been challenges to executive branch actions or to acts of congress prior to raines v byrd the case law on congressional standing consisted almost entirely of opinions of the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the import of these decisions following the ruling in raines is uncertain11 in the leading case of riegle v federal open market committee 12 the court concluded that if member had standing under the rules applied in noncongressional plaintiff cases the separation of powers issues raised in members suit

the member had legislative remedy and if similar action could be brought by private plaintiff the legislative remedy aspect of this doctrine reflected judicial reluctance to provide forum to member who has failed to exhaust possible legislative avenues of relief or who has done so but has been unsuccessful in persuading his colleagues of the merits of his views13 members had some success in establishing their standing following adoption of the riegle test but such suits were frequently dismissed on the basis of the equitable discretion doctrine14 the problems presented by congressional plaintiff suits were explained by the dc circuit in an important postriegle ruling moore v us house of representatives suits against coordinate branches of government by congressional plaintiffs pose separationofpowers concerns which may affect complainants standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the extent that the constitution envisions limited federal court jurisdiction out of respect for the coordinate branches of government we have been reluctant to grant standing to members of congress alleging generalized amorphous injuries due to either the actions of their colleagues in congress or the conduct of the executive where separationof powers concerns are present the plaintiffs alleged injury must be specific and cognizable in order to give rise to standing deprivation of constitutionally mandated process of enacting law may inflict more specific injury on member of congress than would be presented by generalized complaint that legislators effectiveness is diminished by allegedly illegal activities taking place outside the legislative forum15 the decision in raines v byrd in raines six members of congress who had voted against the line item veto

see also id at 81920 19id at 81820 although the holding was based on the courts finding that plaintiffs did not satisfy the first standing requirement personal injury the court questioned whether the plaintiffs could meet the second standing requirement that the injury be fairly traceable to unlawful conduct by the defendants since the alleged cause of plaintiffs injury is not the executive branch defendants exercise of legislative power but the actions of their own colleagues in congress in passing the act id at 830 n11 20justice souter concurring seemed to attach less importan ce than the majority to the distinction between personal and official injury id at 831 but agreed with the majority that plaintiffs lacked standing justice breyer dissenting argued that there is absolute constitutional distinction between cases involving personal harm and those involving an official harm id at 841 and would have granted standing id at 843 unlike the majority which viewed injury to legislators voting power as an official injury justice stevens dissenting asserted that legislator has personal interest in the ability to vote and stated that deprivation of the right to vote would be sufficient injury to establish standing id at 837 and 837 n2 21see chenoweth v clinton 997 f supp 36 3839 ddc 1998 personal injury more likely to result in grant of standing but institutional injury is sufficient under raines affd 181 f3d 112 dccir 1999 see also planned parenthood v ehlmann 137 f3d 573 57778 8th cir 1998standing of state legislators 22the court in coleman v miller 307 us 433 1939 held that kansas state legislators had standing to bring suit against state officials to recognize that the legislature had not ratified proposed amendment to the united states constitution the plaintiffs in that case included twenty senators whose votes against the measure would have been sufficient to defeat it but whose votes were essentially nullified by the tiebreaking vote of the states lieutenant governor the presiding officer of the senate in favor of ratification the raines court distinguished the injury alleged by the plaintiffs in that case the abstract dilution of institutional legislative power from the injury asserted in coleman vote nullification 521 us at 826 and found it unnecessary to decide whether coleman might also be distinguished on other grounds therefore raines did not address the question of whether coleman would warrant granting standing in suit by federal legislators even though such an action raises separation of powers concerns not present in coleman 521 us at 824 n8 coleman the only case in which the court has held that legislators alleging an institutional injury have standing raines 521 us at 821 may be narrow exception to raines personalcapacity injury requirement based on the concreteness of the alleged injury leading cases supra note 1 at 223 because of the considerable difference between the vote nullification in coleman and the alleged dilution of legislative power in raines it was not necessary for the raines court to determine the precise parameters of continuedthe complaint the court in an opinion by chief justice rehnquist that recognized the restricted role for article iii courts in resolving disputes between the political branches18 held that plaintiffs lacked standing because their complaint did not establish that they had suffered an injury that was personal particularized and concrete19 the majority distinguished between personal injury to private right and an institutional or official one20 and was of the view that congressional plaintiff may have standing in suit against the executive if it is alleged that the plaintiff has suffered either personal injury eg loss of members seat or an institutional one21 that is not abstract and widely dispersed but amounts to vote nullification22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30280crs5 22continued vote nullification that must be alleged for members to

27id at 218 28problems posed for the judiciary in resolving dispute involving the two political branches are less severe when suit is brought by private plaintiff because the role of the courts in hearing such cases has been recognized since marbury v madison 1 cranch 137 1803 see raines v byrd 521 us at 83334 souter j concurring the vitality of this principle was demonstrated when the court the year after raines invalidated the line item veto act in suit filed by several noncongressional plaintiffs clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 1998 in the view of the court the raines plaintiffs alleged23 an institutional injury which damaged all members reduction of legislative and political power rather than personal injury to private right which would be more particularized and concrete24 the court in raines declined to decide whether the outcome might have been different if plaintiffs had been authorized to represent the house and senate in fact both houses opposed the suit b members lacked legislative remedy the court noted that members could repeal the act or exempt appropriations bills from its reach or c the act was not subject to constitutional challenge in suit by other plaintiffs25 analysis congressional standing after raines v byrd the law of congressional standing which even prior to the courts ruling in raines was described as both complex and contentious26 has now been characterized as doctrine fraught with analytical inconsistency and uncertain boundaries27 raines the first ruling of the court on the issue of the standing of members of congress when they assert an injury to their institutional authority as legislators revealed the courts reluctance to grant standing to members because of separation of powers considerations but the case did not fully define the circumstances in which congressional plaintiff suits may be permissible the court in raines recognized the separation of powers problems posed by congressional plaintiff suits28 and addressed them as part of the constitutional standinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30280crs6 29prudential limitations on standing had been removed by law 521 us at 820 n3 30see chenoweth v clinton 181 f3d

seat and the loss of his salary at issue in powell v mccormack 395 us 486 1969 raines 521 us at 82021 the plaintiff in powell clearly had standing to challenge the loss of his salary resulting from his exclusion by the house in the 90th congress because such loss of salary constituted personal injury to private right in ruling of the dc circuit prior to raines it was held that member had standing to challenge the automatic cost of living adjustment cola provisions of the ethics reform act of 1989 as those provisions affected congressional salaries and that the equitable discretion doctrine did not preclude such challenge even though the 1989 act could have been amended or repealed because the member sued in his capacity as government employee boehner v anderson 30 f3d 156 dc cir 1994 in ruling of the 10th circuit after raines it was held that member lacked standing to challenge two colas received pursuant to the 1989 act because the alleged injury was not shown to be personal colas were received by all members and concrete allegation that colas damaged members political position found to be more abstract than dilution of legislative power alleged in raines schaeffer v clinton 240 f3d 878 885 886 10th cir 2001 the court in schaeffer id at 886 found the cursory discussion of standing in boehner unpersuasive and contrary to recent supreme court law 33see

problems as part of the standing inquiry but rather under the equitable discretion doctrine as matters that might require court to exercise judicial selfrestraint30 under both raines and riegle congressional plaintiff is more likely to succeed in establishing his standing if he alleges particular injury rather than an injury related to generalized grievance about the conduct of government or an injury amounting to claim of diminished effectiveness as legislator31 the court in raines was prepared to recognize members standing based on personal injury to private right32 but considered an injury to legislators voting power to be an official injury the dc circuit cases had found members to have personal interest in the exercise of their governmental powers33 the court in raines was willing to find an institutional injury to be sufficient if that injury amounted to nullification of particular vote34 and if the plaintiffs votes would have been sufficient to pass or defeat specific

house it may be more difficult for congressional plaintiff to establish his standing after raines but it is noted that cases in which congressional plaintiffs established standing under riegle were often either dismissed under the equitable discretion doctrine or were reversed by the supreme court on other jurisdictional grounds see chenoweth v clinton 37leading cases supra note 1 at 222 38id at

requisite category of nullification emphasis added 41wright miller and cooper supra note 11 at p 1 42raines 521 us at 824 43wright miller and cooper supra note 11 at p 1 44congressional plaintiffs may name executive branch officials as defendants in suits alleging vote nullification by the executive see eg coleman v miller 307 us 433 1939 affg 146 kan 390 71 p2d 518 1937 among the named defendants were executive and continuedconstitutionally prescribed process for enacting legislation including injuries related to dilution of legislative authority36 the court in raines may have insisted that congressional plaintiffs allege either personal injury to private right or an institutional injury amounting to nullification of vote because it is in such cases that the injury is concrete particularized and thus presents case appropriate for judicial resolution37 furthermore the court may have been willing to recognize an institutional injury amounting to nullification of vote on particular matter in suit filed by controlling bloc of legislators because in such an action plaintiffs sue in effect as representatives of their legislative bodies suits to protect legislative power brought by representatives of congress or by congress itself do not seek to protect private stake in official power38 stake which the court in raines was not willing to recognize39 additionally the raines court indicated that it would not find nullification of vote if some means of legislative redress was available to the plaintiffs40 the limits on standing established in raines may well preclude member from obtaining standing in suit to challenge an act of congress41 because in such case the availability of legislative remedies including the repeal or amendment of the act42 would prevent the court from finding vote nullification raines will greatly restrict standing to challenge executive action although there may be better opportunity to achieve standing in this setting43 if the plaintiff member can show the nullification of vote by the executiv as in coleman and can thus establish an institutional injury44 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30280crs8 44continued legislative branch

explained in riegle 656 f2d at 879 n6 when plaintiff alleges injury by unconstitutional action taken pursuant to statute his proper defendants are those acting unconstitutionally under the law and not the legislature which enacted the statute see generally marbury v madison 5 us 1 cranch 137 17580 1803 4552 f supp 2d 34 ddc 1999 affd 203 f3d 19 dc cir cert denied 121 s ct 50 2000 the district court held that twentysix members of the house lacked standing to seek declaration that the president violated the war powers clause of the constitution and the war powers resolution 50 usc 1541 et seq by involving the united states in an air offensive against the federal republic of yugoslavia plaintiffs in campbell argued that they had standing because the president had nullified or ignored clear legislative directives from congress 52 f supp 2d at 42 the district court found that because series of congressional votes relating to the air offensive had sent conflicting signals the president had not nullified or ignored an unambiguous directive from congress id at 43 the district court explained that to show complete nullification of their votes plaintiffs were required to demonstrate that there was constitutional impasse or actual confrontation between the legislative and executive branches id in the majority opinion for the court of appeals judge silberman observed that it is not readily apparent what the supreme court meant by nullification 203 f3d at 22 but found that the president had relied on his constitutional powers for his actions and had not nullified legislative directives id according to silberman nullification must be understood in light of the unusual situation in coleman v miller 307 us 433 1939 in which the plaintiff state legislators had legislative remedy whereas the plaintiffs in campbell had legislative options including legislation barring the use of us forces in the yugoslav campaign legislation cutting off funding for the american participation in the conflict and impeachment of the president 203 f3d at 23 the majority opinion concluded that the availability of legislative optionie the right to vote in the futureis remedy for the nullification of prior vote id at 24 but randolph j concurring was of the view that the nullification of prior vote is unaffected by members ability to vote for other legislation in the future id at 42 46181 f3d 112 dc cir 1999 47in chenoweth plaintiffs alleged that the presidents creation of program the american heritage rivers initiative ahri by executive order in the absence of statutory authority denied them their proper role in the legislative process and thus diluted their authority as legislators id at 113 115 this was the same harm held in moore v us house of continuedfollowing raines decisions of the dc circuit have attempted to clarify the meaning of nullification as used in raines and b the status of preraines circuit rulings in regard to the meaning of nullification the dc circuit concluded in campbell v clinton45 that the availability of legislative remedy precludes the finding of nullification in regard to the status of its preraines rulings the majority of the court of appeals in chenoweth v clinton46 believed that raines had limited but not overruled those cases47 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30280crs9 47continued representatives 733 f2d 946 dccir 1984 cert

chenoweth found id that because such an injury is widely dispersed and abstract it is insuffici ent following raines chenoweth concluded that although moore would have given the chenoweth plaintiffs standing it would have resulted in dismissal of the plaintiffs suit under the equitable discretion doctrine because of the availability of legislative remedy therefore according to the chenoweth court raines may not overrule moore but might require the dc circuit to merge its separation of powers and standing analyses 181 f3d at 11516 and according to dicta in chenoweth kennedy may survive raines as peculiar application of coleman because the presidents pocket veto arguably nullified plaintiffs vote chenoweth 181 f3d at 116 17 conclusion raines v byrd revealed the reluctance of the court to grant standing to members because of separation of powers considerations but the ruling did not fully define the circumstances in which congressional plaintiff suits may be allowed the court in raines was of the view that congressional plaintiff may have standing if he has suffered either personal injury or an institutional one that amounts to vote nullification raines may make it impossible for member to obtain standing to challenge an act of congress and will require member in suit challenging executive action to show the nullification of vote by the executive to establish an institutional injury
