the investment theme of africa and the related opportunities historically african growth has lagged the global average between 1960 and 2001 according to the imf average african growth was just 32 compared to the global average of 41 however more recently 2002 07e africa has enjoyed much healthier growth rates in absolute and relative terms aggregate regional gdp growth looks likely to have topped 5 for the fourth year in row in 2007e based on imf data in our view the current growth rate l ooks much more sustainable given political and institutional improvements and greater economic stability however africa is likely to remain something of warrant on commodity performance given significant oil and mining dependence but given positive view on commodities our forecasts for aggregate growth in africa remain well above forecasts for global growth we forecast average african gdp growth of 53 pa between 2008 and 2011 compared to 34 at the global level from an equity perspective african mark ets have displayed low correlation to other markets and in that respect offer diversification benefits we see value in considering this as an indirect investor we thus

correlations 101 prices in this report as at the close on 2 april 2008 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 4 executive summary introduction much of what has historically been said about potential growth in africa has been negative this report seeks to reexamine this story we find that average african gdp growth between 1960 and 2001 was indeed lower than for the rest of the world at 32 according to the imf compared to the global average of 41 pa however more recently 2002 07e africa has enjoyed much healthier growth rates in absolute and relative terms aggregate regional gdp growth looks likely to have topped 5 for the fourth year in row in 2007e based on imf data compared to other global economic regions average gdp growth in africa has been second only to asia in the current decade however there is long way to go for africa to develop in manner akin to that seen in asia in 2007 africa accounted for 13 of global population 857m out of 65bn people but only 2 of global gdp us1041bn out of us53352bn gdp per capita was just us1215 compared to the global average of us8183 according to imf data the spark that has ignited african growth in recent years arguably stems from the significant increase in commodity prices 57 of africas exports are fuels 23 are metals and raw materials this is akin to the exper ience of africa during the 1960s african gdp growth averaged 46 over the 1960s as the region benefited from the global upturn in commodity prices however growth back then proved hard to sustain as political conflicts developed macro policy was unsupportive and institutions were weak the question for us now is whether or not the growth this time can prove to be more resilient in this report we consider the macro and micro developments in africa so far and consider the potential for investors from the revival in africas fortunes from macro perspective we attempt to gauge to what extent the current growth rate is sustainable relative to africas own history and the experience of other developing economies from micro perspective we look at the growth prospects for eight sectors and specifically consider which international companies look set to benefit from an ongoing reversal in africas fortunes african markets have themselves disp layed low correlation with global equities and to that extent offered diversification bene fit for investors the indirect investor may be able to achieve similar aim within devel oped markets in this report we identify international stocks that offer the highest exposure to africa based on our and company guidance for 2007e percentage revenue from africa the macro backdrop fundamentals improving but heavily dependent on commodities we consider six factors that help determi ne the sustainability of growth politics institutions macrostability diversification health and educat ion wherever possible we have compared the current statistics for africa to its own history and that of asia 2030 years ago when that region began period of sustained growth generally the good news is as follows 1 the political situation is much improv ed although kenya zimbabwe and darfur have dominated headlines in recent months civil unrest has declined significantly in angola the 27yearlong civil war ended in 2002 mozambique since the end of the civil war in 1992 after 17 years of fighting and uganda the government and the main rebel group signed peace deal in august 2006 after 18 years of conflict data on political freedom suggests that 11 out of 50 countries representing 33 of total african gdp are now classified as fullyfree political systems compared to only four countries classified as fullyfree 10 years ago 84 of latin american gdp and 41 of emerging asian gdp are classified as fully free 2 meanwhile significant advances have been made in terms of the institutional framework for example the imf measure of economic institutional risk allocates an 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 5 average score of 313 out of 50the higher the level the betterto africa which is in line with the asian score 317 in 1984 when asia underwent period of sustained growth 3 macro indicators suggest greater stabilit african inflation has dropped from an average of 19 in the 1980s to 6 now our global strategists find that falling inflation is the single most important driver of market rerating and falling real interest rates reserves have risen from 37 months of imports at the start of the decade to over six months external debt largely thanks to the efforts of the hipc mdri and paris club has fallen by us73bn over the past three years to 20 of gdp regional budget deficit of 27 of gdp at the start of the decade is 19 surplus now 4 education levels are now much better than we re historically the case according to unesco 98 of children were enrolled at primary school in 2005 vs 78 in 1990 and 37 made it to secondary school vs 22 in 1990 this is in line with the statistics for asia in the 1970s the latest data 2004 from unesco shows that 44 of african gdp is spent on education compared to 3 in asia in 1991 5 africa looks likely to benefit significantly from the commodity boom it benefits directly because overall for the continent 47 of gdp is commodityrelated and net commodity exports are 32 of gdp thus 10 rise in commodity prices overall boosts net exports by 32 as important is the indirect effect in bid to secure access to resources china in particular has been investing more in africa which has often involved improving the infrastructure as well as boosting extractive capacity net fdi to africa has risen 10fold us271bn in 2007 vs us24bn average over the 1980s and 1990s relative to gdp net fdi into africa is now secondhighest among the emerging market regions after emerging europe and the middle east and much of the fdi is concentrated on the resources sector the imf estimate that 70 of the gross direct investment flows to subs aharan africa in 2006 went to oil exporters angola equatorial guinea and nigeria in addi tion the tax take on resource projects in africa tends to be very high thus boosting fiscal revenues more than elsewhere in the world africa is net food importer 55 of employment and 17 of gdp comes from agriculture high agriprices should spur impr ovements in agricultural productivity 6 there appears to be significant scope for vertical integration especially now that there has been substantial easing of trade ba rriers through the eba and agoa schemes and in many cases this is being enforced by legislation that mandates minimum local content for instance in botswana one of the worlds biggest diamond producers cut diamonds represented less than 1 of tota l diamond exports in 2006 most of the grading and polishing was undertaken in europe and india african oil is exported in raw form for refining in another country and t hen reimported for retail sale angola for instance only has capacity to refine 49 of its total oil production gabon can refine only 68 of its total oil production however against these positives we have to face up to three very significant problems 1 the massive appreciation of the terms of trade has taken exchange rates in many african markets to levels that may adversely affect longterm current account prospects by restricting export diversific ation fuel exports made up 51 of total african exports in 1985 and still accounted for 57 of exports in 2005 africa has lost market share over the last 30 years t 24 of global trade vs 4 in 1970 2 health issues are still major problem africa based on who data average life expectancy of 49 years clearly lags behind even the historical record set by asia where the population has seen an improvement in life expectancy from 65 years in 1982 to 70 years currently according to the who nevertheless population and labour force growth is high in africa 24 pa given double the female fertility rate of asia 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 6 3 the volatility of political regimes partly as result of country borders that in many cases were drawn up irrespective of tribal boundaries we reach four broa d macro conclusions 1 african growth is more sustainable than it has been in the past but much more reform is needed before africa can decouple from the global cycle 2 given number 1 the outlook for commodities still appears to be the key to african growth performance over the next five years however we remain very positive on commodity prospects see figure 40 detailing our view on resources hence our forecasts for aggregate growth in africa remain well above expectations for average global growth we forecast average afric an growth of 53 pa between 2008 and 2011 compared to 34 at the global level 3 from topdown perspective given the bi as towards commoditydriven investment and growth in the region it seems likely that those countries with relatively greater natural resources as well as improving political situations are most likely to deliver the fastest growth rates over the next 35 years we would group botswana nigeria angola and zambia in this bracket as we ll as albeit with somewhat higher risk ratings dr congo equatorial guinea liby and mozambique south african growth prospects are somewhat lower than for other parts of africa since the current account deficit 64 of gdp is more difficult financing proposition than the surpluses recorded elsewhere and since many of the more straightforward changes and improvements in terms of political and institutional reform have already been made as illustrated by the much higher private sector credit to gdp ratio of 86 than for the rest of africa indeed the apparent lack of choice for the electorate in the forthcoming 2009 presidential elections is concern in addition the severe ongoing power shortage is already undermining output in key parts of the economy eg gold mining 4 globally one of the most successful strategies for making money out of the commodity boom has been to buy domestic pl ays in those countries that are big commodity exporters eg opec banks russian banks and telecoms this of course applies to africa as well and thus from topdown perspective we would focus on telecom infrastructure and bank names with exposure to the large commodity exporters particularly in those markets that are enjoying current account surpluses examples from our screen include mtn orascom zain group pz cussons cimpor bpi guangzhou shipyard hikma lafarge heineken cocacola hellenic equity themes mining and more in this report our global equity research teams have put together view of africa from an equity investment perspective this has cent red around eight major sectors while we have included analysis of south african exposed companies we are mainly concentrating here on the relevance of this investment theme for companies that are listed outside of the continent in this process we have identified total of 111 internationally rather than south african listed companies that offer exposure to african growth potential eighteen of these companies have exposure in excess of 40 of revenues 15 have exposure of between 20 and 40 and 23 have exposure of 1020 other companies are included in our study despite having african exposure that is currently low as they may have plans in place for significant future growth eg international power which is contracted to build and run the 3600mw power plant in mmamabula botswana which the company expects to come on stream around 2012 we would highlight the following as key to the investment story 1 mining and commodities the opportunities in the mining sector are very significant given the lack of investment to date and the size of the resource dr congo hosts some of the worlds richest known 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 7 copper and cobalt orebodies but is only producing at 510 of their potential on our estimates zambia is rich in copper and appear s to be quickly returning to its former productive capacity but is still only operating at 60 of its potential on our estimates mozambique hosts an estimated 10 of global c oal resources according to consultants brook hunt but accounts for less than 2 of world coal production angola has significant copper diamond and oil prospects that are attracting attention from china as ballpark estimate we think these countries could see investments of over us100bn in the coming five years as the commodity bull market continues the major miners have been slow to invest in africa and most of the early moves have come from either chineseindian consortiums or smallcap miners listed on the aim tsx jsx or the asx indices significant exposure to african commodities can be accessed via canadalisted first quantum mining for copper and coal and gold in drc zambia and mauritania 100 of revenues from africa in 2007 australialisted anvil mining copper in drc 100 revenues

salisted miners the pureplay platinum and gold stocks offer much greater african exposure than the duallisted bigcap names zimbabwe appears to be the key to longterm growth at impala platinum anglo platinum is much more focused on south africa as is anglogold ashanti gold fields has been expanding operations in ghana which made up 19 of production in 2007 2 oil and energy the potential in the oil and energy sector in africa appears to be as impressive as for mining africa ranks as the thirdlargest region in terms of remaining proved liquid and gas reserves 9 of the global total and this loo ks set to rise with recent finds in uganda and offshore ghana there has of course been less intensive exploration than elsewhere proven oil and gas reserves for africa have ris by 15 over the last 10 years compared to only 8 for the world the key resource holders are nigeria liby algeria egypt and angola which combined account for 92 of total proved african reserves according to eni of the internationally listed companies we have focused on in this report the greatest exposure to africa is offered via afren over 95 of revenues from africa in 2007 tullow oil 58 of revenues from africa in 2007 eni 49 of reserves in africa in 2007 marathon 46 of reserves in africa in 2007 and total 29 of reserves in 2007 asian corporates have also made major investments in african oil petrochina has made upstream investments in sudan and sinopec has invested in angola although the contribution to revenues is so far minimal cnooc has made meaningful commitment cus4bn in nigeria we believe this will account for c13 of total revenues by 2010 indias ongc has invested in exploratory blocks in libya sudan and egypt and has stake in the gnop field in sudan but accounting for less than 10 of total revenues for now in joint venture ongc mittal has committed us6bn to infrastructure development in nigeria and has stakes in two oil blocks japans itochu holds 20 interest in an lng project in namibia the total project cost is estimated at cus6bn by the company the major south african oil stock is sasol around 90 of sasols near term revenues are generated through the sale of oil and chemical products from its 150kbd secunda plant in south africa sasol also has upstream acreage in mozambique and is building gas to liquids plant in nigeria 3 infrastructure investment growth in the commodity sector is likely to fuel significant growth in african infrastructure for three reasons because some governments are demanding the expense as part of granting oil and mining concessions b since infrastructure is so poor growth in extraction or costeffective exporting requi res the upgrade and c because the significant 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 8 improvement in fiscal accounts means some countries can easily fund improvements directly libya announced in late 2007 that it would spend us123bn 186 of gdp over five years building roads ports schools and housing on the back of rising oil revenues it is clear to us that africa is suffering major power shortage the world bank financed african power projects worth us1bn in 2007 and us660m in 2006 this investment should deliver c1000mw of additional generating capacity pa yet the world bank estimate 2000mw pa or more is needed to keep pace with demand there is huge hydro as well as coalfired power potential expanding the inga hydro project on the kinshasa also known as the congo river could prov ide enough power for the whole of africa according to the development team international power generators have so far been reluctant to invest much in african power supply given political instability and problems defining longterm contracts uklisted international power is the only generating company with major africa power project in its pipeline the other major shortage is the supply of fresh water the major investment so far has come from hyflux through its desalination project in algeria we estimate the revenue contribution will be around 40 of the total for hyflux in 2008 and 2009 revenue exposure of the capital goods companies is not that high for now but the growth forecasts are strong at alstom african orders account for around 1015 of total order intake in the past 12 months but courtesy of the power shortages demand appears to be accelerating abb 5 in sales to africa in 2007 is another way to play power capex in africa away from purely power generation at jgc tokyolisted engineering and construction company african projects accounted for 3 of the order book at the end of 1h 308 but could rise sharply to over 20 with the expected by the company award of major gas development project in 309 at daewoo engineering and construction 11 of 2007 revenues were generated through sales of lng and power plant equipment to nigeria and libya we expect african revenue growth of c33 in 2008 versus 10 growth in group sales only 2 of gs engineering and constructio n revenues were generated in africa in 2007 but nearly 10 of the current order backlog is for africa we expect 150 growth in african sales in 2008 compared to group sales growth of just 12 alternatively infrastructure growth in africa can be played via the cement and steel sectors for cimpor africa accounted for nearly third of total profits in 2007 we estimate sales exposure at lafarge of c16 in 2007 and project african growth of c10 pa roughly twice the group av erage over the next three ears about 6 7mt of arcelormittal s crude steel production for 2007 was in africa with the company stating plans to increase production by further 2mt but all in we estimate that africa accounted for less than 10 of total revenues last year 4 agriculture and soft commodity prices african agriculture has huge unrealised potential in our view according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the afri ca accounts for 15 of global arable land but uses only 13 of the global average in fertilizer and has only one tractor for every 868 hectares compared to the global average of 1 per 56 hectares ie just over 6 of the tractor density per hectare it is not even an issue of poor rainfall africa could significantly increase the area of irrigated l and the fao suggest that the irrigated area in africa is only 14 of the potentially irrigated area and b africa is using only 43 of the arable land with sufficient rainfed potential acco rding to the the cumulative effect is that african agricultural yields are 66 bel ow the global average and africa is net food importer climate change could negatively impact african agricultural production over the medium to long term but in the short term better fiscal balances higher agricultural prices and more lenient import policies from the us and eu under the agoa and eba initiatives should facilitate and incentivise the required investment in our view 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 9 those exposed to this trend could include south africalisted illovo sugar the largest sugar producer in africa tongaat hulett which produces range of products from sugar cane and maize omnia holdings not covered which offers exposure to demand growth for fertilisers across subsaharan africa and norwaybased yara international not covered another fertiliser producer that could benefit from increased african demand africa accounted for 85 of revenues in 2006 5 telecommunications africa has the lowest global penetration rate in telecoms but is currently enjoying the fastest growth rate 2006 data shows that africa had only 31 fixed lines per 100 inhabitants compared to the global average of 194 in 2006 21 of africans were mobile subscribers compared to 41 globally growth in african fixed line connections was 28 2006 vs 2001 versus the global average of 20 growth in african mobile subscribers was 51 2006 vs 2001 versus the global average of 23 four factors support the growth 1 rising gdp per capita 2 cl earer and more benign regulation by mid2007 83 of african economies had established an independent regulatory author ity 3 falling costs and 4 more efficient service we expect strong growth in african telecommunications clearly mobile could be winning application given that there is far less wireline or cable competition than elsewhere specifically we forecast mobile penetration to increase from 28 in 2007 to 46 by 2010 coupled with an increase in the addressable market greater affordability and inco redistribution this implies growth in the number of african mobile subscribers of 76 between 2007 and 2010 compared to global growth of 36 there are two ways to access this investm ent theme through the equipment suppliers or the service providers ericsson and alcatel lucent should be beneficiaries by virtue of their dominance in the wireless

research is this new phase what indications are ther that africa can sustain growth at these kind of rates and lift itself out of poverty as east asia did from the 1960s onwards the spark that has ignited african growth in recent years arguably stems from the significant increase in commodity prices 57 of africas exports are fuels 23 are metals and raw materials as at year end 2006 so far this is akin to the experience of africa during the 1960s african gdp growth averaged 46 over the 1960s as the region benefited from the global upturn in commoditi however growth back then proved hard to sustain as amongst other things political conflicts developed macro policy was unsupportive and institutions were weak the issue for us now is whether or not the growth this time can prove to be more resilient we consider six factors that arguably deter mine the sustainability of growth politics institutions legal systems macrostability diversification heal th and education we consider how africa stacks up on these factors now compared to two benchmarks i as far as the data allow we contrast the current african situation to conditions prevailing in the 1960s1970s and ii we compare the current african conditi ons to those of the east asian nations 2030 years ago when this region began period of sustained economic growth the short conclusion is that there is room for optimism but also significant room for improvement on many parameters africa stacks up reasonably well compared to the asian benchmark of 2030 years ago and is certai nly much improved compared to its own historical performance however on several key measures exchange rate valuation economic and export diversification and health there is still wide gulf between african attainment and international or asian standards determinants of growth politics markets operating under political freedom usually in the guise of fully functioning democracies appear on average to have delivered and sustained higher rates of gdp per capita than other political systems we illustrate the point in figure 7 gdp per capita growth in africa in the last five years has averaged 142 pa compared to india at 153 and china at 168 the spark that has ignited african growth in recent years stems from the increase in commodity prices can the growth be sustained 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 14 figure 7 political

score which is calculated by freedom house nongovernmental organisa tion that tracks democratic processes around the world the score ranges between 0 and 40 the higher the reading the greater the degree of political freedom the data suggest that high political score is not sufficient by itself to deliver high gdp per capita however low political score is almost always associated with low gdp per capita th few exceptions to this are the oilrich sparsely populated countries of the middl east uae kuwait and saudi arabia we note that gdp per capita is probably understated across much of africa due to the size of the informal economy as well as tax avoidance which is probably much greater than in developed markets due to the limited banking sector however the same criticism of the

concept across much of africa it was only on 27 april 1994 that south africa held its first democratic elections other major advances have been much more recent in january 2005 the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation movement signed comprehensive peace agreement after more than two years of negotiations this agreement between the north and south of sudan ended the worlds longestrunning civil war across t he border in northern uganda the government and the main rebel group the lords resistanc army signed truce in august 2006 that brought an end to their 18year conflict albei t many ugandans are still sceptical that the peace deal will last according to bbc repor ts the intergovernmental authority on development igad has achieved several major breakthroughs in efforts to restore peace to somalia in burundi the first elections since the start of the civil war were held in mid 2005 ceasefire was finalised between the government and the last active rebel group in september 2006 the tragedy in darfur instability in cote divoire and recent violence in kenya are reminders nonetheless that peace can remain very fragile one of the most successful cases has been botswana since gaining independence from the british commonwealth on 30 september 1966 botswana has held democratic elections every five years albeit the party platform has been dominated by the botswana democratic party the president of botswana is both head of state and head of government legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament of botswana the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature botswana now has one of the highest gdp per capita across the continent us7269 2007e according to the imf which contrasts sharply with drc us161 2007e on imf data which is equally imbued with ample natural resources especially diamonds but has been blighted by political turmoil for much of the last 50 years b institutions weak economic institutions do not prevent growth but are associated with the derailment of growth good leaders can make difference for while but when they leave office countries with weak institutions will oft suffer relapse why because i weak institutions are characterised by high levels of income inequality which tends to leave country less flexible in the face of external shocks and ii weak institutions propagate greater propensity for conflict or civil strife on the other hand strong institutions creat effective property rights for most people including protection against expropriation by the state and enforceable contracts between private parties in other words strong inst itutions foster healthy environment that promotes higher levels of private sector investment institutional risk is not easy to measure but the imf has developed system for gauging relative strength figure 10 shows the broad results for africa on average and the developing asian markets as they looked just over 20 years ago on

score is given out of 50 the higher the score the lower the risk investment risk is an alternative measure this is score out of 12 similarly the higher the score the lowe r the risk we also consider gauge of corruption by using the kaufmannkraay index which allocates score out of six the higher the score the lower the level of corrupti on finally we look at one measure of the cost of doing business in the form of the cost of entry ie the cost of registering new business relative to annual per capita income on the whole africa stacks up relatively we ll compared to the historical picture for asia economic and investment risk are in line and corruption in africa is only slightly higher costs of entry however are factor that probably warrant significant improvement registering new

country c macro policy stable macroeconomic policy is another typical precondition alt hough not necessarily determinant of higher average gdp per capi ta gauging the success of macropolicy is made reasonably straightforward by cons idering basic set of parameters first we consider inflation in aggregate africa has made significant advances in controlling inflation this is particularly impor tant for region where income disparities are still relatively acute given that high inflation usually serves to accentuate the real differences between the rich who own inflation hedges in the form of real assets and the poor who do not as we illustrate in figure 11 african inflation has fallen from 188 on average gdp weighted in the 1980s to 62 estimated by the imf for 2008 figure 11 aggregate

although still slightly higher than the 14 that asia averaged in the 1970s we can work out the net aggregate benefit in debt reduction the annual cost of external debt of 74 of gdp at real rate of 10

what next we think there is scope for some optimism eba everything but arms and agoa african growth and opportunities act have paved the way for greater non resource exports eba is an eu initiative under which all imports apart from armaments to the eu from the least developed countries are duty free and quota free eba entered into force on 5 march 2001 there are transit ional arrangements for sugar and rice until july 2009 and september 2009 respectively agoa is us legislation approved by congress in may 2000 that exempts the eligible countries from us import duties and quotas the legislation authorises the us president to determine which subsaharan african countries are eligible for agoa on an annual basis currently there are 38 agoaeligible countries initially agoa was set to expire in 2008 but congress passed the agoa acceleration ac t of 2004 which extended the legislation to 2015 special provision for apparel which per mits countries to use foreign fabric in their garment exports was due to expire in september 2007 but has been extended through to 2012 agoa has resulted in limited success in some countries notably the textile industry has benefited in mauritius madagascar lesotho and swaziland despite the dismantling of the multi fibre agreements world quota regime for textile and apparel trade in january 2005 which gave china much broader access to international textile demand in theory the eba and agoa initiatives should fa cilitate greater agricultural exports at least of certain products given the large stock of land and labour that implies africa does have natural comparative advantage in practi ce there is yet to be much progress here for three reasons the phased nature of the eba sugar quotas b safety and quality issues that have been particular stumbling blocks for african agricultura l exports to the us and c poor production from africa itself africa is net food importer however the significant rise in agricultural prices over recent years along with better fiscal balances should be catalyst for change protectionism is longer the priority it has been in western markets now that farm revenues have improved in fact we believe we are more likely to see moves to encourage greater agricu ltural trade in order to keep lid on food inflation the bigger issue is whether or not african farmers can respond to stronger demand with higher output as we discuss in t he section on agriculture there are some obvious avenues greater use of fertiliser and pesticides that could significantly enhance african output in its recent report crop prospects and food situation report the fao noted that aboveaverage harvests are forecast for most countries in the african region but poor seasonal rain in the large northern nigerian market has brought drop in regional food production and forced prices higher the general response has been cut in food the bulk of asian demand for african exports is for fuel and raw materials eba and agoa have paved the way for greater non resource exports agoa has been boost for the textile industry agriculture has si gnificant potential but significant investment is required to boost output 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 26 import tariffs and in some instances ban on exports the zambian government has reinstated ban on any new export contracts the ethiopian government is stockpiling grain and has banned exports of the main cereals there are also moves in several especially southern african countries to follow the lead set by south africa with its black economic empowerment bee agenda to improve the degree of beneficiation this term is used in the bee charter to describe the practice of adding value to raw materials before export it is on this quest that beers has formed the diamond trading company dtc of botswana to manufacture over us550m of rough diamonds year by 2010 up from us 30m in 2006 following his election in september last year president koroma of sierra leone has pledged to introduce legislation to similarly ensure that most of the countrys annual diamond production is cut and polished before being exported in south africa the countrys first platinum beneficiation centre for the design and manufacture of jewellery was launched in rustenburg in december 2006 in october 2007 the governor of katanga in drc banned most raw ore exports from the region in or der to force businesses to process metals mostly copper and cobalt in drc itself rather than abroad all in all however african export diversific ation has long way to go in the face of serious asian competition and overvalued xchange rates before the continent can hope to be less sensitive to swings in commodity prices education another potential constraint on sustained growth is the level and extent of education there can be temporary booms on the back of hi gher commodity prices but collapses when prices fall because skills have not developed further education has clearly been extended to encompass greater proportion of the elig ible population across much of africa although we cannot compare the quality of education african primary and secondary average enrolment ratios are at least in line with asian standards of the 1970s in terms of overall expenditure on education the latest data on africa 2004 from unesco shows that roughly 44 of total african gdp is dedicated

disease is so prevalent in africa fo r two reasons i envi ronmental and ecological conditions are favourable for the anopheles mosquito especially the anopheles gambiae the most effective at carrying the malaria parasite africa is also host to the plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite the most deadly variety and main cause of cerebral malaria 2 poverty and lack of goodquality healthcare hinder the control and treatment of the disease and africa has both of these factors in africa life expectancy has stagnated largely as result of the hivaids pandemic and now stands at just 49 years on average malaria is still huge problem 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 28 the main form of prevention in endemic areas is to increase the usage of bed nets impregnated with insecticide and also the spraying of houses in 2000 numerous african countries agreed to series of malaria tar gets including insecticide treated net itns penetration of 60 in the highest risk areas however by 2005 according to the world malaria report 2005 only some headway had been made towards these goals increased efforts are being made to develop reli able but cheap detection kits that allow for diagnosis of malaria infection to be made by anyone trained to use them and to provide early treatment without the need for empirical blood testing which requires sophisticated laboratories and trained technicians increasing treatment resistance to chlor oquine and sulphadoxinepyrimethamine based medications has led to global push to util ise artemisininbased combination therapies acts that are highly effective in killing t he malaria parasite however they are more expensive than the older forms of treatment costing between us075 and us275 per treatment and this makes them unaffordable for many developing countries however despite the twin threat of hivaids and malaria growth in the labour force in africa is not under significant pressure as our demographics expert amlan roy sets out in the next section fertility rates in africa are so much higher than other economic regions including asia that labour force growth pr evails despite the terrible health statistics however poor health is obviously drain on pr oductivity directly with workers off sick and indirectly given increased dependency ratios and resources given the cost of caring for the sick conclusion to recap we have looked at six broad factors t hat are likely to influence the sustainability of stronger african growth we judge that the political situation is on the whole mu ch improved not withstanding the current unrest in kenya and zimbabwe the institutional framework again is more ad vanced and not dissimilar to the prevailing situation in asia in the 1970s macro indicators suggest much greater stabilit lower inflation higher reserves less external debt we are concerned that the massive appreciation of the terms of trade has taken exchange rates in many african markets to levels that adversely effect longterm current account prospects by restricting export diversification education levels are much better than history and akin to the experience of asia in the 1970s health issues are still major problem af rica clearly lags behind even the historical record set by asia set against this population growth in africa of 24 is still well ahead of asia at 17 pa we have four broad conclusions 1 growth is more sustainable than it has been in the past but much more reform is needed before africa can decouple from the global cycle 2 given this the outlook for commodities is still key to african growth performance over the next five years however we remain very positive on the outlook for commodities as detailed by our commodity team in figure 40 hence our forecasts for aggregate growth in africa remain well above expectations of average global growth very effective treatment is available but costs are still too high to facilitate widespread usa ge of the factors we have considered africa appears to have made headway on four fronts but is still struggling to liver greater economic diversification or improve average health growth is probably more sustainable but commodity performance is still crucial 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 29 figure 33 global and african real gdp growth forecasts chg yy 2007e 2008e 2009e 2010e 2011e global 47 32 36 35 34

subsaharan africa remains the worst hivaids affected region in the world with 225m people infected by the virus5 hivaids is the top killer of people aged 5 in africa and among the top five for those age 04 hivaids deaths may well be higher than the reported statistics since tb and pneumonia ar often implicated and identified as the cause of death when in fact it was the breakdown of the immune

life of illhealth and poverty another important feature is t he rapid growth of larger citi like lagos cairo kinshasa khartoum cape town johannesburg nairobi and kampala leading to overcrowding in parts accompanied by noise and air pollution that however leads to need for new infrastructure particularly in overcrowded cities africas future economically and financially depends on the health of

that follow we analyse the bottomup industry stories that underlie this top down theme as highlighted earlier this focuses on the indirect company beneficiaries from the growth story rather than african companies themselves in many respects many of the companies we look at offer more liqui d and investable qualities in the context of this story however while not focusing on africa in direct asset allocation context we would flag the diversification that africa has actually offered for direct investors in the region due to their low correlation with t he developed markets this provides an added context in which to view the relevance of the theme that we are seeking to play through the indirect beneficiaries listed in nonafrican markets at the most simplistic level figure 50 first shows

are held up in dr congo this ban has been imposed by the katanga governor in order to force th rough vertical integration and allow the raw ore which can longer be exported to be processed in drc it self rather than being processed abroad we think cobalt demand is likely to remain robust from the superalloys battery industry hev and gtl industries total consumption particularly from china shows signs of slowing down and global demand for cobalt could grow as much as 7 pa from 2007 to 2009 china is still one of the worlds largest consumers of cobalt accounting for c23 of forecast global demand in 2007a and we belie ve chinese consumption could further increase by c20 to 18kt pa in 2010 cl early this growth will be highly dependent on dr congo increasing exports of cobalt in the meantime we expect cobalt prices to continue to rally figure 57 katanga copper beltdr congo source world maps dr congo not only has huge resources of copper and cobalt but also one of the largest river systems in africa the kinshasa river also known as the congo river which runs through the country provides abundant opportunities for hydro power phase i of the inga project was commissioned in 1972 with capacity of 351 mw per annum phase ii of the project came onstream in 1982 with 1424 mw of powergeneration capacity however mismanagement and poor administration has led to under utilisation of these power plants the recent surge in mining activities in dr congo has required an increased supply of electricity and this has led to the rehabilitat ion of inga ii we expect the rehabilitation programme which will likely cost us110m will be carried out by magindustries from canada the company completed the feasibility studies of the rehabilitation programme in 2006 and the first of the four turbines s hould be operational in 2008 all of the other turbines are due to become operational with t he project achieving full capacity by 2011 currently studies are also being conducted for the construction of phases iii and iv phase iii of the inga project comprises the construction of 3500mw of power generation the congo river provides abundant opportunities for hydro power 14 april 2008

national power firms of dr congo angol namibia botswana and south africa conceptual studies are underway for the development of the phase iv or the grand inga power station the project comprises of 52 power generators of 750mw each amounting to 39000 mw of total capacity the capital cost of the project which will be sufficient to provide electricity for the entire african c ontinent is estimated by the consortium at us80bn initial studies completed by westcor indicate that the excess power generated could even be exported to europe one step at time but we believe this project clearly has significant potentia l and would be cornerstone of dr congo re developmentnot least since much greater power supply is prerequisite for greater vertical integration of the metals and mining industry across africa figure 58 location of hydro power projects along the congo riverdr congo source world energy council dr congo is also very rich in diamonds and home to some of the largest stones found in africa we anticipate dr congo to become bigger player in the diamond industry as the likes of gem diamonds plc invest more heavily in the country while dr congo has hydro potential mozambique has vast coal resource that is relatively untouched we have visited this coal basin twice in the last 18 months and are always amazed by the vast scale of the resource that can be observed from the air the resource appears to host all grades steaming coal for power stations coking coal for steel production and middlings lowergrade brown coal for local power stations and not for export with south

coal mines in mozambique could reach us30bn over the next ten years which would provide major lift for the country so far tourism has been the countrys biggest earner although going forward with rising coal prices mozambique acreage is likely to become more and more valuable both to africa and to other fastgrowing regi ons like india and china camec central african mining plc holds one of the

res ources but producing only 40000 tonnes pa currently to put that in perspective moza mbique produces less coal per annum than any of the major miners currently produce in just one day the opportunity is huge but there is still very little known about coal in mozambique the governments official statistics indicate resources of over 25bn tonnes in the country situated in four coal basins including tete moatise mefedeze mucanhavusi and cahora bassa north in mozambique the mining laws are simple and ttractive for new entrants requiring state participation or any minority participation exploration licences have duration of five years with automatic extension of another five years and 25 years thereafter mineral royalties are 3 of sales foreign exchange is freely imported and exported growth in tourism farming and new mining projects should significantly lift the gdp of the country after the 20year civil war fought between frelimo and renamo from 1975 to 1992 the first free elections were held in 1994 we view logistics as the key to the success of coal in mozambique the 310kilometre tete to beira rail link that was destroyed during the war is now being reconstructed using financing from the world bank we expect this to be completed by the end of 2009 opening up the tete coal basin for mining savana is north of beira and could be suitable for jetty that would

the deposit over its estimated life of 36 years the company estimates the initial capex for the project at us1bn moatise was hotly contested during its tender with other bidders including several of the major mining houses camec applied for the surrounding licences shortly after cvrd announced its acquisition of moatise why the majors did not secure the surrounding areas is unknown although the lack of drilling data on these concessions may have been part of the reason the investment by cvrd is the first in the coal basin and we believe is likely to open the floodgates of more developments from companies such as camec and riversdale time will tell how long it takes for the other major miners to become involved in the region but we think both camec and riversdale could be potential takeover targets in the coming years ahead given they have secured such large areas of the region zambia primarily produces copper and cobalt which constitute more than 60 of the countrys merchandise

this country has vast diamond platinum coal and nickel resources the platinum belt in zimbabwe is known as the great dyke which is linear f eature running northsouth through the centre of the country the pgm resources of the great dyke are second only to the bushveld complex in south africa in comparison the great dyke hosts lower pgm content at 4gt and higher nickel and copper content than that of its south african counterpart figure 61 the great dyke in zimbabwe source zimplats website key advantage of the great dyke is that many of the prospects are open cuttable mined with opencut techniques as opposed to underground and do not require deep shafts and caving which is common feature of the operations in south africa this is because the south african platinum industry is some 80 years old and has mined out most of the near surface prospects unlike south africa the zimbabwean platinum industry is relatively undeveloped and hosts many nearsurface deposits zimbabwe has the potential to be key growth area for south africalisted impala platinum the main zimbabwean platinum pr oducer zimplats is 869 owned by impala platinum and currently contributes roughly 7 to impalas production in fy2007 zimplats produced 96500 ounces of platinum in matte and the company has approved development plans to increase production to 160000 ounces of platinum by 2010 zimplats represents roughly 28 of impalas reserves and 42 of its known resources impalas future expansion projects are largely reliant on its operations in zimbabwe but this exposes the company to significant risk the

some 46 of its production we believe anglogold ashanti should take steps to accelerate the reduction of its hedge book going forward we expect to see reduced production from anglogold ashanti due to the electricity shortage in south africa gold fields limited is one of the worlds largest unhedged producers of gold providing investors with maximum leverage to the gold price gold fields has attributable production of 40m ounces per annum most of its production is concentrated in south africa but ghana makes up 19 of production according to the latest quarterly results the current power shortage in south africa has led the dme department of minerals and energy to r equest that mining companies reduce their electricity consumption by 10 in order to achieve this reduction in energy consumption we believe the company will hav to take drastic measures including the closure of marginal mines retrenchment of staff and restructuring of its operations gold fields has announced that it will likely have to close down six shafts as result of the proposed powersupply reduction from eskom during fy 2007 gold fields spent us47m on near mine exploration and us41m on greenfields

governments are selectively for now insisting that oil companies wishing to gain access to oil gas reserves commit to investment in other projects such as the construction of power plants roads and hospitals overall this is rving to reduce typical industry returns on standalone oil and gas fields indeed the reluctance of many of the major oil companies to cede to this new requirement has opened

the commodity warrant 59 infrastructure strong growth for capital goods companies africa is not an area which at present is major focus with asia and the middle east and to some extent north africa being the two main emerging regions where management teams are looking to grow market share via acquisitions and more importantly organic growth however we do anticipate that africa will slowly become more important driver of growth for companies we cover although the relatively low gdp in many african economies means that the addressable market will remain quite small on threeyear view there are two main sources of likely incr eased capital investment domesticallydriven spending ie policyrelated and the activity in the mining and oil sectors hence we would expect to see two main drivers which ar related of investment in areas relevant for capital goods companies 1 infrastructure if we do see gdp growth start to accelerate in subsaharan economies this will likely spur growth in demand for infrastructure initially and increase the demand for capital equipment necessary for electricity roads ports rail networks airports off very low base as illustrated in figure 73 which as we have seen in china and india are crit ical if rapid gdp growth is to be sustained this is on the assumption that the economic growth will be at least to some extent based on industrialisation we show below the

estimates these two points are clearly related in two ma in ways first having extracted the relevant minerals the need to transport these goods out of africa will in turn drive investment in infrastructure eg roads and ports in addition indirectly substantial investment in mines and oil exploration and high commodity pr ices should boost the budgets of african governments enabling them to spend more on the domestic economy which should fuel infrastructure spend we note for instance that libya announced in late 2007 that it would spend us123bn over five years on an annualised basis that is equivalent to 37 of gdp building roads ports schools and housing due to rising revenues from high oil prices the assumption that most of future economic activity will be dependent on electricity ie is not purely agrarian clearly implies the need for an upgrade to africas power networks in particular and this is likely to offer so of the most compelling growth rates when compared with other endmarkets for capital goods companies we show in figure 75 the split of global power generation demand by regi on africa is around 3 of the total at present compared to 2 of world gdp and 13 of the

holcim and cimpor lafarge produces cement aggregates and concrete used in housing commercial and industrial construction and infrastructure dist ribution across africa is fairly widespread including south africa k enya nigeria cameroon zambia benin zimbabwe tanzania uganda morocco and egypt with listings on several local stock exchanges zambia zimbabwe and morocco we estimate sales exposure of

major european cement producer african exposure is concentrated in the north egypt and morocco we estimate sales exposure of c12 in 2007 23 of ebitda and expect future sales growth of c67 4 for volumes and 23 for prices capital investment in africa was 15bn or 23 of group total for 2006 holcim on our forecasts will derive about 10 of group profit in 2008 from its africa middle east division of which we believe about 8 will come from its operations in africa holcims primary business is the manufacture of cement although in many regions it complements this with the downstream operations of aggregates and concrete holcim operates in the following countries across africa morocco guinea ivory coast nigeria namibia south africa tanzania madagascar and egypt in 2007 the group did however sell majority st ake in its south african operations to governmentsponsored black empowerment or ganisation significantly reducing its exposure to that market trading conditions across the region were on the whole robust in 2007 with morocco and egypt deliver ing the highest rates of growth holcim is globally diverse cement group operating across all continents while the group has established significant portfolio of assets across the developing countries where the longterm need for construc tion materials is significant it balances this exposure with its operations in developed markets which offer more stable cash flows we believe that holcim plans to continue to grow the business on global basis and as such would expect further investment in africa in coming years either by acquiring existing players in the market or by building new cement plants cimpor is the 10th largest cement producer in the world portugal the groups domestic market is the top contributor to group profits although the group operates in further eight countries six of them in africa m orocco tunisia egypt mozambique south africa cape verde the group is market leader in mozambique 1 of group

egypt 11 of profit and south africa 9 profit in total the african contri bution to profit was 31 in 2006 the groups strategy is to consolidate current positions while maintaining balance between

african wood needs from plantation forests in south africa south africa offers good growth conditions especially for eucalyptus however growth has been impaired by low rain fall or is coming at relatively higher costs as plantations need to be irrigated angola and mozambique offer significant potential for establishment of fastgrowing plantation forests with similar growth conditions to brazil ie good soil conditions even temperatures and regular precipitation wood from such plantations could enable establishment of very costcompetitive pulp industry that would be wellpositioned to com pete with current cost leaders in latin america global fibre needs appear to be growing strongly thanks to increased demand from fastgrowing chinese paper industry china has very limited domestic fibre resources increasing demand from the energy sector and the potential for the cellulose fibre to replace oil polymers in manmade fibres and in certain areas of plastic manufacturing we believe both sappi and mondi are well positioned to tap into this potential from the respective company s south african base and they have indicated an interest in such projects such projects would be long

feeding this analysis thr ough to our estimates by 2012 expansion into mozambique and angola would increase sales from sappi by about 13 and ebitda using our 2009 estimate as base by 3545 at mondi we

two ways to play the growth in the african telecoms market via international stocks either through the equipm ent providers or the telecom operators with direct business exposure in 2006 we believe that africa had handset penetration level of 206 which suggests that the region had some 190m subscribers we believe that this penetration level will increase to 455 by 2010e which suggests an increase to 457m subscribers according to our estimates this subscriber growth ccounts for some 26 of the subscriber growth that we expect in the top seven emerging markets china india indonesia brazil mexico russia and africa and is some 165 of global subscriber growth between 2006 and 2010e this significant increase will lead to new rollouts in the region which is supported by recent press articles stating that operators are intending to spend us50bn on telecommunications equipment in africa over the next five years which clearly suggests secular growth story given that ericsson is the global leader in the wireless infrastructure market with alcatel lucent holding the number three position we believe that both these companies will benefit from the increased investment in the region even though sales from africa account for less than 10 of revenues for both companies assuming 50 of the targeted us50bn is invested in the region this would st ill result in an incremental us5bn pa ie total us25bn spend spread over five years which accounts for some 10 of revenues for the global wireless infrastr ucture market going forward we also highlight the opportunity this presents for both huawei and zte two major telecom equipment suppliers in china which have been aggressively expanding their footprint in africa as of 2006 africa contributed 11 of total revenue to zte through equipment sales to many african markets as well as its joint venture mobile operation in the drc with local operator and 51 stake in niger telecommunications sales to sub saharan african countries exceeded us1bn for privately owned huawei company in 2006 c12 of total huawei is now the largest wireless technology cdma pr oduct provider in the region of the telecom operators reasonable exposure

able to handle those risks to date its only major move in africa was an unsuccessful bid for the third mobile licence in egypt in 2006 we believe telenors new approach also reflects the fact that competition to establish presence in many of the asian markets that lenor has previously said it would like to enter vietnam indonesia philippines has increased substantially and could make the cost of entry in these markets too expensive mr baksaas said in the same interview that he is now prepared to be more flexible on the issue of ownership and control in telenors international assets previously telenors position was that an investment must give it clear path to control the position now is that telenor is prepared to accept minority ownership position in its international investments deutsche telekom the group has significant interest in africa currently and its ma strategy is more focused on inmarket consolidation and central and eastern europe however ceo rene obermann has said that he does want to change the shape of dts asset mix over time to include more growth markets so we think move in this or any region cannot be excluded african expansion is key goal of both south african listed telecommunications companies mtn and telkom sa with increasing competition in the south african landline market and approaching saturation in the sa mobile market both of these operators have looked to expand into africa to drive growth mtn was one of the first mobile operators globally to recognise the african opportunity with its initial expansions beyond south africa into uganda rwanda and swaziland in 1998 mtn along with orascom was the first mover into the african space and this has facilitated its strong return on capital as the company was able to secure licences in most markets prior to these becoming prohibitively expensive as late entrants bid up prices and b mtn has been able to build leading market share positions in most of its african operations as result of its firstmover advantage mtn currently has operations in 21 countries with five in the middle east and the remainder in africa at september 2007 mtn had 54m subscribers 14m of which in south africa 9m in the middle east and 31m in other africa mtns african effort is spearheaded by nigeria where the company has 15m subscribers and 45 of the fastgrowing nigerian mobile market mtn might be seen to represent the perfect investment vehicle for investors looking to gain exposure to africa given 1 that africa is the majority of its business 2 its proven track record in africa 3 the high quality of the company in terms of corporate governance and its leading market position in the majority of its african markets and 4 that mobile may represent the best opportunity in africa to monetise the spending power of african businesses and consumers on panafrican basis integrated incumbent telkom sa until recently had focused its africa efforts via its 50 stake in leading south african mobile operator vodacom which has operations in south africa lesotho mozambique tanzania and drc this changed in 2007 when telkom indicated its intention to expand into africa in the fixedline space and followed through with the acquisition of multilinks nigerian unified licence cdma operator and africa online panafrican isp vodacoms reasonably early african expansion was stymied by its shareholder agreement between telkom sa and vodafone which prevented vodacom from expanding north of the equator while this clause of the telenor has presence in africa at the moment but recent comments from the company suggest it may be looking for opportunities deutsche telekom similarly has limited african presence for now but future acquisitions cannot be ruled out south africalisted mtn offers significant exposure to growth in the south african and gerian mobile markets telkom sa offers african exposure via its 50 holding in vodacom and has recently started to expand its wireline business outside south africa 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 77 shareholder agreement longer holds it prevented vodacoms expansion at critical time with the net result that only 83m of vodacoms 316m customers are outside of south africa because of vodacoms relatively limited exposure to africa as percentage of subscribers and the fact that multilinks and africa online will take some years before they begin to contribute meaningfully to telkoms bottom line we do not see telkom sa as an ideal vehicle to gain exposure to africa despite telkom managements strong focus on building this business also worth mention is naspers naspers is south africas leading media company with diversified media interests in africa brazil china india and eastern europe the companys primary african focus is paytv although it also provides internet access and print media paytv subsidiary multichoice africa accounts for c13 of naspers value the company had 500000 subscribers at september 2007

beneficiaries as pressures to reduce healthcare costs are particularly acute moves by countries like south africa to introduce fixed prices for medicines particularly the dispensing fee and to pressurise health care providers to utilise generic formul ations are an indication of t he pressures to reduce costs the competition tribunal in south africa has become increasingly proactive in limiting consolidation in the market and investigating anticompetitive behaviour so as to curtail pricing power this is true for both the hos pital providers and generic drug providers in some african countries the private sector is becoming increasing involved in the provision of health services through either vo luntary work or publicprivate partnerships ppps in others the governments actively encourage the population to utilise the private sector such as in south africa where priv ate medical insurance costs are tax deductible one of the biggest risks for future growth in healthcare in africa is the shortage of skilled professionals while this is global phenomenon the attractive remuneration packages available in developed countries for healthcare professionals means there is constant drain of resources from africa this has led to spiralling wage inflation we expect nursing salaries in south africa will rise by 2080 in 2008 aloneand increased attempts by african countries

ciplam edpro and strides arcolab all compete to provide arv apis for aspen almost 50 of astrixs revenues come from this the main risks for aspen in south africa include the continued subinflation cap

division according to the company for both mediclinic and netcare company guidance suggests growth in their south african operations is likely to be between 10 and 18 pa as opposed to 58 in the european operations thus over time barring fu rther acquisitions their african operations will continue to dominate revenues growth is being driven by the increasing incidence of communicable diseases like hiv and tb and lifestyle conditions like obesity and hypertension public partnerships with gov ernments provide opportunities for further geographic expansion in subsaharan africa s outh africa and more recently lesotho have started proceeding down this route although netcare has said it is unlikely it will try to enter other african markets for now risks for both companies include the

benefits for social infrastructure in the resource rich countries we can expect credit to the private sector to continue to increase moreover the incentives generated by the hipc mdri and paris club debt relief schemes have meant moving ahead with various institutional reforms to assist in the growth of the private sector including banking in some countries for instance initiatives to improve accounting standards western african economic and monetary union waemu uniform accounting system was adopted in 2001 while in tanzania the regulation of company accounting and auditi ng practices was

bankruptcy act securi ties act and venture capital scheme however it is slow process off low base accounting and auditing standards on the whole remain weak and the legal judi cial and regulatory

out enforcing commercial contract through the courts is more difficult in subsaharan africa than anywhere else on average creditors must go through 35 steps wait 15 months and spend 43 of country per

ghana south africa and botswana stand out internationals making their presence felt international exposure to african banking has increased substantially over the past five years we highlight barclays following its takeover in 2005 barclays makes about 6 of total earnings from absa and just less than 10 overall from african operations according to management it is looking to integrate existing african businesses we think the outlook is reasonable with strong volume growth tempered by rising impairment charges 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 83 hsbc has concentrated its african banking operations in egypt with 43 branches however the contribution to earnings at the group level is not significant around 6 of standard chartereds earnings currently come from africa around 75 of that comes from the wholesale rather than consumer business which has benefited from increased asiaafrican trade flows the main operations in africa are in kenya zimbabwe ghana zambia bots wana nigeria and tanzania the highest growth prospects in retail are currently being driven by kenya ghana and nigeria on the back of an increased push into wealth management as at the latest interim stage the nigerian operation saw total profits up 40 the bank is looking to grow organically here rather than by acquisition standard chartered has limited presence in south africa and it is difficult to grow organically given the entrenched positions of the local banks management previously expressed an interest in expanding retail operations here and the group was widely lin ked with potential acquisition of nedbank last year but has since stated that it does not think the riskreward stacks up of the spanish banks the only bank with any reported exposure to africa is santander with 146 stake in atijari wafa bank morocco equity income accounted negligible contribution at t he corporate level san has 500m unrealised capital gain on its position though santander has major strategic plans regarding its investments in africa it is completely marginal area so far most listed french banks are active in africa in retail banking mainly the mediterranean basin and north africa they have developed franchises over the past 30 years but have been accelerating their expansion since 2005 through organic growth they have also been exploring acquisitions and took part in pr ivatisations egypt and algeria due to language and cultural similarities french banks have been able to build extensive networks on relative basis additionally we note that some of french banks cib revenues we assume 35 have come from africa in recent years as some countries are directindirect beneficiaries of the commodities boom project finance and trade finance in which french banks are big play ers have been areas of focus in the cib divisions société générale is the most exposed to africa among the french banks it generates about 34 of its pretax profit from africa retail banking in our view mainly from egypt and morocco it has about 450 branches 13m clients and about 7000 employees its loan book in the region amounted to about 7bn in 2q07 in total bnpp has about 600 branches in africamiddle east and loan book of c 7bn on our calculations we estimate that this area will account for about 12 of bnpps pretax profit in 2008e retail banking contribution or 34 when adding the cib contribution crédit agricole s international retail strategy is more focused on old europe and as result african exposure is limited to handful of countries with c150200 branches and about 1 of pretax

african banks absa firstrand and standard bank have all been increasing their presence in africa over the past few ears and are all pursuing strategy to make more acquisitions on the continent in future b anking in africa while volatile comes with fairly good roes and earnings growth potential as the markets open up retail banking in africa also tends to come with high net interest margins we are therefore encouraged by the prospects of banking growth in africa and see expansion in the region as positive factor longer term the percentages of group earnings that come from africa listed below are slightly understated as these are just the numbers for the disclosed african operations and often do not include the project and infrastructure finance work that the banks do in africa which is usually booked under corporate investment banking profits nevertheless the split of total group profits made from the businesses sitting in other african countries is as follows standard 84 firstrand 38 nedbank 14 and absa 12 of these four the two to focus on are standard and absa firstrand is looking to make acquisitions in africa but is doing so slowly and this split of earnings is not likely to change quickly nedbank has shown major intent to expand its african operations by far the best exposure that one gets to africa through the south african banks is standard as it has presence in 15 african countries and growing percentage of its revenue comes from its african operations african revenues 84 of total in 2006 should be further augmented by the us400m acquisition of ibtc chartered bank in nigeria and cfc bank in kenya both in 2007 one of standards key strategies is to expand its presence in african and emerging markets and it is looking to do this through combination of organic and acquis itive growth with standard receiving r16bn of fresh capital from its new shares issued to industrial commercial bank of china icbc it has indicated that it will be aggressively looking to make acquisitions to increase its offshore franchise and africa will certainly be region that it will look at furthermore given the trade links between china and africa the icbc deal should accelerate standards african business if the synergy targets are met standards biggest focus in africa now is in nigeria post the acquisition it recently concluded there but its other sizeable businesses ar found in namibia uganda and botswana although only 12 of group earnings as at june 2007 absa is looking to aggressively increase its presence in africa with the merger of barclays african network this deal was supposed to have been done in 2007 but there are regulatory delays that are holding up the process absa is reportedly now in discussions to buy barclays nine african operations one by one to avoid regulatory problems and the difficulty in dealing with minority sharehol ders although barclays does not disclose exactly how much its african operations make we think it is fair to assume that if absa buys barclays entire african operations other africa would increase to 10 15 of absa group earnings we expect absa to spend some time in 2008 bedding down the first few acquisitions from barclays at the moment absa biggest operations in africa are in mozambique and tanzania 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 85 insurance only slow growth life insurance in africa is concentrated in few nodes most importantly south africa and kenya kenya has large indian population which has driven much of the development there that said many south african life insurers old mutual are increasing activities in africa as business tends to be capital effi cient mostly protection products and profitable protection mostlylittle savings the key characteristics of insurance in africa are many risk benefits are provided through state pension funds in many african countries the state insurance company or company majority owned by the state tends to have monopolistic powersthis is especially true for those that have recently past 2030 years gained independence with the exception of kenya mauritius and namibia none of the markets have high levels of competition premium growth is expected to increase stead ily but slowly over the next few years in our view like many other consumables insurance in the end should benefit from higher rates of gdp per capita but is unlikely to take priority over the likes of better food healthcare mobile phones and housing successful growth for foreign insurers in africa will probably come down to question of relationships foreign companies are not readily accepted hence it can take while for business to materialise good example of this is metropolitan life in south africa which has spread its wings to east africa and growth has been slower than anticipated in its greenfield operations as it has set up business with few links to local players we think the only obvious way to play growth in insurance in africa is via old mutual however old mutuals african operations c ontribute only c4 to south african ape or 08 of oml group ape so clearly not much to write home about for now figure 101 finance sector and

shortages in south africa have meant sabmiller has had to import 80000 tonnes of glass over the past few months this has led to some contraction in margin from strategic point of view we think ther is still significant upside for sabmiller south africa in accessing new consumer segments and in pursuing its shebeen legalisation strategy the weight of the groups competitive advantage in south africa has been made clear by its ability to recoup six percentage points of the nine percentage points of volume share lost as result of the loss of the amstel licence amstel demand over the past six months has been substituted by hansa pilsner as well as hansa marzen gold on shebeen legalisation the group ultimately s ees the number of illegal outlets reducing from 200000 to 100000 as some outlets gain licences while others are forced to close the group saw 20 increase in the number of legal shebeens in the last financial year and anticipates another 20 becoming legal th is year all in all management estimates that the number of legal shebeens should gr ow from 30000 to 60000 over the medium term looking outside south africa sabmiller is already the market leader in most of the nine countries in which it operates independently and has led growth in consumption by both enhancing affordability as well as its own scale it operates together with cal operator castel in 15 other countries in africa over sixyear period the group has been able to drive both volume as well as value growthwith organic ebita growth in africa exsouth africa which is classified separately at 16 over

from cheap wine and illicit liquor to beer the two major sabmillerowned profit centres in africa remain tanzania and botswana we estimate these two markets combined contribute over 40 of sabmillers african profits including castel in tanzania per capita consumption remains low at around 6 litres pa with the economy showing modest growth the outlook for beer volumes is promisingcurrent growth rate is mid to high single digits since the deal with diageo in 2003 which effectively gave diageo the monopoly in kenya and sabmiller the monopoly in tanzania tanzania has become an even more strategic part of the african portfolio ebit margins are already high at around 29 though management has said it believes there is plenty of scope for further enhancement notwithstanding the situation in zimbabwe the political and economic environment in the majority of sabmiller territories is at least stable and broadly improving two key growth markets include angola now the thirdhighest gdp in southern africa and mozambique in angola sabmiller is moving to full ownership from management contract we are forecasting that with the uplift provided by its expanding oil industry we should see marked acceleration in demand for both beer and carbonated soft drinks csds we forecast ebita from angola of us30m in fy2008e it has already overtaken mozambique to become sabmillers third biggest profit centre in the subsaharan region after botswana and tanz ania excluding castel several markets offer the significant benefits of joint beer and csd production and distribution the high profitability levels achieved by the botsw ana business are good example of this at its african investor trip in 2001 the company identified several coke bottling franchises in southern africa that wo uld be attractive acquisition targets since then only the zambian franchise has come its way 2002 further complementary coke bottling franchises sabco for exampl would clearly be beneficial to regional profitability we note cocacola hellenic derives c10 of its overa ll sales volumes from nigeria the importance of nigeria to the group in re cent years has been eclipsed by consistent annual doubledigit growth in russia which is now the biggest individual country contributor to group volumes c20 of total however nigeria offers significant demographicdriven consumption growth potent ial alongside economic growth similar to the sabmiller growth trajectory in southern africa plus the company also believes that in addition to csd consumption there is significant opportunity for the groups packaged water and juice products 14 april 2008 africa the commodity warrant 89 coke hellenic is well positioned to capture the dominant share of ongoing growth in nonalcoholic beverage consumption in niger ia with 572 share of the csd category in 2006 due in part to the fragmented nature of the retail sector and the absence of hypermarkets and supermarket chains coke hellenics distribution in nigeria is largely managed directly by t he company although there are wholesalers and strategic supply depots priority for the group over the medium term is to improve the efficiency and reliability of its distri bution network cchbc c ontinues to expand its preselling system for highvolume outlets strategic supply depots and key accounts with more than 60 of sales now generated through this systemwhich makes margins in nigeria relatively more attracti ve than elsewhere within the coke hellenic system to improve visibility in key gerian population centres including lagos and other large cities coke hellenic has established approximately 530 independent strategic distribution centres which has enabled the company to reach smaller outlets more efficiently due to the low availability of electricity in outlets in nigeria coke hellenic also manufactures and distributes ice to support the supply of cold drinks us sales in africa as for the us cocacola is the only name with material exposure to africa 45 of revenues and c5 of operating profit last quar ter coke singled out south africa 9 volumes and nigeria specifically as great performers in aggregate volume and revenue growth in africa up 11 and 13 respecti vely has been solid in recent quarters but profit growth has been much more subdued operating profit up just 1 on the back of restructuring costs negative currency impacts and an investment in marketing cocacola zero in egypt for example in terms of future profitability we think africa is likely to look like china with ample volume and revenue growth but more limited profit growth as these countries sort out their social political and economic structural issues 2 tobacco the main international operator in the tobacco sector in africa is
