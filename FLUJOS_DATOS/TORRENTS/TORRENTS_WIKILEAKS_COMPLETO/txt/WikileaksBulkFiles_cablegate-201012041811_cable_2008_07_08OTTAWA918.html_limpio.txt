summary canadian security intelligence service csis director judd discussed domestic and foreign terror threats with counselor of the state department cohen in ottawa on july 2 judd admitted that csis was increasingly distracted from its mission by legal challenges that could endanger foreign intelligencesharing with canadian agencies he predicted that the upcoming release of dvd of guantanamo detainee and canadian citizen omar khadrs interrogation by canadian officials would lead to heightened pressure on the government to press for his return to canada which the government would continue to resist judd shared dr cohens negative assessment of current political economic and security trends in pakistan and was worried about what it would mean for the isaf mission in afghanistan canada has begun formulating an interagency pakistan strategy and csis had agreed to open channel to irans intelligence service which judd has not yet figured out septel will cover dr cohens discussions regarding pakistan and the oef and isaf missions in afghanistan end summary 2 snf counselor of the department of state eliot cohen and csis director jim judd in ottawa on july 2 discussed threats posed by violent islamist groups in canada and recent developments in pakistan and afghanistan csis is canadas lead agency for national security intelligence director judd ascribed an alice in wonderland worldview to canadians and their courts whose judges have tied csis in knots making it ever more difficult to detect and prevent terror attacks in canada and abroad the situation he commented left government security agencies on the defensive and losing public support for their effort to protect canada and its allies legal wrangling risks chill effect 3 snf responding to dr cohens query judd said csis had responded to recent nonspecific intelligence on possible terror operations by vigorously harassing known hezbollah members in canada according to judd csis current assessment is that attack is in the offing in canada he noted however that hezbollah members and their lawyers were considering new avenues of litigation resulting from recent court rulings that judd complained had inappropriately treated intelligence agencies like law enforcement bodies refs and c the director observed that csis was sinking deeper and deeper into judicial processes making legal affairs the fastest growing division of his organization indeed he added legal challenges were becoming distraction that could have major chill effect on intelligence officials 4 snf judd derided recent judgments in canadas courts that threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence qthat threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence and informationsharing with canada these judgments posit that canadian authorities cannot use information that may have been derived from torture and that any canadian public official who conveys such information may be subject to criminal prosecution this he commented put the government in reverseonus situation whereby it would have to prove the innocence of partner nations in the face of assumed wrongdoing 5 snf judd credited prime minister stephen harpers minority conservative government for taking it on the chin and pressing ahead with common sense measures despite court challenges and political knocks from the opposition and interest groups when asked to look to the future judd predicted that canada would soon implement uklike legal procedures that make intelligence available to vetted defense lawyers who see everything the judge sees ottawa 00000918 0022 of 003 terror cases and communities present mixed pictures 6 cnf judd commented that cherrypicked sections of the courtordered release of dvd of guantanamo detainee and canadian citizen omar khadr ref d would likely show three canadian adults interrogating kid who breaks down in tears he observed that the images would doubt trigger kneejerk antiamericanism and paroxysms of moral outrage canadian specialty as well as lead to new round of heightened pressure on the government to press for khadrs return to canada he predicted that pm harpers government would nonetheless continue to resist this pressure 7 c the director mentioned other major cases that also presented csis with major legal headaches due to the use of intelligence products in their development momin khawaja has been on trial for his role in an qaeda uk bomb plot since june 23 in the first major test of canadas 2001 antiterrorism act and canadas ability to protect intelligence supplied by foreign government sources ref d the trial of the first of the homegrown toronto 11 down from 18 terror plotters which is also now underway and the prosecution of global islamic media front propagandist said namouh who was arrested in quebec in 2007 for conspiring to conduct bombings in austria and germany 8 c judd said he viewed khawaja and his ilk as outliers due in part to the fact that canadas ethnic pakistani community is unlike its ghettoized and poorly educated uk counterpart it is largely made up of traders lawyers doctors engineers and others who see promise for themselves and their children in north america he observed so its members are unlikely to engage in domestic terror plots he said that therefore csis main domestic focus is instead on fundraising and procurement as well as the recruitment of small number of canadian wannabes of pakistani origin for mostly overseas operations pakistan and afghanistan 9 c turning to pakistan counselor cohen briefed his recent trip to islamabad and peshawar noting his alarm at the degrading economic political and security situation there and its implications for pakistan afghan and regional stability judd responded that dr cohens sober assessment tracked with csis own view of pakistan and that it is hard to see good outcome there due to that countrys political economic and security failures on top of fastrising oil and food prices canada does not have an explicit strategy for pakistan judd said but privy council deputy secretary david mulroney who leads the interagency on afghanistan now has the lead on developing one septel dr cohen remarked and judd agreed that it would be necessary to avoid approaching pakistan as simply an adjunct to the isaf and oef missions in afghanistan 10 snf csis is far from being highfive mode on q10 snf csis is far from being highfive mode on afghanistan judd asserted due in part to karzais weak leadership widespread corruption the lack of will to press ahead on counternarcotics limited afghan security force capability particularly the police and most recently the sarpoza prison break he commented that csis had seen sarpoza coming and its link to the quetta shura in pakistan but could not get handle on the timing iranian outreach 11 snf judd added that he and his colleagues are very very worried about iran csis recently talked to irans ministry of intelligence and security mois after that agency requested its own channel of communication to canada he said the iranians agreed to help on afghan issues including sharing information regarding potential attacks however we have not figured out what they are up to judd confided since it is clear that the iranians want isaf to bleedslowly ottawa 00000918 0032 of 003 12 u dr cohen has cleared
