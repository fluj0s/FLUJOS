year the bush administration released its fy2007 budget the budget of the us government fiscal year 2007 on february 6 2006 the multiple volumes contained both general and specific descriptions of the administrations policy proposals and expectations for the budget for fy2006 through fy2011 it included section on longterm fiscal issues facing the nation and provided limited information on the revenue and mandatory spending changes after 2011 the full set of budget documents budget appendix analytical perspectives historical tables among several other supplemental budget documents contained extensive and detailed budget information including estimates of the budget without the proposed policy changes current service baseline estimates historical budget data detailed budget authority outlay and receipt data selected analysis of specific budget related topics and the administrations economic forecast1 in addition to their presentation of the administrations proposals the budget documents are an annual reference source for federal budget information including enacted appropriations the administrations annual budget submission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconciliation bill or bills as required by the budget resolution over the course of deliberation on the budget the administration often revises its original proposals as it interacts with congress and as conditions change in the economy and the world the current situation the final budget estimates for fy2007 from the administration in the mid session review for fy2008 july 11 2007 included further reductions in the expected deficit to 205 billion from 244 billion in february 2007 and continued unexpected increases in receipts cbos july monthly budget report indicated that 1 current services baseline estimates and baseline estimates in general are not meant to be predictions of future budget outcomes but instead are designed to provide neutral measure against which to compare proposed policy changes in general they project current policy which includes future changes in law over the next 5 to 10 years their construction generally follows instructions provided in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 dca and the congressional control and impoundment act of 1974 crs2 the deficit may be closer to 150 billion than 200 billion its midyear budget report will be released later in august earlier in 2007 congress adopted supplemental appropriations for fy2007 congress responded to president bushs request for additional funding for the ongoing military conflicts and few other needs by passing 124 billion funding bill hr 1591 the house passed the conference report on april 25 with the senate following on april 26 2007 hrept 110107 the bill included about 100 billion in military funding and approximately 24 billion in domestic spending much of which the president had not requested it also included timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq beginning later this year the president had threatened veto because of the withdrawal timetable and the additional spending as the bill was taking shape in the house and senate on may 1 the president vetoed the bill the house failed to override the veto on may 2 the house passed second supplemental appropriations bill hr 2206 on may 10 2007 it contained the funding for the war without the withdrawal deadline along with most of the additional domestic spending the senate amended the bill and passed it on may 17 discussions between the house and senate led to further changes these were incorporated into the bill which congress passed on may 24 2007 the president signed the bill on may 25 pl 11028 budget totals table 1 below contains budget estimates for fy2007 from the cbo the administration the office of management and budget omb and congress differences in totals can result from differing underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and techniques as well as differences in policy assumptions the dollar differences in the budget outlook resulting from underlying policy differences in the presidents proposals or those from congress are often relatively small for the upcoming fiscal year compared to the budget as whole these small differences however may grow over time sometimes substantially potentially producing widely divergent future budget paths budget estimates generally should be expected to change over time from those originally proposed or estimated by the president cbo or congress budget estimates and proposals cbos first budget report for fy2007 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20072016 january 2006 contained baseline and economic estimates and projections for fy2006 through fy2016 the report estimated an fy2007 baseline deficit of 270 billion smaller than the estimated fy2006 baseline deficit of 337 billion by fy2011 the cbo baseline deficit estimate had fallen to 114 billion the next year fy2012 the increased receipts from the scheduled in current law expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts produced small baseline surplus estimate of 38 billion the small surplus estimates never exceeding 75 billion or 04 of gdp persisted through fy2016 crs3 under the baseline assumptions cbo increases discretionary spending at the rate of inflation assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 as required under current law and allows the recently lapsed alternative minimum tax amt relief to remain lapsed the effects of these assumptions raise receipts in the nearterm and increase receipts by substantial amounts after fy2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire under current law the declining deficit and appearance of small surpluses over the 10 years in the cbo baseline are largely explained by the baseline construction rules that cbo follows the results likely understate the nearterm future size and persistence of the deficit as cbo acknowledges in its report table 1 budget estimates and proposals for fy2007 in billions of dollars deficit receipts outlays

estimates of the effect on the deficit or surplus of selected policies not included in the baseline estimates these policy alternatives usually reflect policies under discussion or of high interest such as making the 2001 2003 and other expiring tax cuts permanent addressing the expanding coverage of the amt assuming rate of growth other than the inflation rate for discretionary spending and assuming additional expenditures for military activities overseas beyond the next year in cbos january 2006 report making the tax cuts permanent increased the fiveyear fy2007fy2011 cumulative deficit including higher debtservice costs by 372 billion and by cumulative 23 trillion over the 10year period fy2007 fy2016 cbos estimate of the revenue loss from reforming the amt produced 317 billion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 691 billion increase over 10 years if discretionary spending were to grow at the rate of gdp rather than crs4 at the rate of inflation the fiveyear cumulative deficit would increase in cbos report by an estimated 356 billion and the 10year cumulative deficit would increase by an estimated 16 trillion cbo estimated that freezing discretionary appropriations at the fy2006 level would reduce the fiveyear cumulative deficit by 317 billion and the 10year cumulative deficit by 14 trillion president bushs fy2007 budget february 2006 called for extending and making permanent most of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 as well as extending other expiring tax provisions the budget showed extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would reduce receipts by an estimated 179 billion between fy2007 and fy2011 and by an estimated 14 trillion between fy2007 and fy2016 these estimates do not include the resulting higher debtservice costs resulting from the change2 the administrations total receipt proposals would reduce fiveyear receipts by 280 billion and 10year receipts by 17 trillion cumulative receipts over the 5 and 10year periods total approximately 13823 billion and 32496 billion respectively without the proposed changes the administrations budget provided limited amount of information for the years beyond fy2011 the budget did include estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2007 through fy2011 and fy2007 through fy2016 but these projections contained information for the individual years after fy2010 nor were estimates provided for other components of the budget or for budget totals beyond fy2011 although not included in the budget documents it was made available on february 9 2006 the president proposed the elimination of the reduction in or the reform of approximately 141 discretionary programs the administration reports that these changes would produce an estimated 20 billion in budget authority not outlay savings in fy2007 compared to fy2006 how much these savings would affect the fy2007 deficit was left unclear the fy2007 budget also proposed reductions mostly in the rates of increase in mandatory programs over the next five years the proposed net savings totaled 71 billion over five years but this is only partial accounting of the presidents mandatory proposals the other proposals include user fee increases 3 billion in savings program augmentations 9 billion in increases social security personal accounts 82 billion in increases in fy2010 and fy2011 the outlay effects of extending the tax cuts 6 billion in increases and other mandatory proposals 1 billion in savings the net effect increases mandatory outlays by 21 billion over five years over the same five years cumulative mandatory spending excluding the administrations proposals totaled an estimated 8385 billion the administrations mandatory proposals would have increased it 03 above the mandatory spending baseline estimates 2 the changes are measured from ombs current services baseline estimates excluding policy proposals the administration included in its revenue baseline omb included the extensions of expiring tax cuts in its baseline this set of assumptions produced current services revenue estimate substantially smaller than cbos baseline revenue estimate particularly in the second half of the 10year period crs5 cbo released its analysis with contributions from the joint committee on taxation of the presidents budget proposal on march 15 2006 preliminary analysis was published on march 3 the analysis involved plugging the administrations policy proposals into cbos underlying budget assumptions and budget estimating methods the results produced smaller deficits in fy2006 and fy2007 than the presidents budget but larger than cbos baseline deficit estimates see table 1 cbos reestimates and the administrations deficits were similar for the remaining years projected through fy2011 cbo extended its reestimates through fy2016 showing the deficit under the administrations policies growing slightly as percentage of gdp from fy2012 through fy2016 the administration provided its annual midsession review for the fy2007 budget msr on july 11 2006 the report updated the administrations budget and economic estimates for fy2006 through fy2011 for fy2007 the changes from the february budget estimates were relatively small the deficit fell by 42 to 339 billion receipts grew by 18 to 2459 billion and outlays grew by 10 to 2798 billion as shares of gdp the estimates of gdp also were revised the deficit fell from 26 of gdp in february 2006 to 24 of gdp in july receipts fell by 01 of gdp to 176 of gdp outlays remained unchanged at 201 of gdp the somewhat improved shortterm budget outlook in the administrations msr had little effect on the longterm budget imbalance facing the country the rapid growth in receipts then expected in fy2006 was not necessarily going to continue in future years the administrations assumption about future spending restraint is also not assured even if the administrations shortterm assumptions prove correct without substantial changes to the programs that will expand rapidly as the baby boom retires or other large policy changes occur the longterm budget imbalance remained and remains in place cbos august 2006 release of the budget and economic outlook an update also showed fairly dramatic improvement in the deficit for fy2006 but showed little change for the other years from its earlier budget reports january and march 2006 the adoption of fy2006 supplemental appropriation in the spring of 2006 which cbo under the baseline rules it follows includes in its baseline estimates for subsequent years generated much of the baseline outlay estimate increase for fy2007 in the update revisions showing higher receipts in fy2007 limited the effect of the increased outlays on the deficit with the combined changes raising the deficit by 21 billion above cbos march 2006 baseline estimate cbos august revisions showed slightly worsened longterm budget outlook under its baseline assumptions even with the improved expectations for fy2006 the cumulative deficit in cbos august baseline 345 trillion was 13 trillion larger than cbos march baseline estimates 332 trillion the initial fy2008 budget documents from cbo and omb in january and february 2007 respectively contained an improved outlook for the fy2007 budget cbos report the budget and economic outlook fy20082017 had fy2007 baseline deficit estimate of 172 billion 13 of gdp over 100 billion below crs6 cbos august 2006 baseline estimate3 the presidents fy2008 budget february 5 2007 with fy2007 deficit estimate of 244 billion 18 of gdp included request that would result in an estimated additional 37 billion in outlays from about 100 billion in requested budget authority for the ongoing war efforts cbos march 2007 analysis of the presidents budget proposals for fiscal year 2008 contained cbos estimates of the administrations proposals and reestimates of cbos january 2007 baseline estimates cbo estimated that the fy2007 deficit would be 214 billion using the presidents policy proposals 30 billion smaller than ombs february 2007 estimate cbos baseline deficit estimate for fy2007 grew slightly by 5 billion from its january 2007 estimate to 177 billion the presidents fy2008 midsession review july 11 2007 included updated estimates for fy2007 showing continuing decline in the expected deficit the administration attributed the fall to higherthanexpected receipts which were primarily due to higher corporate income tax and excise tax collections the faster thanexpected growth in receipts tapers off in the estimates for subsequent years the budget report hinted that the actual deficit for fy2007 could be lower than indicated in the report subsequent cbo monthly budget report from july 2007 expected the deficit to be closer to 150 billion for fy2007 the improvements in the deficit outlook and in receipts are not the result of policy changes but mostly the result of changes in economic assumptions and technical changes in the estimates uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are inherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimates and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes4 small changes in economic conditions particularly the rate of gdp growth from those assumed in the estimates can produce large changes in the budget estimates according to cbo persistent 01 increase in the real growth rate of gdp would reduce the deficit including interest costs by 58 billion cumulatively over fiveyear period and by 272 billion over the next 10 years reductions in the rate of gdp growth would increase the deficit by similar amounts over the same time periods policy changes that are likely such as supplemental appropriations for operations in iraq and afghanistan but which are not included in 3 according to cbos january 2007 budget report outlays for fy2007 fell by 86 billion and receipts increased by 28 billion since cbos and ombs summer 2006 respective budget reports about half of the revenue changes and 60 of the outlay changes were technical in nature having nothing to do with policy changes adopted during the fall of 2006 4 some of the underlying components of budget estimates are known with some certainty demographics are one known component in the next decade the expected retirements in the baby boom generation will rapidly increase the spending for medicare and social security as well as other federal activities benefitting the elderly because virtually all those who will become eligible for these benefits are alive today estimating the growth in the populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforward crs7 cbos baseline can also change the budget outlook both for the current budget year and for future years the presidents fy2007 budget included chapter in the analytical perspectives volume titled comparison of actual to estimated totals the chapter examined the causes of the changes from the initial budget estimates for fy2005 february 2004 through the actual results for that year omb extended its analysis to find upper and lower bounds to the deficit or surplus estimates over fiveyear period based on data going back to fy1982 it found that the upper and lower bounds ranged over 11 trillion at the end of fiveyear period in other words the administrations deficit estimate for fy2011 205 billion could range from surplus of approximately 300 billion to deficit of approximately 700 billion with 90 chance of the budget balance falling between those two numbers even the administrations deficit estimate for fy2007 has 90 chance of being as small as 86 billion or as large as 622 billion budget projections are dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy expected policy and policy changes and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the expected or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can have substantial effects on the budget estimates and projections particularly over longer periods budget action congressional committees began hearings on the presidents fy2007 budget shortly after it was released the senate budget committee reported its version of the congressional budget resolution for fy2007 sconres 83 on march 9 after amending the resolution the senate passed it on march 16 as passed the resolution had higher outlays and larger deficit for fy2007 than proposed by the president it assumed the extension of numerous expiring tax cuts but did not include fix temporary or otherwise for the alternative minimum tax beyond fy2006 and did not include reductions in mandatory spending the house budget committee passed its version of the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 on march 29 the house budget committees resolution had smaller discretionary spending caps than the senatepassed resolution among other differences the house after an extended delay passed the budget committees version of the budget resolution on may 18 the house resolution had budget totals for fy2007 that were in most respects similar to those proposed in the presidents budget substantial differences between the house and senatepassed budget resolutions along with the relatively late adoption of the house resolution in an electionyearshortened legislative session may have reduced the chances of successful conference in the expectation of very difficulttoachieve housesenate crs8 agreement on fy2007 budget resolution both the house and senate adopted deeming resolutions5 the deeming resolutions established the discretionary spending levels for fy2007 the house and senate both used 873 billion for use by the appropriation committees in both chambers the house adopted its deeming resolution shortly after it passed its version of the budget resolution the senate attached its deeming resolution to the emergency supplemental appropriations for fy2006 hr 4939 which became law pl 109234 on june 15 2006 the discretionary level in the senate deeming resolution was almost 16 billion below the discretionary level in the senatepassed budget resolution following the adoption of the deeming resolutions the appropriation committees in the house and senate began considering and reporting the annual appropriation bills for fy2007 when congress left in august regular appropriation had passed the house had passed 10 of its 11 appropriations the house committee on appropriations had cleared all 11 of the appropriations the senate had yet to pass any of its 12 appropriations the senate committee on appropriations had cleared all 12 congress passed the defense hr 5631 and homeland security hr 5441 appropriations at the end of september 2006 in advance of the october 2006 start of fy2007 but none of the others the defense appropriation included continuing resolution on appropriations cr that funded all the activities not in the two adopted appropriations through november 17 2006 funding under the cr would be at either the housepassed senatepassed or last years fy2006 funding levels whichever was the lowest because the senate had only passed the defense and homeland security appropriations the funding level chosen was the lower of the housepassed or fy2006 levels congress returned after the election on november 13 with little time to adopt the remaining appropriations for fy2007 action on the remaining appropriations in the senate bogged down quickly to avoid possible lapse in funding congress adopted second cr pl 109369 hjres 100 on november 15 2006 the new cr provided funding through december 8 2006 in its postthanksgiving session congress adopted third cr pl109383 hjres 102 very late on december 8 2006 extending the existing cr through february 15 2007 congress also passed legislation that included an extension of numerous regularly extended tax breaks hr 6111 and also included trade and health savings account modifications among other provisions on january 31 2007 the house passed hjres 20 which would fund the remaining fy2007 appropriations for the rest of the year 9 of the 11 regular appropriations for fy2007 did not clear congress before the 109th congress ended in december 2006 most activities with numerous exceptions would be funded at or near fy2006 funding levels the senate passed the legislation without amendment on february 14 the president signed it on february 15 pl 1105 5 the deeming resolutions serve as an annual budget resolution to establish enforceable budget levels in the absence of an actual congressionally adopted budget resolution for additional information see the crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith crs9 along with his fy2008 budget the president requested 103 billion in supplemental appropriations for the wars in iraq and afghanistan and for additional hurricane recovery on the gulf coast the 2007 supplemental most of which was for defense and international affairs 99 billion would be spent in both fy2007 and fy2008 the house passed its version of the legislation hr 1591 on march 23 2007 in addition to the funding requested by the president the bill contained an additional 20 billion for domestic purposes it also included instructions to remove us troops from iraq under certain conditions during 2008 the senate approved its version of the legislation on march 29 2007 it contained 21 billion in spending for domestic programs not requested by the president it also included instructions to remove troops from iraq in 2008 the president threatened to veto the bills in their current forms because of the requirements for troop withdrawal and the additional unrequested domestic spending conference on the bill reached agreement hrept 110107 on april 24 2007 the agreement included the additional domestic funding and the withdrawal timetables as well as the funding for the military the house passed the agreement on april 25 and the senate passed it on april 26 the president received the bill on may 1 and as promised vetoed it the house failed in its attempt to override the veto the house and senate began discussions about new supplemental shortly after the veto the house passed new supplemental appropriations bill hr 2206 funding military and domestic spending on may 10 the bill did not contain timetable for withdrawal from iraq the senate amended the legislation with placeholder to facilitate conference on may 17 after leadership discussions an agreement was reached that passed the house and senate on may 24 the president signed the bill on may 25 pl11028 outlays the administrations fy2007 budget february 2006 proposed 2770 billion in outlays for fy2007 rising to 3240 billion in fy2011 the last year shown in the presidents budget the proposals would boost funding for defense and homeland security spending restrain or cut most other discretionary spending and make modest growthslowing changes to medicare in fy2010 and fy2011 it would raise spending by tens of billions of dollars to fund private accounts for social security the administrations proposals which the budget assumes are adopted would raise outlays by 61 billion 22 above the administrations revised fy2006 outlay estimate and by 170 from fy2007 to fy2011 measured against the administrations fy2007 current services baseline outlay estimates the proposed level of outlays would grow by 69 billion 266 the 6 the current services baseline estimates like cbos baseline estimates are designed to provide neutral benchmark against which policy proposals can be measured for outlays the modified baseline used this year by omb assumes emergencies are onetime only that federal pay adjustment assumptions reflect the usual first full pay period in continued crs10 difference between the current services baseline outlay estimate and proposed outlays for fy2007 indicates the cost of the administrations proposed policies the year toyear change the 61 billion increase combines the costs of proposed policy changes for fy2007 with the relatively automatic growth in large parts of the budget from fy2006 to fy2007 these relatively automatic increases include costofliving adjustments in many federal programs growth in populations eligible for program benefits and inflationdriven costs of goods and

wind down in fy2007 22 billion reduction in federal education funding mostly for support of higher education substantial increases in outlays in net interest 27 billion as both the debt and interest

billion in fy2011 crs11 gdp in fy2006 to 201 of gdp in fy2007 by fy2011 the administration projected that outlays would have fallen to 191 of gdp cbos january 2006 baseline estimates showed outlays falling very slowly from 198 of gdp in fy2007 to 194 of gdp in fy2011 and after falling slightly in the intervening years returning to 194 of gdp in fy2016 under selection of cbos alternative scenarios for spending including the assumption that there is phasedown in activities in iraq and afghanistan over number of years that total discretionary spending increases at the rate of nominal gdp growth rather than the rate of inflation and including higher interest costs from the larger deficits and debt resulting from these changes and from extending the tax cuts outlays would fall from 201 of gdp in fy2007 to 200 of gdp in fy2011 before rising to 212 of gdp in fy2016 the presidents budget indicated that department of defense dod spending would increase by 69 from fy2006 to fy2007 this increase 28 billion from 411 billion to 439 billion is based on budget authority ba for those two years and excluded enacted and proposed supplementals for the dod the presidents budget showed outlays the actual expenditures of the dod dropping from fy2006 512 billion to fy2007 505 billion 14 reduction in spending7 total outlays not ba and total revenues determine years surplus or deficit with the uncertainty surrounding the financing needs for the ongoing military action in iraq and afghanistan fy2007 defense outlays seem unlikely to match the proposals cbos baseline estimates for defense spending which include extending previously adopted supplemental funding increase ba by 25 and lower outlays by less than 1 between fy2006 and fy20078 nondefense discretionary outlays in the presidents fy2007 budget would grow by just under 1 5 billion from fy2006 to fy2007 from 500 billion in fy2006 to 505 billion in fy2007 the presidents budget showed nondefense discretionary ba falling by 42 18 billion between those two years most of that change resulted from the boost in fy2006 spending resulting from the administrations proposed 18 billion hurricane relief supplemental excluding that amount nondefense discretionary ba as whole would barely change from fy2006 to fy2007 cbos january 2006 baseline nondefense discretionary outlay estimates grow by less than 1 between fy2006 and fy2007 from 499 billion to 502 billion similar to the change in the presidents budget the presidents budget left unspecified his calledfor future year reductions in discretionary spending mandatory spending federal activities that generally do not need an annual appropriation would grow by 39 64 billion from fy2006 to fy2007 including the administrations proposed 17 billion in mandatory spending reductions for 7 these outlay numbers include both discretionary and mandatory outlays for the dod mandatory spending for the dod is less than 2 billion in both years 8 cbos defense category matches the budget enforcement act bea defense category somewhat larger collection of defense related activities than is covered by the dod alone crs12 fy2007 under the presidents original proposals9 this would raise mandatory spending the largest broad category of federal spending from 1457 billion in fy2006 to 1494 billion in fy2007 cbos january 2006 baseline estimates of mandatory spending showed it rising from 1432 billion in fy2006 to 1488 billion in fy2007 39 increase the administration proposed 36 billion in medicare savings from baseline levels through fy2011 which would slow slightly the expected increase in medicare spending medicare spending over the five years totaled an estimated 2207 billion the administrations proposed medicare reduction amounts to 16 cut from total medicare baseline spending over the five years legislation to reduce medicare spending was adopted in 2006 the budget also included in its mandatory proposals personal accounts for social security beginning in fy2010 that would increase spending by 82 billion over the two years fy2010 and fy2011 the net effect of the administrations mandatory proposals which included both increases and decreases would increase spending by 21 billion over the five years fy2007 through fy201110 the large deficits and an expected rise in interest rates change the interest payments the government must make on its growing debt both the presidents budget and cbos baseline estimates had net interest rising by 12 from fy2006 to fy2007 continued large deficits that rapidly increase the debt combined with expected higher interest rates would continue to raise the governments annual interest payment net interest as share of total outlays was expected to grow from 74 in fy2005 to 82 in fy2006 and to 89 of total outlays in fy2007 in the early spring of 2006 the senate passed its verison of the fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 march 16 2006 if followed it would have increased the proposed level of outlays by 120 billion 45 between fy2006 and fy2007 the resolutions fy2007 outlays were 69 billion larger than cbos fy2007 baseline outlay estimate and 25 billion above the presidents proposed fy2007 outlays under the senate resolution outlays would fall as percentage of gdp from 203 of gdp in fy2007 to 189 of gdp in fy2011 the housepassed version of the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 may 18 2006 followed most of the policies of the presidents budget proposal the resolution had slightly smaller deficit and slightly higher outlays than in the presidents proposal for fy2007 outlays in the resolution would increase by 95 billion 36 from fy2006 to fy2007 the outlays were 45 billion higher than cbos fy2007 baseline outlay estimate and less than 1 billion above the presidents fy2007 outlay proposal in the resolution outlays would fall from 201 of gdp in fy2007 to 188 of gdp in fy2011 congress did not adopt budget resolution for fy2007 9 the administrations reductions include increased user fee offsets as well as reductions in mandatory spending 10 the mandatory proposals would increase spending by an estimated 551 billion over the 10year period fy2007 through fy2016 according to the budget documents crs13 the administrations july 2006 midsession review msr increased the fy2007 outlay estimate by 28 billion most of the increase came from higher estimates for the administrations global war on terror and the effect of the fy2006 supplemental pl 109234 on outlays in fy2007 somewhat lower spending estimates in variety of other programs moderated the overall increase over the five years covered in the msr the changes in estimates between february 2006 and july 2006 would raise cumulative outlays by 45 billion barely noticeable amount given that cumulative outlays approach projected 12 trillion over the five years cbos august 2006 midyear budget report the budget and economic outlook an update reflecting budget legislation adopted to that point along with economic and technical adjustments to the underlying budget estimates boosted baseline outlays for fy2007 by 75 billion to 2801 billion over its january 2006 baseline estimates much of the increase reflected legislation that increased spending for the war effort and hurricane recovery the january 2007 cbo budget report the budget and economic outlook fy2008fy2017 reduced expected fy2007 outlays by 87 billion to 2714 billionbelow its august 2006 budget estimates about 30 of the reported change came from legislative actions taken since the august 2006 estimates the remaining change

gdp outlays under the alternative estimate wander bit as percentage of gdp in the near future from 201 of gdp in fy2007 to 203 of gdp in fy2011 and to 199 of gdp in fy2012 before rising steadily to

included extending the current relief from the alternative minimum tax amt for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 without further extensions of or permanent fix to the amt growing number of middleclass taxpayers would find themselves subject to the amt14 cbo estimated january 2007 that providing annual amt relief would reduce receipts by 279 billion between fy2008 and fy2012 and by 569 billion between fy2008 and fy2017 without adjustment to the amt it will eventually recapture much of the tax reduction provided in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts15 the administrations july 2006 msr showed jump in receipts as share of gdp in fy2006 to 183 of gdp from 175 of gdp in the presidents february 2006 budget but the two sets of estimates are relatively close in the other years the large increase in receipts expected at that time in fy2006 and possibly into fy2007 mostly from corporate income and nonwithheld individual income taxes appeared to be limited and had little effect on receipts in subsequent years the cbo august 2006 update also reflected the expected jump in fy2006 receipts from 177 of gdp in cbos march 2006 budget report to 183 of gdp an increase that dissipates over the 10year forecast by fy2011 the august 2006 baseline receipt estimate was 02 of gdp larger than cbos march 2006 baseline receipt estimate 189 of gdp versus 187 of gdp the expected jump in fy2007 receipts was smaller rising from 179 of gdp in the january 2006 estimates to 182 of gdp in the august 2006 estimates the revised estimates for fy2007 in the cbo january 2007 budget report and the omb fy2008 budget both showed still higher receipts in fy2007 186 and 185 of gdp respectively large component of the increase as with the outlay estimate changes was technical revisions to underlying assumptions by both omb and cbo produced much of the change in the revenue estimates for fy2007 not legislation or changes in the economic outlook the increase in nearterm receipts as shares of gdp persisted but generally diminishes over time the administration revised receipt estimates in its july 2007 msr the revisions raised expected receipts as percentages of gdp above the february 2007 administration receipt estimates in dollars the july estimates were below those from february the administration revised its estimates of gdp over the next five years reducing it in each of the years this produced the somewhat unusual result of receipts rising as percentage of gdp while falling in dollars in the same years receipts continue rising from yeartoyear 14 for discussions of the amt

administrations proposals show higher receipts early in the fy2007fy2012 period then closely track the presidents budget estimates beyond fy2012 the extension of the reestimates shows receipts rising through fy2017 as percentages of gdp the alternative estimate based on data provided in cbos january 2007 budget report showed receipts falling to near 175 of gdp by fy2011 and rising slowly after that the alternative assumes that the amt is adjusted to eliminate its growing coverage and that most expiring tax provisions as in the administrations estimate are extended this last adjustment to

articulated this goal16 the fy2007 budget showed the deficit falling below 2 of gdp by fy2008 and to 14 of gdp in fy2009 achieving the administrations deficit reduction goals would require during the five years in the budget strict limits on the growth in domestic discretionary spending if not actual reductions slowing in the growth rate of some entitlements and letting amt relief lapse after 2007 some of the presidents proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts requiring larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget to reduce the deficit since the administration has

not shown in figure 5 the cbo baseline deficit estimate january 2007 assumed the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in 2010 future adjustments to lessen the expanding coverage of the amt an annual inflation adjustment to discretionary spending along with number of other assumptions the result was growing receipts falling outlays and rapid fall in the deficit as share of gdp after fy2010 that would reach surplus in fy2012 cbo put the fy2007 baseline deficit estimate at 177 billion 13 of gdp in its march 2007 estimates this was 5 billion higher than its january estimates but over 100 billion smaller than its august 2006 baseline deficit estimate of 286 billion 21 of gdp previous budget reports during the fy2007 budget cycle tended to show shrinking deficit estimates for fy2007 with less improvement if any in the surplus deficit outlook for subsequent years compared to the presidents original budget proposal see table 4 combination of higherthanexpected revenues and somewhat lower levels of spending produced much of the change the senates fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 march 2006 contained slightly larger proposed deficit in fy2007 than in the presidents budget and was 30 billion larger than cbos march 2006 reestimate of the presidents proposed deficit compared with cbos revised march 2006 baseline the senates budget resolution deficit is almost 100 billion larger implying that policy changes would produce smaller deficit than the policy change assumptions included in the budget resolution as shares of gdp the deficits in the senate budget resolution fall from 26 in fy2007 to 10 of gdp in fy2010 before rising to 11 of gdp in fy2011 the house budget resolution hconres 376 may 2006 for fy2007 had slightly smaller proposed deficit than the president originally proposed by 6 billion and generally smaller deficits in subsequent years compared to the march 2006 cbo estimates the house budget resolution deficit for fy2007was80 billion larger than cbos baseline deficit and almost 15 billion larger than cbos reestimate of the presidents fy2007 proposal as with the senate resolution making policy changes would produce smaller deficit in fy2007 than adopting the policy changes assumed in the house budget resolution congress did adopt budget resolution for fy2007 crs22 the longer run both omb and cbo agree that over longer time period one beginning in the next decade and lasting for decades demographic pressure will so badly distort current policies as to make them unsustainable the future under current policies will lead to growing and persistent deficits cbo report on the longterm budget outlook december 2005 states over the next halfcentury the united states will confront the challenge of conducting its fiscal policy in the face of the retirement of the babyboom generation under current policies the aging of the population is likely to combine with rapidly rising health care costs to create an evergrowing demand for resources to finance federal spending for mandatory programs such as medicare medicaid and social security attaining fiscal stability in the coming decades will probably require substantial reductions in the projected growth of spending and perhaps also sizable increase in taxes as share of the economy18 the administration indicated similar concerns about the outlook for the budget over the long term in the presidents fy2007 budget february 2006 the longterm picture presents major challenge due to the expected growth in spending for major entitlement programs in only two years the leading edge of the baby boom generation will become eligible for early retirement under social security in 5 years these retirees will be eligible for medicare the budgetary effects will be muted at first but if we do not take action soon to reform both social security and medicare the coming demographic bulge will drive federal spending to unprecedented levels and threaten the nations future prosperity plausible amount of cuts to discretionary programs or tax increases can help us avert this major fiscal challenge by 2070 if we do not reform entitlement programs to slow their growth the rate of taxation on the overall economy would need to be more than doubled19 the shortterm budget outlook can change when it is buffeted by all types of unexpected events such as the hurricanes last year or deteriorating economic conditions the longterm budget outlook although susceptible to these types of events will largely be determined by the interplay of current policy and demographics the retirement of the baby boom generation rapidly expanding the population eligible for federal programs serving the elderly will put enormous pressure on the federal budget without policy changes these programs could overwhelm the rest of the budget not only will the programs themselves be stressed but their growth would be likely to impede the governments ability to meet its obligations and the ability of the economy to provide the resources needed 18 cbo the longterm budget outlook december 2005 p 1 19 omb budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2007 february 2006 p 18 crs23
