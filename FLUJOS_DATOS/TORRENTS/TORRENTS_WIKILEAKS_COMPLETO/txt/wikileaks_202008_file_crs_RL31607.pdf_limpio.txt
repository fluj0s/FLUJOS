intervention in iraq and depose saddam hu ssein is complex despite general consensus in washington that the world would be much better off if hussein were not in power although most us observe rs for variety of reasons would prefer some degree of allied or support for military intervention in iraq some observers believe that the united states should act unilaterally even without such multilateral support some commentators argue for stronger more committed version of the current policy approach toward iraq and leave war as decision to reach later only after exhaus ting additional means of dealin g with husseins regime number of key questions are raised in this debate such as 1 is war on iraq linked to the war on terrorism and to the arabisraeli dispute 2 what effect will war against

in the war on terror the new york times september 13 2002 james baker former secretary of state james baker stresses the need to remove hussein from power and eliminate iraqs wmd in order to preserve international peace because hussein vi olated previous security council resolutions he advocates the adoption by the security council of simple and straightforward resolution requiring that ir aq submit to intrusiv inspections anytime anywhere with exceptions and authorizing all necessary means to enforce it this resolution must also contain deadline for iraqs compliance judging that diplomatic and economic effo rts have been exhausted in cluding the pursuit of covert action and internal revolt ba ker maintains that the only realistic way to bring about regime change in iraq is through the application of military force including sufficient ground troops to occupy the country including baghdad depose the current leadership and install successor government but baker also emphasizes that the united states should strive to bu ild an international coalition to carry out military action to minimize the costs and risks inherent in unilateral effort baker warns that if it should become apparent th at we cannot get satisfactory reasonable resolution out of the security council eith er because of threatened veto or shortage of votes we should carefully cons ider whether to go ahead anyway and call for vote doing so would tell the world which countries stand for doing right and which stand for doing business baker james the right way to change regime the new york

economically critical to the united states berger contends that the risks associated with war on iraq are as serious as the threat posed by iraq including destabilization of an already volatile region

however he contends that it seeks more th an we need and more than we can obtain at this point in particular the draft in cludes prior explicit authorization to use military force if hussein does not comply in speak by all necessary means berger believes that this military for ce component is unnecessary because such authority can be derived from prior po stcold war resolutions instead of overloading the resolution we should focu s on the essence of what we need an unequivocal statement by the international community that the iraqi government must cooperate and comply with in an established time fra with truly unfettered inspections he urges the united states to negotiate resolution that isolates hussein and not us berger samuel h senate armed services committee testimony

motivations that drive terrorism brzezinski contends that in ternational support for an ev entual military conflict in iraq will be weakened he argues that us preemption is justified only if an attack on us is imminent because for the united states to go to war unless provoked is very serious very serious step brzezinski obser ves that nearly year after the start of americas war on terrorism that war faces the real risk of being hijacked by foreign governments with repr essive agendas instead of l eading democratic coalition the united states faces the risk of dangerous isolation brzezinski zbigniew confrontin g antiamerican grievances the new york times september 1 2002 richard butler former weapons inspector butler asserts that hussein violated international law by denying weapons inspections and that iraq already possesses wmd because iraq has avoided any inspection or monitoring of its wmd programs since 1998 he argues that the international community needs to take concrete steps to eliminate iraqs wmd by first insisting that hussein adhere to current security council resolutions butler says that iraqs failure to comply with resolutions and the terms of nonproliferation agreements including the nuclear proliferation treaty and the biolog ical weapons convention challenges the authority of the security council although butler declares that regime change is desirable in iraq he doe s not believe it can be engin eered from the outside butler recommends that the united states seek security council support to monitor wmd development in iraq to enforce sanctions aimed at limiting the financial activities of iraqi leaders and to prevent iraq from importing other military equipment butler richard saddams continuing deceit the washington file september 5 2002 richard

campaign clark has warned that war may not be the best way of dealing with hussein because you can get strate gically decisive result without having to use strategically decisive and destructive military power if you bring in the elements of the international law and the full diplomatic weight of the international community clark suggests that hussein might be less inclined to use wmd if the and the international community we re behind us campaign against iraq according to clark the immediate urgency of the threat posed by saddam must be determined before the administration can justify an attack against iraq he argues that the current primary threat to us security is qaeda and not iraq and that the united states would lose its focus in the war against terrorism if it began war now against iraq clark argues that the united states has time to engage in dialogue regarding iraq and to gain internationa l support for possible future military action he recommends that the united

could undermine this task by dismantling the international coalition which has most importan tly provided essen tial intelligence information although the united states could certainly defeat iraqi forces it would not be cakewalk would be expensive since the united states would be essentially acting alone would likely be costly in human lives and would result in largescale longterm us military occupation of iraq afterwards in addition to his focus on the war on terrorism scowcroft has emphasized the d ire consequences for the middle east regional destabilization destab ilization could help further saddam husseins strategy to dominate the persian gulf by reducin g international cooperation on the war on terrorism and increasing the numbers of rrorists scowcroft thus calls for the

could eventually diminish american influence in other parts of the world he explains that wars often ve unintended consequences and questions if the united states is prepared to physically occupy territory in the middle east for the next 30 to 50 years webb has also criticized those who are pushing for unilateral war because he judges that they have failed to articulate an exit strategy if the united states invades and stays in iraq he adds it is also true that if we invade and occupy iraq without broadbased in ternational support others in the muslim world might be encouraged to intensify the same sort of efforts and it is crucial that our national leaders consider the impact of this propos ed action on our longterm ability to deter aggression

showed that us invasion of iraq would be ca kewalk and that plans for posthussein democratic iraq were not realistic he argues the kurds and shiites probably would seek to become autonomous and thus ma ke posthussein politi cal reconstruction difficult in the event of war borchgrave maintains that the united states must be prepared to shoulder the costs of not only the military operation itself but also long term nation building in iraq given the views of european countries including britain with the exception of british primer minister tony blair he concludes the united states would be

the current political and social situation in iraq he has argued nationbuilding in iraq will be long costly and difficult but it is essential in order to avoid another dictatorship to help defray these longterm costs and to avoid the appearance of neocolonia lism in iraq he argues the united states must have international support preferab ly support friedman further argues that if the united
