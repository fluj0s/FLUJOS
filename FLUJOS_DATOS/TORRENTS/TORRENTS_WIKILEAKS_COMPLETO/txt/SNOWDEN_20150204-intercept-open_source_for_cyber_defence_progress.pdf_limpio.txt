system or buy from rirs regional internet registeries or can we find another way of getting all updates copied to us what about nsas foxtrail or our own geofusion and theres now refried chicken from redacted its database of passively intercepted domain whois records searchable by any word in the record since feb 2011 there are legal and policy constraints which mean you cannot search domains or terms within records that may be sensitive on grounds of location or nationality without appropriate authorisation if you would like an account please let know access to the data relies on having global surge account every few days dont know dont know ask the nac nsas foxtrail is in this space and needs more checks to see whether it isnt suitable and geofusion poc redacted recent domain registrations maybe an analytic run against the main dns records to find the new domains or is there more definitive source companies like cyveillance are able to obtain feeds of new domain registrations for brand monitoring so i imagine wed be able to get hold of something similar redactedgchq 0951 7 september 2011 bst ready for morning and afternoon shifts none very small mb nsas foxtrail is in this space and needs more checks to see whether it isnt suitable site type of data legal status pastebin an increasing number of tipoffs are coming from the pastebin website as this is where many hackers anonymously advertise and promote their exploits by publishing stolen information an automated regular search say weekly across pastebin for certain keywords such as govuk or gsi or hmg etc would be very valuable to ensure that govcertuk is always notified if any information that they need to be concerned about appears in open source 30112011 govcertuk briefed about an attack on server this tip came from open source and specifically from pastebin where the stolen emails and passwords had been posted online not approved this nature of this site means that it would be very difficult to demonstrate the proportionality of scraping the whole site to identify the small proportion of information that would be of value to cdo and therefore approval cannot be given for scraping of the site oval list for ndr to feed into hidden spotlight vulnerability database approved afraidorg redacted this lists domains which are publically available for anyone to add subdomain to

work is bird seed jtrigs birdstrike provides the scraping already but only for handfuls of ids and doesnt repeat the tweets requires data mining experiment run by cdt for ndr using cyber cloud and has oppleg approval already certain blogs and cert web sites for vulnerabilities direct web scrape if allowed mhs osint pages have examples hourly by list of specific sitespages small gb trcisa have previously run several contracts looking at this problem with view to delivery to cne final wrap up work is scheduled to automate the derivation of sem rules see trfsp from open source information such that machines matching those rule vulnerabilities can be found in passive wanted by ndr ref marble polls and govcert see open source vulnerability sources certain cert irc chatrooms for
