reorganization from going into eff ect and would likely have to pass law to prevent such reorganization from occurring1 in carrying out the reorganization authority the secretary pursuant to 872b may not abolish any agency entity organizational unit program or function expressly established either by the hsa or another statute in the process2 section 872b is the only strict limitation on the secretarys administrative reorganization authority however other provisions of the hsa appear to qualif the secretarys reorganization authority including 821 which requires the secret service to be mainta ined as distinct entity in dhs and 888 which requires the coast guard to be maintained as distinct entity in dhs3 while the secretarys reorganization au thority appears broa d legislation would seem to be required for any action that would 1 abolish an agency entity organizational unit program or function expressly created by congress or 2 do more than move function or establish consolidate alter or discontinue an organizational unit organizational units section 872a gives the secretary the authority to establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within the department however the term is not defined in the hsa consequently there is some question as to how the term organizational units limits the secretarys aut hority although court may apply considerable degree of deference to the secretarys organizational decisions4 because dispositive legislative history s been found discussing the scope of an organizational unit case law may be helpful in adams v united states 350 border patrol agents cl aimed that they were entitled to rather than exempt from overtime pa under the fair labor standards act because they were not executive employees within the meaning of the act ie supervisorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21450crs3 5 46 fed cl 616 fed cl 2000 6 fpm letter 5517 the federal claims court recognized the checkered history of the letter but still felt it captured the relevant standard 7 see 2a norman j singer st atutes and statutory constr uction 4717 at 284 4719 at 292 6th ed 2000 foremen or managers who managed fede ral agency or any subdivision thereof including the lowest recognized organizational unit with continuing function5 the adams court relied on 1975 opm advi sory letter that defined organizational units to mean an established and defined organizational entity with regularly assigned employees this requirement distinguishes supervisor s who are responsible for planning and accomplishing continuing workload from l eaders who head temporary groups formed to perform special assignment of limited dur ation or who direct the work of other employees assigned to project but do not exercise full supervision over such employees6 the adams case appears to suggest that an organizational unit may be relatively small administrative structure furthermore in applying canons of stat utory construction to the hsa it appears congress intended an organizational unit to be something smaller than an agency or other statutorily created entity in the limitation pr ovision of 872b1 for example congress placed the term organizational units after the terms agency and entity but before the terms program and function this placement suggests congress may have intended an organizational unit to be smaller than an agency and entity on the general assumption that things of higher order are named at the be ginning of an enumeration and that congress does not intend to be superfluous7 in 471b of the hsa congress again suggests that an organizational unit may be small administratively created structure section 471b authorizes the secretary through the presiden ts reorganization plan to reorganize the functions or organizational units within the bureau of citizenship and immigration services because the provisi on places an organizational unit within the bureau it appears congress also intended the term to be something smaller than bureau the definition of the term organizational units in essence affects the secretarys authority to reorganize dhs because 872a only allows the secretary to establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within the department it might be argued that the secretary is only allowed to establish consolidate alter or discontinue units smaller than an agency entity or bureau an office advisory committee or laboratory for example might arguably qualify as something smaller than an agency entity or bureau changes to structures other than organizational units would apparently need to be categorized as reallocation of functions among the officers of the department or be conducted pursuant to new legislative action to void an unauthorized action nonetheless because the term organizational units is not defined in the hsa or discussed in any relevant legislative history the sc ope of the term is not completely clear section 872a1 section 872a1 indicates th at the secretary may pursuant to 1502b ie the presidents reorganization plan allocate or reallocate functions among the officers of dhs and establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within dhs provided the secretary does not abolish any agency entity organizational unit program or function expressly blished by the hsa this implieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21450crs4 8 however the hsa states that the secretary may act pursuant to 1502b rather than through the reorganization plan and it could be argued that the secretary may like the president effect reorganization through transmission of plan elements the legislative history of the hsa in conjunction with president bushs thinly detailed reorganization plan however more appropriately supports the position that the secr etary must act through the presidents 1502b reorganization plan as rest ricted by 1502a rather than independently 9 see pl 107296 1502d 10 press release department of homeland security homeland security secretary michael chertoff announces sixpoint agenda fo r department of homeland security july 13 2005 available at httpwwwdhsgovdhspublicd isplaytheme43content4598printtruethat in order to reorganize the infrastruct ure of dhs under 872a1 the secretary must act through the presidents reorganization plan8 the reorganization plan including modifications was to become effective upon th earlier of 1 the dates specified in the plan or 2 the end of the transition peri od transition period means the 12month period beginning on the effective date of the hs ie november 25 2002 to november 24 20039 since the president is not authorized to modify or submit another reorganization plan under the hsa the secr etarys reorganization authority under 872a1 seems to also be similarly limited by these dates ccordingly the secretarys authority under 872a1 likely terminated on march 1 2003 the effective transfer date for many agencies under president bushs reorganizati on plan and earlier of the two selections section 872a2 the authority under 872a2 llows the secretary to allocate or reallocate functions among the officers of dhs and to establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within dhs after providing 60 days notice to the appropriate congressional committees of such action with an explanation of the rationale for the action this authority is perman ent but it is limited by 872b2 which prohibits the secretary from abolishing any agencies entities organizational units programs or functions establis hed or required to be maintained by statute in essence this limitation requires the secretary to maintain any of the aforementioned categories that are created by law including those categorie s created by the hsa section 872a2 allows the secretary to act independently of the presidents reorganization plan section 1502b provided proper notif ication is supplied to th appropriate congressional committees by the secretary administra tive reorganizations conducted pursuant to 872a2 become effective 60 days afte r providing notice to the appropriate congressional committees unless legislation would prevent such an occurrence the

operations and structures are optimally aligned to address present and future potential threats to the united states among the agendas sixpoint s is change that would realign the dhs organization to maximize mission performance10 the secretary stated that details would be announced in the coming weeks the followi ng describe some of the major structural adjustments being proposed by the s ecretary from available information create new directorate of policy this new directorate will serve as the primary departmentwide coordinator for policies regulations and other initiatives andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21450crs5 will assume the policy coordination functions previously performed by the border and transportation security directorate it w ill include the 1 office of international affairs 2 office of privat sector liaison 3 homela nd security advisory council 4 office of immigration statistics and 5 senior asylum officer create new office of intelligence and analysis this new office will gather information from all relevant field operations and other parts of the intelligence community for dissemination to the appropriate personnel it will be led by chief intelligence officer who will report directly to the secretary and will be comprised of analysts within the former information analysis directorate create new director of operations coordination this new office will allow dhs to conduct joint operations acr oss all organizational elements of the department and coordinate incident management activities among other things the homeland security operations center whic h serves as the nations nerve center for information sharing and domestic incide nt management will be housed here rename the information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate the directorate for preparedness the directorate for preparedness will facilitate grants and oversee nationwide preparedne ss efforts supporting first responder training citizen awar eness public health and in frastructure the renamed directorate will be managed by an under secretary and include 1 new assistant secretary for cyber security and telecommunications 2 new chief medical officer 3 an assistant secretary for infrastructure protection 4 assets of the office of state and local government coordina tion and preparedness 5 the us fire administration and 6 the office of nationa l capitol region coordination other proposed changes other changes reportedly include 1 having the federal emergency management agency fema report directly to the secretary of homeland security rather than to an under secretary 2 moving the federal air marshal service from the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement to the transportation security administration 3 merging the office of legislative affairs and the office of state and local government coordination into the newly established office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs and 4 having the office of security report to the under secretary for management rather than the deputy secretary for dhs legislative action as previously mentioned the secretary of dhs has broad and permanent authority to reorganize the depa rtment provided he gi ves appropria notice to congress the only explicit prohibition is that he not abolish any agency entity organizational unit program or function tablished or required to be maintained by statute from the information that is available it appears the secretary is primarily reallocating functions among the officers of dhs cons olidating certain responsibilities and establishing new organizational units there are some proposed changes nonetheless that might need legislative ac tion according to july 13 2005 letter from dhs to congress the secretary plans on seeking congressional action for the following organizational changes elevating the assistant secretary for the newly created office of policy to an under secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21450crs6 11 us const art ii 2 cl 2 12 us dept of justice office of legal counsel the constitutional separation of powers between the president and congress at 27 1996eliminating the position of under secretary for border and transportation security and requiring the director of fema to report directly to the secretary of dhs rather than the under secretary for emergency preparedness and response in dhs all the current directorates were established by statute accordingly it would appear consistent with the presumed intent of congress that completely new directorates also be established by statute moreover because the directorates currently in place at dhs all contain ag encies bureaus and other large entities it is would seem that establishing new directorate is something beyond establishing an organizational unit establishing new directorate ther efore would seem to need authorizing legislation and presumably that is what th secretary might be doing in his attempt to seek legislation for the elevation of the assistant secretary position to an under secretary relatedly the abolition of an existing directorate might also require legislative action since each was established by statute indeed this seem s to be the course of action being taken by dhs with respect to the elimination of the under secretary for the directorate of border and transportati on security on the other hand from the information available it appears dhs is not taking any legislative action to rename the directorate of information analysis and infrastructure policy the directorate of preparedness whether the renaming of dir ectorate is tantamount to an abolition of the entity however may be unlikely some might argue for instance that the mere renaming of directorate that keeps some of its or iginal components and gains others is not an abolition still others might suggest that renamed director ate which contains components fundamentally differe nt than originally concei ved is not appropriate for change through administrative fiat also unclear from the secretarys proposed plans is the status of the directorat of emergency preparedness and response which will have many of its functions or organizational units consolidated or reallocated to fema or elsewhere in the department this director ate nonetheless is still statutorily created entity that may require further legislative action to dissolve it legislation might also be needed if not ready provided elsewhere for some of the new personnel in the reorganization if they are an officer of the united states under the appointment s clause of the constitution11 an appointee 1 to position of employment 2 within the federal government 3 that carries significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states is required to be an officer of the united states12 until more information is made ava ilable regarding the secretarys proposed administrative and legislative organizationa l initiatives many uncertainties will continue to exist
