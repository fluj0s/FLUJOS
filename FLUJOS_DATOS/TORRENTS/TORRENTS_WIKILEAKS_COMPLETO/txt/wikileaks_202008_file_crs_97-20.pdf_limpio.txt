fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9720economic sanctions and the former yugoslavia current status and policy considerations summary in november and december 1996 hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in serbiamontenegro federal republic of yugoslaviafry rallied daily in the capital in protest of attempts by the serbian government under president slobodan milosevic to annul the electoral vict ories of the opposition in the municipal elections some international policymakers have threatened the serbian leadership with sanctions should it resort to violent means of quelling the protests in bosnia violations of lack of satisfactory compliance with aspects of the dayton peace agreement have periodically prompted calls for the reim position of sanctions against the offending partyies in particular extremely limited progress has been evident in the return of refugees to their homes or the turning over of indicted war criminals to the international tribunal during the course of the bosnian wa r from 1992 to 1995 an extensive sanctions regime was constructed by the international community primarily against serbia montenegro for its role in the bosnian conflict the united states imposed several implementing measures in compliance with the sanctions after conclusion of the dayton peace agreement in november 1995 the security council suspended sanctions sanctions were terminated in october 1996 after bosnia held its first national elections since dayton the united states has main tained unilateral policy of upholding socalled outer wall of sanctions against serbiam ontenegro that holds full diplomatic relations and u s economic benefits as we ll as us support of fry membership in international organizations or of economic assistance from international financial institutions these limited sanctions are to remain until the fry demonstrates further progress in c ooperation with the wa r crimes tribunal and with respect to the situation in kosovo in december 1996 in response to the political crisis in serbia the state department emphasized that this policy would remain in place until the serbian leadership reversed its antide mocratic practices at the end of 1996 the sanctions bate was focused on two related but distinguishable policy objectives to res pond to and possibly affect the internal political crisis in serbiamontenegro nd to press for greater compliance with aspects of the peace accord in bosnia for the first objective policymakers were able to consider various forms of sanctions in order to support demo cratic movements in serbiamontenegro and to condemn th repressive gove rnment under slobodan milosevic for the latter objective economic sanctions that had been in place would have been difficult to restore rather the international community or individual countries used internationa l reconstruction aid as an economic lever to influence compliance with the peace process in bosniahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9720contents

military response would not be feasible or ppropriate since late 1995 th threat of sanctions has frequently been invoked by the internationa l community as means to pressure the bosnian parties especially the bosnian rbs to comply with the terms of the bosnian peace agreement more recently attempts by the serbian leadership in belgrade to manipulate the electoral proce ss at home have prompted some calls for sanctions to be reimposed against serbiamontenegro beginning in 1992 the security council imposed series of economic sanctions1 against the federal republic of yugo slavia fryserbiamontenegro s m and later against the bosnian serbs in the republika srpska for their respective roles in perpetrating the war in bosnia and herzegovina the total package of sanctions against the fryserbiamontenegro was virtually comprehensive once the sanctions were in place international policy on sanctions focussed on sanctions enforcement sanctions primarily targeted the fryserbiamontenegro which financially and materi ally supported the bosnian serb armed forces but which was not direct party in the conflict as the war continued the serbian l eadership under slobodan milosevic sought to play peacemaking role in order to remove the burden of sanctions and the status of international pariah state as part of the usled peace process concluded in dayton ohio almost all sanctions against the fryserbiamontenegro were suspended in late 1995 and sa nctions against the bosnia n serbs were suspended in early 1996 after bosnia and herzegovina held national elections in midseptember 1996 the security council terminated th economic sanctions in october 1996 some observers contend that economic sanctions could tinue to serve useful role for variety of purposes th ey argue that some form or threat of sanctions could foster greater compliance with aspects of the bosnian peace agreement such as cooperation with the in ternational war crimes tribunal assurance of freedom of movement impr oved human rights practices and participation in joint political institutions among others the civilian consolidation plan for bosnia agreed to in paris in november 1996 refe rred to the possibility of renewed sanctions against any party that failed significantly to meet its obligations under the peace agreement httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9720crs2 2 for further discussion

international observers and the ability of the elected government of kosova to meet and conduct business the president may waive the requirement however to meet emergency humanitarian needs or to achieve negotiated settlement of the conflict in bosnia and herzegovina policy considerations international policymaker s have frequently invoked the threat of economic sanctions in order to advance certain policy objectives in the former yugoslavia during the war sanctions were imposed to bring pressure on serbian president milosevic to end the war and were in part the reason he took on the role of peacemaker in the current situation u s and other western policymakers may maintain multiple policy objectives in the balkans that are distinct but mutually interactive international policy directed at affecting developments in serbia montenegro or croatia for example may affect developments in bosnia as well with regard to sanctions at least two separate policy objectives can be identified to respond to and possibly affect the recen t internal political crisis in serbia montenegro and to press for greater co mpliance with aspects of the peace accord in bosnia political unrest in serbiamontenegro erupted after the serbian government partially overturned the re sults of the november 17 municipal elections during which the opposition claimed victory over th ruling socialists in numerous cities including belgrade in response tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets in daily protests the state department decried the belgrade governments anti democratic measures and specified that the united states would maintain its limited sanctions against serbiamontenegro and woul d reserve the right to consider re imposition of sanctions13 the state department also called for european countries to impose measures similar to the us outer wall of sanctions while the united states and other count ries have demanded that the serbian government respect the results of the muni cipal elections the threat of restoring sanctions against belgrade appears to be directed primarily at forestalling any violent suppression of the protests at th london peace implementation conference in december fry foreign minister milan milu tinovic pledged not to use force to end the rallies many analysts predict that the international community will not actively press for multilateral economic sanctions unless the situation on the streets turns violent they point to milosevics role as guarantor of the bosnian peace process his ability in the past to survive political challenges and the lack of international consensus as yet on sancti ons nevertheless some i ndividuals may call for some form of sanctions or other measures against belgrade that would convey support for the democratic movement in serbiamontenegro and c ondemnation of the serbian governments antidemocratic policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9720crs8 14 the washington post december 5 1996 p a39an ongoing policy objective of the united states has been to promote implementation of the bosnia peace agreement since the conclusion of the agreement one year ago the threat of sa nctions has often been raised by the international community in response to viol ations to or lack of progress in peace implementati on with the current s ituation regarding war criminals and refugee returns at stalemate one can expect that some individuals may again call for the imposition of sanctions in order to compel compliance by one or more of the balkan parties in particul ar many observers have called fo r sanctions to be imposed on any party that does not cooperate with the gue war crimes tribuna l and facilitate the arrest and transfer of indicted war criminals in the first year after dayton the threat of restoring suspended sanctions in effect from november 1995 until october 1996 may have enhanced president milosevics interest in moving fo rward with peace implementation current circumstances however raise some doubt s as to the feasibility and likely effectiveness of future sanc tions the united nations could reimpose sanctions only by approving new security council re solution support among other security council member countries for restoring multilateral sanctions against serbia montenegro with regard to the bosnian peace process remains uncertain even if other european countries in the security council were eventually to support renewed economic sanctions russia woul d likely remain opposed it would be easier for the president to order or for the congress to legislate unilateral us sanctions but such measures would have lesser economic impact than multilateral sanctions whom to target for possible future sanctions related to the bosnian peace process is also problematic issue by most accounts all of th interested parties including neighboring serbiamontenegro and croatia remain out of compliance with one or another aspect of the peace agreement could sanctions feasibly be targeted on multiple parties even if sanctions were to be concentrated on the ostensibly worst offender the bosnian serb s the impact of such sanctions would be questionable given that the republika srpska remains substate entity that would be difficult to target within th greater bosnia and herzegovina rather than sanctions the international community appears to have settled on utilizing international recons truction assistance as its pr imary economic lever the paris meeting of the bosnia presidency in november 1996 specified link between the availability of assistance from the international financial institutions and implementation by the bosn ian parties of the peace agreement in december 1996 international leaders at the london confer ence emphasized that economic aid would be conditional on the political willingness of the bosnian parties to implement the peace14 individual donor countries conceiva bly may exercise the prerogative of withholding funds for reconstruction ai d or conditioning economic assistance on certain political goals
