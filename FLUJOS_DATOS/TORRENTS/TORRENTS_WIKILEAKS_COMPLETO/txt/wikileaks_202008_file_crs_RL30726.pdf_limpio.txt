divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726prescription drug coverage under medicaid summary medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for services on behalf of certain groups of lowincome persons one of its most important benefits is prescription drug coverage as of january 2006 many of medicaids elderly and disabled beneficiaries began receivin g their drug coverage under medicare nonetheless medicaid continue s to be an important source of funding in the nations pharmaceutical markets and medicaid drug coverage an important source of drugs for many lowincome and disa bled medicaid beneficiaries outpatient prescription dr ug coverage under medicaid is an optional benefit if states choose to cover prescription dr ugs they must be provided to medicaid enrollees who are categorically needy th at is to individuals who qualify for medicaid on the basis of being in certain gr oups in addition states have the option of choosing to provide prescription drug coverage to medically needy individuals persons who are not poor by cash welfare standards but who require help with medical expenses thirtythree states and the district of columbia provide prescription drug coverage to all medicaid beneficiaries prescription drug benefits under medicai d are very broad states can create formularies or lists of pr eferred benefits but certain federal rules keep actual coverage very comprehensive even in medicaid managed care organizations which are not subject to those rules current practice ensures gene rous drug benefit there are 11 categories of prescription drugs that states are allowed to exclude from coverage based on state financial reports for 2005 payments for medicaid outpatient prescription drugs net of all rebates federally re quired rebates plus state supplemental rebates were 307 billion accounting for just over 10 of payments for all medicaid services since 1990 pharm aceutical manufacturers whose drugs are covered by state medicaid

rules to extend coverage to other groups of individuals not traditionally eligible prescription drug coverage under medicaid introduction medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical services on behalf of certain groups of wincome persons it is the third largest social program in the federal budget exceed ed only by social security and medicare and is typically the second largest spendi ng item for states the federal share of medicaid costs in fy2005 for benefits and administration is timated to have been 180 billion1 states are estimated to have spen t an additional 136 billion for total program cost of 316 billion medicaid programs are administered nd designed by the states under broad federal guidelines states must provide medicaid to certain population groups and have the option of covering others similarly state must cover certain basic services and may cover add itional services if it chooses states set their own payment rates for services with some limitations there is thus considerable variation in medicaid programs with some relatively limited and others very generous in terms of eligib populations covered benefits and payments for services medicaid is meanstested program enrollees income and other resources2 must be within program financial standards these standards vary among states and among different population groups within state with some exceptions medicaid is available only to persons with very low incomes most medicaid enrollees have income that is below the poverty level with number of exceptions medicaid is available only to children adult members of families with children pregnant women and to persons who are aged blind or disabled persons not falling into those categories such as single adults and childless couples gene rally cannot qualify matter how low their income is3 the various eligibility groups have traditiona lly been divided into two basic classes the categorically needy and the medically needy the two terms once distinguished between welfarerelated categ orically needy beneficiaries and those qualifying only under special medicaid rule s which allow states to cover persons whose income is too high to qualify fo r cash welfare support but who nevertheless need help with medical bills medically needy however nonwelfare groups havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726crs2 been added to the categorically needy list over the years as result the terms are longer especially helpful in sor ting out the various populations for whom mandatory or optional medicai d coverage has been made available however the distinction remains important when considering certain benefits some benefits are considered mandatory for categorically need individuals that is states must cover those benefits for the categorically needy but they are optional for medically needy individuals other benefits including prescription drugs are optional for both groups of beneficiaries some st ates provide those optional be nefits only to categorically needy individuals some states provide those benefits to both groups and some provide those benefits to certain subcategories of medically needy as well as categorically needy see table 1 several recent laws have had and will continue to have major impact on medicaid prescription drug benefits while specific provisions will be discussed in detail below summary of those major ch anges that affect prescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries are as follows the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra 2005 pl 109171 changed the federal upper limit applying to payments for most generic drugs under the medicaid program required that manufacturerre ported average manufacturer prices be publically available included provisions intended to improve states ability tocollect drug rebates for physicianadministered and authorized generic drugs and liberalized states ability to establish copayments onprescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries the medicare prescription drug improvements and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 established the part d medicare benefit effective january 1 2006 all beneficiaries who are

outpatient drugs in their medicaid benefit package in 2005 ll states covered out patient prescription drugs for at least some medicaid beneficiaries well more than half of the states reported covering outpa tient drugs for all medicaid be neficiaries the remaining states covered drugs for at least categorically needy individuals table 1 and sometimes for other specified groups in add ition to the categorically needy prescription drug coverage is one of the few optional medicaid services provided by all states this is in part due to the belie f that coverage of pr escription drug benefits is good deal that the provision of th is benefit can help to keep enrollees healthier and potentially prevent more seri ous andor costly medical interventions table 1 medicaid coverage of outpatient

and medically needy feeforservice coverage for medicaid beneficiaries who are not enrolled in medicaid managed care plans federal statut allows states to establish formularies formularies are lists of preferred pharmaceuticals when health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others the list is referred to as closed formulary medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the priv ate market for insurance because of two statutory requirements th first requirement is that states must cover any non formulary drug with the exception of dr ugs in 11 specific categories see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726crs5 6 prior authorization is process whereby patients provider requests approval for coverage from the medicaid agency or its cont ractor of specific drug before dispensing that drug 7 barbiturates and benzodiazepines are drugs generally used as sedatives and tranquilizers 8 section 1927j of the social

manufacturers entering into rebate agreements with the secretary of health and human services hhs while ensuring that medicaid formularies are not too restrictiv federal statute does section 1927d of medicaid law on the other hand clearly allow states to exclude the following categories of drug products from medicai d coverage drugs used to treat anorexia weight loss or weight gain b to promote fertility c for cosmetic purposes or hair growth d for the relief of coughs and colds for smoking cessation and f prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride prepara tions g nonprescription drugs h barbiturates i benzodiazepines7 j drugs requiring tests or monitoring that can only be provided by the drug manufacturer and k for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction unless such agents ar used to treat condition other than sexual or erectile dysfuncti on for which the agents have been approved by the food and drug administration formularies may also exclude drug for which there is significant therapeutic advantage over other drugs that are included in the formularies as long as there is written explanation of the reason for its exclusion and the explanation is available to the public managed care coverage for medicaid beneficiaries who are enrolled in managed care plans plans to which states pay fixed monthly payment in exchange for the provision all or some subset of c overed services medicai d statute includes broad exception to the drug c overage rules scribed above8 the law allows the enrolling managed care organization to develop and administer its own formulary in practice however when prescription drugs are covered under the managed care arrangement states enforce limitations on the formularies of managed care entities similar to those imposed on states by the federal government this policy was initiated in correspondence from the secretar of health and human services hhs to state medicaid directors9 this letter notified states that drugs covered under the state plan must also be made available in medicaid managed care formularies for medicaid managed care enrollees states generally establish contract clauses in their agreements with medicaid health mainte nance organizations hmos and other managed care organizations mcos that allow such entities to establish formularies but also require them to meet all of the feeforservice coverage rules overthecounter otc medications many state medicaid programs also cover otc medications or those medica tions that can be purchased without prescription

pharmaceutical be nefits are very broad encompassing most prescription drugs and many nonpres cription drugs medicaid beneficiaries receiving care in the feeforservice sector are assured of broad pharmaceutical coverage due to statutory re quirements that prohibit states with closed formularies from denying drugs requested and approved in the prior authorization process and those offered by manufacturers that have re bate agreements in effect the benefits provided to medicaid managed care enrollees tend to be similarly broad because of administrative policies state medicaid programs have undergone major changes in their drug coverage policies over the past few years in res ponse to the implementation of medicare prescription drug coverage part d u nder the provisions of the mma 2003 and as of january of 2006 medicare part d replaced medicaid as the primary insurer for most drugs for dual eligible beneficiar ies medicaid programs are specifically prohibited from continuing to cover drugs offered under the medicare plans but may however cover those drugs not included in part d coverage state medicaid programs will continue to be required to contribute to the cost of drugs now covered under medicare part d however based on formula specified in mma 2003 the formula requires states to contribute an amount equal to 90 declining to 75 of the per capita cost of states drug spe nding under medicaid in 2003 multiplied by the number of dual eligibles enrolling in the new medicare benefit12 in addition medicaid administrations are required to conduct eligibility

account changes passe d in dra are not likely to be issued soon this is because regulations issued in july of 2007 describing the methodology for calculating amp an important component of the fuls as required by dra have been enjoined from being implemented pending legal challenge brought by the national association of chain drug st ores and the national community pharmacists association they contend that the regulation goes bey ond congressional intent and would cause harm if implementedthe prescription the dispensing fee medicaid law requires the secretary to establish upper limits on the federal share of payments for acquisition costs that are designed to encourage the substitution of lowercost generic equivalents for more costly brand name drugs those limits apply separately to multiple source drugs defined to include any drug for which there is at leas t one other drug sold and marketed during the period that is rated as therapeutically equivalent and bioequi valent to it and to all other drugs fuls for multiple source drugs when applied to multiple source drugs the limits are referred to as the fuls which stands for federal upper limits the fuls do not apply to individual claims for prescription drugs rather the limits are applied in the aggregate to each states spending for particular drug the dra 2005 signed by the president on february 8 2006 made several significant changes to the ful policy for multiple source drug s the provision of law became effective on january 1 2007 new fuls however have not yet been issued by cms as result the fuls in effect today are based on formulas in prior law the fuls are calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and are periodically publishe d in the state medicaid manual13 under the deficit reduction act of 2005 new fuls issued after january 1 2007 are required to be equal to 250 of the average manuf acturer price amp of the least costly therapeutic equivalent computed wit hout regard to prompt pay discounts14 the amp is reported to cms by ma nufacturers and is defined in statute to be the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholes alers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade15 under the ful policy each state must assure the secretary that its medicaid spending for multiple source drugs is in accordance with the upper limits plus reasonable dispensing fees the effect of this requirement is that when lowercost generic equivalent exists for brandname drug pharmacy will be paid at price tied to the least costly alternative even if the brandname drug is actually furnished the medicaid program as well as the pharm acy supplying the drug therefore has financial incentive to see that lowercost generic equivalents are substituted for their brandname counterpartshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726crs8 16 awps are intended to represent the average price at which wholesal ers sell drug product to retail pharmacies they are compiled

change following the full implementation of dra 2005 the formulas below represent states attempt to estimate the true acquisition costs that retailers pay to wholesalers to obtain the pharmaceuticals they sell while awps are used by the states to estimate those acquisition costs it is believed that the published awps are more like manufacturers suggested wholesale prices rather than true measure of the average costs to pharmaci of obtaining pharmaceuticals in reality many drug wholesalers compete with each other by ffering pharmacies di fferent discounts from awp and some pharmacies purchase

provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid fo r medicaid beneficiaries th formulas used to compute the rebates are intended to ensure that medicaid pays the lowest price that the manufacturers offer for the drugs in return for entering into agreements with the secretary state medicaid programs are required to cover all of the drugs marketed by those manufacturers with possible excep tions for the 11 categories of drugs that states are allowed to exclude from coverage in 2003 there were reported to have been more than 550 manufacturers partic ipating in the medicaid drug rebate program19 rebate requirements do not apply to drugs dispensed by medicaid managed care organizations when the drugs are paid as part of the mcos capitation rate and to drugs provided in

these are di scussed in further detail below single source and innovator multiple source drugs manufacturers are required to pay state medicaid programs basic rebate for single source and innovator multiple source drugs basic reba amounts are determined by comparing the amp for drug to the best price which is the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler retailer nonprofit or public entity21 the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price additional rebates are required if the weighted average prices for all of given manufacturers single sour ce and innovator multiple sour ce drugs rise faster than inflation as measured by the consumer pr ice index for all urban consumers prices in effect on october 1 1990 are used as ba and are compared with prices in the month before the start of the period for which the rebate is to be issued to determine if current prices have ri sen faster than inflation22 since 1990 there have been few change s to the medicaid drug rebate policy before 1992 best price was defined to ex clude drugs sold to federal agencies at depot prices23 and single award contract prices under the veterans health care act of 1992 pl 102585 prices charged by ma nufacturers to certain federal agencies were also excluded from the determination of best price these agencies include the department of veteran s affairs dva the departme nt of defense dod the public health service phs and various phsfunded health programs and state nonmedicaid pharmaceutical assistance programs the exclusion of those prices from the best price potentially reduced medicaid savings from the rebate program so congress responded with an offset reba percentages were increased to

two criteria 1 they must respond within 24 hours to request for approval nd 2 they must dispense at least 72 hour supply of covered drug in emergency situations in 2005 all including the district of

for 2006 through 2010 and almost 12 billion over 10 years the amps as submitted by the manufacturers to cms are generally lower than any of the published awps and as yet remain confidential until the passage of dra cms was prohib ited from making those prices publically available and could only share them with the us general accounting office and the congressional budget office upon full implementation of the dra provisions amps are to become publically available retail pharmacies have res ponded to dras ful formula change with concerns that the lower fuls will push medicaid reimbursements for multiple source drugs to amounts below pharmacies acquisition costs small community pharmacies that buy smaller quantities of drugs than the big chain pharmacies are particularly concerned since they have less price nego tiating power and almost always purchase through thirdparty wholesalers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726crs27 44 letter from john dicken director of health care

expenditure medicaid drugs gao found that the estima ted fuls were below average retail pharmacy acquisition costs for 59 of the 77 drugs examined44 these findings potentially provide support for the concerns raised by the retail pharmacies and may raise other concerns as well for example if the fuls when finally implemented turn out to be below acquisition costs medicaid beneficiaries could suffer reduced access to such products since pharmacies might be disinclined to do business with medicaid programs proposed regulation in december 2006 cms issued proposed rule to implement the dra provisions pertaining to prescription drugs under medicaid the rule which was issued in final form in july of 2007 72 federal register 39142 defines number of important terms re lated to drug pricing under medicaid including definitions impacted by dra provisions such as amp multiple source drugs and nominal prices the rule has elevated the concerns of pharmacy groups some of those concerns were expressed in letters from members of the us house of representatives and the senate to the acting cms ad ministrator in february nd march of 2007 one of the issues identified in the letters was about cmss45 inclusion of prices that are not available to retailers in calculating amp according to the pharmacy groups by including those prices in amp prices and rebates that community pharmacists do not have access to the fuls would be lowered as would medicaid reimbursements potentially making th eir medicaid business unsustainable46 this has prompted pending lawsuit brought by the national association of chain drug stores and the national community pharmacists association to halt the implementation of this rule at this time the rule has been prohibited from being implemented while the court case proceeds cost sharing and other flexibility enabled by dra as summarized above the dra gave states several new cost sharing options although the outcome of these new options on benefici aries copayments is not yet clear survey of state medicaid directors conducted during the summer of 2006 suggests that only handful of states consider it likely or were certain to make changes based on the dra options thirty states however responde d that they didnt know or had not yet determined whether such changes would be forthcoming47httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30726crs28 48 including the

state medicaid programs are undergoing major changes in response to the implementation of the provi sions of the medicare prescription drug improvements and modernization act of 2003 mma 2003 pl 108173 signed in december of 2003 as of the start of 2006 medicaid eligibles who also qualify for medicare receive their outpatient pr escription drugs under medicare part d instead of under medicaid while this w doesnt affect eligibility for medicaid programs it does however affect the benefits that medicaid programs will cover under mma 2003 state medicaid programs ar prohibited from covering drugs that are to be provided under part d and cannot pay cost sharing amounts for those drugs additional administrative responsibilities states have both new administrative and financia l obligations under mma 2003 states are required to conduct eligibility dete rminations for the lowincome subsidies and cost sharing assistance for the medicare program this is because the assistance for lowincome medicare part d beneficiarie s is based on the statutor description for medicaid coverage group qualified medicare bene ficiaries qmbs qmbs are group of dual eligible enrollees for whom medicaid pays medicares cost sharing requirements the group of individuals who qualify for lowincome subsidies under medicare part d is similar to the qmb eligibility group except that the part d group allows for somewhat higher income financial standards maintenance of effort payments finally mma requires states to continue to pay part of the cost of the medicare pa rt d drug benefit based on formula that projects what they would have paid fo r pharmacy benefits for the dual eligible population in the absence of medicare part d beginning in 2006 each state must make monthly payment to the secretary of hhs equal to the product of the states share of 2003 medicaid per capita spending for drugs for all fullbenefit dual eligibles48 trended forward to the current year multiplied by the total number of such dual eligibles in the state for the month and multiplied again by the factor for the year the factor was 90 in 2006 and will phase down to 75 over 10 years this provision has proven to be controversial some states claim that the payments for part d exceed what they would have had to pay under medicaid because the formula doesnt account for cost cutting activities that would have
