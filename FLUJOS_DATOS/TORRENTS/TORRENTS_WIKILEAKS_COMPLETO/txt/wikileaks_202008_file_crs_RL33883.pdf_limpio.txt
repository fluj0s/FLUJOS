number of federal statutes may apply to potential energy installation depending on its type loca tion and the agency with jurisdiction background energy sources and technologies for each type of energy resource number of specific generator designs have been considered and as the technology is further developed new engineering solutions may be devised to generate power with the energy of moving water or waves rather than provide great detail on specific mechanical designs this discussion of technology will focus on the broad categories of renewable ocean and river power generation cu rrently under development river flow hydroelectric dams the mo st familiar waterpower technology have been source of energy for centuries but they have costs due to the changes they create in river flow patterns3 however kinetic or freeflow turbines do not rely on the differential height of water on either side of an impoundment to generate electricity but instead use the force of moving water to spin turbine blades4 river currents may be harnessed as power s ource with new turbine technologies similar to those identified below for tidal power generation tidal flow tidal generation uses the ener gy of moving water to spin generator and may produce power from water moving in two directions inward on the flood tide and outward on the ebb tide tidal power technology projects fall into two broad categories barrage projects and instream gene rators barrage generation is similar to the construction of traditional hydropower dam in that an impoundment is built across river estuary or other area subject to tidal flow and electricity is generated by the difference of water height on either side of the barrier depending on whether the tide is flowin g in or out instream projects do not impound water but instead use the energy of the tidal current to spin turbine5 tidal resources are modest overall in the united states although significant potential exists in some areas such as new

electricity from the undulating motion of the oceans waves7 the power in the moving wave may drive turbine or other device directly or it may pressu rize air or hydraulic fluid to power generator waves contain more energy than other renewable energy sources like solar radiation wave size is predictable many hours or ev days in advance the united states has considerable wave energy potential and wave energy generators may minimize aesthetic issues by being located far from shore underwater or protruding only slightly above the surface of the sea8 ocean thermal energy conversion otec otec systems rely on technology that uses the oceans thermal gr adient the difference in temperature of water layers to drive generator these systems require that the temperature between the warm surface water and the cold deep water differs by at least 36f under these circumstances an otec system can produce electric power the requirement for this temperature differential limits otec systems largely to tropical zones ocean temperature differentials in the pacific northwest for example range from 0 to 20 f9 otec technology has been demonstrated at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii nelha at keahole point on the kona coast of the island of hawaii it has become the worlds foremost otec laboratory and test facility unlike the other technologies discussed due in part to the limited number of suitable sites and the expense of the technology otec systems have not been the focus of recent ocean energy proposals in the united states10 project activities energy projects designed to harness the

environmental issues and other considerations these technologies are appealing to some due to their renewable energy sources and emissionfree operation in contrast to hydroelectric dams freeflow turbines do not impound water divert flow or prevent sediment transport however as the technologies develop especially if thei r application grows to commercial scale there will be environmental issues to consider these issues likely will include withdrawal of wave energy conver ting some of waves power into electricity reduces wave height which may alter the coastal or marine environment interactions with marine life pow er plants may artificially provide resting space for seals and sea lions and nesting for sea birds and may create artificial reefs below the surface and devices with open spinning turbines may pose hazard to fish or mammals air or water emissions devices using hydraulic fluid may leak releasing pollutants aesthetic concerns there may be issues with the visual

type of exemption in addition to meeting other requirements the continuedpreliminary permits licensing and exemptions ferc has three general administrative categories that may apply to potential wave tidal or in stream generation project first propos ed project may be issued preliminary permit this permit is not re quired prior to license appli cation permit is valid for up to three years and gives the holder priority status if the holder chooses to apply for license that is the permit reserves project location for the applicant while the holder conducts feasibility studies and prep ares license application it does not allow demonstration project or any ot her construction and the permit holder must file periodic reports on the progress of the feasibility studies the second category licensing refers to the traditional operating license associated with nonfederal hydropower pr ojects this is the regulatory document referenced in 16 usc 817 1 hydropow er licenses typically are issued for up to 50 year periods and may require severa l years of preapplication analysis and review before submission of an pplication and issuance of license35 ferc has introduced two license modifica tions to hydrokinetic projects that aid project developers the first is pilot li cense process the goal of the hydrokinetic pilot license is to eliminate barriers to development by reducing processing time to as little as six months allowing installation of test equipment and allowing power generation to the grid the license requires th at projects have size of five megawatts or less be easily removed or deactivated and be installe d for longer than five year term there are additional provisi ons for site decommissioning and project changes or equipment removal if unexpected environmental impacts arise36 the second license modification is conditi oned license unlike the pilot license program this is full project operating li cense which allows applicants to begin non construction activities while some permitting processes such as water quality certification are still pending37 on march 20 2008 ferc finalized the first license under this program for wa ve energy project in washington38 finally for some projects ferc may issue an exemption to the licensing required under the fpa an exemption is valid in perpetuity and the process of applying for an exemption may be simple r than applying for license however there are some stipulations and technical specifications for an exemption to be exempt project must be rate d at less than 5 megawatts mw39 and use

under the fpa referencing 16 usc 796 8 streams or other bodies of water emphasis in original and cites presidential proc lamation 5928 as having extended the territorial sea and thus its federal jurisdicti on to 12 nautical miles45 ferc contends that wave and tidal energy projects are under its jurisdiction based on fercs interp retation of the fpa adding its own emphasis any da m water conduit reservoir power house or other works incidental thereto 46 the agency has asserted that project fe atures such as undersea anchors or conduit leading to station on the s hore would occupy land under federal jurisdiction so the project would require ferc license additionally ferc finds that any generator connecting to or displacing power from the electric transmission grid affects interstate

limited project boundaries to prevent sitebanking and promote comp etition and the require d project progress reports will be given closer review to ensure active exploration of the energy resource88 there is concern among ocean ener gy proponents that having different agencies with regulatory authority on either side of 3 nm line may lead to hardship for project developers some projects may be sited outside of the limit specifically to avoid ferc licensing while others th at choose to use similar technology inside the 3 nm limit would require ferc license89 there are some who may oppose wave or tidal power development or have concerns about project impacts this may especially be true among groups such as fishing organizations other recreational us ers and some environmental interests these stakeholders may prefer to see slowerpaced licensing process which they may feel ensures more extensive public involvement and regulatory review
