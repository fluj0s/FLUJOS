irans minorities iran transitorigin heroin seizures rise alleged problems with iranian gas export deals ref karachi 145 b 2008 baku 917 classified by polecon counselor robert garverick for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c iran view from baku is the first in an occasional series from embassy baku iran watcher that will report on short andor partially documented items of interest to iran information consumers but not necessarily warranting separate cables this cable includes information on reported increasing security problems in iranian baluchistan including alleged disruption of iranpakistan railroad links message from senior goaj military offical about the dangers of stirring up iranian minorities the apparent quadrupling in first quarter 2009 compared to first quarter 2008 seizures in azerbaijan of iranian transited heroin and skepticism about iranian gas export contracts related by industry participants at the recentlycompleted baku oil and gas show end summary baluchi violence obstructing iranpakistan rail link 2 c several iranian contacts including apolitical businessmen have told baku iran watcher that the recent suicide bombing of shia mosque and subsequent attack on campaign center in zahedan reflect surge in baluchi violence in the border area and inside pakistan that has been building steadily over several years according to one source the iranian security forces may be losing effective control over growing areas in the countryside all noted that the rising violence in iranian baluchistan is mirrored and influenced by similar events on the pakistani side of the border recently described in refa 3 c one alleged result is the apparent postponement of completion of the longplanned improved rail link between pakistan and iran designed to run through or near baluchi territory on both sides of the border the current rail connection running between quetta pakistan and zahedan iran is in poor condition and has low freightcarrying capacity moreover according to reports it has recently been repeatedly subject to rocket attacks and other disruption by baluchi tribes an improved link also traversing iranian and pakistani baluchi areas was originally supposed to have been inaugurated in march 2009 with container train service beginning in august according to iranian sources in baku this deadline is unlikely to be achieved and regular use of the iranpakistan railway for significant cargo shipment is unlikely in the foreseeable future 4 s xxxxxxxxxxxx quoted the ministry source as saying that in 2008 iran asked pakistan to establish new more secure and modern route but that pakistan has so far refused the source added that tehran is rife with rumors about the increasing lack of safety in baluchi areas and claimed that many guard and police posts in sistanbaluchistan areas are longer occupied at night due to the increased danger of attack 5 c another source xxxxxxxxxxxx blamed the ahmadinejad administration for pursuing provocative antisunni practices including harassment of sunni clergy and congregations and raids on sunni mosques and other arrogant crackdowns over the last few years he claimed that these practices combined with high unemployment perceived discrimination baku 00000478 0022 of 003 subject iran view from baku violence in baluchistan reducing border security goaj official warns against manipulation of irans minorities iran transitorigin heroin seizures rise alleged problems with iranian gas export deals and few government services has increased anger among baluchis and identification of the central government as an enemy he cited the appointment of ahmadinejad ally habibullah dehmordah as governor of sistanbaluchistan as typical insensitive blunder calling him stupid brutal sunnihater note dehmordah was replaced as governor in 2008 by alimohammed azad end note goaj military figure opposes promoting unrest in iran 6 s at 12 may meeting with visiting group of 16 us military general officers the goajs special assistant to the president for defense general vahid aliyev related that he had recently met in iranian azerbaijan with unnamed highranking iranian general8 although he did not provide details aliyev strongly implied that the iranian general raised alleged foreignsponsored efforts to foment unrest among iranian ethnic groups including iranian azerbaijanis who make up nearly thirty percent of the iranian population commenting on this issue aliyev asserted that there have been four attempts by iranian azerbaijanis to assert autonomy in the last hundred years all of which were crushed by the iranian state as an example aliyev cited the soviet effort during world war ii to establish breakaway republic of south azerbaijan the soviets forces pulled back in 1946 after trumanstalin agreement which aliyev depicted as cynical betrayal of collaborating iranian azerbaijanis he recounted that the resulting repression by tehran resulted in the deaths of 60000 azeris and the flight of many more into soviet azerbaijan 7 s us military participants agreed that aliyev appeared to be implicitly signaling that outside fomenting of unrest in iranian azerbaijan is opposed by the goaj aliyev similarly told the us officers that any foreign war with iran will be bad for azerbaijan and result in flood of refugees entering the country note the three other failed azerbaijani autonomy struggles cited by aliyev presumably refer to the early 20th century constitutional revolution azerbaijani resistance to reza shahs centralization policies in the 1920s and efforts by senior azerbaijani clerics and activists to obtain local autonomy in the wake of the islamic revolution in 1979 end note goaj iranorigin heroin seizures continue rise 8 c according to xxxxxxxxxxxx export of narcotics from iran into azerbaijan continue to skyrocket see ref b according to statistics provided to baku iran watcher xxxxxxxxxxxx iranorigin heroin seizures ie heroin derived from afghani and pakistani opium that entered azerbaijan from iran in azerbaijan nearly quadrupled during the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008 according to the goaj virtually all of this heroin had been fully processed in labs and was ready for market total heroin seizures in azerbaijan during the first quarter of 2008 reflected sharp increase over the first quarter of 2007 while in 2006 only twenty kilograms of such heroin was officially reported seized in azerbaijan during the entire year in contrast reported goaj seizures of iranorigin heroin during the first quarter of 2009 amounted to nearly 59000 kilos as compared to approximately 15000 kilos of heroin seized in the first quarter of 2008 projected problems in iranian gas links 9 c the annual baku oil and gas show held june 25 brought variety of energy company executives and pundits to baku though senior officials from iran an american baku 00000478 0032 of 003 subject iran view from baku violence in baluchistan reducing border security goaj official warns against manipulation of irans minorities iran transitorigin heroin seizures rise alleged problems with iranian gas export deals interlocutor told baku iran watcher on the side of the show that xxxxxxxxxxxx had confided to him in private conversation xxxxxxxxxxxx that he viewed nearterm implementation of the iranianpakistani gas link project as very unlikely the downbeat comment by the xxxxxxxxxxxx was made despite the recent signing in istanbul by president ahmadinejad and president zardari of an iranianpakistani mou committing to the gas project according to this source xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated that he had several reasons for this opinion but the only one he elaborated was that the pakistanis dont have the money to pay for either the pipeline or the gas 10 c meanwhile during panel discussion at the conference on the future prospects of caspian gas several commentators noted the difficulty of doing business in unpredictable overly bureaucratic iran and the alleged historical unreliability of iranian gas supply contracts previously reached with turkey and turkmenistan for example panelists recounted that after long negotiations iran has four times failed to sign separate liquid national gas contracts at the last minute two panelists claimed that iran has repeatedly diverted gas supplies to meet domestic needs thereby interrupting its contractual gas exports and has not paid contractual penalties for these violations 11 c xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted bluntly that iranian political leaders are totally focused on domestic needs and personal jockeying and are simply not interested in hearing about the value of optimizing foreign gas exports the only exception he claimed is their interest in the notional prospect of annually exporting ten billion cubic meters bcms of gas to europe he attributed this interest to conviction that such deal will significantly increase irans political leverage in europe and substantially insulate it from future european pressure perception he characterized as revealing and typically unrealistic derse
