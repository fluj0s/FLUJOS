capital stock is believed to be one way to raise the productivity of the labor force i ndividually saving is critical to accumulating sufficient wealth to maintain living standards after retirement this report explains how national saving is measured presents recen t estimates of saving rates in the united states and for compar ison provides t hose of other major industrial countries this report will be upda ted periodically introduction anyone with income and future must decide how much to spend and how much to save individuals may save fraction of their income for precautionary reasons as well as to provide for themselves in retirement businesses retain fraction of their profits in order to finance new investme nts governments save or dissave as consequence of policy decisions about how much to tax and how much to spend the amount of money saved as nation s important economic consequences if individuals save too little during their working lives to avoid falling living standards in old age that may influence policymakers views about the appropr iate level of social security taxes and benefits national saving the sum of individual business and public saving has important c onsequences for the balance of tr ade economic growth and future standards of living1 although economic theory gives reason to prefer one saving ra to another it may still be useful to examine trends in saving and to compare us saving rates with those in other countries this report provi des brief explanation of how saving ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21480crs2 2 just as there is balance between the income and product sides of the nipa there is balance in international payments if americans buy more goods and services from abroad than they export then at least in this simplifie d example the net outflow of dollars w ill be used by foreigners to buy dollardenominated assets which thus helps to finance domestic investmentmeasured and it provides current data on saving rates in the united states and for selected foreign countries measuring saving saving in nutshell is income minus c onsumption in an economic sense however consumption is not the same as expenditures translating the theoretical notion of saving into statistical measure is challenge the source for us saving data is th national income nd product accounts nipa published by the department of commerce bureau of economic analysis bea the nipa constitute the accounting framework whic h is used to produce estimates of gross domestic product gdp gdp is the total va lue of goods and services produced and it can be calculated in two different ways on way is to add up the value of all the goods and services produced the pr oduct side of the accounts and the other way is to add up all of the income earned in the production of those goods nd services the income side of the account on the product side gdp is the total value of those goods and services produced for personal consumption c investment i gove rnment g as well as for export x on the income side the income earned in the production of those goods and services can be accounted for as consumer spendi ng c taxes t private sa ving s and spending for imported goods and services m since each of these approaches measure the same variable gdp they can be set equal to each other in this way c i g x c t s m subtracting consumption c from both sides simplifies the equality i g x t s m this can now be rearranged by subtractin g government spending g and exports x from both sides which gives i s t g m x this equation illustrates the importance of saving total investment is equal to the sum of private saving s public saving tg and the net inflow of capital from abroad m x2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21480crs3 gross and net saving in the broadest sense saving is income less consumption consumption is typically taken to mean spending on goods and servi ces by households but consumption can also refer to the wear and tear depreciation or capital consumption on the capital stock that occurs in the production of those goods nd services thus some saving must be allocated to the replacement of the existing capital stock as it wears out only if saving is more than sufficient to replace the existing capital stock as it wears out can the capital stock grow for this reason saving data distinguish between gross and net saving the difference between the two measures is the estimated deterioration in the existing capital stock in some cases such as computers cap ital may be completely depreciated in very short period of time whereas in others such as buildings or heavy equipment capital may take long time to wear out saving and economic growth economic growth in the long run is determined by three factors the growth rate of the labor force the rate of technological pr ogress and the rate of growth of the capital stock the productivity of the labor force pends on both the level of technology and the size of the capital stock the more capital there is the more productive the labor force can be the size of the capital stock in turn depends on the ra of investment investment must equal saving the amount that can be invested depends on the amount of saving saving more can lead to increased investment resulting in larger stock of capital and higher vels of productivity cons uming less now enables more consumption in the future thrift is considered by many to be virtue but economic theory gives reason to prefer one saving rate over nother the amount saved is s een simply as reflection of the trade off made between desire to consume now and willingness to consume less than ones current income to pr ovide resources for the future historical saving data table 1 presents historical estimates of us saving rates since 1997 the data in the top third of the chart relate to the contribution of the privat sector personal or household saving and business saving to national saving followed by data indicating the saving of the public

rate is pr escribed by economic theory the case for saving more is sometimes argued on the grounds th at either less is save d now than in prior years or that the current saving rate is below that of other countries table 2 presents data showing how national saving in the united states compares with that in other major industrial countries these data diffe r somewhat from those presented in table 1 because the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd uses different set of economic accounting rules and because the oecd data are not revised on the same schedule as the nipa data
