birth certificates summary in its comprehensive report to the nation the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the unite d states 911 commission recommended that the federal government set national st andards for the issuance of identification documents including drivers licenses social security cards and birth certificates the commission noted that identification fraud is longer simply matter of theft but now complicates the governments ability to adequately ensu re public safety at vulnerable facilities including airport terminals train stations bus stations and other entry points as the legislative process unfolded both the house of representatives and the senates proposed versions of legislation included provisions intended to address this specific recommendation however their pproaches varied both with respect to scope as well as the suggested methodology th at was to be used to bring the states into conformity with these new national standards generally the house version opted to detail specific statutory requireme nts while the senate proposal chose to mandate regulation but delegate d broad discretionary authority to the relevant federal agencies the final legislation that was appr oved by congress on december 8 2004 and signed by the president on december 17 2004 contained many of the provisions found in the senates original proposal w ith several significant additions from the houses proposed language many of the provisions that were considered controversial were not ultimately included however several members indicated during the floor debate that these issues specifically those that relate to drivers licenses would be revisited during the 109th congress in addition because many of these provisions only delegate regulatory authority to federal agencies several concerns that were raised during the gislations delibera tion including access to birth certificates by genealogists or other historical researchers are not specifically addressed by the statutory language and will likely be the subject of agency action this report will be update d as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32722contents introduction 1 d r i v r s l i

terrorism prevention act of 2004 national standards for drivers licenses social security cards and birth certificates introduction the 911 commissions final report recomme nded that the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as drivers licenses1 specifically noting the rising problem of identification fraud the commission concluded that sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are w ho they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists2 prior to the passage of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the standards for driv ers licenses and birth certificates were determined on statebystate basis with national standards in place while states are currently required to obtain social security numbers from drivers license applicants for child support collection purpos it appears that most states were not requiring that the social security number be printed on drivers license however in those states that still use social security numbers on drivers licenses it appears that an optout process was available both the house of

obviates federalism concerns under supreme court jurisprudence remains to be see n the court has held that in exercising its power under the commerce clause congress may not commandeer the state regulatory processes by ordering states to enact or administer federal regulatory program see new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 the court has extended this principle by holding in printz v united states that congress may not circumvent the prohibition on commandeering states regulatory processes b conscripting the states officers directly printz v united states 521 us 898 935 1997 it may be possible to argue that because the issuance of drivers licenses remains st ate regulatory function the minimum issuance and verification requirements established in th is bill even if limited to federal agency acceptance constitute an effective commandeer ing by congress of the state regulatory process or conscription of the state nd local officials who issue the licenses 7 id at

of individuals that are eligible to obtain drivers license or personal identification card12 in other words it would appear that if state grants certain category of individuals ie immigrants legal or illegal permission to obtain license nothing in the forthcoming regulati ons is to infringe on that states decision or its ability to enforce that decision the regulations are also not to require

federal agency acceptance of drivers licenses and personal identification cards however the senate propos delegated the authority to set the minimum standards to the secret ary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of homeland security the senate proposed that the secretar within 18 months of enactment establish minimum standards for drivers licenses or personal identification cards issued by state for use by federal ag encies for identification purposes the regulations would have been required to include standards for documentation verification and processing required for dr ivers licenses and pe rsonal identification cards in addition the regulations were required to contain security standards to ensure that drivers licenses and personal identification cards are resistant to tampering alteration or counterfeiting and capable of accommodating and ensuring the security of digital photograph or othe r unique identifier also the regulations were to require states to confiscate driv ers license or personal identification card if any component or security feature of the license or identification card is compromised finally the regulations were required to contain procedures designed to protect the privacy and civil rights of applicants for drivers licenses and identification cards to ensure compliance with these regulations the senate language required the states to certify to th secretary of trans portation at intervals to be determined by regulation that thei r licensing procedures conform with the legislations requirements the senate proposal also imposed limita tions on the secretarys regulatory authority specifically the regulations were not permitted to infringe on the states power to set eligibility requirements or to fully enforce those requirements in addition the senate proposed that the s ecretary may not require single national design for either drivers license s or personal identification cards in addition to the specific

privacy of social security numbers30 the proposal called for prohibi tion on the states or their political subdivisions from displaying electronically or otherwise social security number or any derivative of such number on an drivers license or motor vehicle registration or on any other document issu ed by states to an individual for identification the house proposal also required the commissioner of social security to promulgate number of regulations with respect to the system for issuing social security numbers first regarding app lications for social security numbers by individuals other than for purposes of enumeration at birth the commissioner was instructed to require indepe ndent verification of any bi rth record provided by the applicant in support of the application and may provide for reasonable exceptions in situations where the commissioner dete rmines there is minimal opportunity for fraud second the commissioner was direct ed to make improvements to the enumeration at birth program for the i ssuance of social security numbers to newborns such improvement s were to be designed to prevent the assignment of social security numbers to unnamed childre n the issuance of more than one social security number to the same child and other opportunities for fraudulently obtaining social security number finally th house proposal required the commissioner to issue regulations restricting the issuance of multiple replacement social security cards to any individual to 3 per year and to 10 for the life of the individual except where the commissioner determines there is minimal opportunity for fraud in addition the house proposal containe d number of provisions requiring the submission to congress of reports nd recommendations

the best method of requiring and obtaining photographic identification of applicants for oldage survivors and disability insurance benefits for social security number or for replacement social security card including reasonable exceptions to any requirement for photographic identification of such applicants senate proposal31 as was the case with respect to drivers licenses the senate proposal took different approach w ith respect to social security numbers like the house the senate proposal re quired the commissioner of social security to issue regulations restricting the issuance of multiple replacement cards to minimize fraud and requiring independent verification of all records provided by applicants for social security numbers other than at enumeration at birth however unlike the house the senate required the commissioner to add death fraud and work authorization indicators to the social security number verification system within 18 months of the legisla tions enactment in addition the senate proposal provided for the establishment of an interagency task force to further improve the security of social security cards and numbers within one year the task force was to have established security re quirements for safeguarding social security cards from counterfeiting tampering th eft and alteration verifying documents submitted for the issuance of replacement car ds and to have increased enforcement against the fraudulent issuance or use of so cial security numbers and cards the senate proposal did not appear to amend th social security act nor did it appear to have contained any of the study nd recommendation provisions included within the houses proposed language birth certificates final bill with respect to birth certificates the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 delegated authority to th secretary of health and human services requiring that minimum st andards for birth cer tificates for use by federal agencies for official purposes be completed later than one year after the date of enactment32 the regulations are directed to require the state or local issuing official to certify the birth certificate and will also require that the states utilize safety paper or alternative secure m easures designed to prevent tampering counterfeiting or otherw ise duplicating the birth certificate for fraudulent purposes33 in addition to the security measures th secretary is instructed to establish requirements for proof and verification of identity as condition of issuance of

issuance of birth certificate for person who is not the applicant34 concern has been expressed that this provision may have an impact on gen ealogical and other historical research involving access to birth records however what exactly that impact will be appears dependant on precisely how the regulation is ultimately drafted for example it is possible that the regulations could be drafted in such way that will make it difficult for genealogical res earchers to obtain birth certificat without express permission or authorization from the person or persons whose records they are seeking this problem may be especially prevalent w ith respect to abandoned fosterraised or adopted children who may not have the ab ility to obtain proper authorizations from their direct decedents while it appears possible for the secretary to draft regulation that both complies with the st atute and provides an exception or special procedure for genealogical and historical access this result is by means guaranteed nor is it mandated by the plain nguage of the statute furthermore it is important to note that these regulations appear only to apply with respect to acceptance of birth certificate by federa l agency for official purposes therefore if the birth certificate is to be used for any other purpose it appears that these regulations will not apply and the states will retain control over procedures for issuing nonofficial birth reco rds that being said it is also possible that either federal pressure to unify the standards may force states to move exclusively to federallycompliant birth records thereby eliminating the storage and issuance of nonofficial birt h certificates the statute does provide some limitations on the secretarys regulatory powers specifically the regulations may not require single design to which certificates issued by all states must conform35 the secretarys power is also limited by the requirement to accommodate the differences between the states in the manner and form in which birth records are stored and birth certificates are produced from such records36 finally the statute sets timetable for implementation as previously mentioned the secretary has one year to promulgate the regulations however the regulations will not go into effect until two years after they are promulgated37 the states will be required to certify that the state and all local government or other officials are in compliance with the standards at intervals established by the secretary38 the statute also provides that grant funding be made available to assist the states in conforming to the standards that are created by the secretary39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32722crs10 40 all references to the house proposal in this section can be found at hr 10 108th cong 30613067

established minimum document i ssuance and verification standards for federal recognition of birth certificates to meet the minimum document standards the house proposal required state and local governments to use safety paper custodian of records seal and any other m easures deemed necessary by the secretary of health and human services to pr event the tampering counterfeiting or unauthorized duplication of birth certifi cate the secretary was instructed however not to require sing national design to which all states must conform before issuing duplicate certificate state to comply with the minimum issuance standards would have been re quired to verify the name on the birth certificate the date and location of birth the mothers maiden name and substantial proof of the requestors identity in cases where the requestor was not named on the birth certificate states were to have requi red the presentation and verification of legal authorization before issuing birth certif icate in addition the house language would have required the secretary to prom ulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for the issuance of birth certificates to authorized family members the house proposal would have also re quired states to establish minimum building security standards for both state and local vital records offices implement other security and privacy protection measur and establish central database that can provide interoperative data exchange with other states and federal agencies in addition the house proposal required the s ecretary to establish common database and exchange protocol for electronic birth and death re gistration systems this system would have been required to employ fraud prevention technology utilize common electronic system for issuing birth certificates employ common format for certified copies and establish uniform fi eld requirements for st ate birth registries senate proposal41 as with standards for drivers licenses and social security cards the senate measure proposed delegatin g regulatory authority here to the secretary of health and human services to establish minimum standards for birth certificates for use by federal agencies for official purposes the regulations promulgated by the secretary were require d to include certification by the state or local custodian of records the use of safety paper custodians s eal and other features designed to prevent tamperin g counterfeiting or other unauthorized duplications for fraudulent purposes in addition the regulati ons were to establish requirements for both proof and verification of identity as well as the processing of birth certificate applications to prevent fraud moreover the secretary was to be prohibited from requiring that single national design be used and was specifically required to accommodate the differences between the states with respect to the manner and form in which birth certificates are stored and produced
