alternatively propose trading program but only if it achieved greater progress in improving visibility the bart requirements interaction w ith other air pollution control programs has become an issue

involves controls on so2 and nox focuses on egus as the most costeffective source to control and proposes using trading mechanism to acco mplish reductions at issue is how the model cair trading program for egus interacts with the bart requirement for egus in 2005 epa made final determin ation to exempt egus subject to the cair trading program from the section 169a visibility bart program critics of epas proposal point out that section 169a specifies prot ection of individual class i areas and that bart requirements woul d be more stringent than cair for individual sources and they claim that overall visibility improvements attributable to cair would not be adequate to meet caa goals epas effort to meld the visibility program with cair is consistent with its expressed desire to

with several very specific pr ovisions including the best available retrofit technology bart requi rements for existing sources epa promulgated rules in 1980 to addr ess visibility impairment that was reasonably attributable to single sour ce or small group of sources ie plume blight4 as with many air pollution regulations these visibility regulations are implemented by states through sips in general the 36 states with mandatory class i areas were required to revise their sips to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal the major elements of the regulation were 1 identifying existing sources causing visibility impairment and creating procedures for determining which existing stationary sources should be subject to bart requirements 2 assessing potential adverse impacts from proposed new sources or modified old sources and recommending remedial actions via the new source review nsr process and the psd progra m 3 developing 1015 year longterm strategy to make reasonabl progress toward the visi bility goal and 4 conducting visibility monitoring in mandatory class i areas as noted these regulations deal with plume blight only regional haze reduction was explicitly delayed until some future date this lack of aggressive implementation of secti on 169a extended to the implementation of the 1980 regulations as well after 35 of 36 st ates missed the september 1981 deadline for final visibility plans the environmen tal defense fund sued the epa in 1982 to implement the plume blight regulations the suit was settled in 1984 with the epa developing phasedin schedule for co mpliance with december 1986 deadline for states to revise their sips to include controls on existing sources that hinder visibility goals5 this sequential implementation of plume blight regulations actually extended through 1989 so far the only bart inst allation to occur under the 1980 regulations has been the installation of sulfur dioxide scrubbers at the nava jo generating station in arizona in 19916 epas lack of initiative on visibility during the 1980s prompted the congress to revisit the issue in the 1990 amendments to the clean air act those actions

its own discretion or petition from at least two states commissions were required to assess the scientific technical and other data available on visibility impairment from potential or projected emissions growth in the region based on those data the commissions were to issue reports within four years to epa recommending what measures if any should be taken to reme dy such impairment within 18 months of receiving commissions report epa wa s to carry out its responsibilities under section 169a including crite ria for measuring reasonable progress toward the national goal finally states affected by any regulations promulgated under section 169a were required to revise their sips within 12 months of such promulgation in 1991 visibility transport commission for the region affecting visibility in grand canyon national park was established in june 1996 this commission consisting of the governors of arizona california co lorado nevada new mexico oregon utah and wyoming and the leaders of five indian tribes approved set of recommendations for improving western vistas8 there were nine primary recommendations including increased energy conservation use of renewable energy and emission reductions fro m stationary sources9 the commissions baseline forecast anticipated that current regulatory programs would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide from stationary sources pow er plants smelters and other industrial sources 13 by the year 2000 although dditional measures under consideration might reduce emissions 2030 in light of this uncertainty about the effects of current programs and the fact that emissions were projected to decline in the short term without additional regulation the commi ssion agreed to set only regional targets for sulfur dioxide emissions in the year 2000 the ultimate targets would be in the range of 5070 reduction by the year 2040 but interim targets may also be needed to ensure steady and continui ng emission reductions and to promote investment in pollution prevention10 if the targets are exceeded this would trigger regulatory program probably including regional cap on emissions with market based trading the regional haze rule the

although each could control emissions from any major source of these emissions cair is focused on electric generating units while the regional haze ru is focused on 26 different categories of sources therefore as major sources of so2 and nox electric generating units become critical point of interaction betw een cair and the regional haze rule the contentious issue has been whether bart for egus can be and should be superseded by cair for affected egus determining bart under the regional haze rule the clean air act explicitly states that bart decisions ar to be made according to their impact on visibility as stated in section 169a each major stationary source which as determined by the state emits any air pollutant which may reasonably be antic ipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any such area shall procure install and operate as expeditiously as practicable and maintain thereafter the best available retrofit technology as determined by the state for controlling emissions from such source for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any such impairment27 epa originally proposed guidelines to assist states in determining bart in 200128 after portions of the regional haze ru were remanded by the court in the american corn growers v epa decision29 epa revised and reproposed its bart determination guid elines in may 200430 in particular the proposed revisions focused on state determinations of individua l source contributions rather than on the collective contribution to visibility impairm ent as contained in the proposed regional haze rule and 2001 guidelines this reproposal focuses on the use of single source emission modeling for assessing the degree of improvement in visibility from various bart control levels31 under section

bart guidelines also proposed guidelines for states to assist them in determining the appropriate state emissi on budgets or caps for their trading program to ensure it met the greater reasonable progress requirement37 the proposed guidelines would have required dispersion modeling of bart and the trading program to ensure better visibility specifically the modeling should identify 1 the difference in visibility conditions under both approaches for each class i area and 2 the average difference in visibility over all class i areas affected by the regions emissions the analysis would demonstrate greater reasonable progress if 1 visibility does not decline in any class i area and 2 there is overall improvement in visibility as determined by comparing the average differences over

requirements for an emissions trading program that responded to the objections raised by the court the final rule was published on october 13 200640 with respect to the alternative trading program the primary change to the existing guidelines was to bring the program requirement into compliance with the american corn growers v epa decision41 specifically the revision permits states to use the same bart determination approach to develop base line estimate of bart in the alternative program as it allows for sourceby source bart as stated by epa in short to demonstrate that trading program or other alternative program makes greater reasonable program than ba rt the state can develop an estimate of bart emissions reductions using th same approach that it would use to establish

air pollution as preferred implementation strategy epa encourages states to use trading program to reduce emissions in costeffective manner to set allocations epa compared the costs of various control

cair model trading program44 among its provisions the proposed supplemental rule would have permitted electric generating units to us the emission trading program under cair to meet the bart requirement imposed by the regional haze rule to achieve this epa proposed to amend the trading prog ram requirements unde r the regional haze rule the proposed supplemental rule woul d have amended and revised the regional haze regulation to exempt electric utility sources that comply with the cair from the regional haze regulations ba rt requirement specifica lly the cair would have45 revised section 308e2 so that sources participating in the cair trading program would have been excluded from the requirement that state demonstrate that its regional haze emission trading program will achieve greater reasonable progress than would be achieved through the installa tion and operation of bart inserted renumbered section 308 e3 providing that states barteligible electric generating units that participate in the cair trading program would not have to install and operate bart thus the proposed supplemental cair revisions to the regional haze rule would have done two things 1 exempted states from having to demonstrate that sources complying with the cair thr ough its proposed trading program would achieve greater reasonable progress than w ould be achieved through the installation and operation of bart and 2 exempted such sources from bart in the final cair epa decided to defer the decision on substituting cair for bart for affected units until the bart guidelines are finalized as stated by epa the results clearly indicate that the cair will achieve greater reasonable progress than bart as proposed measured by the proposed betterthanbart test at this time we can foresee circumstances under which bart for egus could produce greater visibility improvement than the cair however for the reasons noted in section ixc1 above we are deferring final determination

making this determination epa notes that we are not constraining the discretion of states to determine which sources are subject to bart and to make bart determinations cairaffected states are not required to accept our determination that cair may substitute for bart48 epas justification the proposal by epa to declare cair to be better than bart for individual barteligible elect ric generating units had been strongly hinted in its may 2004 proposed revisions to bart guidelines in that proposal epa included strong statement of suppor t for both employing trading programs to address regional haze and the use of cair as better than bart alternative as stated by epa based on our current evaluation we believe the interstate air quality rule later cair as proposed is clearly better than bart for those affected egus in the affected states which we propose to cover under the iaqr we thus expect that the final iaqr would satisfy the bart requirements for affected egus that are covered pursuant to the final iaqr49 analysis to support this declaration was provided in the june 2004 proposal supplemental rule for the cair tradin g program and in the final cair50 the bush administration uses regional analysis of the visibility improvement resulting from bart and cair to justify exempting barteligible electric generating units from bart and from the requirement that trading rather than installing bart must yield greater reasonable progress the twopart test examined the effects of the two programs on 116 class i areas with respect to potential visibility degradation the analysis concludes that cair emissions reductions in the east produce significantly greater visibility improvements than sourcespecific bart51 on nationwide basis epa states the visibility modeling shows that for all 116 class i areas evaluated the average visibility improvement on the 20 percent worst days in 2015 was 05 dv deciview under the cair capandtrad program in the east and bart in the west but only 02 dv under th nationwide sourcespecific bart approach52 questions this linking of cair to the regional haze rule is based on the programs common characteristic of controlling sulfur dioxide and

questions include the following visibility impacts on class i areas individually and collectively critics contend that epas analysis suggesting that nationwide the average visibility would impr ove more under cairbart program than bart program is inadequate they observe that section 169a discusses bart in terms of visibility impairment of any class i area not an average of all 156 class i areas or the 116 29 in the east class i ar eas epa analyzed for its cair determination epa c ites data limitations for not including other class i areas 5 in the east in its analysis53 with the final bart determination guidelines permitting such an analysis litigation is likely stringency of bart versus cair on an individual egu basis the 95 reduction requirement contained in epas bart guidelines is substantially more stringent than the overall 67 reduction in so2 emissions from future 2015 baseline envisioned in cair however the scope of th two scenarios is different for egus bart is required nationwide on powerplants over 250 million btu thermal input basis operating in 1977 but not more than 15 years old 1962 that may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any class i area cairs model trading program is regional scheme focused on all egus that are greater than 25mw within the 23 state pm25 region54 achieving visibility goals as noted above using an analysis that grafted the cair trading pr ogram onto an individual bart program for the other 25 barteligible categories epa argues that cair is better than bart opponents argue that the analysis is insufficient that 12 deciview improvement will not achieve the caa visibility goal instead oppone nts assert that 79 deciview improvement is necessary to achieve the caas visibility goal of preventing any future and remedying any existing visibility impairment in class i areas achieving such goal will require bart controls on the level of ep as proposed default levels plus controls on additional egus such as required under cair implications the clean air act has evolved over time in response to developing understanding of the environment new t echnologies and changes in the nations transportation energy and i ndustrial sectors the result has been patchwork of requirements that are not always consiste nt and may even be incompatible athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32483crs14 55 for

declined and the number of persons living in areas where pollution exceeds standards has diminished55 from policy standpoint epa has presen ted the clean air interstate rule and the accompanying mercury hg rule as suite of integrated air actions to reduce emissions of three pollutants so2 nox and hg by promulgating guidelines to help states determine ppropriate state emissions budget s for their trading program and to exempt sources subject to the ca ir from the individual bart determinations required by section 169a visibility impairment epa appears to be trying to extend the suite to the visibility protection provisions of the caa in other words epa is endeavoring to transform cair from another layer on the already multilayered cake called the clean air act to an integrative program that simplifies the layers as discussed this effort to meld section 169a visibility and section 109 naaqs implementation strategies ba sed on their common characteristic of controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides raises numerous issues in the clean air act their only procedural link is the si p process but they have different scopes purposes and requirements because of the happenstance that the timing of the pm25 naaqs and the regional haze rules partly coincided epa proposed and congress legislated that the initial implementation schedules of the sip process for the 1997 pm25 naaqs and the sip process for the re gional haze rule be coordinated now epa is linking the two programs by determining that certain cair program provisions can in effect substitu for related but different visibility requirements whether it can do this while accomplishing the express purposes and requirements of both section 109 and section169a is subject to debate and possible litigation by using collective analysis design ed to assist states in determining state emission budgets to justify excluding i ndividual units from undergoing individual stateled bart review epa concludes that the cair program adequately meets visibility requirements conclusion that is contentious indeed opponents of the attempt have described it as regulatory bait and switch56 this conflict is not surprising as epa is attempting to integrate regulatory provisions that are separate in many essential respects it appears the administrations goal is to redirect caa compliance strategies toward marketoriented capandtrade prog ram viewed by many observers as more costeffective approach to pollution control than direct regulation such as the bart program such redirection of compliance

administrations clean air interstate rule and mercury rule are very similar in terms of reduction requirements as clear skies however unlike epas ite of integrated air action clear skies contains significant conforming language to avoid conflicts with other caa provisions such as section 169a the admin istration has stated its preference for clear skies over its re gulatory approach however the congress has yet to move any multipollutant proposal to the floor nor has it given epa broad authority to reconstitute regulatory approaches into marketoriented ones58 epas combining of cair and bart represents regulatory initiative to achieve at least partial step in coordinating regulatory programs under marketoriented approach it is possible however that statutory solution could be necessary
