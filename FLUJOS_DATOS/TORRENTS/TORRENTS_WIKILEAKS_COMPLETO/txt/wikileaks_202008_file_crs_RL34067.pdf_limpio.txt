congressional resolutions that address climat changerelated issues but do not directly call for action on greenhouse gas emissions are likewise not included in this reportclimate change legislation in the 110th congress introduction in the 110th congress members have introduced numerous bills that would directly or indirectly address climate change this report describes and compares bills that directly address climate change as opposed to those that primarily address other issues eg energy efficiency and conservation but could have ancillary impacts on climate1 in some cases it is difficult to draw line between direct and indirect climate change bills because specific bill or action may seek to achieve multiple objectives this report focuses on legislative actions including comprehensive bills with individual climate change titles or sections that explicitly address climate change issues these bills fall into six major categories 1 research on the causes and effects of climate change nd on methods to measure and predict climate change 2 deployment of emissionre ducing technologies in the united states or other countries 3 requirements for us participation in international climate agreements 4 investments in systems to adapt to changes in climate 5 establishment of greenhouse gas ghg monitoring systems as basis for research or for any potential reduction program and 6 implementation of mandatory ghg emission reduction programs these categories are not mutually exclusive and several bills address more than one of the above categories there has been considerable interest in climate change issues in the 110th congress as of the date of this report members have introduced more than 100 bills that would directly address climate change issues congress has enacted six legislation proposals th at address climate ch ange to some degree pl 110140 the president signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 december 19 2007 among other provisions some of which indirectly addr ess ghg emissions this act amends the energy policy act of 2005 to expand the carbon capture research and development program it also directs the department of the interior to

effects nas is to report its findings to congress by october 3 2010 in addition to enacted legislation the house and senate ve passed several bills numerous bills have been reported out of committees these bills address range of climate change topics these topics are discussed briefly below appendix categorizes the bills and enacted legislation by the topics discussed below appendix b provides brief summary of each bills provisions and status in the legislative process climate change research and studies global climate change is complex issue while most scientists agree that the climate is changing in response to ghg emissions uncertainties concerning the causes and effects of climate change remain and are continuing subject of extensive scientific research5 these uncertainties include the potential effects on natural systems as well as effects on social and political systems further research is ongoing regarding technologies that improve efficiency reduce fossil fuel consumption and capture and store carbon dioxide co2 emissions deployment of greenhouse gas reduction technology one approach to addressing climate change is to promote the deployment and diffusion of technologies to reduce ghg emissions such as carbon capture and storage or sequestration within the legislative proposals there are different methods of promoting technology deploy ment one deployment strategy may involve tax incentives for investment in technologies to improve efficiency andor lower emissions other deploy ment strategies would provide grants loans and other incentives for technology transf er to developing countries in the 110th congress some bills deal so lely with technology deployment through tax incentives for lowercarbon tec hnology or grants to develop and deploy carbon capture and sequestration or thr ough requirements that the federal government use technology with lower emi ssions other bills that create mandatory ghg reduction programs also include tec hnology deployment as one componenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34067crs4 6 president clinton did not submit the protocol to the senate for advice and consent because the senate was on record in mid1997

action by states to continuedinternational agreements the united states ratified the unite d nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in 1992 five years later the united states signed the conventions kyoto protocol but it wa s never submitted to the senate for ratification6 in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol and withdrew the united states from subsequent negotiations since that time the united states has entered into other c ooperative agreements including the asia pacific partnership on clean development and climate this partnership focuses on voluntary action by member states to prom ote cleaner technology and related goals however us participation in discussions over binding agreements has been limited adaptation bills some critics of ghg regulation argu that the effects on global ghg concentrations and consequently the effects on climate from any reduction scheme will be limited some therefore contend that investment should focus on preparing communities and systems to adapt to the effects of changing climate this notion is shared by some proponent s of ghg regulation who argue that because of earlier greenhouse gas emissions some vel of warming will occur regardless of mitigation activity those stakeholders s upport adaptation initiatives in concert with mitigation efforts greenhouse gas reporting and registry bills pursuant to the unfccc the united states publishes annual reports on its ghg emissions7 the us environmental protection agency epa reports this information using various techni ques eg fuel analysis for co2 the 2005 emissions estimates indicate that the thr ee dominant sources of ghg emissions are electricity generation 33 trans portation 28 and industry 198 at the national level the 1990 clean ai r act requires most electric utilities to report their ghg emissions but ther is overall national ghg reporting requirement however some states also gather data through voluntary registries or mandatory ghg emissions reporting mechanisms9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34067crs5 9 continued address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 10 president bush has articulated the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions intensity the ratio of ghg emissions to economic output however that goal is voluntary not mandatory 11 for more discussion of the different em ission reduction policy options see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker 12 for detailed informa tion on ghg reduction bills see crs report rl33846 climate change greenhouse gas reduction bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci 13 hybrid of capandtrade and carbon tax schemes would require tradeable emissions permits but establish safety valve price in this case if the market value of permit remains below set price the safety valve the emissions targets will be achieved at low cost if prices rise above the safety valve covered entities can purchase an unlimited number of permits from the government in this way the overall price to covered entities and the economy is limited but specific emission reduction targets may not be reached however such bills have been introduced in the 110th congressgreenhouse gas emi ssion reduction bills the united states has federal ghg reduc tion requirements although there have been proposals to require such reductions10 these proposals include command and control regulations and marketbased techniques to limit emissions marketbased programs typically take as their model the clean air acts acid rain program which employs capandtrade design to control several air pollutants11 capandtrade systems set strict limits on specific emissions from particular group of sources sources may reduce their own emissions or purchase credits ie trade from other sources that have re duced emissions below their individual allotment this flexibility in who makes reductions can lead to lower costs in an efficient market entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs would have an incentive to achieve extra emission reductions because these additional reductions could be sold to entities that face higher emissionreduction costs an entity facing higher costs could purchase allowances that would allow it to emit more than its initial emissions allotment total us emissions may decrease or increase depending on the entities covered the ghgs controlled nd the emissions trading schemes in the 110th congress some bills cover just the electric utility sector while others cover most or all emissions throughout the economy12 another marketbased option is to tablish carbon tax direct tax on ghg emissions or on the fuels that genera emissions when combusted to the extent that emissions reductions can be achieved at costs lower than the tax rate those reductions will be undertaken if missions reductions are more expensive covered entities would opt to pa the tax in this way there is an upper limit to the cost of the control program13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34067crs6 14 for more information on multipollutant bills see crs report rl34018 air quality multipollutant legislati on in the 110th congress by larry parker and john blodgettsectorspecific reduction bills members have introduced several bills in the 110th congress that would control emissions from only the electric utility sector the rationale for such policy is that electricity generation emits the highest percentage of ghgs by sector and th number of covered sources would be relatively small compared to other sector s eg transportation moreover power plants have experience with re porting if not reducing their co2 emissions under the clean air act sectorspecific bills generally fall into two categories 1 bills that would control only ghgs and 2 bills that woul d control both ghgs and other pollutants such as mercury sulfur dioxide and nitrog oxides this latter category of bills is generally referred to as multipollutant legislation14 comprehensive ghg em issions reductions broader approach is to require emission reductions fro m multiple economic sectors several bills in the 110th congress would apply to most or all u s ghg emissions these bills are often described as an economywide ghg reduction approach these bills vary in their coverage some bills cover the most highemitting sectors eg electricity generation industry and transportation while excludi ng other sectors eg residential and commercial other bills grant epa broad
