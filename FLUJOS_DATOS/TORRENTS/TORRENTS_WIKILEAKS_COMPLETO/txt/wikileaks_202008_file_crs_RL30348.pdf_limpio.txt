warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30348ecuadors brady bond default background and implications summary ecuador faces its worst economic crisis since the 1930s suffering from deep recession collapsed currency and failing banking system together these problems led to huge fiscal deficits and increased external borrowing the fiscal shortfall took dramatic turn on september 30 1999 when ecuador decided to default on its brady bonds effectively cutting off ecuador from foreign financial resources this proved to be pivotal decision contributing to the escalating social and political strife that resulted in the forced removal of sitting president in january 2000 brady bonds named for former us treasury secretary nicholas f brady were one answer to the lingering latin american debt crisis they combined partial debt forgiveness with repackaging of the remaining debt into bonds that could then be traded on the securities markets this met debtor country need for reduction of debt and debt service and the commercial banks goal of removing this debt from their balance sheets without having to write off the entire amount ecuador currently has 6 billion of brady debt in bonds with varying provisions some collateralized with us treasury zero coupon bonds held in escrow citing its large budget deficit ecuador gave notice on august 26 1999 that in an attempt to restructur its external debt it would use the 30day grace period provision in its brady bond agreement to defer 98 million payment that had come due on september 30 1999 ecuador missed 445 million interest payment on portion of its brady bonds one month later ecuador defaulted on 27 million eurobond interest payment the brady bond default was calculated move to pay off the noncollateralized debt with the expectation that investors would be amenable to invoking the collateral clause on the discount bonds to cover the missed interest payment thereby giving ecuador more time to restructure its debt portfolio with viable plan to restructure its debt portfolio investors voted instead to invoke the acceleration clause requiring full payment of the brady discount bonds ecuador has been unable to pay these bonds in full leaving the two groups at an impasse for ecuador defaulting on its brady bonds worsened its financial crisis causing creditors to shun requests for debt rescheduling this has forced ecuador into acute budget tightening which may extend an already deep recession and exacerbate attendant social costs in this very poor country new lending to ecuador from either private or official lenders seems unlikely until an officially sanctioned structural adjustment plan is in place although ecuadors brady bond default is relatively small it does have potentially broader implications for the precedent it set the default effectively subordinated brady debt to other international claims raising questions in the international debt markets in addition ecuadors inability to come to terms with either public or private internation lenders escalated its financial hardship and the political and social turmoil that led to the ousting of sitting president in january 2000 it is currently unclear how

crisis was firmly rooted in ecuadors twoyear recession which severely affected all levels of society including the nations large wellorganized indigenous community as mahuads economic policy responses became increasingly less credible social unrest including seizing of the congress and supreme court buildings led the armed forces to call for mahuad to step down critical turning point in ecuadors deepening financial troubles was president mahuads determination on september 30 1999 to default on 445 million brady bond interest payment1 this precedentsetting decision followed month of intensive efforts to reschedule its external debt including request to the international monetary fund imf for 400 million loan later reduced to 250 million as part of plan to address ecuadors deteriorating economic and financial situation mahuads gamble was intended to force debt rescheduling but instead resulted in ecuadors increasing financial isolation and ultimately fullblown financial crisis this report is an update reevaluating ecuadors bond default in light of the massive financial and political turmoil that it helped to spark ecuadors economic situation ecuador faces its worst economic crisis since the 1930s in 1999 gross domestic product gdp fell by 75 unemployment rose to 155 annual inflation reached 600 and the ecuadoran sucre depreciated by over 60 before being pegged to the

collapsed in 199899 and agricultural prices fell as well in large part due to the asian financial crisis ecuadors agricultural sector was also devastated by the effects of an nino weather pattern the decline in export prices caused huge revenue shortfalls for the national government on the expenditure side ecuador faces the high costs of rebuilding its road network and coastal infrastructure

reasons may be difficult for ecuador to achieve given its poor economic condition4 latin americas debt crisis and brady bonds excessive lending by commercial banks poor debt management by debtor countries and dramatic changes in the international economy combined to spawn in 1982 what became known as the latin american debt crisis initial strategies to alleviate the problem involved the imposition of structural adjustment programs on debtor countries and the rescheduling of their debt by increasing lending and lengthening loan maturities eg the baker plan by the late 1980s however it had become clear that this approach had served only to compound the problem the brady plan named for thenus secretary of the treasury nicholas f brady was unveiled in march 1989 as an alternative to address lingering latin american indebtedness the thrust of the brady plan was to combine some level of debt forgiveness with repackaging of the remaining debt into bonds that could then be traded on the securities markets this met debtor country need for reduction of debt and debt service and the commercial banks goal of removing this debt from their balance sheets without having to write off the entire amount the brady plan coordinated the roles and responsibilities of debtor countries international financial institutions imf world bank commercial banks and creditor countries the debtor countries had to take responsibility for enacting meaningful structural reform with an emphasis on policies that would reduce huge fiscal deficits and encourage growth commercial banks were to respond with debt relief and restructuring on terms favorable to the debtor countries the imf and world bank agreed to allocate funds to help reduce the principal of commercial debt and to finance collateral arrangements where needed finally creditor governments which years earlier had come together as an informal group known as the paris club agreed to restructure or reschedule their loans5 the focus of the brady plan however was on reducing sovereign debt to commercial banks and although simple in theory its actual execution was somewhat complicated each debtor country had to negotiate its own deal with the commercial banks through bank advisory committee bac in coordination with the imf and the world bank the commercial loans were then restructured with some amount of principal written down the brady plan took menu approach to debt relief in which debt instruments were available in combinations that suited each individual country case an important part of many agreements was the debt buyback in which the countries were allowed to repurchase portion of their debt at stated discounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30348crs4 6 the world bank world debt tables 199495 volume 1 analysis and summary

reduction the remaining options involved debt restructuring in which commercia l loans were paid off with newly issued bonds there were three basic categories of bond used to refinance loan principal6 1discount bond exchanges commercial bank loans were exchanged for bonds at stated discount with bonds issued at market interest rate goal debt reduction discount bonds had 30year term and grace period with bullet payment meaning that interest is paid periodically eg quarterly with single principal payment at maturity 2par bond exchanges loans were exchanged at face par value for bonds carrying lower interest rates than the original loans goal debt service reduction pars were 30year bullet bonds like discount bonds but the interest rate rather than the principal was reduced 3conversion bonds loans were exchanged at face value for bonds issued at market interest rates and banks were required to provide new money to maintain liquidity in debtor countries goal continue d debt payment without reduction used to cover claims of usually smaller banks unable or unwilling to take any debt writeoffs special arrangements were made for countries that had excessive interest arrears at the time of closing on the brady deal interest arrears were converted into bonds with tighter provisions than those applied to rescheduled principal including 1past due interest bonds pdis interest arrears were combined into single bond issue sold at market interest rate they had 20year term and 10year grace period payment for 10 years and 2interest equali zation ie bonds similar to pdis but with 10year term and grace period issued to ensure that at least some minimal payment on capitalized pastdue interest was made from the outset of the brady deal collateral provisions key brady provision involves the use of collateral to back some of the bonds specifically those bonds that involved debt forgiveness and had long 30 year grace periods and maturities basically the discount and par exchange bonds were partially collateralized often with funds loaned by the imf this was required for bonds issued in currencies other than the us dollar7 principal on the discount and par bonds was collateralized by the debtor country purchasing us treasury zero couponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30348crs5 8 zero coupon bond is sold at discount to its face value having regular interest payment but paying the full face value of the bond at maturity 9 eurobonds are longterm debt instruments denominated in currency other than that of the country in which the instrument is issued 10 institute of international finance inc economic report ecuador 1999 p 11 ecuadors 1994 brady deal was one of the last and involved higher than the more usual 35 discount on the debt 11 one month later ecuador also missed 27 million interest payment on its eurobondsbonds which are held in escrow at the federal reserve bank of new york8 collateral on interest payments works in similar fashion the difference is that the debtor country deposited the equivalent of 1218 months of interest into an interest bearing account or purchased us treasury bills at the federal reserve bank of new york significantly the us government s facilitation of brady deals by issuing treasury debt in this manner does not carry any explicit or implicit guarantee of the brady bonds themselves theoretically in case of default creditors would be able to access the collateral which they would then be able to hold or trade like any other security default provisions are technical but in general once default occurs creditors meet through the bank advisory commit tee to vote on their collective response they have the option to do nothing vote to release the collateral or vote to accelerate payment of the bonds this third alternative would require immediate repayment of the full debt to the creditors at least 25 of bondholders must vote to invoke either the collateral or acceleration clauses ecuadors external debt and brady default ecuadors public external debt amounts to 133 billion as seen in table 2 nearly 6 billion or 44 of the total is in the form of brady bonds the second largest single category is debt owed to the international financial institutions followed by paris club debt governmenttogovernment which also has been in arrears since 1996 eurobonds9 and other debt of the brady debt past due interest is the largest portion 46 par and discount bonds the two bond types incorporating debt relief together amount to 31 billion or 53 of brady debt the discount bonds were issued at 45 discount on the face value of its debt meaning that nearly half of this portion of ecuadors commercial bank debt was written off average annual cost for ecuador to service the brady debt through 2003 is 370 million10 citing its large budget deficit ecuador gave notice on august 26 1999 that in an attempt to restructure its external debt it would use the 30day grace period provision in its brady bond agreement to defer 98 million payment that had come due on september 30 1999 ecuador missed 445 million interest payment on its discount brady bonds but paid off interest due on its pdis11 this appeared to be calculated

restructu re its debt portfolio ecuador instead faced an irate creditor group almost immediately creditors voted to invoke the acceleration clause rather than permit collateral to be drawn to cover

1999 p 11 and banco central ecuador as of september 30 1999 creditors moved forcefully against ecuador for various reasons first there is insufficient collateral to cover large or ongoing default second drawing on the collateral is considered poor precedent effectively allowing it to be used as an additional source of revolving credit at the whim of debtor countries third the bradys already represent debt forgiveness so private creditors argue that they have already met their obligations for debt relief in return for debt forgiveness it was generally understood that brady bonds would be treated as senior debt payable by countries in advance of other debt should financial trouble arise13 fourth debt restructuring is not viewed as feasible until major economic reform program is in place that can address ecuadors massive fiscal shortfall negotiated solutions and the imfs nonresponse oil prices have recovered and agricultural production has improved but ecuadors financial situation remains dire and major reason for the continued social unrest that led to the deposing of president mahuad most analyses of ecuadorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30348crs7 14 business monitor international ltd latin american monitor andean group october 1999 p 10debt position recognize it as unsustainable and view the brady default as unavoidable although ecuador has signed letter of intent with the imf for 400 million stand by credit the request subsequently reduced to 250 million approval will not be forthcoming until detailed economic adjustment plan has been accepted including fiscal tax and banking reform so far ecuadors congress has shown little support for such extensive reform14 big part of the adjustment plan will have to be complete restructuring of ecuado ran external debt with an emphasis on arriving at some type of negotiated solution with private creditors this may take considerable time and effort because renegotiation of brady agreement will require 100 of creditors to acquiesce as they did with the initial agreement in 1994 the current attitude is relatively contentious toward ecuado r because bondholders are foremost concerned with protecting the value of their portfolios which could suffer if investors lose confidence in brady bonds as whole creditor incentive to reschedule debt hinges in part on understanding that the new arrangement increases the probability of repayment creditors reluctance to reschedule ecuadors brady debt rests on the belief that it is direct response to previous defaults and theoretically already had seniority status ecuador is in the difficult position of having clear and certain access to imf funds during time of national financial crisis hinging any resolution of the crisis on privatesector debt renegotiation ecuador cannot pay what it owes so bondholders will have to come to the negotiating table but ecuador is not in sound bargaining position the longer the negotiations take the higher the cost of default may be private capital inflows will likely dry up until some new agreement is arranged to the extent this trend continues ecuadors financial condition will deteriorate further new funds may eventually come but likely with stricter provisions implications of default for ecuador default on its brady bonds likely represen ts longterm hardship since it sharply reduces ecuadors prospects for obtaining new loans perhaps the most painful aspect is the immediate need for severe budget tightening which may extend an already deep recession and exacerbate attendant social costs in this very poor country the economic repercussions will be unpopular adding to the political fallout already visible in the political demonstrations and ousting of president jamil mahuad political showdown between executive and legislative branches over the depth and timing of deep reform measures may well continue under the new administration of president noboa who may have little room to change policy directions given ecuadors lack of financial options new lending to ecuador from private groups seems an unlikely possibility and negotiations over debt restructuring with newlyformed creditor committe havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30348crs8 15 private investors formed the ecuador creditors advisory group inc to act as one official point of contact and ecuador has created creditor committee to coordinate negotiationsbegun but have not moved ahead significantly 15 the alternative is to solicit additional financial resources from either the imf or other official sources such as paris club countries without an officially sanctioned structural adjustment plan in place addressing at minimum the large budget deficit this too is longshot although the actual cost to bondholders of ecuadors default may be relatively small the default does have potentially broader implications for the developing country debt market the face value of ecuadors brady bonds is 6 billion but they trade on the open market at approximately 020 on the dollar or an actual market value of 12 billion tiny portion of emerging market debt the importance of the default however lies in the precedent it sets to date other country has defaulted on its brady bonds but ecuadors restructuring of bradys could affect trading of this class of asset in the secondary market if investors thought that this strategy might spread to much larger debtors such as brazil or mexico to date market reactions have been restrained for at least three reasons first ecuadors poor financial condition has been recognized for some time and so the default was surprise and was already reflected in the lower secondary market value of its bradys second investors for now appear to be distinguishing between country risks rather than lumping all brady bonds into single risk category third the amount of ecuadors debt is small by global standards still investor decisions to shun ecuador has left it without the financial resources it needs to help generate an economic recovery so the decision to give priority to one type of debt over another at this point seems to have worked very poorly for ecuador
