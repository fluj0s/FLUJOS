largest bilateral trade relationship with total merchandise trade exports and imports exceeding 5615 billion in 2007 the uscanadian relationship revolves around the themes of integration and asymmetry integration from successive trade liberalization from the uscanada auto pact of 1965 leading to north american free trade agreement nafta and asymmetry resulting from canadian dependence on the us market and from the disparate size of the two economies the economies of the united states and canada are highly integrated process that has been accelerated by the bilateral uscanada free trade agreement fta of 1988 and the nafta of 1994 both are affluent industrialized economies with similar standards of living and industrial structure however the two economies diverge in size per capita income productivity and net savings canada is the largest singlecountry trading partner of the united states in 2007 total merchandise trade with canada consisted of 3131 billion in imports and 2484 billion in exports however china displaced canada as the largest source for us imports for the first time in 2007 while canada is an important trading partner for the united states the united states is the dominant trade partner for canada and trade is dominant feature of the canadian economy automobiles and auto parts sector which has become highly integrated due to free trade make up the largest sector of traded products canada is also the largest exporter of energy to the united states like the united states the canadian economy is affected by the transformation of china into an economic superpower the united states and canada also have significant stakes in each others economy through foreign direct investment both countries are members of the world trade organization wto and both are partners with mexico in the nafta while most trade is conducted smoothly several disputes remain contentious disputes concerning the 2006 softw ood lumber agreement are under arbitration and agriculture subsidies are being addressed by dispute settlement body at the wto in addition us regulatory proceedings restricted the importation of canadian beef now lifted and the united states has placed canada on its special 301 watch list over intellectual property rights enforcement the terrorist attacks of 2001 focused attention on the uscanadian border several bilateral initiatives have been undertaken to minimize disruption to commerce from added border security the focus on the border has renewed interest in some quarters in greater economic integration either through

of the united states and canada are highly integrated process that has been accelerated by the bilateral uscanada free trade agreement fta of 1989 and the north american free trade agreement nafta of 1994 the two countries are natural trading partners given their geographic proximity and their partial linguistic and cultural similarities because 80 of the canadian population lives within 200 miles of the us border and due to the impediments of canadian geography trade with the united states is often easier and less expensive than canadian interprovincial trade both are affluent industrialized economies with similar though not identical standards of living however the economies of the two countries diverge in numerous ways first the us economy dwarfs that of canada us gross domestic product gdp is nearly 10 times that of canada in nominal terms and nearly 11 times as large in terms of purchasing power parity 1 see table 1 this large and historic disparity has presented opportunities and challenges for canada nafta provides canada with large market for its exports at its doorstep however it has also led to increased import competition for smallscale canadian businesses the canadian economy is also disproportionately impacted by us economic slowdown or changes in the bilateral exchange rate since 2001 the average real gdp growth rates of the united states and canada have been virtually identical canada 26 for canada versus 24 for the us per capita average annual growth rates have shown similar though smaller trend 16 v 14 canadian per capita gdp in terms of ppp has remained relatively constant at around 83 of us per capita income the persistent per capita income gap has proven worrisome to canadian policymakers as it raises questions about canadian productivity and competitiveness see box in terms of sectoral components of gdp the unit ed states and canada are similar over two thirds of both economies are devoted to the services sector although the sector is relatively larger as percentage of gdp in the united states 80 68 the manufacturing sectors composition of gdp has fallen in both countries over time but it is still relatively more important to the canadian economy 3020 agriculture makes up the remaining 25 of the canadian economy and 1 of the us economy in terms of savings and investment canada and the united states have diverged canadas experience with fiscal profligacy in the 1970s and 1980s caused the country to eschew deficit spending in the 1990s parliament consistently has passed balanced budgets since 1997 although government spending swung slightly into deficit in 20023 and canada has lowered its ratio of public debttogdp from 100 of gdp in 1996 to 642 of gdp in 2007 the united states has lower ratio of debttogdp but it has stabilized at around 37 of gdp after trending upwards earlier in the decade 1 purchasing power parity ppp is economic theory which holds that exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when their purchasing power is the same in each of the two c ountries ppp is useful for crosscountry comparisons because its measurement exclude s exchange rate volatility and speculation

ntelligence unit census b ureau b urea u of conomic analysis statistics canada some of the differences between us and canadian economic performance may be traced to the differences in the role and structure of the government in economic life while both countries can be identified as generally freemarket capitalist economies at times canada has adopted more interventionist economic policies prior to the fta with the united states canada protected her smallscale manufacturing enterprises that produced solely for the domestic market with high tariffs while these plants provided jobs to canadi an workers they resulted in higher prices for canadian consumers and led to relatively inefficient allocation of national economic resources canada has also provided its citizens with more generous social safety net including governmentrun national health service canadian citizens pay higher taxes to receive these benefits but private industry is relieved of providing health care coverage different relationship between the canadian federal government and the provinces also affect economic dynamics canadian provinces have relatively more power visavis canadas federal government than that of states with the us government for example natural resources are under the policy control and in many cases ownership of canadian provincial governments in the softwood lumber dispute provincial ownership and management of forests have made the provincial governments key players in the negotiations albertas vast energy reserves may also cause friction between it and other havenot provinces without similar resource endowments the canadian federal government attempts to provide uniform level of services across the provinces by providing equalization payments to poorer provinces however these payments are source of continuous squabbling between the provinces on one side and the federal government

states the value of trade exports imports as percentage of gdp was about 225 in 2007 the comparable figure for canada was 562 canadas goods exports totaled 416 billion in 2007 which represented 294 of canadian gdp and exports to the united states alone represent 221 of canadian gdp further 175 of canadian gdp was used to purchase us goods in 2007 canada imported 381 billion from all destinations 269 of its gdp canada is relatively more exposed to the world economy and to the fortunes of other economies foremost the united states than most other countries autos and auto parts are the top us exports to and second largest imports from canada computer equipment electrical equipment engines turboengines recorded media optical equipment and precision instruments are other major us exports primary us imports from canada outside the automotive sector are energy natural gas petroleum products electricity engines aircraft equipment wood and paper products that the united states and canada trade substantial volumes of the same goods bespeaks the economic integration of the two economies this integration has been assisted by trade liberalization over the past 40 years beginning with the automotive agreement of 1965 which eliminated tariffs on shipments of autos and auto parts between the two countries through the canadau s free trade agreement of 1989 fta and nafta under the fta which was incorporated into nafta bilateral tariffs except for certain agricultural products were phased out ov er 10year period culminating in 1998 the elimination of tariffs and the reduction of nontariff barriers have contributed to the process of specialization as each country is able to produce goods for larger continentwide market thus firms are able to improve productivity through increased economies of scale and coordinated production such specialization led to increased bilateral trade much of it in intermediate the pr oductivity conundrum economists have long noticed tha t

intrafirm trade reflecting the substantial integration of the two economies and contributing to increased efficiency and competitiveness of firms on both sides of the border3 g3g158g157g152g156g561 integration of the us and canadian automotive industries is an example of the benefits of specialization and economies of scale before the mid1960s each countrys industry produced for its own market due largely to tariffs imposed by both countries canadian auto firms mostly subsidiaries of us firms were considerably less productive than their us counterparts because canadian firms produced variety of differentiated products for relatively small domestic market in an industry characterized by economies of scale the automotive agreement of 1965 auto pact between the united states and canada began the process of integration by eliminating tariffs on sh ipments of autos and auto parts between the two countries thus each countrys industry could specialize in smaller number of products and use longer production runs coordinated production on both sides of the border increased significantly as did bilateral automotive trade coordinated automotive production has raised living standards in both the united states and canada and has strengthened the global competitiveness of producers on both sides of the border motor vehicles vehicle parts and engines made up 214 of us exports to canada and 203 of us imports from canada in 2007 see table 2 although vehicles and parts flow in both directions the primary trajectory is that of us parts exported to canada for assembly and vehicles exported back to the united states in 2007 230 million vehicles were imported from canada us auto exports to canada neared 11 million vehicles the same year an increase of 173 from 2003 one notable feature of this trade is the increasing composition of trade in so called new domestic manufactures foreignowned companies with manufacturing and assembly plants in the united states and canada while the value of canadian big 3 exports to the us has declined 32 since 2000 the value of the primarily japanese new domestics has increased by 45 and in 2006 these new domestics made up 315 of canadian imports into the united states the value of canadas imports of usproduced new domestics has also increased by about 13 from 2000 and made up about 21 of the va lue of us vehicle exports to canada in 2006 4 while canada suffers from productivity problems in other sectors of its economy its automotive plants are among the most competitive in north am erica part of the cost advantage traditionally had been due to the weak canadian dollar also known as the loonie due to representation of loon on the c1 coin but that advantage s diminished with the loonies nearly 50 appreciation since 2002 another major competitive advantage is canadas national health system which reportedly relieves canadian automakers of approximately 1400 in costs per vehicle5 3 world trade organization

2006 this follows summer in which the canadian government of prime minister stephen harper enlisted support for the agreement among canadian provinces and among what he called clear majority of the canadian lumber industry 18 the canadian parliament approved legislation implementing the agreement on december 14 2006 the present incarnation of the dispute began when the softwood lumber agreement sla between the united states and canada expired on april 1 2001 this agreement implemented in 1996 set tariff rate quota on exports of softwood lumber to the united states from four canadian provinces at 147 billion board feet per year and set fees for exports in excess of that amount us lumber producers contend that cana dian provinces subsidize their lumber industry by charging less than market value for lumber harvested in the form of stumpage fees and other practices us timber and environmental groups have also expressed concern about canadian forestry management and clearcutting practices and allege that such practices lead to dumping the canadian government has rejected these allegations and has demanded free trade in lumber it has asserted that canadian mills have modernized and are more efficient than us operations the sla ends all antidumping and countervailing duty litigation and return 4 billion of the estimated 5 billion in antidumping and countervailing duties collected since 2002 to the canadian lumber industry the remaining 1 billion was split half went to us lumber companies and the rest was used for joint north american lumber initiatives and other meritorious initiatives such as possible katrina rebuilding efforts the canadian government implemented supply management system for its lumber exports involving export taxes and quotas based on the price of lumber under the agreement if the price of lumber remains above 355thousand board feet quotas or tariffs would be imposed if prices fall below this threshold each province could either choose to pay slidingscale export tax that would increase as the price falls or pa smaller tax along with agreeing to market share limitation based on provinces share of total exports to the united states under the former provincial producers would pay slidingscale export tax of 5 if prices fall below 350 10 if prices fall below 335 and 15 if prices fall below 315 under the hybrid methodology each province has share of the us market thus if the benchmark price falls below 355 each provinces exports would be capped at its share of 34 of the us market with an export tax of 25 its share of 32 of the us market combined with tax of 3 at prices below 335 and its share of 30 of the us market with 5 tax at prices below 315 the agreement lasts for seven years with an option of two year renewal maritime provinces which have private timber ownership and other producers not engaged in the litigation are exempt from the agreement the agreement also provides for surge mechanism if exports from canadian province exceed 110 of its allocated share conversely if third country exports to the united states increase by 20 in two consecutive quarters canadian market share decreases 17

any export taxes collected in that quarter generally proponents of the agreement view it as the best deal that could be obtained by negotiation to proponents the alternative was continuing litigation with its inherent risk and uncertainty to each side through various restrictive mechanisms us producers would be able to avoid free trade in lumber with canada which they maintain continues to subsidize its producers through provincial ownership of crown nds us producers would also able to keep about 10 of the duties collected by the us government despite court of international trade ruling that the byrd amendment did not apply to duties collected from nafta countries see below canadian proponents point out that cana dian producers would get most 80 of their antidumping and countervailing duties back they contend that while trade is still managed proceeds of an export tax would be retained in canada rather than paying antidumping and countervailing duties to the united states proponents in canada also note that unless lumber prices drop below the 355 benchmark there will be restrictions on the us market while prices were above that level around the time the agreement was proposed subsequently lumber prices have fallen dramatically with lumber prices around 270 on the date of implementation october 12 2006 the full 15 export tax will be applied opponents of the deal include consumers of softwood lumber such as us homebuilder and homebuyer groups and canadian opposition parties the former claim that the deal will hurt consumers through higher prices for new homes and materials for renovation canadian opposition leaders attacked the deal as sellout 19 to us lumber interests some claim that the agreement scuttles that nafta dispute settlement

with the united states that canada had not adjusted the trigger surge levels in timely manner disagreeing with canadas contention that the adjustment triggers were intended to take effect on july 1 2007 rather than january 1 of that year however the arbitrators also decided that the western provinces that collect only export taxes did not have to adjust their trigger volumes based on reading of

infrastructure to cope with increased security measures the aging condition and limited capacity of the land border infrastructure preceded the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the ambassador bridge and the detroitwindsor tunnel which together carry 25 of total uscanada crossborder traffic both opened in 1930 the peace bridge linking buffalo ny and niagara ontario was opened in 1927 and is 3 lanes wide approaches to the bridges often city streets have been criticized as inadequate to the commercial needs of the 21st century this issue in turn affects the efficient implementation of security measures the fast system provides for dedicated lanes at land border ports for expedited preclearance however these lanes will not save time if the fast participant cannot access this lane due to congestion or delays at the points of access the spp completed pilot program that attained 25 improvement in border crossing times at the detroitwindsor gateway in december 2005 yet the aging and adequacy of the border infrastructure may affect whether such improvements are sustainable binational partnership to construct additional crossing capacity at the detroitwindsor gateway is engaged in technical and environmental assessments of potential new crossing sites however the opening of new bridge or tunnel capacity is not envisioned before 2013

sparked wideranging debate in canada over its relationship with the united states including the feasibility or desirability of furthering the process of north american integration the extent to which the two economies are integrated was dramatized by the adverse impact that border closings had on trade flows after the terrorist attacks while concerns in the united states over the uscanada border are focused primarily on border security and immigration issues the debate in canada has become much broader encompassing such issues as the nature of sovereignty the desirability and feasibility of further economic integration with the united states and even the adoption of the us dollar this discourse is not unusual in canada questions concerning relations with the united states continually loom large in policy discussions such discussions are unusual in the united states and at this point they are generally confined to the types of security measures described in the preceding section certain aspects of increased cooperation with the united states on border and immigration issues have proved controversial to some canadians these questions generally have taken the form of resistance in some quarters to the notion of harmonization of us and canadian regulations segment of canadian public opinion fears that due to the wide disparity in population and economic power of the two nations harmonization of customs and immigration regulations would inevitably lead to adoption of us standards and implicitly the policies behind them moreover according to this view canadian resistance to this harmonization could imperil the economic relationship with the united states however others contend that canadian and us regulations affecting the border are more similar than different and would be for the most part compatible hence the scope of coordination in certain areas of border management may be acceptably encompassed by mutual recognition of each others regulations others in canada believe the lesson from september 11 is that increased cooperation with the united states is both necessary and inevitable given the reality of canadian trade flows and economic interdependence yet they believe such integration must be managed to assure canada protects its interests and its sovereignty several economic options have received renewed

harmonization to more longterm options including security perimeter customs union common market or monetary union the latter also received attention due to the longterm slide of the canadian dollar up to 2002 however the appreciation of the canadian currency by 30 against the us dollar since has eclipsed such discussions these concepts are not new and they have been discussed in conjunction with deepening the north american free trade agreement consequently these discussions often involve mexico as well nafta plus there has been renewed discussion of ways to enhance cooperation between the three nafta partners the concept of deepening naftanafta plushas taken on added salience in some quarters since most of the gains resulting from tariff reduction of the agreement have been realized in addition ftas negotiated by the united states and canada with other trading partners have diminished the relative advantage of nafta in addition since the 2001 terror attacks there has been perception by some in canada and mexico that continued economic access to the us market is dependent on greater security cooperation with the united states former us ambassador paul cellucci nota bly said in 2003 that security trumps trade in the uscanada relationship 43 this realization has led to many border initiatives described above the security and prosperity partnership spp contains many initiatives that could lead to some measure of regulatory harmonization among the united states canada and mexico in addition to calling for implementation of common border security strategies the spp initiates cooperation in energy the transportation network financial services and standards harmonization ten ministerial working groups were formed and were required to report after 90 days and semiannually thereafter reportedly the scope of spp activity is in the realm of regulatory changes actions that do not require legislative activity 44 the initial report was released on june 27 2005 the prosperity component of the spp intends to enhance competitiveness by developing proposals to streamline regulatory processes among the three partners enhance detection and prevention of counterfeiting and piracy and liberalize rules of origin sectoral initiatives on steel autos energy air transport and ecommerce are also envisioned quality of life cooperative initiatives on pollution agriculture and food supply and health issues were also launched 45 since the initial report the united states and canada have agreed to facilitate the exchange of information on infectious disease outbreaks concluded an open sky agreement and signed memorandum of understanding on pipeline safety in june 2006 the three nations launched north american competiveness council which is made up of business leaders from each nation who will examine proposals and provide recommendations to improve the competitiveness of north american business in global markets security perimeter one approach envisioned by some us and canadian business leaders and policy advocates is to create north american curity perimeter this proposal responds to us fears of terrorism by removing the security functions from the border to the point of first contact of good or person to north america thus the co ntainer landing at the canadian port of halifax headed for the united states would be inspected in halifax not at the us border thereby 43 celluccis message national post march 26 2003 44 nafta ministers to review proposals for integrating economies inside us trade may 13 2005 45 security and prosperity

passengers would also take place at the point of landing not at the border however completely seamless border for goods would also require standards harmonization or acceptance of the inspecting partys standards information sharing on threat assessments and trust in each partys screening procedures it also makes the assumption that there are terrorist threats indigenous to the north american security perimeter customs union another step discussed in policy circles regarding the further integration of the north american economy is the creation of customs union members of customs union commonly eliminate tariffs among themselves and erect common barriers against the rest of the world both the us and canada have already eliminated all tariffs between each other under nafta and have similar though not identical tariff schedules with third countries because all customs duties would be paid at port of entry at the perimeter of the customs union the need for customs agents on the uscanadian land border to collect revenue would be obviated however border agents also enforce immigration sanitary and phytosanitary and environmental laws customs union does not imply harmonization or mutual recognition of each nations regulations thus national presence at the border would continue to be necessary it is also unclear in what form current trade remedy practices could be continued under customs union such actions against third countries could continue relatively easily if both sides found it necessary however actions against each other would require the continued payment of duties at the border common market or economic union deeper integration of the north american economic space would imply some form of common market or economic union common market area would add free movement of labor and capital thus immigration and investment regulations would need to be harmonized or mutually recognized in addition to common tariff policy and free trade in goods and services common market would imply free movement of capital and labor at this point harmonization of certain investment and i mmigration issues would need to be agreed upon type of economic union approaching that of the european union would also require harmonized or mutually recognized standards and regulations and perhaps some supranational institutions although the united states and canada share many developed country level standards this form of integration would still need to be meticulously worked out for example would the united states adopt the metric system to fulfill its obligations to harmonize standards could the two nations adopt common forestry prices and management policies and thereby help resolve the softwood lumber dispute would either nation allow supranational entities to overrule laws passed by congress or parliament these questions illustrate the extent to which north american economic integration would affect the governance of the united states canada and possibly mexico monetary union another discussion recurrent in many canadian policy circles is that of monetary union with the united states this potential goal has been discussed in many forms the canadian dollar could be linked in value to the us dollar canada could adopt the us dollar or new north american currency called the amero by one proponent could replace the us and canadian dollars and perhaps the mexican peso generally talk of monetary union north of the border is strongest during times of relative weakness of the loonie visavis the us dollar the recent strength of the loonie has diminished such discussion although the idea still has some proponents those who support monetary union argue that it would force canada to make the necessary structural adjustments that would make it more competitive with the united states in other words dollarization or currency union would remove the ability to cushion adverse economic conditions through depreciation of the currency by tying the loonie to the us dollar or by

unmistakable commitment to converge with us macroeconomic policy then canada would be able to reap the benefits of us policy which traditionally have been lower inflation lower interest rates and higher levels of growth than canada has experienced in addition the savings in trade transaction costs would be significant for the volume of trade the two nations conduct canadian opponents of monetary union contend that it would lead to an unacceptable loss of political and economic sovereignty monetary policy would be dependent on or tied to actions of the us federal reserve thus the canadian government would be left with fewer levers to combat inflation or fight recession in monetary union in which macroeconomic convergence is reached this point may not be important to opponents of monetary union however the two economies respond differently to events and thus need to utilize different adjustment mechanisms furthermore with population and economy smaller than some federal reserve districts canadas ability to influence us m onetary policy in monetary union likely would be small
