in program enhancements the office of justice programs would have received funding of 22 billion of which 112 million increase would have funded 215 million initiative in 2000 to promote drug testing and treatment for the following programs 10 million in additional funding for total of 50 million for the drug courts program 100 million to establish drug testing and treatment program that would have provided discretionary grants to state and local governments and indian tribes and 21 million in additional funding for total of 651 million for the residential substance abuse treatment program which provides formula grants to states for state and local governments to develop and implement residential substance abuse treatment programs for prisoners crs25 for fy2000 congress approved 13 billion for the drug enforcement agency 343 million is from the crime trust fund and 80 million is derived from the diversion control fund for diversion control activities compared to the administrations request of 14 billion and fy1999 funding of 12 billion congress provided 6 million in fy2000 to augment the caribbean initiative 11 million for domestic counterdrug activities 80 million for the drug diversion control fee account and 21 million for investigative support requirements of dea the senate committee recommendation would have provided 12 billion for the dea for

enforcement teams to address drug threats at the state and local levels 149 million for deas heroin enforcement strategy 275 million to address methamphetamine trafficking production and abuse additional funds for these purposes would also have been provided through the office of justice programs and the deas asset forfeiture account and 175 million for new dea agents and support positions in south and central america and mexico the committee would have provided 893 million for deas drug diversion control program the full amount requested and expected the level of balances in the fee account to fully support the programs in fy2000 funds were provided dea for salaries and expenses because the committee expected federal agencies to provide sufficient personnel to operate the program the house committee recommended 13 billion for dea for fy2000 of which 344 million would have come from the violent crime reduction trust fund for the caribbean initiative the committee recommended 9 million and 30 new agents funding would have included 22 million for program enhancements to address infrastructure needs and 80 million for deas drug diversion control fee account the senatepassed bill s 1217 would have provided 12 billion for the dea the same funding level as recommended by the senate appropriations committee and 165 million less than the president requested for fy2000 the bill passed by the house hr 2670 would have provided 13 billion for the drug enforcement administration based on revised budget submitted by the agency 104 million below the presidents request and 72 million above the current funding level for dojs civil rights division under the legal activities account the administration requested 822 million an increase of 19 over the fy1999 enacted level these funds were to help prosecute hate crime violations deter the victimization of migrant workers and other minorities and combat police misconduct increased resources to fight housing and lending discrimination were provided to the department of housing and urban development it was anticipated that as result of this action additional cases would be referred to doj therefore the president requested 187 million to handle them congress initially approved 494 million for general legal activities for fy2000 148 million is from the crime trust fund while the president requested 577 million fy1999 funding was 475 million of the fy2000 funding for this account 72 million was for the civil rights division of doj president clinton crs26 requested funding increase in fy2000 for this account to fight hate crimes among other actions because the account was not funded at the requested level the president vetoed hr 2670 after the presidents veto congress increased fy2000 funding for this account to 504 million with the civil rights division receiving an increase of 10 million for total appropriation of 822 million the senate committee recommended 485 million for fy2000 for general legal activities of which 185 million comes from the violent crime reduction trust fund this recommendation is 10 million above the fy1999 appropriation and 91 million less than the president requested the committee directed the civil rights division as well as other divisions to redouble efforts in combating hate crimes and domestic terrorism it did not specifically direct how much money should be spent in this effort the house committee recommended 504 million for fy2000 for the general legal activities account of which 148 million would have come from the violent crime reduction trust fund the committee recommended 7 million for the community relations service to provide assistance to communities in resolving disagreements arising form discriminatory practices it did not specifically direct how much money should be spent in the civil rights division the senatepassed bill would have provided 485 million for the general legal activities account compared to the housepassed bill provision of 504 million for general legal activities and the presidents request of 577 million the immigration and naturalization service ins is the principal federal agency charged with enforcing and administering the immigration and nationality act ina from fy1993 to fy1999 congress has increased the ins budget from 15 to nearly 39 billion19 during these years ins staffing has increased from just over 18000 to nearly 31000 funded permanent positions ins now makes up the largest corps of federal civilian employees empowered to make arrests and carry firearms congress approved 43 billion in total fy2000 funding for ins this amount included 30 billion in direct funding that is comprised of 16 billion from the general fund 13 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund and an additional 100 million from the general fund for construction the 30 billion in direct funding is 26 million less than the administrations request but it is 460 million more than the direct funding appropriated last year by congress in addition for fy2000 congress approved 13 billion for ins in offsetting fee receipts while hr 2670 was vetoed largely for reasons unrelated to ins the presidents veto message did address the concern that this bill did not include any funding to reimburse guam and other us territories for the costs of detaining smuggled chinese nationals who were and are being screened by ins for asylum or removal the conference agreement however on the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act hr 3194 did not include earmarked funding for this purpose 19 the 39 billion in fy1999 funding does not include the 96 million congress provided ins from the working capital fund nor does it include an emergency supplemental of 80 million for the mandatory detention of criminal and other removable aliens crs27 previously the housepassed cjs appropriations bill would have provided ins with 43 billion in total funding for fy2000 this amount included direct appropriation of 16 billion from the general fund the house also adopted floor amendment which cut inss direct appropriation by 44 million to increase funding for the legal services corporation other funding for ins included 13 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund 13 billion in fees and an additional line item appropriation of 90 million for construction in report language the house committee earmarked increases of 100 million to hire an additional 1000 border patrol agents and 140 support staff and 200 million for additional detention space on the other hand the senatepassed cjs

intelligence system isis to remotely monitor illegal activities at the border 3 million for law enforcement support centers in louisiana mississippi and south carolina and 15 million for sentri20 dedicated commuter lane at san luis arizona in addition senate appropriation language would have capped the number of ins fulltime equivalent work years at 29784 further during consideration of s 1217 the senate adopted several amendments related to compensation for border patrol agents and linking ins databases with other doj law enforcement databases greater border control and deterrence of illegal immigration continued to be an ongoing issue for congress between fy1993 and fy1999 funding for the border patrol increased from 362 million to 917 million for fy1999 the conference agreement included an earmarked increase of 97 million to hire an additional 1000 agents increasing the total number of funded agent positions to 8947 for fy2000 the administration did not request funding to hire another 1000 agents as mandated in pl 104208 instead the administration interpreted this provision to be an authorization nevertheless there was strong congressional support to increase the border patrol by 1000 agents in fy2000 both house and senate report language included funding earmarks for this purpose conference report language included an earmark of 50 million for this purpose during fy1999 the administration informed congress that only 200 to 400 new agents would be hired due to lack of qualified applicants in strong labor market and high attrition rates among candidates at the border patrol academy at the end of fy1999 there were 8225 border patrol agents who were on duty and deployed as compared to 7856 at that time last year to increase the attractiveness of career as border patrol agent the senate adopted two amendments related to compensation for border patrol agents the first would have provided that any 20 the acronym sentri stands for secure electronic network for travelers rapid inspection crs28 border patrol agent who completes 1year period of service at gs9 grade level and whose current rating on record is fully successful or higher shall be classified as gs11 the second would have authorized the commissioner to provide border patrol agents with language proficiency bonus conference report language included requirement that ins establish an office of border patrol recruitment and retention it also included an authorization to increase pay for nonsupervisory agents who have served for more than one year at the gs9 level if the agency is unable to recruit the required agents by june 1 2000 in addition the senate adopted two amendments to require ins to develop plan to link immigration and law enforcement databases particularly ident with other doj criminalcasetracking databases like ncic national crime information center ident fingerprintbased positive identification system was designed to give the border patrol an increased capability to identify repeat offenders and criminal aliens these amendments were in response to the case of angel maturino resendiz an illegal alien and mexican national who was on the fbis 10 most wanted list in connection with string of homicides resendiz was apprehended while illegally entering the united states by the border patrol yet he was allowed to return voluntarily to mexico the house committee on the other hand directed the agency in report language to suspend further deployment of ident until doj submits report outlining the integration of ident with the interagency fingerprint identification system iafis that was recently incorporated into ncic conference report language included requirement that the attorney general submit plan to integrate the ident and iafis systems to congress by november 1 1999 the senate bill included provision to repeal section 110 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act division c pl 104208 which originally required the attorney general to develop an entryexit control system to track noncitizen arrivals and departures by september 30 1998 last years omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 however amended this provision to extend this deadline to march 30 2001 for land border and sea ports of entry but left the end of fy1998 deadline in place for air ports of entry the conference agreement however included provision to amend or repeal section 110 in recent years ins has come under intense criticism for failing to deport criminal aliens expeditiously at the end of fy1997 the bureau of prisons estimated that 27 of approximately 113000 inmates in federal and federally contracted correctional facilities were noncitizens many of whom are subject to removal proceedings despite increased funding ins officials reported that the agency did not possess the detention capacity to fully comply with statutory mandates set out by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act pl 104132 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act pl 104208 to meet these detention mandates in fy1999 congress provided ins with an 80 million emergency supplemental appropriation for fy199921 both house and senate appropriators expressed strong dissatisfaction with ins for failing to request sufficient 21 for further information on the fy1999 80 million supplemental see supplemental appropriations for fy1999 central america disaster aid middle east peace and other initiatives rl30083 larry nowels crs29 funding to meet these detention mandates the administration submitted an amendment to its fy2000 budget submission which included proposal to remove eligibility restrictions under section 245i of the ina in order to increase funding for criminal alien detention through that provisions penalty fee neither house nor senate bills however included section 245i provision instead for fy2000 conference report language earmarked an increase 200 million for detention as was included originally in house report language rather than the 150 million earmarked in senate report language in spite of increased funding ins continued to experience difficulty in processing immigration and naturalization applications at the end of fy1999 inss total pending caseload was over 4 million including pending naturalization caseload of 136 million for fy2000 senate report language earmarked an additional 96 million from dojs working capital fund for working down large pending caseloads senate report language also earmarked transfer of nearly 50 million from the examinations fee account to the executive office of immigration review eoir which is the doj agency that hears immigrationrelated administrative appeals house report language on the other hand included increased funding for the adjudication of immigrationrelated claims rather house report language noted that over the past 2 years ins was provided with 339 million in enhancements for these purposes as provided in fy1999 the conference agreement included 124 million to fully fund inss naturalization backlog reduction efforts in fy2000 ins restructuring conference report language stressed that lack of resources is longer an acceptable response to inss inability to adequately address its mission responsibilities the conference agreement left in place split in inss direct funding into two accounts the enforcement and border affairs account and citizenship and benefits immigration support and program direction account this split according to conference report language was one step towards establishing clearer lines of accountability at ins meanwhile members of congress and administration officials were engaged in efforts to restructure ins on november 4 1999 the house judiciarys immigration and claims subcommittee amended and approved bill hr 2528 originally introduced by representative harold rogers chairman of the house appropriations commerce justice state and the judiciary subcommittee to dismantle ins by establishing separate service and enforcement bureaus within the department of justice as amended this bill would have also established an office of the associate attorney general for immigration affairs to oversee and supervise the directors of these two bureaus and the executive office for immigration review as well the subcommittee also defeated an amendment to hr 2528 offered by representative jacksonlee which was similar but not identical to her restructuring proposal s 2680 while the senate judiciarys immigration subcommittee held hearing on another ins restructuring proposal s 1563 on september 23 there was further action on this bill for further analysis see crs report rs20279 immigration and naturalization service reorganization and related legislative proposals the government performance and results act gpra requires the department of justice along with other federal agencies to prepare 5year strategic crs30 plan which contains mission statement statement of longrange goals in each of the departments core functions and description of information to be used to assess program performance the doj submitted its strategic plan for 19972002 to congress in september 1997 during the fy1999 budget process the senate appropriations committee commended the assistant attorney general for administration for preparing dojs fy1999 performance plan finding it timely with objective measurable performance goals the committee found the strength of the performance plan in its clear strategies for meeting performance goals doj was urged to follow the recommendations of the general accounting office gao in preparing plan for fiscal year 2000 because the committees recommendations for fiscal year 2000 would be based on the gao model the doj fy2000 summary performance plan describes what the department of justice plans to accomplish in fy2000 consistent with the longterm strategic goals and complements the departments budget request it provides summary statement of themes and priorities of doj for seven core functional areas investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses assistance to tribal state and local

enterprises that are responsible for the supply of illicit drugs in this country reduce the production of illegal drugs in our borders enforce civil rights laws including hate crimes and misconduct by law enforcement and to protect us borders against illegal migration and more effectively remove illegal aliens the senate committee requested that by july 1 1999 doj provide it with information about the agencys experiences resulting from gpra in assessing dojs performance plan for fy2000 gao found that the plan furnishes clear relationships between goals and measure provides goals and measures that are quantifiable and discusses strategies to protect the credibility of its performance data on the other hand gao found that the plan does not adequately identify mutually reinforcing goals and measures among various doj components and does not establish complimentary performance indicators crs31 department of commerce in his fy2000 budget request to congress the president originally requested total funding for the department of commerce and related agencies22 of 91 billion about 39 billion increase or 76 over the 51 billion appropriated by congress for fy1999 with regard to

the additional amount the senate agreed to only the original request of 31 billion for the census bureau about 17 billion below the presidents amended request the house appropriations committee the full house and congress approved about the same level requested by the president 47 billion during the course of debate on fy1998 cjs appropriations congress addressed the bureaus plans to incorporate certain new sample survey results into crs33 the 2000 decennial census24 proponents of sampling maintained that it would reduce overall census costs as well as improve the headcount resulting in more accurate more equitable census opponents raised various questions about sampling in connection with the decennial census which is the basis for reapportioning the house of representatives and redrawing legislative districts within states these questions included whether the plan was legal and constitutional whether it was operationally feasible and whether the proposed sampling methods were flawed25 as agreed to in conference the fy1998 cjs appropriations bill hr 2267s1022 pl 105119 granted 390 million for the decennial census of this amount 27 million was for the census bureau to develop contingency plan in the event sampling is not used in the 2000 decennial census 4 million was for modifications to the census dress rehearsal and 4 million was transferred to the census monitoring board section 209 of pl 105119 retained the provision of the housepassed hr 2267 that any person aggrieved by the use of any statistical method in connection with the decennial census to determine the reapportionment and redistricting population might in civil action obtain declaratory injunctive and any other appropriate relief against the use of such method this section provided for an expedited judicial review of the bureaus proposed statistical methods to determine whether their use in the census for reapportionment and redistricting is forbidden by the constitution and laws of the united states26 the conference report section 210 also established bipartisan eightmember census monitoring board to observe and monitor all aspects of the preparation and implementation of the

census statute 13 usc prohibits sampling for this purpose but did not answer the constitutional question crs34 million which was 466 million above the 390 million appropriated in fy1998 this substantial increase reflected the additional funds needed as the bureau accelerates its preparations for the coming decennial census as approved by congress the bureaus fy1999 funding for census 2000 activities was 1027 billion this figure exceeded the housepassed amount by 75 million and the senatepassed amount as well as the presidents request by 179 million an additional 4 million was provided

another appropriations measure hr 1141 fy1999 emergency supplemental appropriations which became law on may 21 1999 repealed this restriction the administration originally requested 28 billion for 2000 census activities in fy2000 this amount however did not reflect the additional funds that the bureau was expected to request so that it could conduct the census without reliance on sampling to derive the reapportionment population congress expressed concern about the bureaus delay in submitting revised fy2000 budget with detailed justification contingent on congressional receipt of this submission by june 1 1999 hr 1141 provided an additional 449 million to the bureau for census preparations in fy1999 the revised fy2000 budget submission sought another 17 billion for the census in

the senate approved the same funding as the committee the house crs35 appropriations committee approved 495 million for fy2000 and the full house approved the same level the president requested 276 million for the minority business development agency mbda which was about 06 million above the 270 million appropriated for fy1999 the senate appropriations committee recommended level of 276 million

by the 105th in the 106th congress appropriators placed eda programs in jeopardy until the last possible moment in the end pl 106113 reduced the agencys funding by 4 million compared to its fy1999 level the presidents fy2000 budget proposal requested 393 million for eda just about the same funding level under which it operated in fy1999 392 million28 more specifically eda requested 364 million for its economic development assistance programs edap and 29 million for salaries and expenses the full senate following the recommendation of the appropriations committee approved only 2034 million

part of pl 105277 congress transferred 20 million 15 million for fisheries and 5 million for trade from the department of agriculture as well as 694000 in y2k funds to eda for fy1999 thus the agency had total budget authority of 413 million for fy1999 crs36 appropriations from the general fund of this amount 643 million was to be derived from offsetting fee collections based on the then existing statutory fee schedule 102 million from fee increase mandated by pl 105358 the us patent and trademark office reauthorization act and 40 million from prior year unobligated funds however pl 105277

projections for noaapac spending 566 billion as part of the total fy2000 budget request crs40 this funding included 2801 million for the scientific and technical research and services strs account with 49 million for expansion of the baldrige quality program into the health and education arenas 3043 million for industrial technology services its including 1975 million for the advanced technology program which reflects 6 million recission in pl 105277 of deobligated funds from projects that were terminated early and 1068 million for the manufacturing extension partnership mep and 567 million for construction while continued support for the advanced technology program atp has been major funding issue it should be noted that the amount appropriated for fy1999 was 3 more than the previous year after the recission atp provides seed financing matched by private sector investment to businesses or consortia including universities and government laboratories for development of generic technologies that have broad applications across industries opponents of the program cite it as prime example of corporate welfare whereby the federal government invests in applied research activities that they maintain should be conducted by the private sector the administration has defended atp arguing it assists businesses and small manufacturers develop technologies that while crucial to industrial competitiveness would not or could not be developed by the private sector alone for fy2000 the appropriations bill passed by the senate included 15 increase in funding for atp however hr 2670 as passed by the house contained appropriation for atp arguing that the program has not produced body of evidence to overcome those fundamental questions about whether to program should exist in the first place while the advanced technology program was ultimately funded in the version of the bill that became law the support provided 1426 million reflects 28 decrease from fy1999 the presidents fy2000 budget requested 737 million for nist this amount was 15 above the previous year due primarily to proposed changes in support for atp and for construction scientific and technical research and services would have received 2896 million and its would have been funded at 3385 million including 2387 million for the advanced technology program 21 above fy1999 and 998 million for the manufacturing extension partnership financing for construction at the laboratory would have increased 88 to 1068 million allowing for improvements in facilities that are now 30 to 45 years old the major portion of funds were to be used to build the advanced measurement laboratory in s 1217 the senate approved fy2000 appropriations of 742 million for nist 16 increase over the previous year this funding included 288 million for the strs account and 3363 million for its of which 2265 million was for the advanced technology program and 1098 million for the manufacturing extension partnership support for atp would have been 15 above the fy1999 figure while financing for mep would have expanded 3 funding for construction of research facilities would more than double to 1175 million hr 2670 as passed by the house funded nist at 4366 million decrease of 32 from its fy1999 budget and 300 million less than the president requested the major portion of this decrease was due to the absence of support for the advanced technology program the strs account would have received 2801 million the same amount as the previous fiscal year and the total 998 million crs41 appropriated for its would have all been applied to the manufacturing extension partnership with funding for atp construction would be financed at 567 million of which 449 million was for the advanced measurement laboratory the figure for construction was 50 million less than the administrations budget request and 608 million less than the support provided in s 1217 the final version of the bill as enacted into law provides 639 million in fy2000 appropriations for nist fundamentally the same support as the previous year but 13 below the presidents request of this amount 283 million is for the strs account 2474 million is for its including 1426 million for atp 28 below fy1999 funding and 1048 million for mep and 1084 million is for construction the office of the undersecretary for technology and the office of technology policy otp was funded at 95 million by the fy1999 omnibus consolidated appropriations act an increase of almost 12 over the fy1998 figure otp is responsible for civilian technology and competitiveness issues and coordinates the various elements of the administrations technology policy the major portion of the funding increase was for the experimental program to stimulate competitive technology epscot an activity designed to strengthen the technological infrastructure in states that are traditionally underrepresented in federal rd funding for fy2000 the president requested 9 million for this office decrease of 5 over the current fiscal year due for the most part to cessation in funding for the epscot program s 1217 as passed by the senate and hr 2670 as passed by the house would have provided 8 million for otp in fy2000 16 less than the previous year this is the amount provided in the version of the bill that ultimately was signed into law the

figures for ntia include the overall budget for its operations and administration support for the information infrastructure assistance program iiap continued development and construction of public broadcast facilities and support for ntia salaries and expenses for fy2000 the clinton administration has requested an overall budget for ntia of 723 million well above its fy1999 funding of 499 million in addition the administration also asked for advance appropriations of 299 million for fy2001 2003 which congress refused to consider the most significant increase within the ntia budget comes from the administrations request for public broadcast facilities planning and construction for fy2000 the clinton administration has requested 35 million for public broadcast facilities planning and construction well above the 21 million appropriated for this program in fy1999 the clinton administration argues that to successfully convert us broadcast technology from analog to digital

in 1993 pl 10362 107 stat 285 requires that agencies develop strategic plans that contain goals objectives and performance measures for all major programs the strategic plan issued by the department of commerce enunciates three strategic themes theme l build for the future and promote us competitiveness in the global marketplace by strengthening and safeguarding the nations economic infrastructure theme 2 keep america competitive with cutting edge science and technology and world class information base theme 3 provide effective management and stewardship of the nations resources and assets to ensure sustainable economic opportunity as stated by the department the themes within the commerce strategic plan help identify and capitalize on relationships among bureaus and on partnerships with other agencies and external groups the strategic plan supports the concept that strong working relationships will serve to strengthen the effectiveness of the department as whole as well as demonstrate how individual bureaus logically and critically support the core mission of the department the commerce strategic plan provides the framework for strengthening existing relationships among bureaus and with external partners success for commerce programs in the changing technological world and global economy will depend increasingly on alliances with businesses and industry universities state and local governments and international parties for more information on the strategic plans goals objectives and performance measures see the department of commerce budget in brief fiscal year 2000 pp viiix commerce department abolition issue since the beginning of the 104th congress several legislative proposals have been considered that called for the abolition of the department of commerce by eliminating certain departmental functions and allowing others to operate as independent agencies or be transferred to other federal agencies those in congress who have favored the abolition of the department argued that it is an unwieldy conglomeration of marginally related crs43 programs nearly all of which duplicate those performed elsewhere in the federal government the clinton administration on the other hand has strongly opposed abolishing the commerce department arguing that it would result in the needless shuffling of governmental functions while eliminating successful activities that clearly benefit the american people especially in areas that promote economic growth increase the international competitiveness of us firms in global markets and advance us technology none of these proposals passed 104th congress there continued to be some congressional interest in reorganizing or downsizing the department in the 105th congress although interest in abolishing the department was considerably less than in the 104th congress31 bill calling for abolition of the department was introduced by representatives royce and kasich and several other cosponsors hr 2667 on october 9 1997 this bill was referred to the house committee on commerce and two other house committees that have jurisdiction over certain functions of the department very similar version of the proposal was also introduced in the senate by senator abraham and others on october 24 1997 s 1316 this was referred to the senate governmental affairs committee further action was taken on this issue in the current congress similar legislation was introduced by representative royce on july 1 1999hr 2452 the bill was referred to several committees commerce transportation and infrastructure banking and financial services international relations armed services ways and means government reform the judiciary science and resources further action was been taken in the house similar legislation was introduced in the senate the judiciary for fy2000 congress approved 396 billion in total budget authority for the judiciary an 84 increase over 365 billion enacted for fy1999compared with the judiciarys request of 416 billion 141 increase over fy1999 funding the fy2000 amount approved by congress exceeded by 59 million the total judiciary funding approved earlier by the house and by 1456 million the total approved by the senate the budget total approved by congress included an upward adjustment above that approved earlier by the house and senate for lower court operations and services slight decrease in the judiciarys sensitive defender services account accompanied however by small increase in hourly compensation rates to courtappointed defense attorneys in federal criminal cases costofliving increase in the salaries of federal judges significant increase in funding for the supreme courts building improvement program and the authorization of nine new article iii judgeships the first since 1990 31 for information see crs report 95834 proposals to eliminate the us department of commerce an issue overview by edward knight crs44 the unusual decision of housesenate conferees to agree on greater judiciary funding than approved earlier by either chamber followed appeals by the judiciary for funding increases letters from chief justice william h rehnquist and the chairman of the judicial conferences budget committee warned congress of the serious impact both the house and senate versions of the cjs appropriations bill would have on the judiciarys ability to provide services to the public the large disparity between the judiciarys overall budget request for fy2000 and what the house and senate approved in their respective cjs appropriations bills was reflected in the largest judiciary account salaries and expenses for the courts of appeals district courts and other judicial services this account funds the salaries and benefits of judges and supporting personnel and all operating expenses of the us courts of appeals district courts bankruptcy courts and the us court of federal claims the principal issue over this account concerned the funding level needed to maintain essential court operations and services for salaries and expenses of the lower courts the judiciary had requested 325 billion 147 increase over fy1999 funding of 283 billion the senate appropriations committee and then the senate approved 299 billion 45 increase in recommending this amount the senate appropriations committee noted its understanding that up to 839 million in carryover reimbursables and fees would be available to apply to this account the committee observed that the judiciarys request for space and facilities included in the salaries and expenses account represented 21 of the judiciarys fy2000 budget submission the committee credited the judiciary for making efforts to control gsa space rental growth noting however that gsa rental payments continued to consume greater portion of the total funds available to the courts to accommodate this growth the committee said its recommendation adjusts downward the request for court staff32 the judiciary however quickly protested these cuts according to the judiciary the senate provided 211 million less in total funding than required to maintain current services which in the judiciarys view might necessitate in fy2000 nearly 11 reduction in court support staff from that authorized in fy1999 the equivalent of approximately 2300 employees33 as result of these 32 the senate appropriations committee prefaced its funding recommendations for the judiciary by noting serious pressures on the judiciary budget these pressures according to the committee came from steady growth in costs associated with defender services court security gsa rental payments and pay and benefits at time of declining resources accordingly the committee has urged the judiciary to make every effort to contain mandatory costs 33 the judiciary noted that its current services budget request for fy2000 would fund total court support staffing level of 20967 compared with 22557 staff authorized by law 19393 staff funded by the houseapproved bill and 18580 staff funded in the senatepassed bill these court support staffing numbers the judiciary noted did not include judicial officers or judges chambers staff crs45 budget reductions the judiciary warned court operations and services would be severely curtailed34 the house in turn approved 309 billion for salaries and expenses 1168 million below the judiciarys request 2589 million above fy1999 funding and 984 million more than approved by the senate the houseapproved amount the house appropriations committee noted was still short of what the judiciary indicated was required but the amount is sufficient to avoid any involuntary personnel actions and to permit hiring to replace attrition with respect to the remaining shortfall the judiciary historically has been able as the course of the year progresses to identify additional carryover and other resources to enable all critical operations to be funded and that may serve to alleviate any problem the judiciary in its official newsletter the third branch said that the houses proposed funding level would have less negative impact on the courts than would the senates under the house bill it said furloughs of judiciary employees would not be necessary although freeze on filling most vacant positions would still be likely35 however in an august 9 1999 letter to senate majority leader trent lott chief justice william h rehnquist criticized both the senate and house fy2000 appropriations bills the chief justice said that despite its growing workload the judiciary under s 1217 would receive 280 million less than was required to furnish the services it provided in fy1999 such budget cut he said was both unjustified and impractical the house bill hr 1670 according to the chief justice while providing significant increase above the senate would provide 180 million less than required to furnish the services the judiciary provided this year and it also would have noticeable adverse impact on court operations36 another issue regarding the salaries and expenses account for the lower courts concerned funding needed to handle workload increases caused primarily by sharp rise in criminal case filings the senate appropriations committee in its report on 34 itemized as operations or services which could be severely curtailed were these some districts would have difficulty complying with the time requirements of the speedy trial act risking the dismissal of criminal cases fewer civil cases could be processed and case disposition times would be extended creating delays in handling cases probation officers would reduce the amount of time they spend supervising felons released by the bureau of prisons pretrial service officers would need to focus their resources on pretrial investigations and prioritize their supervision of defendants possibly resulting in more criminal activity and increased failuretoappear rates bankruptcy courts would be slower in processing cases and automation initiatives to provide significant future improvements in efficiency to the judiciary would be delayed 35 budget conference expected after august recess the third branch vol 31 august 1999 p 2 36 william h rehnquist chief justice of the united states letter to honorable trent lott majority leader of the senate august 9 1999 copy of the rehnquist letter is available on the internet at wwwuscourtsgov crs46 s 1217 stated that it understood that increases in overall judicial caseloads were largely the result of immigration proceedings the committee said it also was aware that these cases while numerous can be resolved expediently as compared to other criminal filings accordingly the committee requested that the judiciary conduct study of whether the ratio of magistrate judges to us district judges should be changed to meet this pressing demand on the courts ultimately following the housesenate conference congress approved 31 billion for salaries and expensesa 100 increase over fy1999 1224 million over the earlier senateapproved amount and 480 million over the house bill one of the more sensitive parts of the judiciarys budget in recent years has been defender services this account funds the operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations and the compensation reimbursement and expenses of panel attorneys appointed to represent persons under the criminal justice act during consideration of the judiciarys fy1999 budget congressional appropriators had expressed concerns about rising defender services costs subsequently conferees for the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act directed the judiciary to review defender services costs in capital cases federal death penalty and death row appeal cases and report its findings by to congress by september 30 1999 for fy2000 the judiciary requested 4114 million for defender services including 366 million in violent crime reduction program trust funds 50 increase over fy1999 budget authority of 3918 million37 congress however ultimately approved 18 reduction in total fy2000 funding for defender services the total approved 3851 million including 262 million in violent crime reduction trust funds was 27 million less than passed earlier by the house and 312 million more than approved by the senate38 the defender services amount approved by congress includes funding as provided in the house bill for an increase of 5 an hour for incourt and outof court compensation for criminal justice act panel attorneys earlier the senate in its cjs bill as requested by the judiciary39 had provided for 10 increase in panel attorney 37 in its initial budget request the judiciary stated that only 12 of its increased funding requirements for defender services were for program enhancementsspecifically 600000 for startup costs to establish two new federal defender organizations the largest part of this accounts adjustments to base increase 193 million would be associated with an anticipated workload increase of 6200 criminal representations 38 the senate in following the recommendation of its appropriations committee approved 3539 million379 million below fy1999 funding this amount the appropriations committee said reflected refinement of anticipated funding requirements in addition the committee noted its understanding that up to 839 million in carryover reimbursables and fees would be available to apply to this account if necessary the house at the recommendation of its appropriations committee approved fy2000 funding of 3878 million for defender services 39 in its budget request the judiciary noted that in all but 16 judicial districts the pay rates of continued crs47 hourly compensation rateshiking incourt rates to 75 an hour and outofcourt rates to 55 an hour for all judicial districts beginning april 1 2000 according to the judiciary however fy2000 funding approved for defender services by the senate would be insufficient to pay for panel attorneys at this higher rate for the entire fiscal year payments for panel attorneys the judiciary contended would have to be halted in late june 2000 deferring nearly 43 million in payments to these attorneys until fy2001 in that event according to the judiciary significant number of cases might not be able to proceed to trial during fy2000 without violating the sixth amendment rights of persons to an adequate defense in turn compelling the courts to postpone trials or dismiss charges against defendants as noted above congress ultimately approved 312 million more for defender services than did the senate in its earlier cjs bill on another matter involving defender services housesenate conferees stated in their report that they had adopted by reference language in the house appropriations committee report relating to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit40 in response to the judiciarys request congress authorized 34 costof living increase in judges and justices salaries for fy2000 appropriating 96 million for this purpose41 the judiciary had requested salary increase for judicial officers effective january 2000 which it stated was consistent with an expected cost ofliving increase for federal employees the requested salary increase was agreed to by the senate but not by the house in their respective cjs bills42 housesenate 39 continued noncapital attorney rates were limited to 65 and 45 per in and outofcourt hour respectively while in the other 16 districts these rates by law could not exceed 75 per hour the current rates of pay to panel attorneys the judiciary said were much lower than those paid to private counsel by other government agencies which averaged 151 per hour panel attorney rates the judiciary maintained in its budget request are so low they are losing their cost effectiveness 40 in its report the house committee noted that study released in february 1999 confirmed concerns expressed by the committee over the cost of capital habeas corpus representations in the ninth circuit and in particular in california districts the committee also noted that since 1998 the ninth circuit and particularly california had undertaken series of measures designed to reduce costs to ensure continued progress the appropriations committee strongly urged the ninth circuit in consultation with the judicial conference to formulate timetable for reducing costs to within reasonable variation of the national average as well as steps necessary to meet the timetable by the end of the calendar year and it requested biennial report on actual results starting in january of 2000 41 language both authorizing the pay adjustment as well as appropriating 96 million for the cost of the adjustment was provided in section 304 of the judiciarys title of the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act under general provisionsthe judiciary 42 in declining to follow the senates lead on this issue the house appropriations committee in its report stated it had deferred without prejudice the request for language to provide salary adjustment for justices and judges crs48 conferees then approved the senates recommendation making the upward pay adjustment for judges effective january 200043 congress previously had approved pay increases for judges in its fy1998 cjs bill that onetime 23 salary adjustment corresponded with costofliving increase which congress allowed for itself effective january 1998 despite request of the judiciary that it again do so the next year congress declined to include pay adjustment for judges in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act in his 1998 year end report of the federal judiciary chief justice william h rehnquist faulted congress for again denying judges pay raise the fifth such denial he noted in the past 6 years denying costofliving adjustments to top officials he said was regressive approach to compensation and was counterproductive to the common sense goal of encouraging capable individuals to enter the judiciary congress also approved substantial increase in funding for care of the building and grounds of the supreme court80 million for fy2000 this amount was 26 million or 325 above the fy1999 appropriation of 54 million but 147 million below the judiciarys initial fy2000 request of 227 million housesenate conferees noted that the 80 million finally approved was the amount the architect of the capitol currently estimates is required for fiscal year 2000 including building renovations and perimeter security earlier the senate had approved 97 million for this account including 85 million for building improvements and funding for all requested perimeter security enhancements including the replacement of aggregate sidewalks and the restoration of brick walkways the senate appropriations committee had rejected 35 million requested for offsite design and construction instead calling on the court to provide the appropriations committees with space utilization study of the court by february 1 200044 the house for its part had approved much less than the

estimate by the us marshals service of court security requirements and funds court security personnel equipment and perimeter enhancements the judiciary however which had requested 2060 million an 180 increase expressed its unhappiness with the senate amount at that level the judiciary maintained nearly 10 million in planned security enhancements could not be funded causing increased threats to judicial personnel trial participants and the general public45 for its part the house approved 1900 million6 million less than appropriated by the senate and 3 million less than ultimately approved by

senate committee in its june 14 1999 report on s 1217 noted that the sevenmember sentencing commission had been vacant since october 31 1998 that commissioners had been nominated or designated by the president and that meanwhile the carriage of justice has continued unabated in the absence of commissioners the committee recommended that the judiciary reassess the need for the commission and it directed that phaseout plan for the commission be provided before november 31 1999 if commissioners were appointed by october 1 1999 subsequently on june 24 1999 the white house announced full slate of seven nominees to fill the commission at about the same time the commissions interim director warned that the budget cuts contained in s 1217 if enacted would prolong the agencys recovery and result in personnel layoffs on november 10 1999 all seven nominees to the commission received senate confirmation another point at issue in the judiciarys budget was the funding needs of the

senates proposal of 561 million in its report the senate appropriations committee stated that its recommendation of 561 million provided most of the requested base adjustments for this account and reflected refinement of anticipated funding requirements the judiciary however asserted that at the funding level approved in s 1217 the senates cjs bill the ao would be unable to pursue economy and efficiency efforts which benefit the entire judiciary or maintain base services to the court and that the funding initially requested by the judiciary was required for the ao to maintain current

its three most important functions are to guarantee via the 7a general business loan program business loans made by banks and other financial institutions to make longterm lowinterest loans to victims of hurricanes earthquakes and other physical disasters and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government for fy2000 the administration requested total appropriation of 9945 million 7615 million in regular appropriations and 233 million in contingent and emergency appropriations51 this compares to 819 million cjs appropriation for sba for fy1999 including 719 million for regular appropriations and 101 million 50 for additional information on the board see p 33 of this report 51 sbas request includes 200 million in budget authority to fund projected subsidy cost of 165

first glance the 288 million for appears to have provided sba with substantial increase in this account compared to fy1998 it is perhaps worth noting however that more than 50 million included in for fy1999 was not requested by sba and was earmarked for assorted projects in several states the senate appropriations committee recommended total funding for sba of 7256 million for fy2000 decrease of 1862 million from the administrations request the committee did not recommend funding any of the new initiatives requested by the sba noting that the committee believes the agencys existing programs should be able to deliver the services envisioned by implementation of these new initiatives the senate approved slightly lower amount 7206 million the house following the recommendation of the appropriations committee approved slightly higher funding for sba 7345 million this amount was 177 million below the budget request which as noted above included 233 million in contingent emergency appropriations more specifically the house recommended 2455 million for an amount 175 million below the administrations request and 428 million below the amount provided for fy1999 in the end congress

lowincome people in civil noncriminal cases the lsc has been controversial since its inception in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980 there have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake in annual appropriations laws congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of lscfunded grantees such as prohibiting representation in certain types of cases or conducting any lobbying activities for fy2000 the administration again requested 340 million for the lsc the proposal would continue all restrictions on lscfunded activities currently in effect the administration has requested 340 million every year since fy1997 in an effort to partially restore recent cutbacks in funding the administrations fy2000 request for lsc is 40 million higher than the 300 million fy1999 appropriation for the program historically the corporations highest level of funding was 400 million in fy1994 and fy1995 for fy2000 the senate appropriations committee recommended

recommendation also includes existing administrative provisions restricting the activities of lscfunded grantees the house committee also cited its concerns about inaccuracies in the reporting of the number of cases served and closed and directed the lsc to make improvement of the accuracy of the annual data reports submitted to congress top priority during the house floor debate representative serrano offered an amendment to increase the funding for lsc by 109 million to 250 million for fy2000 as amended the funding would include 2426 million for basic program operations 53 million for management and administration of the program and 20 million for the office of the inspector general the house passed the amendment and thereby approved 250 million for lsc for fy2000 this amount is 50 million lower than the fy1999 appropriation and the senate request and 90 million lower than the administrations request the conference committee report on hr 2670 included 300 million for lsc this is identical to the fy1999 appropriation and the administrations fy2000 budget request both the house and the senate approved the conference committee recommendation hr 2670 was vetoed by the president on october 25 1999 in his veto message president clinton stated that adequate funding for legal services is essential to ensuring that all citizens have access to the nations justice system and urged

its 1999 annual case service reports and associated data reports to congress by april 30 2000 provisions restricting the activities of lscfunded grantees such as prohibiting representation in certain types of cases or conducting any lobbying activities are also included in the conference report the 305 million agreed to in the conference report for lsc for fy2000 is 5 million higher than the

discrimination based on race color religion sex national origin or handicapped status the eeocs workload has increased dramatically since the agency first was created under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 as new civil rights laws have been enacted and employees increased awareness of their rights has grown the agencys budget and staffing resources have not been able to keep pace with the substantial increase in case load the congress increased the agencys budget for fy1999 giving it 279 million an increase of 37 million over the fy1998 appropriation the additional funds have helped to speed resolution of large backlog cases and expand the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques for fy2000 the president requested 312 million an increase of 33 million to continue the agencys effort to lower charge inventories reduce excess backlogs in hearings and appeals and facilitate compliance with eeo laws in the private and public sectors the senate appropriations committee approved 279 million for fy2000 this amount was 33 million less than the request and the same as the fy1999 appropriation in the accompanying committee report it was suggested that the eeoc expand its use of alternative dispute resolution techniques funding for fair employment practices agencies requested at 29 million was included in the total amount the senate noted that the agency was to use its anticipated fy1999 carryover funds and any amounts not used for the above purposes to modernize its computer systems the full senate approved the committees recommendation the house appropriations committee followed the senates lead and approved the 279 million amount the house committee noted that funds were requested for employment testers and that the eeoc does not intend to use any fiscal year 2000 appropriations for this purpose the committee said it expected the eeoc to submit spending plan to the committee in accordance with section 605 of this act before december 31 1999 the house approved the same amount recommended by the house committee in this round of sparring over appropriations with the white house congress approved an amount of 279 million in his message vetoing the initial fy2000 cjs appropriation measure the president noted that one factor in his veto decision was that funding for the eeoc was frozen at the fy1999 enacted level an action which he said would undermine the eeocs progress in reducing the backlog of employment discrimination cases following the veto congress raised the eeoc appropriation to 282 million which was the amount in the measure signed by the president commission on civil rights the commission collects and studies information on discrimination or denials of equal protection of the laws it received an appropriation of 89 million for fy1999 the presidents request for fy2000 called for an increase to 11 million the senate committee recommended 89 million 21 million less than the budget request and the same funding as appropriated for fy1999 the senate approved this amount the house appropriations committee also recommended the same amount the house approved the committees recommendation congress approved 89

satellite congress approved 210 million in fy2000 for the commissiona 94 increase over fy1999 resources of 1920 million but 209 million less than the commissions fy2000 request the total funding amount approved by congress consisted of direct appropriation of 242 million and 1858 million in offsetting regulatory fee collectionscompared with direct appropriation of 195 million and 1725 million in regulatory fees enacted for fy1999 before resolving their differences in conference the house and senate had approved 1920 million and 2328 million respectively in total fy2000 funding for the commission52 president clinton in his october 25 1999 veto message on the fy2000 cjs spending bill hr 2670 had found the bills fcc section objectionable on several counts first the president said the bill failed to include proposed provision to clarify current law and protect taxpayer interests in the telecommunications spectrum auction process53 this statement concerned the issue of what kind of legislation if any was appropriate to deal with cblock spectrum that had been auctioned off to bidders who subsequently filed for bankruptcy the clinton administration reportedly regarded revenues from this spectrum as offset for other spending in the federal budget and favored provision to allow the fcc to reclaim spectrum from the bankrupt licensees the president also faulted the bill for denying funds needed by the fcc for investments in technology to better serve the communications industry and for not providing sufficient funds for the continued operations of the fcc ultimately language addressing these presidential concerns was not included in the omnibus budget agreement agreed on by administration and congressional negotiators specifically the agreement signed into law by president clinton on november 29 1999 was without provision sought by the president allowing the 52 the senate approved 2328 million in fy2000 for the commissiona 203 increase over fy1999 resources of 1920 million and 19 million more than the commissions fy2000 request the senates funding measure consisted of direct appropriation of 471 million and 1858 million in offsetting regulatory fee collections compared with direct appropriation of 195 million and 1725 million in regulatory fees enacted for fy1999 for its part the house approved 1920 million in total budget authority for the fcc the same amount as enacted for fy1999 and 389 million less than requested by the commission the house measure hr 2670 provided for direct appropriation of 62 million and 1858 million in offsetting regulatory fees 53 currently the president noted 56 billion of bidofspectrum is tied up in bankruptcy court with very real risk that spectrum licensees will be able to retain spectrum at fraction of its real market value the president requested provision which would maintain the integrity of the fcc auction process while also ensuring speedy deployment of new telecommunications services the final version of hr 2670 approved by both the house and senate was without provision included in the earlier senatepassed cjs bill s 1217 which would have clarified the interests of the fcc in cblock spectrum auctioned off to bidders that were now bankrupt s 1217 provided that for each license or construction permitted issued by the fcc under section 309j8 of the communications act of 1934 for which debt or other monetary obligation were owed to the fcc or to the united states the fcc would be deemed to have perfected first priority security interest in such license or permit and in the proceeds of sale of such license or permit to the extent of the outstanding balance of such debt or other obligation crs59 fcc to reclaim spectrum from bankrupt cblock licensees reports in the telecommunications trade press said that the clinton administration and some senators still regarded reauction legislation as high priority and would push for re auction legislation in 2000 also the funding total of 210 million enacted for the commission was precisely the same amount as in the cjs bill vetoed earlier by the president moreover the final agreement contained new language to provide additional funds requested by the president for fcc investments in technology the housesenate conference report on the cjs bill ultimately agreed to by the president and congress dropped language which conferees earlier prior to the presidents veto of the cjs bill hr 2670 had approved involving fcc regulation of telephone companies accounting methods54 two other fcc provisions approved by the senate in its cjs bill in july 1999 also were not included in the fy2000 funding bill finally approved by congress one provision would have given the fcc the authority to independently operate its headquarters building the other would have called on the fcc to release report regarding the proliferation of new telephone area codes later than december 31 1999 while minimizing any disruptions and costs to consumers and businesses associated with the reports implementation in not including this provision house senate conferees noted that the fcc had issued notice of proposed rulemaking to assist state public utility commissions in their efforts to conserve numbers in specific area codes the conferees stated they expected the fcc to issue final order on area code conservation measures later than march 31 2000 the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act approved by congress also contained major new piece of telecommunications legislation separate from the cjs appropriations billthe intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 199955 earlier in the fy2000 appropriations process the senate appropriations committee expressed its concern with an fcc decision to increase charges on citizens telephone bills for the erate program further the committee maintained that the administration of the erate program by the schools and libraries corporation slc had not been adequately examined and assessed accordingly 54 conferees in their report on hr 2670 hrept 106398 introduced in october 19 1999 congressional record had directed the fcc to report to congress later than november 1 2000 on what if any changes could be made to the uniform system of accounts to minimize regulatory burdens on telephone companies without adversely affecting universal service

regulates large part of the waterborne foreign offshore commerce of the united states the administration requested 153 million for the fmc for fy2000 13 million more than congress appropriated to it in fy1999 the senate appropriations committee and the full senate recommended 142 million the house appropriations committee and the full house recommended the same amount congress approved 142

for enforcing number of federal antitrust and consumer protection laws in the fall of 1998 congress approved total fy1999 appropriation for the agency of 1167 million 1065 million of which was in offsetting fee collections 765 million from the current year and 30 million in prioryear collections resulting in direct appropriation of 102 million for fy2000 the administration requested total appropriation for the ftc of 1334 million this figure was to be derived entirely from premerger filing fees direct appropriation were requested for fy2000 specifically 939 million would have come from offsetting collections derived from fees collected for premerger notification filings under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 and the remaining 399 million would have come from prioryear collections the senate appropriations committee recommended total operating level of 1334 million for fy2000 the same as the administrations request the committee however chose different approach it recommended 93 million be derived from prioryear unobligated fee collections and 144 million from current year offsetting fees but as with the administrations assumptions direct appropriations would have been required the senate approved the committees recommendation the full house following the recommendation of the appropriations committee approved 56 the four general

agencys request and the same as the fy1999 appropriation of this amount 395 million was to be derived from prior year unobligated fee collections and 77 million from current year offsetting fee collections from premerger filing fees under the hartscottrodino act resulting as with the senate bill in net direct appropriation for the agency for fy2000 congress approved total operating level of 125 million for the ftc reduction of 84 million from the agencys fy1999 figure more specifically the 125 million is comprised of 104 million in offsetting fee collections and 21 million in prior year collections resulting in net direct appropriation securities and exchange commission sec the sec administers and enforces federal securities laws in order to protect investors and to maintain fair honest and efficient markets for fy1999 the administration had requested total appropriation of 3411 million for the sec including general fund direct appropriation of 1181 million 205 million from 1999 offsetting fee collections and 18 million from 1998 offsetting fee collections this onetime proposed increase in the general fund direct appropriation according to the administration would enable the commission to accommodate the elimination of appropriated budget authority which provides guaranteed funding level that is later reduced as actual collections are received the administrations suggested approach noted in the previous paragraph generally met with the approval of the house cjs appropriations subcommittee albeit at funding level of 324 million 171 million less than the agency requested the housepassed bill hr 4276 accepted the subcommittees recommendation for total appropriation of 324 million to be comprised of the following components 1 direct appropriation of 23 million for fy1999 2 offsetting fees of 214 million to be collected during fy1999 and 3 offsetting fees of 87 million collected in 1998 the cjs bill s 2260 passed by the senate following the recommendation of the appropriations committee rejected the approach of onetimeonly total direct appropriation the senate bill provided total appropriation for the agency of 3411 million as requested in the presidents fy1999 budget however it provided direct appropriations at all the full 3411 million for the agencys salaries and expenses would be derived from fees collected in fiscal 1999 congress generally adopted in pl 105277 the administrations suggested approach it provided the sec with total appropriation of 330 million including direct appropriation of 23 million 214 million from 1999 offsetting fees and 93 million from fees collected in 199857 for fy2000 the administration requested total funding level of 3608 million 195 million increase over the agencys 1999 funding level of 3413 million this total appropriation includes 230 in offsetting fee collections for the year 2000 and 130 million in 1998 offsetting fee collections 57 the accompanying report stated that the agency will be able to request funding for automation needs from amounts that may be made available separately for year 2000 compliance crs62 the senate appropriations committee recommended 3708 million in total funding for the sec for fy2000 the total appropriation recommended included 1308 million in prioryear collections and 240 million in offsetting fee collections for the year 2000 under these assumptions direct appropriations would be required the senate approved the committees recommendation the house appropriations committee recommended significantly lower amount it called for overall funding of 324 million for the sec for fy2000 decrease of 368 million below the agencys request and the same level provided in fy1999 the overall funding is comprised of the following components 1 an appropriation of fy2000 offsetting fee collections of 193 million and 2 an appropriation of 1998 offsetting fee collections of 130 million the full house approved the committees recommendation the congress approved

gpra requirements as noted earlier in this report the government performance and results act gpra passed by congress in 1993 pl 10362 requires that agencies develop strategic plans that contain goals objectives and performance measures for all major programs in its report on the cjs appropriations bill s 2260 srept 105235 pp 56 the senate appropriations committee made the following evaluation regarding agency compliance with gpra requirements the committee has received number of strategic plans from different organizations receiving appropriated funds within the bill the committee found weaknesses with the fiscal year 1999 performance plans of the departments of commerce and state and the small business administration the committee was especially troubled by the lack of resultsoriented measurable goals in the performance plans the committee is also concerned that the plans did not uniformly display clear linkages between performance goals and the program activities in agencies budget requests also some plans did not sufficiently describe approaches to produce credible performance information the committee considers the full and effective implementation of the results act to be priority for all agencies under its jurisdiction we recognize that implementation will be an interactive process likely to involve several appropriations cycles the committee will consider agencies progress in addressing weaknesses in strategic and annual performance plans in tandem with their funding requests in light of their strategic goals this effort will help determine whether any changes or realignments would facilitate more accurate and informed presentation of budgetary information agencies are encouraged to consult with the committee as they consider such revisions prior to finalizing any requests the plan prepared by the department of justice was given high marks by the committee it stated that the plan was received in timely fashion and contained crs64 objective measurable performance goals the strength of the performance plans was its presentation of reasonably clear strategies for its intended performance goals59 in its report on its version of the cjs bill the house appropriations committee in 1998 noted that performance plans have generally been of mixed utility in considering the fiscal year budget request the committee requests that each agency consult with it early in the process of formulating the budget and performance plan for fy2000 to improve the plans usefulness to the committee when it examines the fy2000 request hrept 105636 p 8 in its report on the fy2000 cjs appropriations the senate appropriations committee stated that it had sent memorandum to all organizations subject to gpra funded within this act it
