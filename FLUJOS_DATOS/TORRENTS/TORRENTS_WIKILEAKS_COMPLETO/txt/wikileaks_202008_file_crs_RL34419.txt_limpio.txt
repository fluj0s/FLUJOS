government and finance division the budget for fiscal year 2009 summary on february 4 2008 president bush sent his fiscal year fy 2009 budget to congress the presidents budget predicted deficit of 407 billion for fy2008 and 410 billion for fy2009 up from 162 billion in fy2007 the congressional budget office cbo estimated the fy2008 deficit would total 396 billion if the presidents proposals were enacted about 39 billion more than the currentlaw baseline cbo projected that the presidents proposals would generate fy2009 deficit of 342 billion tax rebates and business investment incentives enacted in the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 which passed in january will push up the fy2008 deficit by an estimated 152 billion cbo estimated the onbudget deficit which excludes social security surpluses for the presidents budget proposals would reach 592 billion in fy2008 and 525 billion in fy2009 budget and economic estimates issued later in 2008 have been less optimistic in february the administration foresaw steady improvement in federal finances including surplus of 29 billion in fy2013 the last year projected the fy2013 onbudget deficit was projected at 201 billion these projections omitted costs of wars in afghanistan and iraq beyond fy2008 aside from 70 billion supplemental request federal deficits are projected to rise rapidly after fy2020 major administration proposals include extending expiring tax cuts limiting domestic discretionary spending and halting the expanding reach of the alternative minimum tax amt for calendar 2008 but not for later years medicare and medicaid were expected to grow more slowly than in recent years the fy2009 budget also discusses longterm fiscal problems according to longerterm projections from the administration cbo and the government accountability office gao the impending retirement of the baby boom generation and rising health care costs will substantially expand spending on medicare social security and medicaid over the coming decades the longterm growth of outlays if left unchanged or if not offset by new revenues could overwhelm the governments ability to finance its obligations

administrations policy proposals and expectations from fy2008 through fy2013 the documents also discuss longterm fiscal issues facing the nation and provide historical data on previously enacted appropriations past outlays and revenues and other budget items the administration foresees steady improvement of the federal governments fiscal position including surplus of 29 billion in fy2013 the last year projected although the fy2013 onbudget deficit which excludes social security surpluses is projected at 201 billion administration projections omit all costs of wars in afghanistan and iraq

increases in domestic discretionary spending and halting the expanding reach of the alternative minimum tax amt for calendar 2008 but not for later years medicare and medicaid are expected to grow more slowly than in recent years the congressional budget process which includes the annual budget resolution and appropriations bills begins once the administration submits its budget to congress as congress deliberates over the budget the administration often revises its proposals as it interacts with members of congress and as national and international economic conditions change 1 the budget and accounting act of 1921 requires the president to submit budget to congress each year current law 31 usc 1105a requires the president to submit budget earlier than the first monday in january and later than the first monday in february 2 current services baseline estimates and baseline estimates in general provide neutral measure against which to compare proposed policy changes and are not designed to predict likely future budget outcomes in general they project current policy which includes future changes in law over the next 5 to 10 years their construction generally follows instructions provided in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and the congressional control and impoundment act of 1974 crs2 on march 7 2008 the house and senate budget committees reported budget resolutions sconres 70 and hconres 312 the house passed its budget resolution on march 13 by 212 to 207 vote and the senate passed its version in the early hours of march 14 by 51 to 44 vote in each chamber large number of amendments were considered before adoption to budget resolutions both resolutions include oneyear alternative minimum tax amt fix the house agreed to an amended version of sconres 70 on may 14 without objection which laid the groundwork for conference committee the budget conference report hrept 110659 was filed on may 203 the next day the house cleared the way for consideration of the conference agreement by passing hres 1214 on june 4 2008 the senate passed the sconres 70 conference report on 4845 vote and the house passed it the next day

estimates for fy2009 from cbo the administration the office of management and budget omb and congress house and senate budget committees estimated budget totals can vary due to differing underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and techniques as well as differences in policy assumptions minor differences in underlying assumptions which may generate small shortterm discrepancies can produce wide divergences in projected longterm budget paths budget estimates issued by the president cbo congress or by others should be expected to change as new data arrive or as economic conditions change the economic slowdown caused by financial turmoil and rising commodity prices that started in the third quarter of 2007 has continued to affect budget estimates and projections early in 2008 cbo predicted that economic growth would slow in calendar year 2008 and recover in 2009 the presidents budget acknowledged economic challenges but predicted strong growth in both 2008 and 2009 over the course of 2008 the economy weakened according to many measures such as employment although other measures such as economic growth and household consumption did not slow as much as some had expected as result of the deepening of the economic slowdown omb and cbo in summer 2008 adjusted forecasts of revenues downwards and outlays upwards cbos september 2008 baseline estimate for fy2009 revenues 2817 trillion was 97 billion below its january figure 2720 trillion while the september baseline estimate for outlays 3158 trillion was 143 billion above the january

funds disbursed in given time period many budget documents also report spending in terms of budget authority which reflects the amount of money federal agencies are legally allowed to spend budget authority has been compared to funds deposited into checking account which then can be used for federal purposes outlay data are more convenient for assessing the macroeconomic effects of the federal budgets while analysts focusing on specific federal programs typically rely on budget authority figures appropriations legislation is generally framed in terms of budget authority because congress can control the amount of funds made available for specific purposes the timing of federal outlays on the other hand often depends on administrative decisions of federal program officials made within bounds set by congress this report focuses on outlays rather than budget authority in order to highlight broader effects of the federal budget on the economy budget estimates and proposals cbo baseline projections cbos first budget report for the fy2009 budget cycle released in january 2008 contained currentlaw budget baseline and economic projections for fy2008 through fy20184 this report projected fy2009 currentlaw baseline deficit of 198 billion up slightly from the fy2007 deficit of 162 billion this projection however assumed that amt relief would lapse and 4 us congress

current fiscal year estimates and calls totals for future years projections crs4 that the fy2009 costs of wars in iraq and afghanistan would be little less than costs in fy2008 that cbo baseline projection showed surplus of 87 billion emerging in fy2012 that was expected to rise to 223 billion in fy2018 cbo baseline projections are computed using certain assumptions set by law5 these assumptions typically yield higher revenue estimates and projections of slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios that independent forecasters consider likely three key assumptions incorporated in cbo baseline projections are that discretionary spending remains constant in inflationadjusted terms the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 as current law specifies and the patch to the alternative minimum tax amt which currently applies to tax year 2007 would lapse after 2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire according to baseline projections receipts grow substantially the assumption that these tax cuts expire and that growth in discretionary spending is zero in real terms explains most of the declining deficit and the surpluses that emerge over the 10year baseline forecast window nonetheless unless major policy changes are made federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10year forecast window largely because of rapidly growing health care costs and the retirement of the baby boomers cbos january report also included estimated budgetary effects of selected policies on revenues and outlays6 these included estimates of the costs of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent and indexing the amt for inflation to limit its expanding coverage cbo also presented projections based on assumptions that differ from currentlaw baseline assumptions one alternate projection assumed that discretionary appropriations increase at the rate of growth of gross domestic product gdp which leads to faster growth of outlays relative to the baseline another alternative projection assumed that total discretionary appropriations would be frozen at fy2008 levels yielding slower growth in outlays relative to the baseline estimated cost savings for troop reductions are also reported reducing troops deployed to iraq afghanistan and other global war on terror postings to 75000 by fy2013 would reduce outlays including borrowing costs by 250 billion over the fy2009fy2013 period relative to baseline levels in february 2008 cbo issued an update of its economic projections due to new evidence of slower economic activity interest rate cuts and other actions taken by the federal reserve and the economic stimulus package7 the revised estimates showed slightly faster economic growth in fy2008 due to fiscal stimulus measures but slightly slower growth in fy2009 when those measures lapse the cost of the 5 cbos role is set forth in title ii of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177 while the portions of the latter act that affect the baseline expired in september 2006 cbo has not changed how it constructs baseline projections 6 ibid table 15 7 us congress congressional budget office letter to sen kent conrad chairman of the senate budget committee february 15 2008 available at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs 89xxdoc8979econforecast_conradletter11shtml crs5 economic stimulus package and slower economic growth imply increases in federal budget deficits in the shortrun cbo analysis of the presidents budget at the beginning of march 2008 cbo published preliminary analysis of the presidents fy2009 budget8 this analysis included the effects of the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 which was projected to raise the fy2008 budget deficit by 152 billion and the fy2009 deficit by 16 billion in addition forecasts reflected lower interest rates which helped increase projected economic growth rates and reduce borrowing costs cbo estimated smaller shortrun deficits than omb largely due to lower estimates of defense costs on the other hand cbo projected slightly higher deficits in later years administration projections and proposals president bushs fy2009 budget proposed permanent extension of most of the 2001 egtrra and 2003 jgtrra tax cuts as well as extending other expiring tax provisions9 when borrowing costs are included the presidents proposals would raise the deficit by projected 692 billion between fy2009 and fy2013 relative to the baseline and by 27 trillion between fy2009 and fy2017 according to administration estimates10 the administrations proposals according to its own estimates would reduce mandatory spending by 96 billion over 5 years and by 309 billion over 10 years proposed policy changes include both spending reductions and some increases termed augmentations by the administration the budget included cost estimate of 637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for social security the administration estimated its mandatory spending proposals including indirect effects and the outlay effects of tax proposals would yield 5year savings of 59 billion and 10year increase in spending of 359 billion the proposed introduction of personal social security accounts is responsible for most of that projected increase the administrations budget provided limited information for years beyond fy2013 the budget included estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2009 through fy2013 and fy2009 through fy2018 but these projections omitted data for individual post fy2013 years estimates for other components of the budget or for budget totals beyond fy2013 were also omitted the president proposed elimination or major reductions in 151 programs which the administration maintains would save 18 billion of budget authority in fy2009 compared to

proposals in this report are estimated by cbo crs6 mandatory spending programs were also proposed last year when elimination or major reductions were proposed for 141 programs cbo scoring of fy2009 appropriations bills cbo estimates the spending totals for discretionary appropriations legislation according to the specifications of budget legislation process usually known as scoring for each category corresponding to regular appropriations bill cbo estimates new budget authority and outlays for nonemergency and emergency spending along with comparison with 302b allocations11 emergency spending is generally treated differently than nonemergency spending in budget legislation12 projections of federal surplus in fy2012 both the cbo baseline projections and administration forecasts show budget surplus in fy2012 which would be the first surplus since fy2001 independent analysts note these forecasts are based on assumptions chosen for the specific purpose of budgetary scorekeeping rather than on assumptions meant to generate predictions of likely future outcomes13 for example funding for military operations after fy2009 is omitted for budgetary scoring purposes projected future outlays would be far higher were these war costs included in projections these proposals also all assume sharply larger portion of middleincome taxpayers will become subject to the alternative minimum tax amt after calendar 2007 even though in recent years congress and the president have agreed to annual fixes to limit the amts reach assuming that amt fixes lapse boosts estimated tax revenues the presidents budget proposes real growth in discretionary spending over the five years while historically discretionary outlays have been more likely to grow at the same rate as the overall economy issues regarding budget projections budget projections depend on models that reflect assumptions about the structure of the economy expected tax and program changes and how these interact along with other factors that affect the budget changed economic conditions such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation or new spending and tax policies affect budget estimates and projections in addition technical components of the budget models may change as the structure of the economy evolves and as econometric techniques advance budget forecasts unlike most other types of economic forecasts are constructed in order to estimate the incremental costs of policy changes ie scoring in consistent manner if policy changes do occur actual budget outcomes will then 11 for an

and cbo have provided information about how past forecasts have varied from actual results cbo has analyzed the track record of its budget estimates extensively and now routinely includes information about its forecast record of baseline projections in its budget publications14 cbo also provides detailed explanations of why its projections differ from omb projections15 cbo routinely provides breakdown of economic legislative and technical factors responsible for divergences between past forecasts and actual outcomes the fy2009 budget documents contain an omb analysis of the divergence between the administrations february 2006 budget estimates and actual results for fy2007 differences are decomposed into 1 legislative and administrative changes 2 changed economic conditions and 3 technical factors budget estimates depend in part on some stable trends such as population demographics for instance many baby boomers will retire in the next decade leading to higher spending for medicare and social security estimating the growth in these beneficiary populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforward budget estimates also depend on factors that are difficult to predict such as future productivity growth and business cycles some factors that effect federal revenues such as financial market trends can be extremely volatile small changes in economic conditions such as gdp growth can produce large changes in the budget estimates according to cbo estimates persistent 01 decrease in the real gdp growth rate would increase deficit including interest costs by 61 billion cumulatively over 5year period and by 273 billion over 10 years faster gdp growth would decrease deficits16 in addition new government policies also affect budget estimates for example extending military operations in iraq or afghanistan or allowing tax cuts to lapse would also change the budget outlook accuracy and statistical bias in budget forecasts budget projections are inherently uncertain two measures of the quality of economic forecasts are statistical unbiasedness meaning that average forecast errors over time are close to zero and accuracy meaning that forecast errors should be small17 an unbiased forecasting method may be of little use if forecast errors are 14 us congress congressional budget office the uncertainty of budget projections discussion of data and methods march 2006 15 us congress congressional budget office comparing budget and accounting measures of the federal governments fiscal condition december 2006 16 slower economic growth would also reduce budget surplus 17 there may be tradeoff between statistical unbiasedness and accuracy because some statistically biased methods may generate forecasts with greater accuracy also other properties of forecasts may be important such as predicting turning points in economic continued crs8 large on the other hand some forecasting methods may sacrifice unbiasedness in order to gain greater accuracy most forecasters try to produce projections that are both unbiased and accurate as far as possible the presidents fy2009 budget includes measures that can be used to assess the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts18 the accuracy of forecasts generally declines as the forecast window extends to later years because more policy and economic changes can occur in the interim19 omb has analyzed february budget estimates of the deficit since fy1982 and estimated the standard deviation of 70 billion for the current fiscal year and 140 billion for the budget year estimate the standard deviation of administration budget year deficitsurplus estimates for the period fy1994fy2001was 77 billion and 237 billion for the period fy2002 fy200720 the standard deviation for the corresponding fouryearsahead forecast was 284 billion about four times larger omb used its standard deviation estimate to compute upper and lower bounds for deficit projections21 the gap between these upper and lower bounds at the end of fiveyear period was over 11 trillion suggesting that the administrations 29 billion point estimate for the fy2013 surplus like all fiveyearsahead forecasts of fiscal balance is imprecise congressional budget action on march 7 2008 the house and senate budget committees reported budget resolutions sconres 70 and hconres 312 the house passed an

large number of amendments were considered both budget resolutions included oneyear fix for the amt in tax year 2008 the house resolution included reconciliation instructions that would offset the cost of the amt fix while the senate resolution omitted offsets for the amt fix according to media reports the house resolution contained 254 billion more including cap 17 continued trends for

outlays the cbo baseline and discretionary defense spending interpreting cbos projection of future discretionary defense spending requires some background on how those projections are constructed cbos projections of future discretionary defense spending are based on enacted budget authority for discretionary defense programs for the current fiscal year adjusted for inflation the spending in the baseline projection can change significantly during the course of the year because of the enactment date of supplemental appropriations for warrelated activities23 in recent years congress has provided some funding for wars in iraq and afghanistan near the start of the fiscal year but has enacted the majority of the funding later in the year thus the baseline projections prepared by cbo in january and march contain only portion of the funding that may ultimately be provided in that fiscal year those projections will understate expenditures for war if the number of deployed forces and the operational tempo remained unchanged from current levels 23 for example the addition of supplemental defense and other appropriations since the march 2007 cbo baseline projections caused an

fy2008 those cbo projections also show discretionary defense spending rising to 645 billion in fy2013 and to 723 billion in fy2018 discretionary defense spending 40 of gdp in fy2007 would fall to 36 of gdp in fy2013 and to 32 of gdp in fy2018 according to cbo baseline projections alternative defense scenarios cbo has also projected the budgetary effects of reducing the number of troops deployed to iraq and afghanistan and elsewhere in the war on terrorism in the first alternative scenario all but 30000 deployed troops to iraq afghanistan and related operations would be withdrawn by 2010 reducing projected discretionary spending and interest costs relative to the currentlaw baseline by about 425 billion over the period fy2009fy2018 in the second alternative scenario forces would be withdrawn more slowly declining to 75000 troops by 2013 which would add about 225 billion in projected discretionary spending and interest costs over the period fy2009fy2018 relative to the currentlaw baseline as noted above the outlays in the january 2008 baseline were based on an extrapolation of the 868 billion in budget authority provided for warrelated activities in 2008 as of january of that year nondefense discretionary spending cbo projects nondefense discretionary spending will rise from 493 billion in fy2007 to 520 billion in fy2008 to projected 571 billion in fy2013 and to 637

because currentlaw baseline projections are based on the assumption that discretionary spending does not grow in real terms while the economy is projected to continue growing both the cbo and

mandatory spending would be 18 billion below baseline the administrations budget showed net interest payments increasing from 260 billion in fy2009 to 300 billion in fy2009 due to increased federal

projections show outlays falling to 185 of gdp lower than in any year since fy1966 the overall 176 billion increase in outlays from fy2008 to fy2009 is due to many factors including automatic costofliving adjustments in many federal programs growth in populations eligible for program benefits increased spending on military and veterans programs policy changes and higher costs due to inflation of goods and services bought by the federal government spending on defense and security for fy2009 almost all of the increase in discretionary spending comes from what the administration calls security activities which comprise spending for defense homeland security and foreign affairs most of the proposed additional security funding is for the wars in iraq and afghanistan mediumterm projections however show decrease in defense spending mostly due to the omission of postfy2009 war costs national defense spending which omb projects will reach 40 of gdp in fy2009 is projected to

with the first full pay period in january as has been usual in recent years rather than october 1 date reflected in the budget enforcement act bea and that emergency spending is not extended as

estimated spending on the national defense function will total 6037 billion in fy2008 and proposes spending 6707 billion in fy2009 nondefense or nonsecurity discretionary spending the administration

larger reductions in later years the reductions would be achieved by slowing the growth of selected mandatory spending activities such as medicare and medicaid among others the administration estimated that these measures would reduce total mandatory spending from baseline levels over the fiveyear period fy2009fy2013 by 178 billion by comparison mandatory spending over the same period is projected to total over 9 trillion the administrations mandatory spending reductions would thus cut about 2 from mandatory spending over fy2009fy2013 even if those cuts were enacted mandatory spending would remain the largest broad category of federal spending net interest the presidents fy2009 budget showed net interest outlays rising from 244 billion in fy2008 to 260 billion in fy2009 as growing federal debt outweighs the effects of lower interest rates federal debt has grown rapidly in recent years and under the administrations proposals will continue to grow higher debt even with lower interest rates is projected to require higher net interest payments in the future proposed net interest outlays in fy2009 exceed the administrations fy2009 current services baseline estimate by 3

be at the same level as in fy2001 in fy2011 and later years according to cbo projections the presidents spending levels which omit war costs in those years run about 1 of gdp lower than currentlaw baseline projections an alternative cbo estimate incorporates two important assumptions that directly affect outlays first discretionary appropriations grow at the same rate as the overall economy in contrast to the baseline assumption that discretionary spending is constant in real terms second the number of troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan as well as other antiterror activities is assumed to fall to 75000 by fy2013 both of these assumptions increase outlays above the currentlaw baseline projections increasing the deficit or reducing possible future surplus increasing federal debt and subsequent net interest payments the alternative estimate includes these higher net interest payments in addition the alternative estimate for outlays includes the outlay effects of the changes that occur in the alternative estimate for receipts which is described in more detail in the next section these outlay effects for the most part reflect higher net interest payments crs18 figure 2 outlays

administrations current services baseline hbc house budget committee sbc senate budget committee conf conference report hrept 110659 msr mid session review the last few fiscal years have seen unexpectedly rapid growth in receipts in part due to strong economic growth after three years of falling receipts from fy2000 through fy2003 federal receipts grew by 55 from fy2003 to fy2004 by 145 from fy2004 to fy2005 and by 118 from fy2005 to fy2006 receipts according to omb rose from 164 of gdp in fy2004 the lowest level for receipts since fy1959 to 188 of gdp in fy2007 recent indications of slower economic growth are expected to slow the growth of federal receipts at least in the short run corporate tax receipts and capital gains receipts can be especially sensitive to cyclical economic conditions in addition tax provisions of the economic stimulus act of 2008 will temporarily reduce federal revenues share of gdp both cbo and omb estimate that federal revenues as share of gdp will drop in fy2008 and will then gradually rise in the following years administration revenue projections receipts rise in current dollars by 71 179 billion from fy2008 to fy2009 under the administrations fy2009 budget proposal over the fiveyear forecast receipts in nominal terms rise by 907 billion 36 increase over fy2008 crs22 the presidents proposals would extend and make permanent most of the tax cuts slated to expire at the end of calendar 2010 or before tax reductions in the administrations economic stimulus proposals according to omb will push federal receipts as share of gdp to 176 in fy2008 that share is then projected to rise to 188 in fy2013 excise and other receipts were both less than 1 of gdp for all years shown the administration projects that corporate income taxes which rose to 27 of gdp in fy2006 and fy2007 will decline slowly to 21 of gdp in fy2013 social insurance receipts at 64 of gdp in fy2008 remain stable through fy2013 the administration projects that individual income taxes having fallen from 103 of gdp in fy2000 to 70 of gdp in fy2004 will rise to 94 of gdp in fy2013 about 1 of gdp below their fy2000 level administration revenue proposals the administration estimated that making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by 635 billion from baseline levels between fy2009 and fy2013 and by 2076 billion between fy2008 and fy201735 administration revenue proposals apart from proposals incorporated in the administration baseline would reduce receipts by an estimated 228 billion in the first 5 years and by 233 billion over 10 years the budget also proposes oneyear fix to limit expansion of the amts coverage through calendar 2008 at an estimated cost of 467 billion the amt will cover rapidly growing proportion of middleclass taxpayers unless sequence of temporary amt fixes or permanent change in the amts structure is enacted36 fix for subsequent years was proposed although congress has passed and the president has signed amt fixes each year in recent years cbo estimates that indexing amt thresholds for inflation would cost on average 724 billion year over the next 10 years plus another 189 billion in debt financing costs although the presidents budget called for limiting the growing reach of the amt it omitted estimates of the fiveyear cost of such fix omitting these estimates in effect increases the administrations postfy2009 estimates of federal receipts substantially above what they would be with an amt fix as shares of gdp total receipts in the presidents budget are expected to remain near their 40year fy1966fy2007 average of 183 throughout the fiveyear budget horizon cbos baseline revenue estimates revised march 2008 which exclude the extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts

teefy crs23 cbo revenue projections the march 2008 cbo preliminary analysis of the presidents fy2009 policy proposals projected slightly lower revenues in fy2008 than the presidents budget in part because the cbo estimate reflected recent fiscal stimulus legislation in later years cbo revenue estimates of the administrations budget were very close to or slightly above omb projections37 cbo baseline revenue estimates released in march 2008 were lower than january estimates in large part due to the passage of the economic stimulus act of 2008 to lesser extent baseline revenue projections changed due to changing economic conditions cbo baseline revenue projections show receipts rising once the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire rising from 186 of gdp in fy2010 to 200 of gdp in fy2012 cbo also calculated revenue estimates and projections using alternative policy assumptions the alternative estimate assumes the extensions of all expiring tax cuts an annual adjustment to the amt to halt its expanding coverage and the interaction effect of the extensions and the amt amt reform would interact with the extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts producing greater revenue losses than the two changes separately these alternative policies according to cbo estimates would produce slower growth in receipts both in dollars and as shares of gdp compared to cbos currentlaw baseline table 5 summarizes cbo estimates of the fiveyear costs of selected revenue policies if the costs of permanently extending the egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts which the administration has proposed were included in the baseline projected future deficit would be larger by 692 billion aside from financing costs over the fiveyear period fy2009fy201338 similarly indexing the amt for inflation which congress has done on temporary basis in recent years would raise the five year deficit projection by 313 billion the costs of indexing the amt and of extending egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts interact in important ways39 costs of the egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts would be much larger if the amt did not cover as many households 37 cbos reestimates allow comparison of the cbo baseline and the administration proposals because both are derived from the same underlying economic and budget estimating assumptions only the policy assumptions differ 38 if there were surpluses after the jgtrra and egtrra extension they would either be smaller or would become deficits 39 see crs report rs21817 the alternative minimum tax amt income entry points and take back effects by steven maguire crs24 table 5 estimated costs of

policies that cause federal spending to exceed federal receipts deficits increase government debt held by the public generally increasing net interest payments surpluses occur when federal receipts exceed outlays which reduces federal debt held by the public40 this can in turn reduce net interest payments many economists believe that running surpluses when economic growth is strong and deficits when the economy is weak helps dampen macroeconomic fluctuations the federal government last ran surplus in fy2001 which amounted to 128 billion or 13 of gdp longterm cbo and omb projections both show substantial increases in budget deficits in the years after fy2020 these deficits result from projected gap between rising federal outlays and revenues the growth of health care spending as well as

administration deficit projections the presidents february budget estimated the fy2008 deficit at 410 billion 16 of gdp and small surplus of 29 billion in fy2013 the administrations current service baseline estimates which assume policy changes showed surpluses appearing in fy2010 two years earlier than the budget reaches surplus the dramatic increase in the fy2008 and fy2009 deficits compared to the fy2007 deficit is largely due to fiscal stimulus measures enacted to respond to weakening economic conditions higher military spending and various legislative changes reaching the budgets deficit reduction goals during the next five years according to the administration requires strict limits on the growth in total discretionary spending and slower growth of entitlement spending some of the presidents proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts requiring larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget since the administration has opposed using tax increases to reduce the deficit41 if war costs which are omitted for postfy2009 years in the presidents budget continue at high levels deficit reduction efforts will face additional challenges cbo deficit projections cbo by law must use assumptions for currentlaw baseline projections that some analysts consider optimistic baseline revenue projections assume that temporary fixes to halt the expanding coverage of the amt expire at the end of 2008 as current law specifies and that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 these assumptions boost revenues considerably compared to restricting amt expansion and extending the tax cuts baseline outlay projections assume that discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation which is at slower rate than it has grown recently and that mandatory spending grows with eligible populations and costofliving adjustments some projections based on alternative assumptions depict more pessimistic fiscal outlook than the path of shrinking deficits and future surpluses indicated by cbo currentlaw baseline projections42 march 2008 baseline projections in march 2008 cbo released revised currentlaw baseline projections which

fy2013 and 202 billion surplus in fy2018 cbo currentlaw baseline projections showed the federal deficit falling after fy2010 both in dollar terms and as percentage of gdp through the end of the budget window in fy2018 surpluses were projected to appear from fy2012 through fy2017 41 the administrations current services baseline estimate which assumes current policy projects smaller deficits than the presidents proposed budget the cumulative fiveyear deficit would be smaller without the presidents proposed policy changes than with them 42 see auerbach furman and gale 2007 referenced at footnote 13 crs29 the march 2008 cbo analysis estimated that the presidents budget proposals would lead to fy2008 deficit of 396 billion 39 billion above the baseline level the cbo also projected that the presidents budget would generate fy2009 deficit of 342 billion well above the revised baseline projection of 207 billion fy2009 deficit september 2008 baseline projections in september 2008 cbo released updated budget and economic projections the projected deficit for fy2008 rose to 407 billion and 438 billion for fy2009 if congress passes an amt patch as it has in previous years projected revenues would fall and projected deficits would rise the september 2008 projections also do not reflect any costs that may occur as result of the deprivatization of fannie mae and freddie mac onbudget deficits the total federal deficit or surplus is the sum of the offbudget and onbudget deficits or surpluses the us postal service net profits or losses and social security revenues net of beneficiary payments are by law considered offbudget entities since fy1985 social security surpluses have led to growing offbudget surpluses which has reduced the size of the total deficit table 7

conf conference report hrept 110659 msr mid session review crs30 the longer run omb cbo and gao agree that over longer time period one beginning in this decade and lasting far into the century the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable the nations aging population combined with rising costs per beneficiary for health care that seem likely to continue rising faster than per capita gdp raises spending in federal programs for the elderly to such an extent that the government faces constantly rising deficits and compounding federal debt burden cbo has concluded that under any plausible scenario the federal budget is on an unsustainable path43 keeping future federal outlays at 20 of gdp approximately its current share and leaving fiscal policies unchanged according to cbo projections would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for medicare social security and medicaid former cbo acting director stated that by 2030 spending for those programs medicare social security and medicaid is projected to reach roughly 15 percent of gdp if that increase happened the rest of the budget would have to be cut by more than half to keep overall spending close to 20 of gdp44 cbo report on the longterm fiscal outlook concluded that over the next halfcentury the united states will confront the challenge of conducting its fiscal policy in the face of the retirement of the babyboom generation under current policies the aging of the population is likely to combine with rapidly rising health care costs to create an evergrowing demand for resources to finance federal spending for mandatory programs such as medicare medicaid and social security attaining fiscal stability in the coming decades will probably require substantial reductions in the projected growth of spending and perhaps also sizable increase in taxes as share of the economy45 the administration indicated similar concerns about the outlook for the budget over the long term in the presidents fy2009 budget the current structure of the federal governments major entitlement programs will place growing and unsustainable burden on the budget in the longterm by 2050 spending on these three entitlement programs social security medicare and medicaid is projected to be more than 15 percent of gdp or 43 us congress government accountability office the nations longterm fiscal

spending on all other programs combined excluding interest on the public debt46 the social security medicare and medicaid programs present different challenges to the longterm fiscal position of the federal government estimates of the longterm fiscal gap between social security oasdi outlays and social security revenues as proportion of longterm gdp are generally much smaller than estimates of the longterm fiscal gap between medicare hi part b and part d outlays and revenues47 these longterm estimates of fiscal imbalances are especially sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding productivity growth and interest rates some analysts willing to make more felicitous assumptions about productivity growth present more optimistic longterm outlook for social security48 spending projections for medicare and medicaid are sensitive to changes in medical inflation in past years many projections that medical inflation would slow have turned out to be overly optimistic49 unexpected events such as the hurricanes in 2005 or an economic downturn can change the shortterm budget outlook the interplay of policy demographics and medical care costs however will in large part determine the longterm budget outlook the retirement of the baby boom generation which will rapidly expand the population eligible for federal programs serving the elderly along with continuing increases in health care costs will put enormous pressure on the federal budget without policy changes these programs could overwhelm the rest of the budget not only will the programs themselves be stressed but their growth could easily limit the governments flexibility in meeting its obligations or new needs as well as overwhelm the economys ability to provide the resources needed for the expanded programs 46 office of management and budget budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2008 february 2007 p 16 47 for detailed discussion of longterm projections see crs report
