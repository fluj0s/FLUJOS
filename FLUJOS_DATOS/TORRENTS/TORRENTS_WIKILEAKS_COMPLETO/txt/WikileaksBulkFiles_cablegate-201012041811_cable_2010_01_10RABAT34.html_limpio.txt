jackson for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary moroccan director general for studies and documentation dged mansouri met with president compaore guinean general konate and guinean captain dadis camara in ouagadougou on january 18 according to senior moroccan mfa official mansouri assured compoare that the gom appreciated his efforts to mediate the crisis in guinea and asked him to take softer stance toward konate as the leader of the guinea transition to konate he offered moroccan political and material support for the transition and to dadis mansouri promised continued moroccan medical assistance throughout his convalescence but also strongly dissuaded him from returning to rabat looking to next steps the gom urged the usg not to rush the international criminal courts investigation noting that while morocco does not condone impunity for the crimes that occurred in conakry it also fears that an early icc warrant for dadis camaras arrest could destabilize the guinea transition end summary 2 c on january 18 ambassador nasser bourita director general for multilateral relations and chief of staff to foreign minister taieb fassi fihri offered dcm and polcouns readout of moroccan director of external intelligence and national security advisor equivalent mohammed yassine mansouris trip to ouagadougou during his january 18 visit mansouri met separately with burkinabe president blaise compaore guinean general sekouba konate and captian moussa dadis camara moroccos messages in ouagadougou 3 c mansouri delivered three separate messages to each of his interlocutors bourita told us first he sought to reassure compaore that rabat greatly appreciated his personal efforts to mediate the guinea crisis his close coordination with morocco and burkina fasos willingness to receive dadis alluding to the moroccan mfas bitterness over its perception that compaore may have torpedoed french moroccan and us efforts to find an african country to accept dadis for resettlement and apparent burkinabe anger at rabats abrupt decision to send him by medical plane to ouagadougou ref bourita said that mansouri also calmed the waters with compaore and secured agreement for continued future cooperation finally mansouri urged compaore to reflect bit on his initial distrust of konate and to realize that given the circumstances and poor alternatives he was not necessarily bad choice to lead the guinean transition 4 c in discussions with konate mansouri assured him that the gom fully supported his efforts to lead the transition and brainstormed with him as to what moroccos most effective roles might be bourita reported mansouri noted that morocco would be willing to offer materiel funding and observers for elections economic and development assistance to build water electricity and other infrastructure and in coordination with the us and france assistance in rehabilitating and modernizing the armed forces 5 c as for dadis mansouri promised that moroccan physicians would be with him throughout his convalescence in ouagadougou and that during that time the gom would continue allow his wife and children who remain in rabat to stay at moroccos expense dadis suggested that he wished to return to morocco bourita said however mansouri strongly dissuaded him the gom would send as many medical personnel rabat 00000034 0022 of 002 as necessary to burkina faso bourita added but it would not accept dadis return since dadis cannot come to rabat rabat will go to dadis he said with smile dont rush the icc 6 c looking forward bourita warmly welcomed the opportunity for morocco to continue working closely with the us and france on guineas transition the gom likewise welcomed the iccs eventual investigation and likely issuance of an arrest order for dadis however he cautioned the gom did not wish to see the icc process result in additional instability in guinea camara is unstable and therefore dangerous he said for this reason france and the us should take care not to rush the icc process morocco does not support or accept impunity for dadis bourita emphasized but france the us morocco and their african partners need to move at rate that is in harmony with one another and that does not disturb the process he added that in addition to mansouris message to this effect in ouagadougou the mfa was reiterating it to france gabon and nigeria among others finally bourita said that the gom looked forward to receiving an invitation from the african union to attend the international contact group on guineas january 26 meeting in addis ababa
