annual congressional budget resolution for fy2000 hconres 68 see related legislative activity page 43 sets the aggregate discretionary spending limit for the annual appropriations total known as the 302a allocation from this allocation the house and senate appropriations committees allocate funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 appropriations bills known as the 302b allocations the 302b allocations can and do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriation bills progress toward final enactment current 302b allocations for the fy2000 lhhsed appropriations bill from the house and senate appropriations committees are shown in table 2 the comparable 302b amounts for fy1999 enacted and the fy2000 budget are the current year discretionary amounts 833 billion and 916 billion respectively as shown in the table the current house limit for fy2000 is 758 billion decrease of 90 and the senate amount is 842 billion 11 increase discussion in the media concerning these proposed amounts suggests that legislative difficulties over the depth of some of the proposed allocation reductions as well attempts to find methods to increase the ceilings may make the lhhsed bill

billion for the senate the fy1999 lhhsed appropriations provided an increase compared to fy1998 appropriations of 49 billion in advance appropriations typically advance appropriations are not scored in the current fiscal year but sometimes this additional amount has been added to the regular fy1999 appropriations for lhhsed programs thereby increasing the fy1999 base by 49 billion table 3

floyd and other hurricanes and associated flooding that occurred in the eastern us during august and september 1999 key issues the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the 13 regular appropriation bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related non funding issues such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion aggregate funding levels the lhhsed bill provides most of the discretionary funds for three federal departments and several related agencies including the social security administration ssa of the 13 annual appropriation bills the lhhsed bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for all domestic programs the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds for all federal programs for fy1999 the lhhsed bill accounted for 847 billion 147 and the defense bill accounted for 2550 billion 443 of the estimated 5750

permit federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest the fy1998 lhhsed appropriations act pl 10578 extended the hyde provisions to prohibit the use of federal funds to buy managed care packages that include abortion coverage except in the cases of rape incest or life endangerment for fy1999 the fy1998 hyde amendment provisions were continued along with clarification to ensure that the hyde amendment applies to all trust fund programs namely medicare funded by the fy1999 lhhsed appropriations act pl 105277 as well as an assurance that medicare choice plans are not required to

forward funding and advance appropriations many of the larger ed programs have either authorization or appropria tion provisions that allow funding flexibility for school program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive funding through appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the appropriations and remain available through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2000 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on july 1 2000 and will remain available for 15month period until september 30 2001 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiyear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants however aggregate program costs for individual students applying for assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2000 appropriation supports the 20002001 academic year unlike forward funded programs howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30203crs33 6 for additional information on budget enforcement procedures see crs report 98720 manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schickthe funds remain available for obligation for 2 full fiscal years thus if cost estimates turn out to be too low funds may be borrowed from the following years appropriations or conversely if the estimates are too high the surplus may be obligated during the following year an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriations are provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriations act was enacted in the case of fy2000 appropriations funds would normally become available october 1 1999 under regular funding provisions but would not become available until july 1 2000 under the forward funding provisions discussed above however if the july 1 2000 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by 3 months until october 1 2000 the appropriation would be classified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in the next fiscal year fy2001 for title i basic grants to leas the fy1998 appropriation of 62 billion was split 48 billion of forward funding and 14 billion as an advance appropriation for fy1999 65 billion was split so that 15 billion was for forward funding and 50 billion was an advance appropriation the fy2000 appropriation under pl 106113 is 67 billion for title i basic grants to leas with forward funding of 17 billion plus an advance appropriation of 50 billion in forward funding for an overall increase of 02 billion what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the 3month delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for standard school year occur after october 1 at the appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence 3month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for part or all of the annual appropriations for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations6 for additional reading crs issue briefs crs issue brief ib10029 education for the disadvantaged esea title i

funds and 2086 billion in mandatory funds the lhhsed appropriations committees generally have effective control only over the discretionary funds which currently constitute approximately 47 of the aggregate budget authority for all federal departments and agencies and 95 of the total budget authority for lhhsed departments and agencies14 what accountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30203crs48 14 continued these targets typically appropriation committees develop proposals to meet discretionary spending levels through appropriation bills likewise authorizing committees develop proposals to meet mandatory spending levels these proposals are often reported by separate authorizing committees and combined into single omnibus reconciliation bill 15 the social security administration ssa was separated from dhhs and established as an independent federal agency on march 31 1995 within the lhhsed bill however the ssa merely was transferred from dhhs to the status of related agency the operation of the social security trust funds is considered offbudget of the 8728 billion total for lhhsed departments and agencies in fy1999 the ssa accounted for 4212 billion or 483 of the total the ssa amount represents 411 billion for designated onbudget activities and 3801 billion for offbudget activitiesfor the remaining lhhsed funds the remaining 905 that are either non discretionary or are otherwise funded outside of the lhhsed appropriation bill first some dol dhhs and ed programs receive automatic funding without congressional intervention in the annual appropriations process these programs receive funds from permanent appropriations and trust funds instead this process accounts for the difference between the lhhsed bill total of 2919 billion and the agency total of 8728 billion in fy1999 the major programs in this group include unemployment compensation medicare railroad retirement temporary assistance for needy families tanf the welfare reform program student loans state childrens health insurance program and social security benefits15 second mandatory programs account for the difference between the lhhsed total of 2919 billion and the subtotal of 833 billion for discretionary funds in fy1999 although annual appropriations are made for these programs in general the amounts provided must be sufficient to cover program obligations and entitlements to beneficiaries for these programs as well as the programs funded through trust funds and permanent authorities most changes in funding levels are made through amendme nts to authorizing legislation rather than through appropriation bills federal administrative costs for these programs typically are subject to annual discretionary appropriations however these programs include supplemental security income black lung payments and the social services block grant as well as general nonearmarked fund support for medicare and medicaid finally few dhhs programs are funded in other appropriations bills the food and drug administration is funded by agriculture appropriations the indian health service is funded in the interior bill the office of consumer affairs is funded in the veterans affairs and housing and urban development vahud appropriations bill in addition the corporation for national and community service cncs one of the related agencies programs receives funds from both the lhhsed bill for programs authorized under the domestic volunteer service act of 1973 and b the vahud bill for americorps and other programs authorized by the national community service act
