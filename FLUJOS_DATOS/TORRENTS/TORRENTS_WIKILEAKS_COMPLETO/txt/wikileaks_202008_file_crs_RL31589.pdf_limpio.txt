for india and pakistan summary since india and pakistan tested nucl ear weapons in 1998 there has been debate on whether the united states shoul d provide assistance in making those weapons safer and more secure in the wake of september 11 2001 interest in this kind of assistance has grown for several reasons the possibility of terrorists gaining access to pakistans nuclear weapons seems higher the us military is forging new relationships with both pakistan and indi in the war on terrorism and heightened tension in kashmir in 2002 threatened to push both states closer to the brink of nuclear war in october 2001 media repor ted that the united states was providing assistance to pakistan to keep its weapons safe although those reports have not been confirmed revelations in 2004 that pakistan i scientist aq khan was selling nuclear technology and reporte dly nuclear bomb design to iran libya and north korea also helped to renew interest in making in particular pakistans nuclear weapons program more secure from explo itation the report of the 911 commission also called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep weapons of mass destruction wmd away from terrorist groups in the 108th congress the nunnlugar expansion act section 1308 of fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108136 allowed the partment of defense to spend up to 50 million in unobligated funds on cooperative threat reduction ctr measures outside the former soviet union in the 109th congress it is likely that similar legislation will be introduced ag ain the bush administration used 20 million of ctr funds to dismantle chemical weaponsrelated items in albania but proponents of expanding ctr have mentioned many othe r countries as possible recipients india pakistan china north ko rea iraq and libya to name few this paper describes wh cooperative threat reduction ctr programs developed for the former soviet union are considered models for assistance elsewhere and their potential application in india and pakistan the paper considers the types of assistance provided under ctr and potential constraints on us assistance in this area including domestic and international legal and political restrictions on cooperation with states out side the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt the low level of cooperation and transparency exhibited by india and pakistan lack of incentives for

reinforced the importance of efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in particular many analysts agree that some countries need greater protection against terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction wmd on their territories the report of the 911 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups pakistan because of its location the nature of its relationship to the taliban and qaeda and its weapons of mass destru ction programs has ge nerated particular concern repeated assassination attempts on president musharraf aq khans nuclear sales to north korea iran and li bya and continuous battle with terrorist elements within the country have made pa kistan the most crucial node of the nexus of terrorism and wmd proliferation moreover combination of doctrinal preference for first use of nuclear weapons and conventional fo rce inferiority has given pakistan strong incentives to forwar ddeploy its nuclear forces leading many observers to conclude that assistance to secure pakistans nuclear warheads could be critical analysts inside and outside government have raised the possibility of us assistance to help reduce the threat of nuc lear weapons losses in india and pakistan1 suggested measures have ranged from g uards and gates ar ound nuclear sites to permissive action links which act as locks on nuclear weapons to prevent unauthorized use in speech in december of 2001 senator lugar noted that concerns had been raised immediately following september 11 2001 about the security of pakistans nuclear weapons program and that similar questions will be raised about indias he then noted uncertainties about the wmd pr ograms of iraq iran syria libya and north korea2 in contrast to

accountability we must attempt to tablish programs that respect their sovereignty and go far to help insure th eir security lugar also suggested that cooperative programs with iran syria or libya should not be ruled out in an article published in july 2002 senator lugar explained that the precise replication of the nunnlugar program will not be possible everywhere but the experience of nunn lugar in russia has demonstrated that the threat of weapons of mass destruc tion can lead to extraordinary outcomes based on mutual interestnations coope rating on securing instruments of mass destruction might also pledge to work cooperatively on measures to retrieve weapons or materials that are in danger of falling into the wrong hands and to come to the aid of any victim of nucl ear chemical or biological terrorism 3 in the specific case of india and paki stan there may be key differences from the fsu that limit the programs applicability many of those differences stem from the fact that india and pakistan are not legal nuclear w eapon states under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt as russia was the united states is currently prohibited from providing many kinds of assistance to nonnuclear weapon states particularly those withou t fullscope nuclear safeguards4 most types of assistance the united states can feasibly provide would probably focus on helping secure nuclear materials and providing em ployment for personnel rather than on security of nuclear weapons extreme sens itivity in india and pakistan about their nuclear weapons and programs will also likely restrict access to facilities which in turn will limit how well assistance can be tailored to potential problems also technical measures to make weapons sa fer from unauthorized use may make those weapons more deployable or usable and thus inadvert ently undermine the goal of reducing the nuclear threat nonethel ess some measures may be useful this paper takes ctr programs as starting point and analyzes their potential application to india and pakistan in pr oviding context for assessing us policy options the paper outlines the proliferation threat in south asia and us nonproliferation policy the paper distinguishes between assistance oriented toward making nuclear weapons more secure and ssistance oriented toward making nuclear material more secure given the

in connection with their destruction establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of theseweapons their components and weaponsusable materials and prevent the diversion of scientific expertise that could contribute to weapons programs in other nations according to senator lugar the ct r program to date has separated 6564 russian nuclear warheads from their missiles and stored

areas of effort destruction and dismantlement chain of custody nd demilitarization destruction and dismantlement activities included removing warheads deactivating missiles and eliminating launch

bu lletproof blankets secure rail cars and building plutonium storage facility at mayak demilitarization projects have included defe nse conversion projects and international science and technology center projects to help wm d scientists pursue work with peaceful objectives and militarytomilitary contacts ctr programs have evolved and expanded over time adjusting to russian nis and us priorities as well as to changing perceptions about which threats posed the greatest risk the programs have also bowed to bureaucratic intransigence and practical considerations upon occasion in one notable incident the department of energy provided blankets to facility guar ds because doe officials discovered that they were leaving their posts to collect wood to build fires as the economy worsened in russia in the mid1990s ctr projects were developed to provide alternative employment and sources of income for unpaid or outofwork wmd scientists at the same time more frequent reports of theft of nuclear material highlighted the need to allocate ctr res ources to material protection control and accounting mpca measures for nuclear material consolidation of nuclear weapons and material and secure tr ansportation the united st ates developed practical approach quickfixes like bars on window s blastproof doors fences followed by second stage that included more sophi sticated security measures like sensors cameras and personnel access measures 8 ctr as precedent the cooperative threat reduction prog ram at its inception was novel approach to novel problem the idea that two former advers aries could cooperate on such sensitive matters as nuclear weapons and material security was radical but so too was the prospect of russias wmd infrastructure unraveling although some of the kinds of assistance and measures undertaken in the ctr program are clearly applicable to india and pakistan the circum stances that have led to the development of similar nuclear terrorist threat are quite different among the many factors that have made ctr successful one of the key factors was basic level of agreement about the threat nd willingness to cooperate russia had already agreed to strategic nuclear reductions under star t i the only question was how to implement those reductions quickly and w ho would pay for them the fact that soviet nuclear weapons had been targeted at the united states for so many years presented compelling reason for the united states to help httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31589crs6 9 according to george perkovich this occurred in the 1982 and 1990 crises and the period in 1998 before pakistan tested its nuclear devices see perkovichs remarks at september 23 2001 carnegie endowment roundtable on pakistans nuclear dilemma 10 see study by tikhonov valentin russias nuclear and missile complex the human factor in proliferation study for carnegie endowment for international peace 2001obviously there is similar agreement between india and pakistan or with the united states moreover india has long maintained that it will disarm when the other nuclear weapon states reduce their stockpiles to similar level thus destruction and dismantlement activities are not now applicable ctr chain of custody programs applied to the weapons and material that were taken out of service and thus did not raise questions about nhancing safety secur ity and control over russias active nuclear weapons stockpile doing similar things for india and pakistan might be desirable from secur ity standpoint but questionable politically establishing verifiable safeguards ag ainst the proliferation of existing nuclear weapons components and materials is the most applicable of all the ctr objectives for india and pakistan however the situa tion of pakistan and india is different from that in russia and offers one major complication threat reduction measures aimed at an outsideterrorist threat may conflict with nuclear deterrence for example making materials and weapons safe from th eft or espionage may logically lead to consolidating material and weapons at as few sites as possible however that consolidation could increase ones vulnerability to preemptive strike by an adversary in the case of russia and the nis the risk of preemptive strike did not weigh into calculations of risk any obstacles to consolidation have been primarily those of cost and effort in constructing adequate facilities like the mayak plutonium storage facility for india and pakistan however the fear of preemptive strike is prominent rumors of an indian or even israeli preemptive attack on pakistani nuclear weapons capabilities ve erupted in pakistan predictably during crises9 the last objective that of preventing diversion of scien tific expertise is also applicable to india and pakistan however the underlying causes for concern are different and therefore may call for different solutions in the russian case the lack of financial security has been documented incentive for scientists to offer their services abroad10 in pakistan the incentive is more likely to be associated with sympathy for terrorist aims brain drain projects in the nis have been predicated on the assumption that there are more scientists than can be paid or are needed but there are indications that pakistani and indian scientists are superfluous to their nuclear weapons programs both india and pakistan are probably interested in retaining their nuclear experts althou gh it has been politically acceptable to fund former wmd scientists in russia and the nis to do nonweaponsrelated work it might be politically unacceptable to fund current wmd scientists in india and pakistan at higher levels simply to keep them in the program braindrain projects in india and pakistan if such project s were implemented would likely focus on personnel reliability testing and psychological profilinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31589crs7 11 gao study wmd reducing the threat from

cooperation carnegie endowment nonproliferation project working paper number 29 august 2002 ctrs critics some arguments against expanding ctr ch allenge its effectiv eness opponents have suggested that assisting russia has simply created opportunities for the russians to spend their money in othe r defenserelated areas so supporters in contrast argue that ctr has not done enough quickly enough those that argue that ctr has not done nough have suggested that the programs have focused misguidedly on nuclear weapons rather than nuclear mate rial security wherei n the greatest threat lies11 some analysts believe that any assistance at all sends the wrong message to india and pakistan eg acceptance of th eir possession of nuclear weapons that assistance could be misused or misappropriated nd that in the end us assistance may wind up improving indian and pakistani nuclear capabilities in ways we had not foreseen proponents of the ctr program in the nis have argued that the program was implemented with key principle that cooperation would serve the objective of enhancing physical security and protection of nuclear assets and not enhance any operational capabilities12 some argue that this principle particularly since india and pakistan have not joined the npt and are jure nonnuclearweapons states nnws must also be adhered to in the case of any assistance to those states south asia context simply put there are two basic nuclear risks in south asia first that terrorists will acquire nuclear material or nuclear weapons and s econd that nuclear war will erupt through miscalculation through preemp tion or through sudde n escalation the threat of terrorism calls primarily for great er physical security at weapons sites and sites where nuclear material is produced or stored partic ularly weaponsgrade material highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium the threat of accidental nuclear war calls for safer nuclear weapons whereas reducing the risk of preemptive or sudden war would require enhanc ing command and control and possibly transparency between the two states some observers have suggested that making nuclear weapons safer through insensitive hi gh explosives or shaping the cores so that they will not give nuclear yield if improperly detonated also makes them more deployable and thus increases the risk of their use given the questionable desirability of measures to enhance indian and pakistani nuclear weapons capabilities this paper will assume that any nuclear threat reduction measures will focus on physical security measures rather than safety measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31589crs8 13 many concerns about radioactive orphan sources would not be addressed under the convention because that material is considered to be byproduct material that is material that is produced as byproduct of i rradiating special nuclear materialnuclear material security nuclear material security is concern for all states in the context of terrorist threat physical security has long been considered subset of international safeguards but it has never been prere quisite for placing nuclear material under international safeguards it can be requirement of bila teral nuclear trade however and the united states requires physical security measures on some of the nuclear material it exports mostly in conjunction with military programs often physical security measures are implemented as matter of course in implementing safeguards since states have to account for missing ma terial in their physical inventories india and pakistan may provide particularly attractive targets because they have weaponsgrade material on their soil but terrorists interest in radiological dispersal device may make any or all radioactive sources potentially attractive to steal india and pakistan became parties to the conven tion on the physical protection of nuclear material in 2002 and 2000 respectively th is convention which entered into force in 1987 was designed to protect nuclear ma terial in transit between countries the cppnm defines range of nuclear terrorist activities and requires parties to criminalize those activities it does not cover physical protection of domestic nuclear material in storage or use nor does it cover byproduct material13 the united states and other members of the conventi on have been working for several years to expand the scope of the agreement and agreed in september 2002 to extend physical protection to domestic use and storage the iaea has circulated proposed amendments to the convention which may be considered in 2005 both india and pakistan have been active in disc ussions on expanding the convention since 1995 the international atomic ergy agency has conducted although mostly outside of the regular budget physi cal protection assessment programs called international physical protection advisory service missions states must request assistance and then an internationa l team conducts c onfidential vulnerab ility assessment and recommends measures to address physical prot ection shortfalls neither india nor pakistan has requested such mission and in the opinion of some observers they are unlikely to do so becau of the sensitivity of their facilities however in may 2002 the iaea conducted joint safety and security workshop in islamabad while pakistan has participated in iaea technical cooperation programs india has not participated since the 1980s in 2002 india requested regional workshop on physical protection focused on s ecurity awareness and culture india was among

those states outside the npt the most notable example being chinas reported sharing of nuclear weapons blueprints with paki stan and reportedly pakist an shared that design with libya25 negotiators of the nuclear nonprolif eration treaty npt in the mid1960s realized that almost any kind of international nuclear assistance is potentially useful to nuclear weapons program26 nuclear weapons more than biological or chemical weapons or missile s require such precision in design and construction that any assistance from technical info rmation to hints about solving technical problems for example how to shape the fi ssile core to equipment or components can be valuable to an aspiring nuclear weapons state therefore nuclear weapon states under article i of the npt commit not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or devices directly or indirectly and not in an way to assist encourage or induce any nonnuclear weapon state to ma nufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices27 in contrast to the obligation of the non nuclearweapon states under article ii not to receive nuclear weapons or related assistance this commitment incurred verification measures in part this omission may have rested on the assumption that holders of nuclear weapons technology would not impart the most sophisticated nd directly weaponsre levant information to nonnuclear weapons states clearly however negotiators felt comfortable with focusing verification on the recipient states all stat are obliged

repeated pakistani officials statements to the press about the security of their ar senal appear to reflect ahandsoff attitude implying that pakistan is quite able to protect and secure its own

united states and the united kingdom proposals to share permissive action links pals which only allow authorized parties to arm the warhead reportedly have b een met with disinterest31 us

economic sanctions many of those states including the united states lifted sanctions quickly thereafter nonethel ess prohibitions regarding nuclear trade with countries are still in place32 these

understand much better how to manage the dangers that the weapons pose there are variety of c onfidence building measures they could take bilaterally and unilaterally35 constraints on us assistance constraints on us assistance can be gr ouped into three categories the first category encompasses legal prohibitions em bodied in internati onal treaties and us domestic law while domestic laws can be changed or provisions can be waived international treatie s are more difficult to amend the second category includes technical limitations given what little we know about indian and pakistani nuclear weapons and their secret nuc lear facilities in additi on assistance should be guided by the impact it would have on the technical capabilities of the indian and pakistani nuclear arsenals that is assistan ce should not advance the nuclear weapon programs of india and paki stan nor should it encourage testing deployment or increased operational readiness the third category covers political

such weapons or devices directly or indirectly it is not readily apparent what is meant by control over such weapons narrow interpretation would focu s on the ability of another state to use such weapon the history of npt ne gotiations reveals that concerns over transferring control over such weapons focused primarily on allies eg nato being able to make command and contro l decisions for us nuclear weapons deployed in europe36 the second part of the obligation lies in not assisting encouraging or inducing nonnuclear weapon states to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devi ces or control over such w eapons or explosive devices the negotiating history reveals that negotiators intended to interpret manufacture broadly from the beginning of the acquisition cycle to the end37 nonnuclear weapon states party to the npt are obligated not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of such weapons under article ii38 presumably this would cover assistance that enhanced command and cont rol of weapons including permissive action link pal technology however i ndia and pakistan while they are legally nonnuclear weapon states are not party to the npt and so are not bound by such an obligation as defined by paragraph 3 article ix of the npt india and pakistan are considered to be nonnuclear weapon states because they did not explode nuclear device before 196739 in the case of providing assistance to russia there was parallel concern because russia is nuclear weapon state under the npt it is difficult to interpret what might c

ecify what can be done but rather what cannot be done there is currently public ly available legal view from the state department on what might constitute violation of article i but legal advisors have considered this question by examining precedents in the application of us domestic law in general the closer assistance is attached to the nuclear weapons programs the more likely that it could run afoul of us legal obligations both under international treaty obligations and domestic law thus some kinds of aid eg food or humanitarian aid could be considere d in the extreme to be assisting or encouraging nuclear weapons program becau they free up resources that the target government can put towards nuclear wea pons program but are permitted in practice because they do not have close associa tion with nuclear weapons program if assistance took the form of transferrabl funds however the possibility of linkage to nuclear weapons program might be considered to be greater domestic

recipient state must guarantee that nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology transferred under the agreement will be used for any nuclear explosive device or for research on or

complained for years that russia s not provided the kinds of access necessary for the united states to ensure that its goals are being met with respect to the material protection control and accounting pr ograms most of the material according to one report remains outsi of the program because the united states cannot gain access to sensitive facilities44 significant concern is whether us assistance if it is targeted at making nuclear weapons more secure from unaut horized use would improve indian or pakistani nuclear weapon capabil ities permissive action links which were developed by the united states in the 1 960s were designed so that unauthorized users would not be able to produce nucl ear yield from the weapon as one observer has remarked however anothe r intended consequence is th at weapons with pals on them are more deployable one of the go als of us nonprolifer ation policy presently is to keep india and pakistan from deploying their weapons political constraints us assistance is likely to be sensitive issue for the indian and pakistani governments neither state will want to be seen as needing assistance india has refused to participate in technical coope ration programs with the iaea except on regional basis precisely for this reason on the other hand india has welcomed talks with the united states on reactor safety and us delegation traveled to india in

on the other hand the bush admin istration did not impose sanctions on pakistan for aiding north koreas cla ndestine uranium enrichment program and has not pressed the pakistani government for direct access to aq khan both of which could be interpreted by pakistan as reluctance by the bush administration to upset relations48 in addition the designation of pakistan in 2004 as major non nato ally has probably also bolstered paki stans confidence in the united states on the whole despite some progress in kashmir there are still few indications that india or pakistan would want to enhance transparency to build confidence either with each other or with the united states between the two states there appears to be more interest in threat enhancement than threat re duction in addition

unauthorized actions movement tampering can help ag ainst both insider and outsider threats measures to protect agains t inside theft include check s on personnel leaving facilities typically onerous without t echnical detection m easures for material or components cameras in sensitive areas and accountin g and access procedures armed guards could help as would operationa l and administrative controls in the russian case us officials toured sites and conducted vulnerability assessments even perimeter visits would likely be viewed as too sensitive by india and pakistan however the united states could offer information or briefings on how security is conducted at sensitive not necessarily nuc lear fac ilities in the united states ideally assistance could cover types of requirement s for personnel vetting and training and development of secur ity culture as noted above assistance of this kind has been provided under iaea auspi ces if materials such as cameras or sensors were intended to be installed at unsafeguarded facilities they would likely require licenses it is likely however that commercial versions of security systems would be cheaper and more palatable for i ndia and pakistan to install themselves if they are not already present material security measures to enhance material security generally fall into the category of material protection control and accounting mpca in some cases securing material in storage site with tamperproof seals cameras and other monitoring techniques is adequate but most often the material is intended to be used in processes like enrichment or reprocessing or fuel fabri cation this requires system of accounting and control that can follow material flows international safeguards rely heavily on state systems of accounting and control ssacs in measuring physical inventories of materials some technical exchanges in these areas may be possible some new techniques for securing mate rial in place could be shar ed one innovative approach used in russia was placing heavy cemen t blocks over plutonium containers pakistans and indias participation in multilateral programs on physical protection of material could

requirements or is designed to replace destroyed wmd forgo the use of fissile materials and other components fromdestroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons facilitate us verifica tion of weapons destruction that uses us money comply with all relevant arms control agreements and observe internationally recognized human rights including the protection of minorities initially presidents george h w bush and clinton certified that the recipient nations russia ukraine belarus nd kazakhstan met those conditions the clinton administration withdrew its certification of belarus for human rights abuses in fy1998 and the george w bush adminis tration withdrew its certification of russia in 2002 for its failure to comply w ith arms control agreements namely the chemical weapons convention and the bi ological weapons convention the bush administration subsequently requested waiver from congress for the certification it is not clear whether congress woul d opt to apply the same certification requirements to recipient stat outside the former sovi et union however s 2980 which was introduced by senator lugar in the 108th congress sought to remove the need for certifications as well as other restrictions the 109th congress may consider this issue more fully if legislation is once more introducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31589crs26 other considerations us nonproliferation laws have been strengthened over the years first to account for states that were not parties to the npt then to target critical capabilities like enrichment and reprocessing and fina lly to target the transfer of nuclear weapons or actual detonation of nuclear explosive device once state has exceeded the maximum prohibition ie possession or detonation of nuclear device logical question to ask is whether lesser restraints for example in providing nuclear technology not directly related to nuclear weapons are necessary or useful applied more broadly to ove rall nonproliferation po licy some observers have argued that the nuclear weapons cat is out of the bag and us policy should reorient itself to manage the nuclear situation in south asia at its extreme this approach would include accepting the nuclear weapons status of india and pakistan and relaxing all restricti ons other observers have argued that the purpose of restraints was to inhibit proliferation and that relaxing the rules for successful states would set bad precedent and result in the collapse of the nonproliferation regime broader issue is whether the united stat should strive for consistency in the treatment of states wmd programs alt hough india pakistan and israel are not parties to the npt and theref ore have not violated any tr eaties their nuclear weapons programs conflict with us nonproliferation objectives nd policies assistance to countries outside the npt ma be viewed as wink and nod to nuclear weapons development at the same time the use of military force to disarm iraq of its weapons of mass destruction provides strong counterpoint to such assistance as such this could threaten international consensus to combat nuclear proliferation should the united states move in the di rection of accepting indian and pakistani nuclear weapons status say some observers would there be pressure to do the same for israel if so such action could have significant impact on security and stability in the middle east other considerations include tradeo ffs between nonproliferation policy and counterterrorism cooperation as well as the promotion of democracy on january 24 2005 senator biden introduced s 12 the targeting terrorists more effectively act of 2005 the bill identifies prolifera tion of nuclear weapons and promotion of democracy as two of several issues that threaten the united states relationship with pakistan the bill would authorize 10m in the nonproliferation antiterrorism demining and related pr ograms account state to be spent in pakistan but would bar any military or economic ssistance appropriated for the fiscal year unless the president submits to congress for such fiscal year certification that military or economic assistance provided by the united states to the government of pakistan will be provided either dir ectly or indirectly to person that is opposing or undermining the efforts of the united states government to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons s 12 does not contain similar prohibitions for the lack of progress in the promotion of democracy although the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 signed on december 17 2004 extended the presidents authority to waive couprelated sanctions for pakistan through fy2006 it may be necessary for the 109th congress to revisit this issue for fy2007 on the same day pl 108458

nuclear capabilities out of the hands of terrorists depends critically on supporting musharrafs vision of moderate modernizing islamic state president musharraf has done very little to move his country toward more democratic rule
