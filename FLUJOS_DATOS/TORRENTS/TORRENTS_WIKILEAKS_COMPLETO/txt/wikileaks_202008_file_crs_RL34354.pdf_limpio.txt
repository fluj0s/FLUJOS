copeland specialist in american national government government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354congressional influence on rulemaking and regulation through appropriations restrictions summary the statutory provision known as the congressional review act cra 5 usc 801808 has not been frequently used method for congress to control agency rulemaking having been used to overturn only one rule in the more than 12 years since it took effect however congre ss has various other thods to influence agency rulemaking and regulatory activity including the addition of provisions to agency appropriations bills that restrict federal rulemaking or regulatory activity the use of restrictions in appropriations legi slation to control rulemaking has received relatively little attention from scholars and analysts but these restrictions can have substantial effects on public policy this report examines the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 pl 110161 and identifies four types of such provisions 1 restrictions on the finaliza tion of particular proposed rules 2 restrictions on regulatory activity within certain areas 3 implementation or enforcement restrictions and 4 cond itional restrictions eg preventing implementation of rule until certain actions are taken the report then examines appropriations acts in nine previous fiscal years noting that some provisions have been included in appropriations bills every year and others have appeared for several years in row numerous examples of regulatory appropriations restrictions are provided in this report the reasons be hind these restrictions vary with some appearing to be based on ec onomic considerations some requiring or preventing the implementation of rules issued at the nd of presidential administration and some included for various other reasons although none of the appropriations provisions appear designed to reverse agency rulemaking actions as the cra was intended to permit the number and variety of the provisions clearly illustrate that congresss ability to oversee and affect regulatory agencies is not confined to cra resolutions of disapproval on the other hand such provisions are generally appli cable only for the period of time and the agencies covered by the relevant appropriations bill also to the extent that agencies have independent sources of funding eg user fees or implement their regulations through state or local governments some of the limitations may not be as restrictive as they seem while appropriations provisions have been advocated by representatives of virtually all political parties and interest groups some observers have questioned whether they are constitu tional or conducive to sound public policy nevertheless their use by congress is likel to continue as long as appropriations bills are considered m ust pass legislation this report will be updated if any ch anges occur that alter the factual information in the

rule it may have other ss discernable effects eg keeping congress informed and preventing the publication of rules that may be disapprovedcongressional influence on rulemaking and regulation through appropriations restrictions introduction1 in march 1996 the statutory provisions commonly known as the congressional review act cra 5 u sc 801808 were included as part of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act under the cra before any final rule can take effect it must be filed with each house of congress and the government accountability office gao the act estab lished expedited procedures by which congress may disapprove agencies rules by enacting joint resolution of disapproval with subsequent presentation to the president for signature or veto2 although initially considered reasse rtion of congressi onal authority over rulemaking agencies the cra is now viewed by some observers as far less effective check on finalizing undesirable rule s than originally anticipated between april 1996 and april 2008 federal agenci submitted nearly 48000 final rules to gao and presumably to congress and 47 cra joint resoluti ons of disapproval were introduced regarding 35 rules ho wever during this 12year period only one rule was overturned through the cras pr ocedures the occ upational safety and health administrations shas ergonomics standard in march 2001 and that reversal was the result of unique set of circumstances3 even though the cra has resulted in the congressional reversal of only one agency rule congress influences regulatory activity in variety of other ways those methods include specifically delineating in the underlying statutes how regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs2 4 all regulations start with an act of congre ss and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are blished the specificity of the statutory basis for regulation can vary significantly fro m broad grants of rulemaking authority that state the general intent of the legislation to very specific requirements delineating exactly what regulatory agencies should do and how they should do it for examples of both general and specific statutory authorities see us general accounting office regulatory burden some agencies claims regarding ck of rulemaking discretion have merit gaoggd9920 january 8 1999 5 these statutory rulemaking requirements include the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq the paperwork reduction act 44 usc 35013520 the regulatory flexibility act 5 usc 601612 title ii of the unfunded mandates reform act 2 usc 15321538 and the information quality act 44 usc 3504d1 and 3516 for discussion of these and ot her requirements see crs report rl32240 the federal rulemaking process an

services from taking any action inc luding through promul gation of regulation to restrict coverage or payment under title xi x of the social secur ity act for rehabilitation services or schoolbased

provisions mentioned were in the text of the appropriations legislation 8 some authors have discussed congressional mechanisms of executive agency control in general or appropriations provisions

particularly those th at prevent or restrict agen cy actions after discussing four types of such provisions in the c onsolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 the report examines their prev alence over longer period of time discusses why the provisions are used nd concludes with discussion of their perceived strengths and wea knesses first however th report briefly discusses several other types of regulatory appropriations measures regulatory appropriations provisions that do not restrict rulemaking although appropriations provisions that are designed to prevent or restrict the development implementation or enforcement of particular rules or types of rules are common other types of appr opriation measures are also prevalent and deserve mention these measures include those th at require agencies to develop rules in particular areas that change the rulemaking process that assign regulatory reporting requirements and that control the funding and operation of re gulatory initiative initiation of rulemaking some appropriations provisi ons direct federal agencies to develop rules in particular areas or to take particular enforcement actions for example provision in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 121 stat 2084 amends the homeland security act of 2002 6 usc 361 et seq and requires the secretary of the department of homeland security to regulate the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate by an ammonium nitrate facility in accordance with the subtitle to prevent the misappropriation or use of amm onium nitrate in an act of terrorism the provision delineates what the regulations must contai n eg registration process for owners records that must be maintained and an appeals process and mandates that the secretary 1 shall issue proposed rule implementing this sub title not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this subtitle and 2 shall issue final rule implementing this subtitle not later than 1 year after such date of enactment in some cases the congressional requi rement for agency rulemaking is conditional upon other factors for exampl the consolidated appropriations act for 2004 pl 108199 118 stat 236 requires th secretary of labor to repropose rule on respirable coal dust which incor porates the use of personal dust monitors but only after the successful demonstra tion of personal dust monitor technology and if the secretary of labor makes dete rmination that personal dust monitors can be effectively applied in regulatory scheme9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs4 10 for more information on oira and this review process see crs report rl32397 federal rulemaking the role of the ffice of information and regulatory affairs by curtis w copeland 11 this restriction on the review of agricultu ral marketing orders has been attached to ombs appropriation every year since 1983 and was reportedly enacted at the insistence of agricultural interests that were angry at ombs application of executive order 12291s economic principles to modify or disapprov their marketing orders christopher c demuth and douglas h ginsburg white house review of agency rulemaking harvard law review vol 99 march 1986 p 1087 for background on this action see jeffrey h birnbaum farm budget fficials clash on supply curbs by marketing boards wall street journal december 7 1982 p 1 12 this provision has been attached to ombs appropriation every year since 2005 in other cases particular amounts of f unds are set aside for rulemaking for example the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 121 stat 2128 states that not less than 35 million of the funds provi ded in epas envi ronmental programs and management account sha ll be provided for activities to develop and publish draft rule not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this act and final rule not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this act to require mandatory reporting of greenhous gas emissions above appropr iate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the united states rule development process other appropriations provisi ons affect the process by which certain types of rules are developed and therefore the participants in that process for example executive order 12866 requires the office of management and budgets ombs office of information and regulatory affa irs oira to review most agencies significant rules before they are published in the federal register 10 however provision within the consolidated ppropriations act fo r 2008 121 stat 1982 states that none of the f unds appropriated in this act for the office of management and budget omb may be used for th purpose of reviewing any agricultural marketing orders or any activities or regulations unde r the provisions of the agricultural marketing agreement act of 1937 7 usc 601 et seq 11 another provision in the same section of the act stat that none of the funds provided in this or prior acts shall be used directly or indirectly by the office of management and budget for evaluating or determining if water resource project or study reports submitted by the chief of engineers acting through the secretary of the army are in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and requirements relevant to the civil works water resour ce planning process12 provisions added to appropriations bills in previous years have also led to the establishment of new procedural requireme nts on rulemaking agencies for example consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 114 stat 2763a154 established what came to be known as the information quality act some times referred to as the data quality act the provision required omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs5 13 omb published final guidelines with re quest for further comments on certain points on september 28 2001 66 federal register 49718 and later republished the guidelines after making changes pursuant to public comments on february 22 2002 67 federal register 8452 14 for more on this issue see crs report rl32532 the information quality act ombs guidance

allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the omb guidance14 other appropriations provisi ons have attempted to prevent the establishment of certain new rulemaking procedures for ex ample as passed by the house section 901 of the financial services and general government fsgg appropriations act 2008 hr 2829 which funded omb among ot her agencies stat ed that none of the funds made available by this act ma be used to implement executive order 13422 that executive order which had been issued by president bush in january 2007 required among other things that ag encies give omb advance notification of any significant guidance documents and that each agency head designate presidential appointee as regulatory policy officer15 the order also gave these officers enhanced power to control agency rulemaking16 ultimately though this provision was not enacted the fsgg appropriations bill was later folded into the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 and the final version of the legislation did not contain any language regarding the executive order similar provision has reportedly been added to the fsgg bill for fy200917 omb reporting requirements certain appropriations provisions ve imposed regulatory reporting requirements on omb secti on 645a of the treasury po stal service and general government appropriations act 1997 pl 104208 required the director of omb to submit report to congress providing 1 estimates of the total annual costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs including quantitative and nonquantitative measures of regulatory costs and benefits 2 estimates of the costs and benefits including quantitative and nonquantitative measures of each rule that is likely to have gross annual effect on the economy of 100000000 or more in increased costs 3 an assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of federal rules on the private sector state and local

act the provision required omb to subm it an accounting statement and associated report for fy2002 and each year thereafter th at included 1 an estimate of the total annual costs and benefits

to title 44 of the united states code established an egovernm ent fund that was to be used to support projects that enable the federal government to expand its ability through the development and implementation of innovative uses of th internet or other electronic methods to conduct activities electronically 20 for more on erulemaking and this funding issue see crs report rl34210 electronic rulemaking in the federal government by curtis w copelandelement that is inefficien t ineffective or is not sound use of the nations resources appropriations legislation for the next several years essentially repeated these requirements and provisi on added to ombs appropr iation for fy2001 made this type of reporting re quirement permanent18 electronic rulem aking initiative congress has also used appropriations provisions in an attempt to control transfers of funding and re imbursements for the bush administrations electronic rulemaking initiative and ot her egovernment projects from fy2003 through fy2007 congress appropriated less than 20 million to the egovernment fund for all egovernment projects much less than the 345 million authorized in the egovernment act for that period19 the lack of direct appropriations for egovernment has led to cont roversial funding mechanisms in which at least 10 egovernment projects including elect ronic rulemaking have been funded by required contributions from pa rticipating agencies in response for several years in row congress has required approval by the appropriations committees before any transfers or reimbursements of agency appropriations are made for example one of the governmentwide provisions in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 section 737 states that funds shall be available for transfers or reimbursements to the government initiatives sponsored by the office of management and budget prior to 15 days following submission of report to the committees on appropriations by the direct or of the office of management and budget and receipt of approval to tr ansfer funds by the house and senate committees on appropriations the provision goes on to require justification materials for subsequent fundi ng requests and says that funds shall be available for obligation or expenditure for new eg overnment initiatives without the explicit approval of the house and senate committees on appropriations20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs7 21 richard j lazarus congressional descent the demise of deliberative democracy in environmental law georgetown law journal vol 94 march 2006 p 635 although legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts are often referred to as riders the use of the term rider is avoided in this report because it is slang and because there is common

action many other provisions in ppropriations acts are intende d to prevent or restrict federal agencies from taking certain rulema king or regulatory actions in fact one author writing about appropria tions provisions in general said the following the classic appropriation rider is negative in its thrust and strictly pertains to the expenditure of funds it declares that th agency may not spend any of the monies congress is appropriating to engage in specific activity described in the legislation this type of rider is often described as limitation rider because it limits the executive branch from engaging in certain activity by denying the funds n ecessary for its undertaking for instance rider may provide that an agency cannot spend money to buy equipment or to hire personnel for particular office more substantively rider may provide that the agency cannot spend money to prepare study on specific topic to propose rule on specific topic to make final pending proposed rule to implement final rule to make legal argument in court or to appeal pending case21 some of the more highprofile appropriations restrictions regarding agency rulemaking have received atte ntion by analysts and schol ars for example gao and others have written about c ongressional restrictions on th development of corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards22 for six years fy1996 through fy2001 the department of transportation s dots appropriations acts stated that none of the funds in the acts could be us ed to prepare propose or promulgate regulations prescribing cafe standards for

the frequency nd nature of regulatory ppropriations restrictions crs initially searched the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 for provisions that were designed to prohibit or limit the

provisions several other provisions appeared only in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 or in only one appropriation bill in the previous nine years examined in some cases it is clear why the provisions have appeared only once for example provision prohibiting the use of funds to implement january 2007 proposed rule rela ted to the national emission standards for hazardous pollutants was only in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 121 stat 2152 the only appr opriations legislation that has been enacted since the rule was proposed43 in other cases some investigation re veals why the provisions have not been repeated for example one provision ppeared only in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropria tions act 1999 pl 105277 112 stat 2681266 and said that none of the funds made available in this or any other act may be expended before ma rch 31 1999 to publish final regulations based on the regulations proposed at 63 fed reg 3289 on january

regulatory appropriations restrictions in some cases the substantive reasons that prompted the inclusion of certain appropriations restrictions seem apparent for exampl the kyoto protocol washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs18 46 see for example us chamber of commerc reality check straight talk about the kyoto protocol available at httpwwwuschambercompublicationsreports

agriculture animal and plant health inspection service cost sharing for animal and plant health emergency programs 68 federal register 40541 july 8 2003 in this rule aphis said that the total amount of emergency funding provided by the federal government had increased from 136 million in the fy1993 fy1998 period to 1234 million in the fy1999 fy2003 periodand to some extent remains highly c ontroversial with some in the business community and elsewhere questioning its effectiveness in addressing climate change and concluding that its adoption and imp lementation by the united states could impose substantial cost and othe r burdens on regu lated parties46 therefore provisions that were added to appropriations bills preventing the implementation of the kyoto protocol appear to have been designed to address and respond to those concerns others however contend that the kyoto protocol would help address climate change and would not be extremely costly to implement47 likewise provisions that would prevent the adoption or implementation of ai rport user fees or prevent requirements that airport sponsors c ontribute buildings or other items to the faa free of charge seem designed to prevent certain costs from being imposed on certain groups the issues underlying other appropriations restrictions are less immediately apparent as many of the provisions have little or legislative history where such information is available though the reas ons behind some of the provisions seem to fall into several categories or types economic concerns endofadministration rules and other reasons economic concerns several other appropr iations restrictions appear to have been prompted by concerns about the economic ramifications of regulations on affected parties animal and plant health for example as noted previously provisions in appropriations bills from fy2004 through fy2008 prohibited the implementation of july 2003 proposed rule on cost sharing for animal and plant health emergency programs in that proposed rule the animal and plant health inspection service aphis noted that the cost to the federal government of detecting and eradicating animal or plant pests or diseases had incr eased sharply and the proposed regulation would provide better define d more consistent approach to cost sharing and the allocation of financ ial responsibility among the fede ral government states and other cooperators48 the regulation was opposed by cer tain interest groups eg the american sheep industry associati on and the nationa l cattlemens beef association which sent tters to aphis recommending that the rule not be madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs19 49 to view copy of the american sh eep industry associations comments see httpwwwsheepusaorgindexpht

because of safety and environmen tal concerns according to the house appropriations committee report on dots appropriation for fy2003 hrept 107772 the provision was added in response to an april 27 1989 proposed rule that would narrow the originally proposed fivemilewide fairway to two onemilewide fairways separated by twomilewide area where offshore oil rigs could be built if lease sale 119 goes forward under this revised propos vessels would be routed in close proximity to oil rigs because the twomile wide nonfairway corridor could contain drilling rigs at the edge of the fairways the committee is concerned that this rule if implemented could increase the threat of offshore oil accidents off the california coast accordingly the bill continues the language prohibiting the implementation of this regulation fairness doctrine the fy2008 prohibition on the fccs use of funds to implement the agencys fairness doctrine which had required broadcasters to air both sides of controversial issues and was repealed by the fcc in 1985 was reportedly based on concerns that the doctr ine could be revived and that doing so would inhibit current political expression over commercial airways others however said there was indication that the fcc or congress intended to revive the doctrine and that the appropriations provision was unnecessary84 ending regulatory appropriation restrictions in some cases the regulatory limitations that have been added to appropriations bills during the past 10 years appear to have ended because the underlying concern was temporal in nature for example one provision that was in appropriations bills for fy2001 and fy2002 prohibited the use of funds to issue certain type of proposed rule for which the comment pe riod would close prior to september 30 2002 therefore after fy2002 the provi sion was longer needed another provision that appeared only in an fy1999 appropriations bill prohibited the use of funds to implement amendments to fe deral milk marketing orders unless the implementation took place before october 1 1999 the end of fy1999 in other cases appropriations restricti ons appear to have ended because of changes in the political environment citing defenders of wildlife report that there was significant decrease in the number of antienvironmental riders between the 1998 to 2000 period and 2001 one observer sa id that this development was not surprising given that so many of the ri ders in the late 1990s resulted from policy conflicts between the republican leadership in congress and the clinton administration85 as noted previously several of the regulatory restrictions werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs27 85 continued between 1998 and 2000 to 23 in 2001 86 for example at march 21 2001 press confer ence the white house press secretary said the president has been unequivocal he does not support the kyoto treaty it exempts the developing nations around the world and it is not in the united states economic best interest httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsbriefings20010328htmlkyototreaty see also william h glaze kyoto is dead environmental science technology vol 35 may 1 2001 p a177 in which epa administrator christine whitman was quoted as saying that the kyoto protocol was dead as far as the administration was concernedadded to multiple appropriations measures for several years at the end of the clinton administration preventing the development or issuance of regulations implementing the kyoto protocols on global warming beginning in fy2002 however those restrictions longer appeared in any of the appropriations bills perhaps because the new bush administration had publicly announced its opposition to the kyoto protocols thereby making the development of regulations implementing its requirements unlikely86 other regulatory appropria tions restrictions have continued even though the original reasons for their enactments appear to have disappeared as noted previously even though aphis announced th at it had withdrawn proposed rule on cost sharing for animal and plant health emergency programs in august 2005 congress has continued to prohibit finalizing the proposed rule the scope and effect of regulatory appropriations restrictions the regulatory restrictions in appropriations bills that have been enacted during the last 10 years illustrate that congress can have substantial effect on agency rulemaking and regulatory activity beyond the introduction of joint resolutions of disapproval pursuant to the congressiona l review act these appropriations provisions can prevent an agency from veloping proposed rule from making proposed rule final or from implementing or enforcing final rule however unlike joint resolutions of disapproval under the congressional review act these appropriations provisions ca nnot nullify an existing regu lation ie remove it from the code of federal regulations or permanently prevent the agency from issuing the same or similar regulations therefore any final rule that has taken effect and been codified in the code of federal regulations will continue to be binding law even if language in the relevant regulatory ag encys appropriations act prohibits the use of funds to enforce the rule regulated entitie s are still required to adhere to applicable requirements eg in stallation of pollution control devices submission of relevant paperwork even if violations are unlikel to be detected and enforcement actions cannot be taken by federal agencies also unless otherwise indicated regulato ry restrictions in appropriations acts are binding only for the period of time covered by the legislation ie fiscal yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs28 87 see us general accounting office principles of appropria tions law third edition volume i gao04261sp january 2004 p 234 which states that since an appropriation act is made for particular fi scal year the starting presumption is that everything contained in the act is effective only for the fiscal year covered thus the rule is provision contained in an annual appr opriation act is not to be construed to be permanent legislation unless the language used therein or the nature of the provision makes it clear that congress intended it to be permanent 88 section 624 of the treasury and general go vernment appropriations act of 2001 pl

provision to be permanent is the presence in the provision of words of futurity clearly indicating such intent gao noted that the us court of appeals for the second circuit concluded that the phrase

governmentwide they are often written in such way that in practice only certain agencies are actually affected in this case opm 90 see us general accounting office principles of appropriations law p 233 which continuedor portion of fiscal year87 therefore any restriction that is not repeated in the next relevant appropr iations act or enacted in other legislation is longer binding on the relevant agency or agencies this may explain why some of the provisions in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 had been in all pr evious appropriations measures since fy1999 on the other nd some appropriati ons provisions are worded in such way that they have essentially become permanent or multiyear requirements for example the provision in the consolidated appropriations act 2001 requiring omb to publish report on th costs and benef its of regulations stated that the report was to be produced that year and each year thereafter88 also the consolidated appropriations act 2008 121 stat 2015 prohibits the issuance of any rule indicating that real estate brokerage activity is financial in nature for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 most of the regulatory restrictions are in appropriations bills providing funds for particular agencies or groups of agencies therefore the prohibitions are generally applicable only to the agencies funded by that appropriations measure however some of the regulatory prohibitions are in the general provisions government wide section of one of th appropriations measures for fy2008 title vii of the financial services and gene ral government ppropriations act and are therefore applicable to virtually all federal agencies for example the provision in section 735 of the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 that prohibited the use of funds to implement proposed rule on mporary details of staff to the legislative branch was in the general provisions governmentwide section of the act89 other provisions are worded in such way that their effects are broader than the agencies funded by those particular ppropriations bills eg those that prohibit the use of funds in this or any other act to publish or implement regulations90

concerns that agencies were treating guidance documents as binding rules nevertheless as omb points out guidance doc uments can have significant effects on regulated entitieson the other hand some of the appropria tions provisions restricting regulatory actions may not be as restrictive as they initially appear some federal regulatory agencies derive substantial amount of their operating funds from sources other than congressional appropr iations eg user fees and th use of those funds to develop implement or enforce rules may not be gally constrained by language preventing the use of appropriated funds91 also some federal regula tions eg many of those issued by epa and osha are primarily implemented or enforced by state or local governments and those governments ma have sources of funding that are independent of the federal f unds that are restricted by the appropriations provisions some state or local governments may also have their own statutory and regulatory requirements that are the same as or similar to the federal rules at issue or may even go beyond federal standards92 if state or local funds or legal authorities are used to develop implement or enfor ce regulations those actions would not appear to be constrained by statutory provisions limiting the use of federal funds to restrict action on particular federal laws and regulations93 agencies may also find ways ar ound provisions prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for rulemaking or other regulatory actions for example if an agency is not permitted to use its appropriation to issue formal rule on particular issue it might attempt to achieve the end result through other means eg guidance document that while technically not having binding effect may be granted great deference by affected

suggests it is unclear how these kinds of congressional appropriations restrictions on regulatory agencies will be viewed and implemented by the president for example in 2006 president bush said the provision prohibiting omb from reviewing agricultural mark eting orders should be deleted as inconsistent with the presidents constitu tional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch97 more recently in his december 26 2007 signing statement on the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 president bush said the act contains certain provisions similar to those found in prior appropriations bills passed by the congress that might be construed to be inconsistent with my constitutional responsibilities to avoid such potential infirmities the executive branch will interpret

the powers activities and purposes what we may call simply objects for which ppropriated funds may be used101 she takes the view that congress has not only the right but constitutional duty to limit the amount and durations of each grant of spe nding authority and that the historical concept of appropriations as adopted by the colonies encompassed dual limitations on both amount and object102 stith also said that when congress denies appropriations for particular activity the denial is not merely determination that the public fisc cannot afford spending any money on that activity by such appropriations legislation congress decides that under our constitutional scheme for the duration of the appropriations denial the specific activity is longer within the realm of authorized government

ability to execute the law appropriations riders that attempt to influence executive discretion in the area of law enforcement prevent the executive branch from carrying out its constitutionally mandated activities105 leboeuf also said that the president should refuse to abide by funding limitations he or she considers to be unconstitutional106 and some presidents have lodged these ki nds of objections for example president reagan in signing statement on limitation provision in the supplemental appropriations act of 1987 said the following article ii of the constitution assigns re sponsibility for executing the law to the president while congress is empowered to enact new or different laws it may not indirectly interpret and implement existing laws which is an essential function allocated by the constitution to the executive branch if the congress disagrees with statutory interpretation advanced by the executive branch the congress may of course amend the underlying statute the use of an appropriations bill for this purpose however is inconsistent with the constitutional scheme of separation of powers107 as noted previously president bush has similarly objected

strings of the commander in chief virginia law review vol 80 may 1994 pp 833944neal devins characterized appropriations restrictions as the constitutional equivalent of authorizations but he also said that the addition of such provisions while on the house or senate floor was troublesome and that the appropriations process may not be conduciv to sound substan tive policymaking for variety of institutional reasons including the pr evention of author izing committees from applying their expertise110 devins said that such provisions may strain the effectiveness of other branches of gove rnment and are symptomatic of congresss inability to enact authorizing legislation111 he also said that appropriations provisions prohibiting agencies from unching regulatory initiatives without changing the underlying authorizations unduly limit the executives policymaking responsibilities may result in confusing pa tchwork of enforcement schemes and are viewed by some as an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers112 he concluded that while congresss use of limitation riders is sometimes necessary congress should be aware of the significant risks associated with policymaking through the appropriations process somewhat different perspective on the constitutionality of appropriations restrictions on executive action was offered by peter ravenhansen and william c banks in the context of the president s authority regarding national security113 the authors took position between the dvocates of unlimited congressional and presidential power but ultimately assertin g that narrowly constructed appropriations restrictions are appropriate contrary to ritualistic incantations by proponents of congressional power the power of the purse is not plenary in national security law it is always qualified by the commands of the constitution and cannot be used to achieve ends that congress could not constitutionally achieve by other means but it is also not merely procedural power that makes an appropriation restriction somehow less than substantive law properly enacted national security appropriation has the same force and effect as any other statute nor is its effect diluted by the truncated legislative process by which it is sometimes enacted the restrictive appropriation will rarely trespass on national security functions assigned to the president by explicit c onstitutional text because so few functions are most national security functions are shared it is therefore as inaccurate to invoke the plenary war and foreign affa irs powers of the president to challenge restrictive appropriations as it is to invoke the plenary power of the purse to defend them instead to determine the constitutionality of restrictive national security appropriation we must weigh the extent to which the restriction prevents the president from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned functions againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs34 114 tennessee valley authority v

weighing the special history of the power of the purse in national security often tips the sales in favor of its expertise the supreme court has not ruled on the specific issue of whether appropriations provisions limiting executive agencies regulatory discretion represent an unconstitutional intrusion into the president s authority however the court has said that while implicit appropriations limitations on authorizing legislation are questionable114 congress may amend substantive law in an appropriations statute as long as it does so clearly115 appropriations restrictions and rulemaking some observers and interest groups ve specifically advocated the use of appropriations provisions to stop rulemaking activity for example john shanahan and mark wilson of the her itage foundation desc ribed several spe nding restrictions in 1995 appropriations legislation for ep and the department of labor eg restricting implementation of the delaney clause wetlands permitting requirements and an ergonomics standard and said the following while permanent labor and environmental policy reform should be pursued many of the problems addressed by th house appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted while these riders are an imperfect solution americans should view them as necessary to encourage recalcitrant federal agencies to work with congress to reform some of the nations most burdensome regulatory statutes116 others however have expressed concerns about these kinds of provisions from both procedural and public policy st andpoint for example in 2005 article entitled regulatory underkill william w buzbee of the center for progressive reform said the following during the past decade use of legislativ riders has become another particularly popular and lowvisibility means of derailing programs such riders are typically not freestanding bills that are subject to the congressional committee process openly debated and visible for all to s ee instead they commonly appear withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs35 117 william w buzbee regulatory underk ill available at httpwwwprogressiveregulationorgperspec tivesunderkillcfm

through analysis and commentary 118 richard j lazarus congressional descent p 637 119 richard j lazarus congressional descent p 635announcement or even an open legislative sponsor riders are appended to other bills often large spending appropriations bills that have broad support and reflect hundreds of fiercely negotiated bargains so riders enact provisions that could not pass as freestanding legislation ot her riders bar the use of appropriations to implement controversial policies th carveouts effectively render such policies nullity for certain periods or in certain areas because these riders do not involve frontal attack on popular law and their advocates may remain unknown the public seldom knows of these proposals in time to mount an effective opposition117 the future congress use of regulatory appropriations restrictions has fluctuated somewhat over time and previous experience suggests that they may be somewhat less frequent when congress and the president are of the same party however the use of such provisions has not been confined to one po litical party or one t of interest groups as richard lazarus pointed out in 2006 one political party and particular ideology have been more likely to promote or to reject the use of appropriati ons riders all appear to have willingly embraced the strategy when it has served their purposes whether republicans or democrats liberals or conservatives each has condemned the other for doing the same the precise identity of the condemnor or the condemnee has turned on whose political ox is being gored at the moment rather than on the willingness of anyone to adhere to principled approach to lawmaking over the longer haul118 although the substantive reasons leadin g to the adoption of these regulatory restrictions are numerous g economic interests or to support or oppose endof administration rules their inclusion in appropriations legislation as matter of legislative strategy appears to be prompted by two factors 1 congress ability via its power of the purse to control agency action and 2 the fact that appropriations bills are considered must pass legisl ation as one observer put it because everyone knows that congress must pass such legislation it is tempting to try and attach incidental provisions that otherwise might lack the political momentum or even majority support necessary for passage119 in that regard several of the regulatory restrictions discussed in this report were also in separate legislation that had not moved since they were introduced the use of regulatory restrictions in appropriations bills is also likely to c ontinue for the foreseeable future the examples provided in this report indicate that they are formidable tool in the toolbox of congressional oversight nd control of executive agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34354crs36 table 1 appropriations provisions affecting rulemaking and regulation fiscal years 1999 through 2008 fiscal years in which the
