including recruiting and retention shortfalls that occurred within the past few years the congression and executive branch response to these shortfalls and an assessment of the current situation additionally it contains an analysis of factors that may have an impact on recruiting and retention in the future and discusses policy options that could be considered to minimize any negative effects that these factors might cause in recent years the military services have experienced recruiting and retention shortfalls for their active component forces the army navy and air force had trouble meeting their goals for new recruits also known as accessions in the late 1990s and all of the services experienced declines in the quality of their recruits from the early 1990s to 2000 with respect to retention the army navy and air force had difficulty meeting their retention goals for enlisted personnel in the late 1990s and the navy and air force are still having some problems today also concerns have been raised about low retention rates in certain critical specialties and declining retention rate among younger officers cited causes of recruiting shortfalls in the late 1990s include the residual effects of the postcold war drawdown competition with robust civilian economy competit ion with institutions of higher education demographic and attitudinal changes among younger americans and need for more recruiting resources commonly cited causes of retention shortfalls include competition with the civilian economy and job dissatisfaction due to variety of factors including the nature and pace of current military operations lack of critical supplies and equipment quality of life issues and changes in the military culture however the data used to ascertain the causes of these shortfalls have often been rather limited congress and the executive branch have initiated or modified number of policies in response to these shortfalls most notably congress provided more money for recruiters advertising enlistment bonuses and reenlistment bonuses as well as increasing military pay and improving retirement benefits the executive branch refocused its advertising provided its recruiters with more and better resources launched several programs designed to expand the pool of potential enlistees and began working on ways to better manage deployments additionally other policy changes have been made most notably with respect to improving military housing benefits and reimbursements for moves these policy changes and other factors appear to have had the desired effect at least in the short term in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 all of the services met their quantity goals for new recruits recruit quality in fiscal year 2001 was slightly better than it had been the previous year with respect to retention the data indicate improvements in some areas in spite of these positive signs number of longer term factors such as demographic attitudinal and lifestyle shifts could have negative impact on recruiting and retention in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297contents recruiting 1 background 1 perceived causes 6 the congressional response 15 the

the difference between the congressionally authorized end strength of the service for given fiscal year and the projected number of personnel the service will actually have at the end of the year officer and enlisted accession goals are set separately for example if service has an authorized end strength of 200000 enlisted personnel in given year and it projects that it will retain 175000 of its current enlisted members through the year it will set goal 25000 new enlisted recruits for that year the actual number of new enlisted recruits it needs however may fluctuate throughout the year as new projections are made about the retention of currently serving enlisted personnelrecruiting and retention in the active component military are there problems this report provides information on recruiting and retention trends in the active component of the armed forces since 1989 including recruiting and retention shortfalls which occurred within the past few years the congressional and executive branch response to these shortfalls and an assessment of the current situation additiona lly the report analyze factors that may have an impact on recruiting and retention in the future and explores possible policy options that could address negative effects that these factors might cause this report is broken down into two sections the first section deals with the issue of recruiting the second with retention both of these sections are structured in the following manner background information on recent shortfalls in recruiting or retention discussion of perceived causes of the shortfalls summary of the major congressional and executive branch response to those shortfalls an assessment of the impact of the congressional and executive responses an analysis of factors that could have negative impact on recruiting or retention trends in the future discussion of policy options that congress might consider recruiting background recruiting has been called the life blood of the military services without robust ability to bring new members into the military the services would lack sufficient manpower to carry out mission essentia l tasks in the near term and would lack sufficient pool of entrylevel personnel to develop into the midlevel and upperlevel leaders of the future to protect against this the individual military services set goals for accessions or new recruits each year there are both quantity goals1 and quality goals officer and enlisted goals are set separatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs2 2these benchmarks were derived from model called the accession quality cost performance tradeoff model cptm the cptm is an optimization model that solves for the number and quality mix of recruits predicted to generate given level of performance and to fill required positions over the first term of service at the lowest costthe rationale underlying the model is relatively straightforward highquality recruits high school diploma graduates scoring in the top half of the armed forces qualification test are more capable in virtually all military occupations their level of performance is higher and they complete their enlistment at higher rates than do other recruits hence it takes fewer of them to generate given level of performance and training costs are lower however the cost of each additional high quality recruit increases at greater rate than for other types of recruitsthe cptm optimization model trades off the higher recruiting costs higher expected performance higher retention and lower training costs of the highquality recruit with the lower recruiting cost lower expected performance lower retention and higher training costs of recruits from other quality categories office of the assistant secretary of defense force management policy report to congress entitled review of minimum active enlisted recruit quality benchmarks do they remain valid march 2000 p 56as the services have generally achieved their goals for officer accessions in recent years this section will focus on enlisted accessions only in fy1998 the army and the navy failed to meet their quantity goals for enlisted accessions and in fiscal year 1999 the army and the air force failed to meet their quantity goals as well this was perceived by some as serious problem not only because of its potential impact on the force structure but also because none of the military services had failed to meet their enlisted accession quantity goal since 1979 see tables 1 through 5 for breakdown of actual enlisted accessions versus goals for dod and for each of the individual services although the quantity of enlisted recruits is an important measure of recruiting success so too is recruit quality dod measures enlisted recruit quality based on two criteria graduation from high school and score on the armed forces qualification test afqt since fiscal year 1993 dods benchmarks for recruit quality stipulate that at least 90 of new recruits must be high school graduates and at least 60 must score above average on the afqt2 those recruits who are both high school graduates and score above average on the afqt are considered high quality recruits every service has met or exceeded these recruit quality standards in every year since they were established indeed every service met or exceeded these standards in each of the seven years preceding the establishment of the standard however recruit quality peaked in fiscal year 1992 and generally declined up through fiscal year 2000 for example between 1992 and 2000 the proportion of new recruits with high school diploma dropped from 99 to 91 the proportion who scored above average on the afqt dropped from 74 to 66 and the proportion of recruits who were deemed high quality dropped from 74 to 57 this trend is even more pronounced with respect to the army which historically has always been the service with the greatest recruiting problems this downward trend line of recruit quality caused some concern in recent years especially when coupled with the quantity shortfalls of fiscal years 1998 and 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs3 however fy1992 was not normal year the resounding victory of the gulf war was fresh in peoples minds and the services were taking in comparatively low number of new recruits allowing them to be more selective it is also important to point out that service has fallen below dods quality benchmarks thus this decline in recruit quality may simply be return to normalcy additionally the data for fiscal year 2001 show slight improvements in the quality of army marine corps and air force recruits see tables 1 through 5 for an overview of recruit quantity and quality trends between 1989 and 2000 additional data from 1975 1980 and 1985 is

changing world in 19911992 american defense annual lexington books 1992 132 135 4note also that during the drawdown the marine corps was the service whose strength was decreased the least as result it was able to maintain fairly constant accession levels throughout the drawdown and subsequently it is also the only service that consistently met its recruiting goals throughout the 1990sperceived causes number of factors have been offered as the cause of the quantity shortfalls in the late 1990s and the quality levels that though still above dods benchmarks and quite high from historical perspective were declining throughout most of the 1990s commonly cited causes include the residual effects of the postcold war drawdown competition with robust civilian economy competi tion with institutions of higher education demographic and attitudinal changes among younger americans and insufficient recruiting resources such factors may not be mutually exclusive and are not necessarily competing explanations rather they may each be seen as partial answers to the question what caused these recruiting trends each is listed below and discussed in some detail however the reader should be aware that they are not necessarily listed in order of actual importance perceived cause 1 residual effects of the postcold war drawdown the end of the cold war forced the united states to rethink the security threats it faced and the type of military it needed to respond to those threats as result of this reevaluation congress substantially reduced the size of us military forces primarily between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 this drawdown was accomplished in part by offering military personn early retirement and voluntary separation bonuses as well as by involuntarily separating small number of those who did not take advantage of these voluntary separation incentives however key tool in managing the drawdown was large reduction in the number of new recruits brought into the services as one report noted during the drawdown accessionswere deliberately cut below the level needed to sustain the force this avoided having to induce even more people to leave the military who otherwise might want to stay3 because accessions were cut below the level needed to sustain the force substantial increase in the number of accessions was inevitable in subsequent years as table 1 indicates goals for accessions for all the services dropped from 292021 in fy1989 the last predrawdown year to low of 174806 in fy1995 in fy1996 and subsequent years the goals for accessions began increasing to 202017 in fy2000 to put it another way between fy1995 and fy2000 the services demand for new recruits increase d by 16 for the army the change was even more pronounced between fy1995 and fy2000 its need for new recruits grew by 274 this increase might not have been problem for the services if it had not been compounded by variety of other factors that decreased the size of its primary recruiting pool and inhibited recruiting effectiveness these factors are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs7 5us census bureau population division population estimates program for years

recent trends in enlisted propensity and conv ersion of potential enlisted supply rand corporation 1996 1011 note however that even though those with negative propensity to serve have very low likelihood of joining the military they make up about half of each years accessions this is due to the very large size of the negative propensity group which constitutes the great majority of the target populationperceived cause 2 demographic and attitudinal changes among young americans the vast majority of new recruits are young men usually those who have just graduated from high school and those who have spent few years in civilian job or in college thus the primary demographic group targeted by recruiters is 1824 year old males since 1981 the size of this age cohort has been decreasing the product of declining fertility rates in the 1960s and 1970s the baby bust in the late 1990s there were roughly 1 million fewer 1824 year old men than there were in 1989 the size of the 1824 year old male cohort reached its lowest point in 1996 and has been gradually increasing since then see table 6 population projections indicate that this cohort will continue to increase in size until 2013 at that point it will begin to decline again5 women make up small but significant proportion of new recruits in 1999 they made up 18 of enlisted accessions the female 1824 year old cohort declined from 1981 to 1996 and has been gradually increasing since then it too is expected to increase in size until 2013 at that point it will begin to decline again in addition to the smaller size of the 1824 year old cohort during the 1990s attitudinal changes among younger americans also made it more difficult for the services to recruit during that timeframe until 1999 the department of defense conducted an annual survey known as the youth attitude tracking study yats which measured the attitudes of youth between the ages of 16 and 246 one of the key types of questions asked in that survey concerned the individuals propensity to serve or willingness to consider joining the military the correlation between propensity to serve and the likelihood of eventually joining the military is quite strong one study compared the propensity to serve of highquality youth with actual enlistment rates and found that among those with highly positive propensity to serve 344 actually enlisted among those with lower but still positive propensity to serve 19 actually enlisted and among those with negative propensity to serve only 51 actually enlisted7 thus changes in cohorts propensity to serve can make it easier or harder for the services to recruit positive propensity to serve among 1621 year old males dropped significantly between 1989 and 1999 in 1989 the last predrawdown year 337 of young men 1621 years old indicated positive propensity to serve that number generally declined in subsequent years although it jumped up in 1991 in the aftermath of the gulf war victory and showed small increase in 1995 positive propensity to serve also showed an increase in 1999 with 286 of young men indicating positivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs8 propensit to serve similar but less pronounced trend in positive propensity to serve occurred among young women although their level of positive propensity to serve has historically been much lower than that of young men additionally in recent years their level of positive propensity to serve has returned to its pre drawdown level the trend in positive propensity to serve for 2224 year old males and females has generally tracked that of their younger peers but at lower level table 6 size of youth cohort ages 1824 19802000 in thousands yearmales 1824females 1824total 1824 1980 15101 15002 30103 1981 15192 15053 30245 1982 15165

not entirely clear some have attributed it to the low advertising budgets of the military during the drawdown years others have attributed it to the declining number of veterans among youth influencers such as parents teachers and guidance counselors while plausible these accounts do not adequately explain why the decline has been heavily concentrated among one specific group african american males african americans have long had higher propensity to serve in the military than whites or hispanics so this trend may simply be normalization of african american attitudes towards the military nonetheless if such decline were to persist it would have troubling ramifications for the militarys ability to recruit as it has long benefitted from the relatively high propensity to serve of african american men to fill its ranks the propensity of this group to serve did rebound in 1999 perceived cause 3 robust civilian economy traditionally the primary recruiting pool for enlisted personnel has been young men8 who have graduated from high school within the past few years essentially these people have three options available to them enlist in the military work in civilian job or attendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs10 9kilburn rebecca and jacob alex klerman enlistment decisions in the 1990s evidence from individual level data rand corporation 1999 10the unemployment rate in 1992 was 75 from there it dropped steadily to 40 by 2000 11the employment cost index used measures changes in private sector wages and salaries 12congressional budget office report entitled what does the military pay gap mean june 1999 by richard l fernandez figure 2 13a likely reason for this increase in the pay gap in the 1990s was the way in that military pay raises were calculated for much of that decade since 1967 federal law has provided that military pay be adjusted upward at the same time and by the same percentage as the average increase in the pay rates for federal general schedule gs employees in 1990 congress enacted statutory formula for federal civilian pay raises that provided for an annual increase beginning in fiscal year 1992 of 05 less than the annual increase in the employment compensation index eci thus by statute military pay raises were supposed to be determined by the an eci minus 05 formula as the pay gap formula is based on continuedcollege9 the decision among these options is based on number of factors one of which is rough comparison of the costs and benefits that could be derived from each choice when the civilian economy is booming the anticipated costs of pursuing civilian job decrease while the anticipated benefits increase one measure of the relative attractivene ss of civilian employment versus military employment is the unemployment rates the higher the unemployment rate the lower the chance an individual has of securing and keeping civilian job and this in turn makes military employment more attractive historical data indicates that the unemployment rate in the united states was generally falling from 1992 to 200010 another measure of the attractiveness of civilian employment versus military employment is relative levels of compensation if military compensation is lower than civilian compensation military service becomes less attractive option and vice versa however compensation levels can be difficult to quantify accurately for example the valuation of employer provided benefits can differ markedly depending on the methodology used even seemingly simple comparisons like pay rates can be complicated due to the differing structure of military and civilian pay for example military pay includes not only basic pay but allowances for housing and subsistence and tax advantages as well some members of the military receive bonuses and special pays too as result estimations of average military pay levels can vary substantially depending on how these different elements are accounted for an alternative to comparing average military and civilian pay is to compare rates of pay growth over time typically military basic pay is the variable used to calculate changes in military pay levels and the employment cost index eci11 is the variable used to calculate changes in civilian pay levels using this methodology if civilian pay grew by 25 over given time period and military pay grew by 15 over the same timeframe one might conclude that military pay was becoming less competitive relative to civilian pay during that period this methodology has been widely used to create measure of pay competitiveness during the past two decades and during the 1990s it indicated pay gap of about eleven to 13 in favor of civilian employment12 it also indicated that the gap grew as the decade progressed13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs11 13continued comparison of the eci and military basic pay it is not surprising that the pay gap grew 14for more extensive discussion on the difficulty of

doubt on military pay gap navy times october 6 1997 8 16us department of commerce bureau of the census current population reports series p20 however the methodology used to create this measure has serious shortfalls as well14 including the previous ly mentioned problem of which elements of military pay to count as pay indeed some studies have disputed the existence of pay gap or have found link between the pay gap as it is usually measured and recruiting or retention15 however whether this pay gap actually existed or was as large as claimed was to certain extent overshadowed by the wide media coverage of the issue which often reported the existence of pay gap as though it were an established fact thus although the data on relative pay levels is ambiguous it seems fair to say that military pay was widely perceived as being lower than civilian pay during the 1990s coupled with the previously mentioned data on unemployment rates this lends some support to the argument that civilian jobs became an increasingly attractive option to recent high school graduates during the 1990s thus increasing competition for the pool of potential enlistees perceived cause 4 increase in college bound youth as mentioned above the militarys primary recruiting pool for enlisted personnel has traditionally been young men who have graduated from high school within the past few years these individuals either enlist in the military work in civilian job or attend college the latter choice has become increasingly popular in recent years in 1980 just under half 467 of male high school graduates went straight on to college that proportion rose to 576 in 1989 and peaked at 635 in 1997 since then the proportion has tapered off slightly to 614 in 199916 among women similar trend is evident although women have gone straight from high school to college at consistently higher rate than men in every year but one since 1988 in part this trend is due to the perceived benefits of college education better employment prospects higher wages and higher social status nor is this perception misguided one study showed that in 1998 the earnings of those who had completed at least bachelors degree were dramatically higher than those who had only high school education for men the college premium was 56 that is men with at least bachelors degree earned 56 more than those with just high school diploma while for women it was 100 additionally this college premium has increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs12 17us department of education national center for education

association of the united states general conference sept 5 1999fairly steadily over the past two decades in 1980 for example the college premium for men was only 19 while it was 52 for women17 an additional reason for the increasing rates of college attendance may be found in the decreasing financial barriers to attending college although it is true that the costs of attending college have grown significantly in recent years this has been accompanied by an increasing number of ways to finance the costs students now have access not only to scholarships grants and student loans but are increasingly able to get tuition reimbursement from their employers or to receive financial assistance in exchange for some type of public service other than active military service since world war ii the premier educational assistance package for public service has been the gi bill18 but the gi bill now has competition from other sources as military sociologist charles moskos points out we now spend over 15 billion year on federal grants and loan subsidies to college students in other words were paying people not to serve their country we have createda gi bill without the gi in fact if you have gi bill if you get the montgomery gi bill colleges will deduct other student aid theyll count the gi bill as part of their income and therefore reduce student aid you might otherwise get19 in addition to federal educational grants the gi bill also faces competition from federal programs like americorps which provides participants with educational grants of up to 9450 upon completion of service and from various state national guards which often offer free tuition at state schools as benefit of membership in addition to the scaled down version of the gi bill available to all reservists additionally it is not uncommon today for private businesses to provide educational benefits to their employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs13 table 8 college enrollment rates of high

competition from higher education decrease d the supply of potential recruits in the 1990s the historically high proportion of people enrolling in college immediately after high school posed direct challenge to the militarys enlisted recruiting efforts which has traditionally focused on recruiting recent high school graduates put simply with more high school graduates choosing to go straight to college fewer potential recruits were in the militarys primary recruiting pool perceived cause 5 insufficient recruiting resources the preceding paragraphs point to both an increase in the militarys demand for recruits and decrease in the available supply of potential enlistees as the fundamental causes of the militarys recruiting shortfalls in the mid to late 1990s however another factor certainly bears examination the resources available to the services to achieve their recruiting goals most agree that these resources such as advertising recruiters enlistment bonuses and educational benefits have historically been valuable tools for convincing potential recruits to sign an enlistment contract while it would be impossible to specify the correct level of these resources it appears that the levels were not adequate for the challenging recruiting environment that emerged as the 1990s progressed as mentioned previously key tool the military used in managing the drawdown was large reduction in the number of new recruits brought into the services based on this policy of reduced accessions the military spent less on recruiting related expenditures during the drawdown period for example as table 9 indicates the total advertising expenditures for all the services fell by over 50 between 1989 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs14 1993 the number of recruiters employed by the

early part of the decade had negative long term affect on recruiting according to the department of defense with the military drawdown we cut advertising budgets and reduced the number of people that we enlisted we believe that this created perception that the military was longer hiring we also believe that by not advertising during the middle of the 1990s we missed the opportunity to communicate with people who are now enlistment age20 the congressional response congress has expressed concern about recruiting trends since at least 1994 the committee report that accompanied hr 4301 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1995 stated the committee has heard compelling testimony from the department of defense and service witnesses that the armed forces are experiencing difficulty in meeting recruiting objectives if left unchecked these trends will ultimately require the services to access lower quality recruits than those that fueled the resurgence of the armed forces in the 1980s21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs16 22for more information on military pay raises see crs issue brief ib10089 military pay and benefits key questions and answers by robert l goldich 23army times congress sets own goals for recruiting june 7 1999 p 16 similar concerns are found in the committee reports accompanying many subsequent defense authorization bills through fy2001 the level of concern evidenced in these reports increased substantially in fy1998 and fy1999 when several of the services failed to meet their accessions quantity goals congress has responded to the militarys recruiting challenges in number of ways the most direct way has been to increase the amount of money available for activities related to recruiting such as advertising see table 9 enlistment bonuses and educational benefits it has also authorized substantial pay increases for the military22 additionally congress has taken action to preserve recruiters access to students in the following ways by prohibiting almost all colleges that accept federal funds except student aid from discriminating against recruiters on campus by prohibiting secondar schools that receive certain types of federal assistance from discriminating against recruiters on campus and by requiring those secondary schools to provide military recruiters with access to the names addresses and phone numbers of their students unless the student or parent of the student objects less directly congress has also funded an increasing number of junior reserve officer training corps jrotc programs which are located at high schools althoug h recruiting is not the purpose of jrotc and its members are in way legally affiliated with the armed forces it may instill participants with positive attitude towards the military the army times for example reported that more than half of the students who participated in jrotc become affiliated with the military in some fashion23 nonetheless the extent to which jrotc instills positive attitudes towards the military as opposed to simply attracting people who already view military service positively is unclear the executive branch response the executive branch has taken number of actions designed to mitigate its recruiting shortfalls the department of defense has conducted more market research on both potential enlistees and their influencers eg parents teachers and guidance counselors and has used this information to refocus its advertising campaigns thus most of the services have recently devised new advertisi ng messages to appeal to the attitudes of young americans and have developed stronger presence on the internet popular medium of communication for these potential recruits significantly the military has also begun to rethink its strategy of recruiting enlistees primarily from the ranks of recent high school graduates increasingly the services are implementing programs that are designed to appeal to college minded students for example the armys college first program pays stipend to people while they are in college in exchange for enlisted service after graduation recruiters are also working with colleges and universities to contact those students who drop out leave college with intention of returning or stop out leave college with the intention of coming back in the future the army has also launched pilot program known as ged plus which helps high school dropouts with exceptionallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs17 24allowing more recruits with geds into the services is controversial issue see the section entitled revised

academyhigh scores on the afqt to complete their general educational development ged credential and then enlist in the army24 results the response of congress and the executive branch over the past few years together with other factors such as slackening economy has yielded some success in fy2000 for the first time in three years all services met their recruiting goals for both quantity and quality and this success was repeated in fy2001 additionally recruit quality improved slightly for most of the services in fy2001 it seems fair to conclude that the increased recruiting budgets improved pay and benefits and modified recruiting strategies have had positive effect on recruiting some of this improvement can also be attributed to factors largely unrelated to new recruiting initiatives for example the growing youth cohort an economic slowdown slight drop off in college enrollment rates and the hard work of individual military recruiters factors that may cause shortfalls in the future despite the recent improvements in meeting recruiting goals number of factors have the potential to cause recruiting shortfalls in the future these factors changes in the militarys recruit quality needs demographic changes and continuing competition with institutions of higher education have the potential to significantly reshape the recruiting environment additionally resurgent economy and further declines in propensity to serve could cause recruiting shortfalls as well factor 1 changing recruit quality needs assuming that military personnel requirements ie end strengths are not significantly increased in future years and assuming stable retention the militarys demand for new recruits will not increase significantly over the number of accessions required in fy2001 however the type of recruit needed may change dramatically over the next twenty years much attention has been paid to the revolution in military affairs rma military concept based on the premise that the integration of sophisticated information technologies into military operations will transform the way in which the united states fights its wars typically discussions of rma center on new types of networked combat systems or on new tactics that can be employed while utilizing these systems less frequently mentioned is the type of people who will be required to man these systems and implement the tactics they may need to have higher cognitive ability than is presently required and this could reduce the pool of people qualified to enlist25 additionally as these high cognitive ability individuals are highly prized by corporations and institutions of higher education competition for them will be fiercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs18 26us department of education the digest of

office of the assistant secretary of defense force management policy population representation in the military services fiscal year 1999 table 27factor 2 changing demographics another important factor is the changing demographics of the youth cohort as indicated previously the size of the 1824 year old cohort is expected to expand in size through the year 2013 this is good news for recruiters as it means there is larger pool of potential enlistees from which to recruit additionally as this cohort grows in size it is also expected to have an increasing proportion of hispanics who currently have the highest propensity to serve of any major ethnic or racial group this too could be good news for recruiters if it creates primary recruiting pool with an increasingly positive attitude towards military service however the increasing representation of hispanics in the youth cohort also has drawback one of dods key measures of recruit quality is possession of high school diploma and hispanics currently have much higher high school dropout rate than other major groups in 1999 for example the dropout rate among hispanics was 29 compared to 7 for whites and 13 for african americans26 thus unless the high school graduation rate increases for hispanics or dod changes its definition of recruit quality the benefit from the increase in cohort size may be less than proportional factor 3 competition with institutions of higher education competition with colleges appears to be one of the key recruiting challenges of the future as mentioned previously the wage premium awarded to college graduates is large and growing today nearly two of every three high school students go straight on to college after graduating from high school27 and that proportion may increase in the future this changing educational pattern will almost certainly require dod to shift its primary recruiting pool from recent high school graduates to those with at least some college28 such shift would pose significant challenges recruiting incentives for example would need to be adapted from targeting those with future plans for college toward targeting those with immediate plans for college those who are already in college and those who have recently left college recruiters would also need to be retrained to market the benefits of military service to people whose career plans are substantially different than the typical high school graduate additionally colleges might be more reluctant to cooperate with recruiters than high schools have been as colleges might perceive recruiting efforts as attempts to steal their undergraduates factor 4 competition with civilian employers the united states is currently in the midst of an economic slowdown which started in early 2001 this actually benefits military recruiting as it reduces the competition it faces from civilian employment opportunities however the economy tends to follow cyclical trend so it is likely that the currently sluggish economic conditions will be replaced in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs19 29authors conversation with bernard rostker former under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness

force management policy report to congress review of minimum active enlisted recruit quality benchmarks do they remain valid march 2000 p 1 not too distant future by more robust economy such revival could create challenges for military recruiting like the economic boom of the 1990s did factor 5 changing attitudes towards military service it appears that the decline in propensity to serve that began in 1992 reached its low point in 1997 and 1998 see table 7 the data from 1999 show an increase in this key predicator of willingness to serve in the military and this upward trend may continue in light of the growing proportion of hispanics in the youth population such trend would be good news for the military services however if downward trend recurs in future years it would have negative effect on recruiting options for congress should any of these factors manifest themselves in the future congress may consider legislative remedies below is list of policy options that could address one or more of the factors mentioned above increase recruit ing resources historically the first response to difficult recruiting environment has been to increase the amount of funds available for recruiting operations specifically funds for advertisi ng enlistment bonuses and increasing the number of recruiters on duty experience has shown that this response is usually an effective way of improving recruiting within relatively short time frame29 and the amount of funding committed can be scaled to match the scope of the recruiting shortfall this approach likely would be effective if it appeared that recruiting shortfalls were principally caused by increased recruit quality demands competition with higher education or competition with civilian employers factors 1 3 and 4 above revised recruit quality criteria this response might be considered if it appeared that recruiting shortfalls were caused by changing demographics specifically the increased representation of group that has relatively low rate of high school completion factor 2 above as mentioned earlier completion of high school is one of the two key indicators that dod uses to assess recruit quality it is important to point out however that the primary reason that dod uses graduation from high school as an indicator of recruit quality rather than ged rests on the strong statistical link between completion of high school and completion of ones enlistment contract in other words those who graduate from high school are substantially more likely to complete their enlistment than those who did not complete high school but who have ged30 as measure of quality then high school graduation is less one of intelligence or knowledge and more one of perseverance admittedly perseverance is critical factor in recruit quality for failure to complete an enlistmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs20 contract results in higher training costs for the military undermanned units and personnel turbulence however there may be alternative ways by which an individuals perseverance could be measured currently dod is testing just such an alternative measure in the form of questionnaire known as the assessment of individual motivation if it proves to be an accurate gauge of an individuals motivation it could be coupled with ged as substitute for the high school graduation requirement without lowering recruit quality congress which has generally been skeptical about suggestions to alter recruit quality standards may decide to closely review any such changes expanding and restructuring military educational programs this response could be explored if it appeared that recruiting shortfalls were caused by increased recruit quality demands or by increased competition with institutions of higher education factors 1 and 3 above the militarys extensive educational benefit programs are primarily structured to attract those who want to go to college eventually but not to attract those who want to go to college immediately after high school those who are already in college or those who have completed at least some college for example the principal educational benefit offered to enlistees is the montgomery gi bill the montgomery gi bill provides substantial educational benefit to enlistees in return for their service but until recently they could only use it after they fulfilled their enlistment contract even so most service members do not use their benefits until after they leave the military the military also has an extensive network of colleges that service members can attend while on active duty the cost of the courses is largely or entirely paid for by the military although it is possible to complete an associates bachelors or even graduate degree through these concurrent education programs it can be difficult for service members to take full advantage of them because military duties can easily conflict with academic pursuits recently some of the services have implemented student loan repayment programs for those who have already attended college and are willing to enlist there has also been some experiment ation with college first type programs where the military provides stipend to individuals while they attend college in exchange for military service after completion of college at present however these programs are relatively small in size and not offered by all services if the services want to expand their pool of recruits to include those who are motivated to go to college immediately after high school those already in college and those who have some college education already they could request congress to consider restructured educational benefits program expansion of the student loan repayment program and college first type programs would be options for doing this another option might be to integrate the militarys concurrent education programs more closely into an individuals enlistment contract for example the services might guarantee an enlistee that in exchange for 6year enlistment he or she would be given enough educational leave during the course of the enlistment to complete an associates degree incentives such as full military pay and benefits while attending college that accepted military training as partial credit towards an associates degree could be considered tuition and fees might either be paid for out of the individuals montgomery gi bill benefit or directly by the militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs21 31for enlisted personnel the obligated term of service is determined by their initial enlistment contract usually three to six years for officers the obligated term of service is determined by rules governing the program through which they receive their commission usually four or five years 32each of these outcomes in turn can have negative impact on recruiting by making the military less attractive career option 33between fy1989 and fy2000 retention computation methodologies varied among the services retention rates for each of the services were computed by dividing the number continuedmore generous pay and benefits this approach could be effective if it appeared that recruiting shortfalls were principally caused by increased recruit quality demands competition with higher education or competition with civilian employers factors 1 3 and 4 above potential recruits especially the highest quality recruits have options other than military service including civilian employment and higher education in confronting these options individuals make rough comparison of the costs and benefits that could be derived from each choice increased pay and benefits for military service would make the choice of enlisting more attractive the magnitude of the increase could be scaled to the magnitude of the recruiting shortfall thus modest recruiting shortfalls could be countered with modest increases in pay and benefits while major shortfalls would require more substantial increases however this is usually very expensive option as increased pay and benefits usually apply to the entire force rather than just new recruits the costs of this approach also continue even if competition for recruits wanes most analysts believe that enlistment bonuses which can be targeted solely towards new recruits are more efficient way of improving recruiting than acrosstheboard improvements in pay or benefits retention background retention in the military refers to the rate at which military personnel voluntarily choose to stay in the military after their original obligated term of service has ended31 imbalances in the retention rate can cause problems within the military personnel system if too few people stay in the military will suffer from lack of experienced leaders decreased military efficiency and lower job satisfaction if too many people stay in promotion opportunities decrease and higher percentage of people must be involuntarily separated in order to prevent the organization from becoming top heavy with middle and upper level leaders32 in recent years concerns have been raised that retention rates in the military were too low in three areas the retention rate of enlisted personnel generally the retention rate of enlisted and officer personnel in critical specialties and the retention rate of officers in certain paygrade retention data are presented and analyzed below to explain the basis for these concerns retention among enlisted personnel generally tables 11 through 14 provide breakdown of retention data from each of the services from fiscal year 1989 the last year before the end of the cold war to fiscal year 2001 as each of the services tracks its retention data in different ways33 the tables do not lendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs22 33continued retained by the total loss population for the army air force and the marine corps the number retained was simply the number who reenlisted for the navy the number retained was the number who reenlisted plus the number who signed longterm extension to their current enlistment with respect to the loss population the army air force and marine corps calculated it in essentially the same way it was simply the total number of people eligible to reenlist whether they actually choose to reenlist or not until 2001 however the navys loss population included the total number of people eligible to reenlist plus those who were not eligible to reenlist and who left the service this difference in computation methodology made the navys retention rate appear lower than it would have been if calculated in manner similar to the other services in april 2001 the navy adopted computation methodology that brought it in line with the other services themselves to direct comparison additionally as each service has unique mission and force structure their retention requiremen ts vary substantially thus the data from one service should not be directly compared with the data from another service each data set should be viewed and analyzed individually army the retention rates for enlisted personnel in the army are listed in table 11 the army tracks retention rates in three categories initial term serving in first enlistment regardless of length midcareer second or subsequent enlistment with less than ten years of service and career second or subsequent enlistment with more than ten but less than twenty years of service it states its retention goals in terms of raw numbers review of those numbers indicates that the army did not meet many of its retention goals in the first half of the 1990s it failed to meet its initial term retention goals in fy1991 1992 1993 and 1995 its midcareer retention goals in fy1991 and 1995 and its career retention goals in fy1991 1992 1993 and 1994 this trend is somewhat surprising in light of the generally declining retention goals sought during that timeframe but it is understandable if viewed as response to the postcold war drawdown the drawdown was carried out principally between fy1991 and fy1996 highlighted in the table thus the lower than expected retention rates in the early 1990s might well have been the result of soldiers making rational decisions to avoid the grim career prospects of the drawdown years in favor of brighter prospects in the civilian world additionally the imperative of reducing the size of the army due to drawdown pressures may have made meeting retention goals lower priority for army officials in the early 1990s than it would

officer enlisted personnel management since fy1996 the last year of the drawdown the army has met or exceeded its retention goals in both its initial term and midcareer categories however it continued to have trouble meeting its retention goals for career personnel until fy1999 from fy1996 to fy1998 the army missed its retention goals for career personnel by between 2 and 5 since fy1999 however the army has been able to meet its career retention goal by substantial margins navy the retention rates for enlisted personnel in the navy from fy19892000 are listed in table 12 during this timeframe the navy tracked retention rates in three categories first term serving in first enlistment regardless of length second term second or subsequent enlistment with less than ten years of service and career second or subsequent enlistment with more than ten years of service it is important to reiterate however that during this time period the navy calculated its retention rate in way that made its rates appear lower than those of the other services thus navy retention rates cannot be directly compared with the retention rates of other services review of navy retention data does indicate an overall decline in retention rates between fiscal years 1989 and 1999 in all three retention categories although it is not surprising that retention rates for the navy dropped during the drawdown years it is surprising that retention rates continued to decline after fy1996 which is generally considered to be the last drawdown year however the navy started itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs24 34statement of admiral vernon clark chief of naval operations before the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense june 20 2001drawdown later than the other services its peak drawdown years in terms of declines in endstrength were fy1994 and 95 and the navy continued to experience significant cuts in endstrength even after the principal drawdown years had passed navy endstrength declined by 5 in fy1997 and by 3 in fy1998 thus it is reasonable to conclude that the navys retention rates were affected by the drawdown for longer period of time than the other services additionally caution must also be used in interpreting these data because the navy did not have any formal retention goals during this timeframe therefore it is difficult to assess the meaning of these retention rates was the decline an indicator of retention problems in the navy or was it simply reflection of force structure readjustments in the postdrawdown navy in all likelihood it was some combination of these two explanations but it is unclear from the data alone still testimony from senior navy leaders indicates that the navy had substantial retention problems with its enlisted force between fy1996 and fy2000 for example despite retention levels substantially higher than those of 1999 the chief of naval operations indicated that as of june 2001 retention rates were not at steady state level34 recently the navy changed the way it tracks retention beginning in fy2001 it has modified the definitions of its retention categories set goals for each of them and significantly changed the formula by which its retention rates are calculated bringing them in line with the formula used by the other services the navys new retention categories are zone 17 months to 6 years of service zone b 6 to 10 years of service and zone c 1014 years of service the navys goals and retention rates for fy2001 are listed in table 13 below and indicate that the navy came very close to meeting its retention goals in fy2001

postcold war drawdown but recovered in subsequent years in fiscal years 1998 through 2001 the marine corps essentially met its retention goals for first term personnel it appears that similar trend occurred in the second term and career categories retention rates dropped during the drawdown followed by gradual upswing that eventually produced retention rates higher than those immediately before

professions this shortfall appears to have gotten worse at least in some specialties in the post drawdown era report issued by the general accounting office gao in march of 2000 compared retention rates at the occupational level in the 19881990 and 19961998 timeframes the study found that substantial drops in retention had occurred among enlisted personnel in number of critical specialties and that smaller drops had occurred among officers as well the more severe declines for enlisted personnel occurred in the intelligence field retention rate down 16 points in the army and 11 points in the air force data processing down 10 points in the army 11 points in the navy and 15 points in the air force and air crews down 20 points in the navy and 14 points in the air force36 according to this same report reductions in retention rates among officers occurred as well however these reductions occurred in lower proportion of occupational fields and the declines were on average substantially smaller than those among enlisted personnel additionally the fields where the declines occurred varied substantially among the different services in the army retention rate declines of between 3 and 5 occurred among officers in the fields of nursing dentistry health service administration automotive maintenance data processin g and fiscal administration in the navy declines of between 3 and 4 occurred in the fields of ordnance and electronics and in some supply related fields in the air force declines of 3 to 5 occurred in the fields of counterintelligence electronics missile maintenance fiscal administration psychology and rotary wing aviation helicopter pilots in the marine corps declines of 3 to 4 occurred in the fields of intelligence electronics supply and aircraft crew operations37 retentio n in certain grades of officers final area of concern in recent years has been the retention of officers in the o3 and o4 paygrades these paygrades correspond to the ranks of captain and major in the army air force and marine corps lieutenant and lieutenant commander in the navy these officers are important in several respects their large numbers make them center of gravity of the officer corps they often function in key front line leadership roles and they are the pool from which the senior military leaders of the future will be drawn in recent years there have been reports that retention among these officers has been declining perhaps precipitously for example one recent news article stated that anecdotal reports to dod officials suggest army air force and

which measure the percentage of officers who continue in the service from one year to the next are commonly used to measure their retentionnavy lieutenants are leaving the military in numbers not seen since 197338 an april 2000 article stated that dissatisfied younger army officers are leaving the service in droves worrying the services leadership and provoking intense debates about the problem at military bases across the nation39 an analysis of retention data indicates that these assertions are overstated for officers in the o3 paygrade but do not appear accurate for those in the o4 paygrade the continuation rates40 of officers in paygrade o3 are displayed in table 16 and broken out by service and fiscal year the pattern is quite similar for each service all show drop in continuation rates early in the drawdown recovery several years later followed by another drop off in more recent years for all services the continuation rate for 03 officers was lower in fy2000 than in fy1989 however this decline was more pronounced in the army than in the other services the armys continuation rate in fy2000 was 34 percentage points lower than it was in fy1989 compared with 26 percentage point decline in the air force 21 percentage point decline in the navy and 07 percentage point decline in the marine corps while these declines appear to be small their impact on the officer corps can be larger due to the numbers of officers in the 03 paygrade for example if the armys continuation rate for captains were the same in fy2000 as it had been in fy1989 it would have kept about 725 more of them on active duty then actually occurred if the air forces continuation rate for captains were the same in fy2000 as it had been in fy1989 it would have kept about 670 more of them on active duty although the change in the navys continuation rate for 03 officers between fy1989 and fy2000 has been less than that of the army and air force the navys continuation rate for these officers is troubling for another reason its showed less of recovery after the drawdown drop then the other services did although all the services showed significant drop in continuation rates in fy1992 and 1993 most recovered strongly in subsequent years the army and air force saw their continuation rates rebound in fy1994 and the marine corps continuation rate began to improve in fy1995 the navy however did not see turnaround in its 03 continuation rate until fy1996 and the recovery proved shortlived continuation dropped in fy1997 1998 and 1999 thus the navys decline in 03 continuation rates while not as large as the armys may be greater problem as it did not recover as robustly from the lows of the drawdown era the navys 03 continuation rate in fy1999 was actually lower than in any year of the drawdown era httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs30 41taken from briefing slides of commanders conference presented by lieutenant general timothy maude army deputy chief of staff for personnel october 19 2000thus with the exception of the marine corps whose continuation rates have recovered to nearly the same level as before the drawdown the data indicate that continuation rates for officers in the 03 paygrade are an area of concern this concern is magnified by the possibility that the overall retention data presented here may mask troubling shifts in voluntary separation of officers in the o3 pay grade versus involuntary separation one study by the army indicates that voluntary separation has climbed significantly for army captains in recent five year period41 while the proportion of involuntary separations has decreased this has led some to infer that fewer officers are being released for substandard performance which might indicate decline in the quality of the officers being retained nonetheless in light of the currently available data the assertion that there has been massive exodus of officers in the o3 paygrade does not appear to be supportable table 16 active duty o3

thousands of individual decisions on whether or not to stay in the military these individual decisions analysts believe are based on the individuals answer to one basic question would i be better off if i stayed in or left the military the question while simple to state can be an extraordinarily complex one to answer as the definition of better off entails broad array of factors including pay and benefits job satisfaction and quality of life some of these factors like pay are tangible and can be quantified and compared with civilian jobs42 others like quality of life are less tangible and can be very difficult or impossible to quantify and compare with civilian life additionally different individuals attach different levels of importance to these various factors given the exact same environment the answer to the question would i be better off if i stayed in or left the military will be answered differently by different people depending on their personal priorities thus it is impossible to identify some sort of objective tipping point that leads military personnel to decide for or against continued service however based on survey research focus groups and individual interviews it is possible to get general idea of the most important factors affecting retention decisions at given point in time the factors most commonly cited as the causes of recent military retention shortfalls are identified and discussed below thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs32 43see crs issue brief ib10089 military pay and benefits key questions and answers by robert goldich

46despite this statutory formula which could operate each year without any intervention congress passed laws that mandated specific pay raises for the military each year in general these pay raises were identical to that determined by the eci minus 05 formula although congress specified pay raises higher than the statutory formula in fy1997 and fy1999factors are not mutually exclusive and should not be seen as competing explanations but instead as partial answers to the question why have the military services experienced retention shortfalls additionally the factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance for it is not entirely clear what the relative importance of these factors is finally it should be pointed out that congress and the executive branch have already taken number of steps to address these issues they are listed in the next section perceived cause 1 relative value of pay and benefits in 1999 survey of active duty personnel administered by the department of defense respondents were asked to choose the most important factor for leaving or considering leaving active duty the most commonly cited response was basic pay 282 indeed many commentators have argued that the major reason for the militarys recent retention shortfalls is the gap between military pay levels and civilian pay levels as pointed out in the previous section on recruiting there is robust debate among compensation analysts over whether such pay gap actually exists43 however it is clear that the vast majority of military personnel believe that it does in the 1999 survey just mentioned twothirds of the respondents indicated that they would receive better total compensation package pay benefits bonuses and allowances in the civilian world than they were receiving in the military contributing to this belief may be the well publicized manner in which military pay raises were calculated throughout most of the 1990s since 1967 federal law has provided that military pay be adjusted upward at the same time and by the same percentage as the average increase in the pay rates for federal general schedule gs employees44 in 1990 congress enacted statutory formula for federal civilian pay raises that beginning in fiscal year 1992 provided for an annual increase of 05 less than the annual increase in the private sector wages and salaries component of the employment compensation index eci45 thus by statute military pay raises were supposed to be determined by the an eci minus 05 formula although this was not always the case in fact46 as the eci is considered standard measure of the rate at which civilian compensation rates are increasing military personnel likely saw the eci minus 05 formula as evidence that their wages were not keeping up with those of private sector employees another factor cited by some as contributing to military retention shortfalls was changes in military benefits most notably retirement pay major change was madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs33 47nonetheless even under redux military retirement would compare quite favorably with most civilian retirement systems as it continued to contain distinctive feature eligibility for retired pay after 20 years of service regardless of age 48pl 10665 sections 641644 the law repealed compulsory redux and gave military personnel the option of retiring under the old more generous preredux retirement pay computation formula or retiring under redux with an immediate cash bonus 49general accounting office report gaonsiad99197br perspectives of surveyed service members in retention critical specialties august 1999 50general accounting office report gaonsiad99197br perspectives of surveyed service members in retention critical specialties august 1999 p 25to the military retirement system in 1986 under the military retirement reform act of 1986 military personnel who first entered military service on or after august 1 1986 would receive less generous retirement plan than those who first entered military service before that date the new retirement plan known as redux was unpopular among the servicemembers who fell under its provisions47 although one actually received reduced benefits under this plan compulsory redux was repealed in 199948 seven years before the first redux payments would have been made some have argued that the existence of redux had negative effect on retention rates in the later half of the 1990s from this perspective the diminished retirement benefit available to redux eligible servicemembers did not provide sufficient incentive for them to stay in the military for full career it does not appear that researchers have been able to document an empirical link between redux and lower retention rates retirement benefits are also cited as special concern for personnel in critical occupational specialties in survey conducted in 1998 and 199949 officers in critical skill specialties who indicated an intention to leave the military picked retirement pay as one of the top reasons for leaving the military along with frequency of deployments for enlisted personnel in critical specialties basic pay was the most important reason for leaving the military but retirement pay was tied with frequency of deployments for second place50 these concerns about retirement pay can probably be attributed at least in part to the same concerns about redux that other servicemembers may have had at that time however another cause of this concern about retired pay may be the way in which retired pay is calculated and the impact this has on people in critical skill specialties depending on when person first entered military service retired pay is based on either the level of basic pay that the servicemember earned just prior to retirement or on the average of the highest 36 months of basic pay that the servicemember has received during his or her career regardless of which formula is used however basic pay is the only aspect of total compensation that is included in the calculation special pays and bonuses are omitted this is significant for those in critical specialties because they often receive very large bonuses or special pays as an incentive to keep them in the service although these bonuses and special pays may substantially increase their average monthly pay while on active duty it does not enhance their retirement pay thus the value of their retirement pay is relatively lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs34 51see crs report 9841 military readiness operations

may decrease the perceived value of staying in the military long enough to receive retirement benefits perceived cause 2 lower quality of life many servicemembers and outside observers believe that there has been decline in the quality of life associated with military service in the postcold war era during the cold war era the united states was focused primarily on containing the spread of communism with particular emphasis on protecting europe from potential soviet invasion and protecting south korea from potential north korean invasion to facilitate this military posture major bases were maintained in western europe and asia military personnel stationed at these overseas bases had demanding jobs but great efforts were made to provide servicemembers with normal life for example overseas bases typically had most of the amenities of stateside bases and servicemembers families were usually allowed to accompany them with the end of the cold war however the situation changed dramatically although many overseas bases were closed and large number of servicemembers were transferred to stateside bases us military operations around the globe grew in the absence of the soviet threat the us began to focus more on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in underdeveloped parts of the world deployments on these missions typically took servicemembers away from their families for six to nine months and sent them to places with comparatively primitive infrastructures additionally as the number of these military commitments increased during the 1990s and as the size of the military decreased during the drawdown the pace of deployments for individuals increased51 this put new pressures on servicemembers as the time spent on mission preparation deployment and postdeployment reconstitution activities decreased the amount of leisure and family time available nonetheless military deployments do not always correlate with lowered retention rates for example noncommissioned officers ncos in the armys v corps reportedly have higher retention rate than ncos in the other three army corps despite v corps higher rate of deployment52 most studies indicate that provided they are well managed and not excessive deployments can enhance retention by providing participants with sense of accomplishment53 however these studies also indicate that after certain threshold level deployments can have negative effect on retention another quality of life issue that has been raised in recent years is the quality of housing used by military personnel and their families in the military servicemembers either live free of charge in military housing or receive an allowance to pay for civilianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs35 54undersecretary of defense

commander in chief of the us european command recently stated although we continue to make progress as whole family housing throughout europe remains old is in need of extensive repair and modernization and is well below contempora ry standards in the us55 those who receive housing allowance known as basic allowance for housing or bah in lieu of military housing usually have greater flexibility in selecting well maintained housing with modern amenities however as bah currently covers 925 of the average rental cost of civilian housing that meets dod standards servicemembers receiving bah are essentially forced to choose between accepting lowercost below average housing or paying money out of pocket to live in better accommodations recently the senior enlisted members from each of the military services testified that quality of housing was major quality of life concern for their members56 the department of defense is in the midst of multiyear plan to raise bah to 100 of the average rental cost but it will not be completed until 2005 perceived cause 3 decreased job satisfaction retention shortfalls may also be attributed to decrease in the level of job satisfaction reported by military personnel some of the common reasons cited for this decline in job satisfaction include unhappiness with the actions of military superiors lack of enthusiasm for the new missions undertaken by the military in the post cold war era difficulties in accomplishing assigned tasks due to lack of resources and disapproval of changes in the military culture each of these topics is discussed in more detail below dissatisfaction with leadership commonly repeated complaint in recent years especially among lower level officers has been that their supervisors micromanage them do not properly mentor them for more challenging assignments and punish them with career ending evaluation s for comparatively minor mistakes though this type of complaint is not new to the military services some factors may have exacerbated the issue in recent years including the more competitive promotion environment that emerged during the drawdown which may have promoted excessive risk avoidance behaviors on the part of some leaders more extensive and critical media coverage of the behavior of members of the military which may prompt leaders to monitor and control their subordinates more closely and advances in communications technologies which allow superiors at all levels to keep closer track of subordinateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs36 57for examples of

january 18 1999 7 stephanie gutmann todays army warriors continuedchanging mission during the cold war era the mission of the armed forces was clearly defined protect the free world from communism and unmistakably oriented towards fighting massive war for many the knowledge that they were defending the nation and its allies from major threat was psychologically rewarding in itself in the postcold war era the militarys mission shifted toward peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations while these types of missions certainly have their own psychological rewards and were appealing to many military personnel some may have found them less rewarding and not important enough to justify the sacrifices of military life this factor is probably irrelevant now however as the recent terrorist attacks on the united states and the ongoing operations in afghanistan have dramatically reemphasized the militarys mission of defending the nation lack of resources another complaint revolves around shortages of resources necessary to accomplish assigned missions some of the resource shortages cited as interfering with mission accomplishment include insufficient personnel assigned to the unit lack of required equipment shortages of spare parts to repair needed equipment and lack of fuel ammunition and training areas to perform realistic training most of these shortages can be attributed to budgetary decisions although personnel issues are also linked more broadly with recruiting retention training and assignment policies and training area issues are linked with base closure and environmental protection issues as well changing military culture final cluster of issues cited in relation to job dissatisfaction revolve around the ongoing changes in the militarys internal culture and its relationship to the culture of the civilian world the culture of the military is unique and in many ways stands in sharp contrast to the broader american culture the military is hierarchical not egalitarian it is regimented in areas where civilians expect liberty decision making is typically top down rather than democratic although many americans would find this type of environment oppressive others find it quite rewarding for it can instill strong sense of purpose promote deep interpersonal bonds and create powerful sense of community those who do enjoy the unique culture of military life naturally want to see it preserved and express dissatisfaction when they think that it is being changed for the worse complaints that the military way of life is changing for the worse are nothing new but they may have been more highly publicized in the 1990s due to related policy disputes at the federal level some servicemembers resented attempts by policymakers to allow homosexuals to serve in the military to allow women to serve in combat or to change military rules prohibiting adultery and fraternization others perceived deemphasis on traditional military values like courage fidelity and self sacrifice and an increased focus on values like tolerance and compassion57httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs37 57continued vs schoolmarms the wall street journal may 9 2000 58another major change to the military retirement system recently approved by congress allows members of the military to participate in the federal thrift savings plan tsp the tsp which is similar to the 401k plans offered by private corporations allows participants to invest pretax dollars in special account where the invested money and any earnings are not taxed until they are withdrawn beginning in late 2001 military personnel were allowed to contribute up to 5 of their base pay to their tsp in addition they can contribute all or part of any special or incentive pay they earn provided their total contibutions do not exceed the limits set by the internal revenue service this latter provision is considered to be especially attractive to those military personnel serving in retention critical specialities these people often receive large retention bonuses or incentive pays to encourage them to continue military service however these bonuses and special pays are not considered to be part of the salary base for calculating retired pay by allowing these people to deposit all or part of their bonuses and special pays in tsp they can enhance their retirement income at this point however the effect of the tsp on military retention is unclear some have argued that it will have negative effect on retention by providing military personnel with sufficient retirement nest egg to leave the service after ten or fifteen years the congressional response in recent years congress has passed number of laws aimed at improving military retention perhaps the most visible of these initiatives has been string of military pay raises and the repeal of the redux retirement plan other legislative initiatives include pay table reform increased funding for reenlistment bonuses and increased ceilings on reenlistment bonuses and incentive pays with respect to pay congress passed law in 1999 that suspended the eci minus 05 formula discussed previously and replaced it with an eci plus 05 formula for the period fy20012006 under this new formula military personnel will receive pay raises one half of percent higher than the eci and full one percent higher than they would have under the old formula assuming that it is fully implemented this policy will increase the basic pay of military personnel relative to civilian occupations additionally it will probably help dispel any negative perceptions generated by the eci minus 05 formula congress also approved pay table reform initiative in 1999 that increased the pay of certain enlisted personnel and officers the change was most beneficial for midcareer officers providing extra pay to those officers at precisely the time in their careers when they make their most important retention decisions it was also beneficial to some junior and mid career enlisted personnel although they received smaller increases than the officers another major retention initiative passed by congress in 1999 was the repeal of the redux military retirement system as mentioned previously the military retirement reform act of 1986 made major compulsory cuts in the future retired pay of those people who first entered the military on or after august 1 1986 the national defense authorization act for fy2000 repealed the compulsory nature of those cuts by providing affected military personnel with the option upon reaching 15 years of service of electing retirement under the old preredux system or retirement under the redux system with substantial cash bonus58 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs38 59pl 10665 section 618 national

2001 62personnel tempo or perstempo is the rate at which military personnel are deployed away from their home station until recently this was usually measured on unit basis rather than an individual basis however due to 1999 law passed by congress pl106 65 each of the services now track the personnel tempo of each individual this rate of individual personnel tempo is commonly referred to as itempo itempo is simply specific way of measuring perstempocongress has also responded to retention shortfalls in the military by substantially increasing the amount of money available for reenlistment bonuses officer retention bonuses and various special and incentive pays for example congress provided more money than the services requested for selective reenlistment bonuses in fiscal years 19992001 the 106th congress increased the maximum amount of the active duty reenlistment bonus from 45000 to 60000 and established special retention bonus for members of armed forces qualified in critical military skills59 the 106th congress also established extended andor increased bonuses special pays and incentive pays designed to retain personnel in critical military occupations such as aviation health care special warfare and naval surface warfare60 the 107th congress authorized an accession bonus of up to 100000 for new officers in certain critical skill areas and provided authority to the services to allow the transfer of gi bill benefits from an enlisted person in critical skill areas to certain family members as reenlistment incentive61 the executive branch response the executive branch has been very involved in developing policies aimed at improving military retention in addition to recommending andor supporting the legislative policy changes mentioned above the various military services have also enacted administrative policies designed to improve retention rates the most notable of these efforts have been those directed toward better managing personnel tempo62 perstempo reducing manpower shortages in units and improving military housing perhaps the most well known perstempo management initiative has been the implementation of the expeditionary aerospace force eaf concept by the air force the eaf established in 1999 established ten packages of air force units known as aerospace expeditionary forces aefs at any given time two of these aefs are on call for deployment to handle ongoing military operations the other eight are conducting normal training and operations every three months two new aefs rotate into on call status this system provides air force personnel with greater stability provides more planning time for deployments and better distributes the burden of deployment throughout the air forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs39 63this category excludes those reservists who served on active duty under voluntary orders or annual training orders and excludes members of the national guard serving in state status additionally with the exception of those mobilized in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11th it excludes involuntary activations of reservists for domestic reasons such as responding to civic disorders for more information on this topic see crs report rl30637 involuntary reserve activations for us military operations since world war ii by lawrence kapp 64pl 10764 military construction fy2002 appropriations act november 5 2001 65for more information on the military housing privatization initiative see crs report rl31039 military housing privatization initiative background and issues by daniel h continuedanother important perstempo management tool has been the increased use of reserve component forces especially by the air force and the army in the cold war era 19461989 reservists were involuntarily activated for federal service in military operations63 four times an average of about once every decade in the post cold war era 19902001 reservists have been involuntarily activated for federal service in military operations six times an average of about once every two years additionally the services are also making increased use of reserve volunteers to help them conduct operational missions moreover reserve units are increasingly being tasked with missions formerly reserved for active duty units for example the army made historic decision when it selected the 49th armored division from the texas army national guard to serve as the headquarters element for the bosnian peacekeeping mission in 2000 the army also selected six other army national guard units to serve as the headquart ers element in bosnia during later rotations more recently national guard infantry battalion was mobilized to take part in the multinational force and observers mission in the sinai mission normally performed by active component forces another area where the services have taken action is in attempting to reduce manpower shortages in units all of the services have become more aggressive in bringing former military personnel and reservists onto active duty different ways of using existing manpower are also being tried for example the army launched man the force initiative designed to fill combat divisions by transferring individuals from noncombat units such as the training and doctrine command to billets in the armys divisions armored cavalry regiments and certain early deploying units improving military housing has been designated as top priority by the department of defense and the various services as mentioned previously the department of defense is in the midst of multiyear plan to raise the basic allowance for housing to 100 of the average rental cost dod has also requested substantial increases in the amount of money appropriated for military housing in fy2002 in comparison to the funds appropriated in fy2001 dod requested 60 increase in military construction funds for barracks dormitories and similar facilities and requested 13 increase in funds for family housing congress approved these requests and added funds for additional housing projects64 finally the services are also making increased use of their authority under the military housing privatization initiative congressionally authorized program to produce commercially owned and operated housing for military personnel65httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs40 65continued else 66cited by jim garamone dod working on retention challenges american forces press service may 9 2001 67see for example james hosek and mark totten does perstempo hurt reenlistment the continuedresults the retention initiatives taken by both congress and the executive branch appear to be bearing some positive results but there are still areas of concern with respect to retention of enlisted personnel generally the army and the marine corps appear to be doing fairly well however the air force continues to experience retention rates that fall short of its 2nd term and career goals and navy retention rates while improving in fy2001 still bear watching with respect to retention in critical specialties the available data indicate that this continues to be cause of concern for the military recent increases in reenlistment bonuses officer retention bonuses and various special and incentive pays along with the general slowing of the economy and the surge in patriotism following the september 11th terrorist attacks have probably mitigated this problem somewhat but the proof ie the data is not yet in with respect to officers in the o3 paygrade there has been massive exodus from the services in recent years but they are exhibiting somewhat lower than normal retention rate retention rates for officers in the 04 paygrade are little different than they were before the drawdown began factors that could cause shortfalls in the future despite the recent improvements in military retention number of factors could change these trends perhaps the most significant is the increasingly demanding retention environment created by the small cohorts of new accessions brought in during the drawdown era of the 1990s other variables include future perstempo levels and the state of the economy each of these is discussed below factor 1 comparatively small size of certain retention cohorts as mentioned earlier in this report during the postcold war drawdown of the early to mid1990s the army navy and air force reduced their accessions below the level needed to sustain the force as way of meeting their endstrength goals as result the cohorts that entered the services during these years are comparatively small these smaller cohorts will create more challenging retention environment in future years when the comparatively low number of recruits in these cohorts finish their enlistments and begin to make retention decisions in order to meet their needs for midlevel enlisted personnel the affected services will need to achieve higher than normal retention rate this factor is even more of an issue in certain retention critical specialties according to vice admiral patricia tracey deputy assistant secretary of defense for military personnel policy the services will need virtually 100 continuation rate66 to sustain normal manning in certain specialized skill areas factor 2 perstempo level another factor that could negatively impact retention rates would be high perstempo level although deployments can have positive effect on retention studies indicate that after certain threshold level high perstempo levels have negative effect on retention67 while it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs41 67continued effect of long or hostile perstempo on reenlistment rand 1998 paul sticha paul hogan and maris diane personnel tempo definition measurement and effects on retention readiness and quality of life army research institute 1999 and peter francis optempo and readiness center for naval analysis 1999difficult to assess just where this threshold level is it is possible that future increases in perstempo levels could have negative effect on retention factor 3 competition with civilian employers the united states is currently in the midst of an economic slowdown this benefits military retention as it reduces the attractiveness of leaving the military however as the economy tends to follow cyclical trend it is likely that the currently sluggish economy will be replaced in the not too distant future by more robust one such revival would create more civilian employment opportunities for military personnel and could create more challenging retention environment on the other hand the vicissitudes of the economy may lead some military members to view the security of military career with greater appreciation options for congress there are number of options that congress could consider to address retention shortfalls below is list of policies that could be used to respond to one or more of the factors mentioned above grouped under four broad headings more competitive pay and benefits this response could be effective if it appeared that serious retention shortfalls were being caused primarily by increased competition with civilian employers as mentioned previously aggregate retention rates in the military are the product of thousands of individual decisions on whether or not to stay in the military these individual decisions it is believed are based on the individuals answer to one basic question would i be better off if i stayed in or left the military major factor in this calculation is military compensation pay and benefits or more specifical ly the perceived value of military compensation relative to civilian compensation pay acrosstheboard pay raises would be an option to improve the perceived competitiveness of military compensation however they are expensive and some argue that they are inefficient because they give raises to people in pay grades or occupational specialties that do not have retention shortfalls another option would be to target pay raises towards retention critical pay grades this can also be problemati c however as it can distort the relationship between pay grades and minimize the incentive to get promoted for example targeted pay raises might enable lower ranking members to make nearly as much higher ranking members phenomenon known as pay compression or more than higher ranking members phenomenon known as pay inversion another option should congress view this as problem would be to increase total pay in targeted manner by increasing re enlistment or retention bonuses for those in retention critical occupational skills pay grades or retention cohorts it might be considered if the projected shortfalls occur due to the comparatively small size of certain retention cohorts mentioned abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs42 68rick maze pentagon opposes gi bill transfer to family members army times september 11 2001 10 69vince crawley expanding gi bill gets dod support marine corps times march 12 2001 20benefits with respect to benefits the military currently offers number of valuable benefits to servicemembers including health care generous non contributory retirement plan educational benefits subsidized grocery stores and free or inexpensive access to various recreational facilities congress might consider enhancing these benefits or expanding certain benefits to family members retention officers and career counselors will often repeat the adage that individuals enlist but families reenlist this summarizes the belief that servicemembers decisions are profoundly affected by the attitudes of their spouses and children in light of this an option to encourage retention would be to provide more benefits to family members particularly spouses for example congress recently gave the services the authority to allow certain military personnel to transfer their gi bill benefits to their spouse or children as reenlistment incentive while this will likely increase the cost of the gi bill program as the benefit likely will be utilized more often it arguably provides family members with significant incentive to endure the hardships of military family life if this program is successful it may be worth further consideration the department of defense has opposed efforts to transfer gi bill benefits to family members in the past on the grounds that it is an untested concept could be very expensive and could hurt recruiting efforts in the future because children of servicemembers who are an excellent source of recruits would not need to join the service to acquire gi bill benefits68 however deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz indicated at his senate confirmation hearing in 2001 that he favored expanded family educational benefits69 increased funding for operations and maintenance one of the issues commonly cited as cause of retention shortfalls is decreased job satisfaction there are several components to this sense of dissatisfaction not all of which are easy to resolve through congressional action dissatisfaction over the level of resources provided could be addressed by congress if it were deemed major problem increasing the amount equipment spare parts ammunition fuel and related supplies might mitigate significan t source of job dissatisfaction among some military personnel however increasing funding of operations and maintenance accounts might have negative impact on other budgetary priorities more flexible career path s another strategy for improving job satisfaction some analysts suggest would be to make military career paths more flexible thereby giving military personnel more control over their professional development at present the military personnel system usually requires servicemembers to serve in fairly rigid progressio n of assignments involving frequent moves and constant rotation into new jobs some have argued that this system should be modified to allow individuals greater involvement in their duty assignments for example by allowing them to stay longer at given assignment or in given pay grade if they so desire on the other hand longer tours would mean that military personnel would receive narrower array of job experiences during thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31297crs43 course of their careers and staying longer in given pay grade could reduce promotion rates for more junior personnel another option might be to expand current programs that allow military personnel usually officers to earn an advanced degree at civilian university or to learn the best business practices of given industry by working for corporation while remaining on active duty in exchange for this opportunity the servicemember must agree to serve specified number of years in the military at the completion of the program generally the service obligation is three years for every year in the program this type of program might be extended to more officers and enlisted personnel as well the military could benefit from this both by obtaining substantial service obligations from participating servicemembers and by obtaining better educated or more highly trained employees the downside of course is that servicemembers are unavailable for military duties while enrolled in these programs less expensive variation of this would be to allow unpaid sabbaticals for year or eighteen months to allow military personnel to take break from military life without damaging their careers this option might be an especially useful tool for retaining those who basically enjoy military life but who have need temporary break in service to attend to family problems or to recover from burn out reduced perstempo levels this response would likely be effective if retention shortfalls were caused primarily by dissatisfaction with high rates of deployment away from home station perstempo management is generally considered to be an executive branch function but congress certainly has the ability to influence perstempo levels in number of ways two of the most obvious are providing funding for fewer military commitments or alternatively increasing the number of military personnel available to handle existing or future commitments other options frequently mentioned include requiring greater use of reserve component forces or civilian contractors another option often mentioned with respect to the various services transformation initiatives would be to promote the procurements of various systems that reduce the demands on military manpower for instance plans for new navy destroyer call for crew of about 95 people as compared to crew of more than 300 for current navy destroyers
