congress introduction the constitution divides the foreign policy powers between the president and congress but not in definitive manner edward s corwin wrote1 what the constitution does and all that it does is to confer on the presiden t certain powers capable of affecting ur foreign relations and certain other powers of the same general kind on the senate and still other such powers on congress but which of these organs shall have the deci sive and final voice in determining the course of the american nation is left for events to resolve2 events have confirmed that together the president and congress make foreign policy but they have not resolved the question of which branch originates or finally determines policy the two branches share in the process and each plays an important but different role the question of who makes foreign policy does not have more precise answer for several reasons first us foreign policy is not created in vacuum as some sort of indivisible whole with single grand design rather making foreign policy is prolonge d process involving many actors and comprising dozens of individual policies toward different countries regions and functional problems second the comp lex process of determining foreign policy makes it difficult to decide who should be credited with initiat ing or altering any particular foreign policy the two branches constantly interact and influence each other under thes circumstanc it is difficult to trace an idea back to its origin determine when proposal actually influences policy and decide when modification creates ne w policy3 third the roles and relative influence of the two branches in making foreig n policy differ from time to time according to such factors as the personalities of th president and members of congress and the degree of consensus on policy throughout american history there have been ebbs and flows of presidential an dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30193crs2 cheever daniel s and h field haviland

dominance reaching it s height in 1991 during operation desert storm against iraq6 in the postpersian gulf war era both president and the co ngress are confronted with issues in foreign policy that may well define whi ch branch of government will play the dominant role during the first decade of the twentyfirst century for many years perception existed that the executive branch usually initiated foreign policy with the impl ication that this relegated congress to an inconsequential role writing in 1950 robert dahl wrote perhaps the single most important fac t about congress and its role in foreign policy therefore is that it rarely provides the initiative most often initiative springs from the executiveadministrative branch7 in 1962 ja mes robinson studied 22 case studies of foreign policies over th previous 30 years and found three cases of congressional initiative the 1943 repeal of the chinese exclusion laws the 1943 fulbright resolution calling for postwa r participation in an international organization and the 1958 monroney resolutio n proposing the international development association francis wilcox who was8 staff director of the senate foreign relations committee from 19471955 an d assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs from 19551961 has argued however that some of the most imaginative and constructive foreig n policies since world war ii have originated in congress9 in the period after the vietnam war congress reasserted its role in foreig n policy it on occasion initiated new policies and ex erted decisive influence on policies initiated by the executive branch one study on the subject concluded that the fact remains that the president is still in charge of american foreign policy but it noted also that the american

foreign policy six utilized by the president or the exe cutive branch and six utilized by the congress attempt has been made to measure how often the various practices are used however the findings of the report are consistent with corwins classic statemen t that actual practice under the constitution has shown that while the president i s usually in position to propose the senate and the congress are often in technical position at least to dispose the verdict of history in short is that the power to determine the substantive content of american foreign policy is divided power with the lions share falling usually though by means always to th president12 this report does not attempt to define how policy is made within branch as this is complex and varied process and would require detailed study of each case several case studies of this type are indicated in footno tes and illustrations mentioned in the report highlight some of the many individuals and groups within each branch who contribute to policy formation similarly the report does not examine th e13 influence of groups outside the executive and legisla tive branches but the illustrations show that such groups including

reverse the impact of his position response to foreign events current events in foreign countries or sudden action by foreign government often challenge us interests as spokesman and head of the foreign service th armed forces the intelligence services and the bureaucracy the president usuall responds to such events and thus initiates us policy congress ordinarily supports the president but on occasion seeks change in policy for example congress supported president reagan in the falkland islands crisis between argentina and the united kingdom after argentina in april 1982 seized and occupied the falkland islands which the united kingdom claimed as crow n colony the us executive branch sought to mediate the dispute when argentin refused one of the us peace overtures secretary of state alexander hai g announced that the united states would p rohibit arms sales to argentina and provide material support for british operati ons both houses of congress passed resolutions

in the multinational force in lebanon for 18 months after terrorist bombin g16 attack in beirut on october 23 1983 that killed more than 200 marines president reagan first took the position that the united states had vital national interests i n lebanon and would continue to participate in the multinational force prominen t members of congress questioned the policy and some proposed an amendment

accordingly proposes legislation t congress congressional approval in this situation is essential congress may play more or less active role in the development of the legislation modifying th administration bill or developing entirely new legislation of its own the classic example of policy proposed by the admin istration but subsequently develope d by both branches working together cooperatively is the marshall plan20 on june 5 1947 secretary of state george marshall proposed us assistance fo r european recovery on condition that the euro pean nations initiate and agree on plans for an aid program the we stern european governments responded with proposal for progr am based on 4 years of us assistance to allow sufficient time fo r consideration president truman requested an interim aid program that was passe d by congress in december 1947 he then submitted to congress the proposal for the longer term europea n recovery program congress created select committee on foreign aid that made an independent study of the needs in europe the senat foreign relations and house foreign affairs committees also held extensiv hearings and the legislation that emerged was widely considered to be the product of bipartisan joint effort of both branches since then presidents have annually proposed foreign assistance programs that congress has authorized or appropr iated after modifying as it saw fit often using the legislation as vehicle for initiatives of its own in 1978 for example congres s required n ew emphasis in both bilateral and multilateral aid for programs designed to meet basic human needs and also launched women in development program to promote attention to women in the economic development process after21 democrati c reforms occurred in poland and

programs all suc h assistance efforts were aimed at advancing democratization in russia 23 negotiation of international agreements the power of negotiatio n gives the executive branch dominant role in making foreign policy through international agreements but the president must take int account congressional opinion because often agreements must be approved by th senate or congress congress also influences agreements by placing in legislatio n instructions and views concerning international agreements indicating throug h various means what kind of agreement would be acceptable and attachin g reservations or other conditions when approving an agreement few international agreements might be called sole executive agreements because the preside nt considers that he has the authority to conclude them under his own powers and does not submit them to the senate as treaties nor to congress for approval examples are the yalta agreement of 1945 the vietnam peac e24 agreem ent of 1973 the iranian hostage agreement of 1981 and the afghanista n settlement agreement of april 14 1988 most international agreements however have some form of congressiona l participation the senate must approve treaties by twothirds majority the bulk of executive agreements are either authorized by congress prior to their conclusion or approved after their conclusion and might be called congressionalexecutiv agreements as an example of prior action congress has authorized the executive branch to conclude agreements on military and economic assistance space an d nuclear energy cooperation and foreign trade nd has set forth goals guidelines and criteria in the authorizing legislation as an example of action after conclusion congress approved the salt i interi m agreement of

process had been developed during the nixon and for d administrations to protect presidents ability to negotiate trade agreements wit h some confidence that they would not be undermined later by congress through the traditional rules applied to legislation under fasttrack rules congress was given 90 days to take action on the implementing bill af ter its formal introduction congress could not amend the bill each congressional committee of jurisdiction was given 45 days to review the proposed legislation the proposed bill was then only subject to yes or vote in the house and the senate since congress could not amend the final legislation practice developed over the years whereby informal committe markup sessions were held on the draft impl ementing bills to indicate to the president key areas of congressional concern regarding the specific trade legislation thi s process afforded the president the opportunity to address these concerns as h deemed appropriate prior to s ubmitting final bill to implement the trade agreement the debates over the nafta and the gat t uruguay round agreements were very contentious following passage of the implementing vehicle for the latter in lam duck session of congress in late 1994 the presidents authority to use fasttrack procedures lapsed subsequent effort by the clinton administration to secur renewal of this authority was dropped in late

the parliamentary assembly of the organization on security and cooperation in europe where their views may affect the perspectives and votes of members from other participating nations 29 whenever implementation of the measures promised by the executive i n unilateral or joint statements requires legislation or approp riations congress has more power in deciding whether to support or modify us policy when th administration pledges funds to the multilateral development banks for example the funds must be authorized and appropriated b congress the united states could not increase its quota in the international mon etary fund for assistance to russia in 1992 until congress appropriated the necessary funds30 policy implementation even when congress establishes foreign policy through legislation th administration continues to shape policy as it interprets and applies the variou s provisions of law this is illustrated in arms sales policy congress has established the objectives and criteria for arms sales to foreign countries in the arms expor t control act and it has required advance notification of major arms sales and provided procedures for halting sale it disapproves but th executive branch makes the daily decisions on whether or not to sell arms to specific countries and what weapon s systems to provide as an exa mple on september 14 1992 president bush notified congress of his intention to sell 72 f15 fi ghter aircraft to saudi arabia and after the 30day congressional review period expired the sale proceeded congress has found it necessary to maintain close supervision to prevent sales particularly to middle eastern countries that it did not approve in some cases it s actions had the effect of halting sales and it has frequently brought about changes in

mexica n default on billions f dollars worth of debt obligations in early 1995 the presidents economic advisors crafted package of support for mexico that did not require congressional vote on the controversial proposal this action was taken when i t appeared possible that congress would not enact the administrations legislation to deal with the crisis the independent initiative by president clinton included 2 0 billion in credits from the exchange stabilization fund esf of the treasur department which is normally use d to stabilize the us dollars value 10 billion in credits from the bank for international settlements and 178 billion from th international monetary fund imf the clinton administrations independen t intervention in the mexican peso crisis led to significant criticism in

approval of twothirds of the senate or majority of both houses of congress senator goldwater also introduced legislation to bar the president from terminating other defense treaties without congressional participation while neither effort was successful they illustrated that in undertaking independent action the president risks punitive action by congress that may reduce future flexibility in foreign policy actions the congress as initiator following are six basic ways in which congress can originate or shape foreign policy in these circumstances the executive branch is put in the position f responding positively to the congressiona l initiative or seeking to adjust or reverse its impact on the course of foreign policy resolutions and policy statements every year members of congress introduce large numbers of simple r concurrent resolutions stating the sense of t he house senate or congress on foreign policy and many such resolutions are adopted many observers are skeptical about the effectiveness f these sense of the house senate or congress resolutions like presidential policy statements they express the policy of single branch f government but their effect is often weaker because congress does not execut policy since simple and concurrent re solutions are not legally binding the executive branch often ignores them in carrying out foreign policy nevertheless sometimes such resolutions pla significant role in foreign policy by launchi ng new idea or promoting new policy s res 264 introduced b senator s mike monroney and adopted july 23 1958 led to the establishment of the international development association as an affiliate of the world ban k designed to make lowinte rest longterm loans in 1973 the senate adopted s res 71 introduced by senator claiborne pell calling for an international agreemen t prohibiting environmental or geophy sical modification activity as weapon of war such an agreement was subsequently negotiated and ratified by the united states in 1979 in 1979 the house passed h res 321 urging the united nations to convene an emergency session of the general assembly to deal with the refugee crisis i n southeast asia this added to other calls for such conference and subsequently united nations conference was convened in july 1979 hcon res 248 adopted september 17 1990 called for higher priority for environm

using legislation to establish new program set objectives and guidelines uthorize and direct the executive branch to undertake specified activities and by earmarking appropriations to be used in specified way the executive branch influences this kind of policy initiative because member s regularly seek administration views in the process of formulatin g legislation the president must approve

example is the congres sional effort in the 1980s to pass legislation imposing economic and other sanctions against south africa the effort was widely seen t have prodded the reagan administration to establish limited economic sanctions dissatisfied with the adminis trations policy of constructive engagement and quiet diplomacy to bring an nd to apartheid in south africa the house in 1983 approved legislation applying sanctions against south africa as part of an extension of th export admini stration act but the bill was rejected by the senate toward the end of 1984 american civil rights leaders began daily protests at the south africa n embassy in washi ngton to focus greater attention on racial violence in south africa and the repressive policies of the white minorit government in

legislative restrictionsfunding denials congress has been most visible in its foreign policy role when it has place d legislation prohibitions or other limitations on the presidents freedom of action i n foreign affairs often these measures have been ame ndments to legislation authorizing or approp riating funds that the president was unlikely to veto the use of fundin g restrictions or denials by congress i s classic illustration of the power of the purse under the constitution unlike other legislative action by congress its use is t subject to serious challenge by the president as an unconstitutional infringement on the presidents foreign policy powers major legislative executive confrontations have occurred when such restrictions have been passed despite the opposition of th president some examples follow on january 23 1973 president nixon announced the signing of the paris peace accords to end us involvement in the vietnam war but attac ks by the khmer rouge in cambodia continued and the united states resumed bombing in cambodia the administration wanted to maintain freedom of us action if north vietnam or it s communi st associates violated the accords but congress

their opposition to the khmer rouge and the aid program was changed from covert to an overt one which could be more openly debated 53 oversight of policy congress shapes foreign policy through regular oversight of executive branc h implementation of foreign policy this involves such mechanisms as hearings an d investigations in particular hearings on annual authorizations and appropriations of funds for executive branch agencies carrying out foreign policy provide n opportunity for committee members to question and influence activities and policies the senate foreign relations and house int
