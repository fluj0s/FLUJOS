hconres 95 required that mandatory spending be reduced by 35 billion and re venues be reduced by more than 70 billion over the next five years congress passed and the president signed reconciliation bill pl 109 171 to reduce mandatory spending by 39 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 revenue reduction reconcilia tion bill hr 4297 has not been enacted as of the date of th is report many argue that tax and spending reductions will stimulate economic growth whereas many others argue that tax cuts will lead to larger deficit with adverse economic effects and that spending cuts will reduce critical government services this report examines the effects of government spending and taxation on ec onomic growth and economic wellbeing by comparing the united states with 20 other industr ial organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries among the 21 oecd countries the united states has the fourth smallest public sector with total government federal state and local expenditures amounting to 37 of gross domestic product gdp to tal government spending accounted for 34 of gdp the smallest in ireland nd 59 of gdp the largest in sweden countries with larger government spendi ng relative to gdp tend to have higher productivity growth rates and lower relative poverty rates there appears however to be relation between govern ment spending and gdp growth public social welfare expenditures are the benefits paid by all levels of government providing support to maintain welfare the level of social welfare spending varies from country to countr the marketoriented englishspeaking countries such as the united states tend to have social welfar expenditures equal to about 15 of gdp whereas the welfarest ate scandinavian c ountries spend much more typically about 25 of gdp the ev idence suggests that public social welfare expenditures do not have an adverse effect on the economy but these expenditures can improve economic wellbe ing countries with higher public social welfare expenditures relative to gdp ve lower relative poverty rates the major source of funding for gove rnment expenditure s is tax revenues taxes have an effect on government budget s and most people would agree that they also have an effect on the economy th evidence suggests how ever that countries with high tax revenues relative to gdp do not generally experience lower economic growth rates than countries with lower tax revenues some scholars argue that countries with higher taxes to fund higher social welfare spending tend to choose the types of taxes with the sm allest economic distortions many scholars argue that longterm budget deficits can have an adverse impact on the economy the evidence suggests that countries with larger budget surpluses tend to have higher economic growth rate s and that sustained government budget deficits are likely to reduce longterm economic growth this report will not be

government expenditure s in fy2003 were 21599 billion but the federal government is not one in spending state and local governments also spent 21642 billion the combined federal state and local government budget deficit was equivalent to 46 of gross domestic product although it is recognized that budget deficits created through either sp ending increases or tax cuts provide shortterm stimulus to the economy it is so generally agreed that persistent budget deficits can have harmful longterm economic effects1 for the past few years there has been vigorous debate at all levels of government on the best way to reduce and eliminate budget deficits raise taxes reduce taxes or reduce spending at the federal level the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 required that mandatory spending that is spending for entitlement programs be reduced by 35 billion and revenues be reduced by more than 70 billion over the next five years congress eventually passed and the presid ent signed reconciliation bill pl 109 171 to reduce mandatory spending by 39 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 the majority of the reductions are in medicare medicaid and student loans for higher

spending and making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent the president and the republican congressi onal leadership argue that the fy2007 proposals will facilitate economic growth nd job creation and otherwise ensure strong economy in the future on the other side the demo cratic congressional leadership argues that tax cuts will lead to ballooning federal deficit with adverse economic effects and that spending cuts will reduce critical government services government spending and taxation can have significant effects on the economy and on the lives of individuals this report examines the

good firm will typically base its pricin g policy on the costs it incurs in the production of the good and not on the total costs which includes the cost placed on society from the pollution 4 see crs report rl32162 the size and role of government economic issues by marc labonte 5 total government spending includes spending at all levels of government such as state and local as well as the federal or central governme nt on average central government spending accounts for 58 of total government expenditu res for the 21 countries considered in the report the range is from low of 30 to hi gh of 91 given this wide disparity in the importance of the central government spending total government expenditures and revenues are examined in this reportfrom previous studies and uses data from 21 industrial countries to compare the us experience with that of other countries2 the size of the public sector in the economy government carries out number of important economic functions one of those functions is to correct inefficiencies or distorti ons in the allocation of goods and services this may take the form of levying taxes or providing subsidies to correct externalities providing public g oods such as national defense and police protection or regulating monopolies3 another function of government is to redistribute income and wealth through th use of taxes and transfers lastly government can have an economic stabilizing function to reduce unemployment or inflation in performing these functions however government may also introduce inefficiencies or dist ortions in the market one issue that often generates vigorous bate is the proper size of government4 mostly this debate is qualitative rather than quantitative in that most argue over whether the public sector is too large or too small there is standard for the optimal size of the public s ector and there is agreed upon way to measure public sector size in this report the size of the public sector will be measured by the ratio of government expenditures to gross dom estic product gdp us public sector size will be judged by comparing this ra tio to the same ratio for other industrial countries government plays significant role in the nations economy but the role varies dramatically from country to country figure 1 shows total government spending as percentage of gdp in 20035 total government spending accounted for 34 of gdp in ireland and 59 of gdp in swed among these 21 countries the united states has the fourth smallest public sect or with government expenditures amounting to 37 of gdp in general the scandi navian and continental european countries have relatively large public sectors whic h amount to 50 or more of gdp the englishspeaking countries as well as ja pan and

development oecd economic theory does not predict an mbiguous effect of government policy on economic growth traditional growth models suggest that longterm growth in output and productivity are due to growth in population and exogenous technical progress which are unaffected by govern ment policy newer growth models however suggest that government policies that increase investment in physical and human capital can raise longterm growth empirical research as well has found that the size of government has ambiguous effects on economic growth some studies find positive effects and others find ne gative effects one study found that government consumption ex penditures have negative effect on economic growth but consumption expenditures are fairly sm all part of total g overnment spending the same study finds that other government functions such as investment spending for physical and human capital as well as high quality bureaucracy have positive effect on economic growth6 table 1

relation between the two variables 8 the 10year averages are used so as to average out the effects of business cycle fluctuations in these economic variables 9 the standard error is also estimated along w ith the correlation the standard error is used to test the hypothesis that the estimated correla tion coefficient is equal to zero that is correlation precisely estimated correlations ve small standard errors and the hypothesis of correlation can usually be rejected when the hypothesis of correlation is rejected the correlation is said to be statistically significant 10 the relative poverty rate is the percentage of the population with adjusted family income below 50 of median family income this poverty threshold is commonly used for international comparisons of poverty because there is internationally accepted official poverty threshold using this poverty threshold produces poverty rate for the united states that is about 5 percenta ge points higher than the official poverty rate the relative poverty rate is available only for 2000 for thes countries for discussion and comparison of alternative poverty measures across countries see timothy smeeding poor people in continuedcorrelation with the 10year average annual real gdp growth rate8 the estimated correlation is fairly small and is not precisely estimated thus correlation of zero cannot be ruled out and the correlation is sa id to be not statistically significant9 consequently there is pparent relation between these two variables as an example both the united states and finl and have experienced average annual real gdp growth rates of 33 over the past 10 years yet finlands government expenditures are equivalent to 543 of gdp compared to 359 for the united states table 1 correlations with 10year

countries table 2 shows the percentage of government spending devoted to five government functions in 200311 the countries are organized into four bloc ks the continental european countries the englishspeaking countries the scandinavi an countries and ja pan and switzerland12 the average size of the public sector in each block is about wh at would be expected see figure 1 the scandinavian countries with their large welfare systems have the largest public sector with government spending equivalent to about 53 of gdp the englishspeaking countries which are mo re market oriented have smaller public sectors that are equivalent to about 38 of gdp the continental european countries fall between these two extremes the public sectors in japan and switzerland are about the same size as the public sectors in the englishspeaking countries surveyed although the overall size of the us pub lic sector is not much different from that of other englishspeaking countries u s spending prioritie s are very different first the united states devotes much greater share of government expenditures to defense than any other country13 part of this is due to the role the united states military plays in protecting europe and ja pan second the us allocates larger proportion of government expenditures fo r health and education than do most countries lastly the share of government

intuition behind this principle is quite si mple as more and more of one input into the production process is used holding the amount of all other inputs constant the increases in output become smaller and smaller nd average output per unit of input falls 20 xavier salaimartin positive theory of social security journal of economic continuedprograms have disincentive effect s which can affect the economy15 providing people with income if they dont work could take productive people out of the workforce thus reducing output there ar two sources of disincentives in many social programs first when income increases individuals tend to purchase more goods and services including leisure that is time not working this is called the income effect and has negative effect on work effort second many social programs reduce bene fits as an individuals earnings rise this acts as an implicit tax on earnings for example social security has retirement earnings test which reduces social security benefits to beneficiaries who are under the normal retirement age by 1 fo r every 2 in earnings above an annual earnings limit16 this benefit reduction is compar able to 50 tax rate on earnings above the limit combined with federal stat and local taxes the increase in total income may be only few cents for ever 2 earned the price an individual pays for leisure is forgone wages as the wage rate falls because of implicit and explicit taxes the price of leisure falls and the individual will typically work less that is purchase more leisure this effect is called the substitution effect in the case of most social programs both the income and substitution effects act to reduce the work effort of beneficiaries for example research has shown that unemployed workers receiving unemployment insurance tend to remain unemployed longer than other unemployed workers17 in addition social security beneficiaries subject to the retirement earnings test have been found to limit work hours to keep their annual earnings below the earnings limit18 removing workers from the workfor ce however could boost productivity in two ways first the principle of diminishing marginal returns suggests that as the workforce is reduced holding the amount of other inputs constant both marginal and average productivity will increase19 second some argue that the people receiving these benefits tend to be less productive than current workers consequently economic grow th and productivity may not be seriously affected by the provision of social benefits20 for example evid ence from oecd

health care sp ending rather than just public health spending both public and private health expenditures will be the focus of attention furthermore although public health spe nding affects the budget both public and private health spending will affect the ec onomy also since di fferent countries have different ratios of public to private h ealth spending examining both public and private health spending may provide insigh t into the effectiveness of public versus private spending on average the 21 countries devote the equivalent of about 65 of gdp for government health spending see figure 7

also have an effect on the economy how taxes affect the economy depends on how they affect work effort investment nd saving the effects that taxes have on individuals can be decomposed into the income and substitution effects an increase in the tax on most goods for example s negative income and substitution effect and individuals will typically wish to purch ase less of the good an increase in taxes on wages will have income nd substitution effects that work in opposite directionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33343crs19 40 leisure not working can be thought of as normal good with price equal to the wage if the price of leisure falls workers will typically want to purchase more leisure and work less 41 the size of the deadweight loss depends on the extent to which behaviors change as result

journal vol 53 2 jun 2000 pp 253272 43 the simple correlation is 006 and is not statistically significantthe tax lowers the effective wage which will typically cause people to want to work less40 but the tax also reduces income which will typically cause people to want to work more the ultimate effect on work effort depends on the relative magnitudes of these two effects similar income and substitution effects also apply to saving consequently peoples be havior may change due to tax changes the distortions introduced by taxes can lead to misallocation of resources and lost output the misallocation of resources due to taxes can be measured by the excess burden or deadweight loss of the tax mo st researchers find deadweight loss from taxes but there is little agreement on the size of the deadweight loss41 yewkwang ng points out that the estimated deadweight loss may be considerably less if the positive effects on the spending side are taken into account42 he also argues that the income taxes themselves may be correc ting distortion in the economy and could lead to more efficient allocation of resources for example most economic measures ignore the social goal of environmental quality if there is positive relation between per capita income and environmental degradation then income taxes may reduce this distortion figure 9 shows the relationship between tota l tax revenues as percentage of gdp and the average real gdp growth rates in the industrialized countries both are 10year averages the figure shows that there is relation since the fitted linear relationship the straight line in the figure is almost flat43 this suggests that countries with high tax re venues relative to gdp do not generally experience lower economic growth rates than count

that rising marginal tax rates had eff ect on economic growth rates48 source crs calculations of oecd data the observation that taxe s may have little effect on economic growth may be partially due to gove rnment spending tax revenues ar either spent or are used to retire government debt both of which may boost economic growth many studies do not separate the effects of government spending on economic growth from the effects of taxes in addition some researchers argue that the welfare states tend to rely on regressive taxes as primary source of re venue and these taxes tend to have

to gdp also tend to have higher average effective tax rates on income higher taxes on consumption and lower taxes on capital he further shows that the welfare states tend to have heavier taxes on consumption goods that may be considered bad such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline government budget deficits the evidence presented so far although not definitive suggests that government expenditures social welfare expenditures and taxes do not adversely affect economic growth raising government spending nd taxes does not appear to reduce economic growth and reducing government spending and taxes does not appear to enhance economic growth but much of the focus recently and in the past has been on budget deficits especially on how defic its affect longterm economic growth the measure of the budget deficit used is the primary government balance which is government revenues minus govern ment expenditures but excludes interest payments paid to the public the primary balance provides more direct measure of overall government spending and ta xes in given period whereas interest payments reflect fiscal actions taken in past years th primary government balance reported here is the 10year average 1994 2003 expressed as percentage of gdp the 10year average is used because the pr imary balance fluctuates over the business cycle and different c ountries tend to be at different poi nts of the business cycle at any given time many scholars argue that longterm budget deficits can have an adverse impact on the economy50 figure 11 suggests that the scholars are correct the figure shows the relation between the primary balance and the average annual real gdp growth rate the fitted linear relationship the straight line is upward sloping and the simple correlation between these two variables is 045 which is statistically significant this suggests that countries with rger primary balance tend to have higher economic growth rates51 recent research on budget defi cits in the united states also suggests that sustained budget deficits will impose signifi cant economic costs52 william gale and pe ter orszag for example project that if the federal budget deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33343crs23 averages 35 of gdp for the next decade then national income will be reduced by 1 to 2 per year after the end of the decade source crs calculations of oecd data conclusion the evidence presented suggests that raising public social welfare expenditures within reason would not harm economic growth and reducing these expenditures would not increase economic growth other research supports this conclusion but changing public social welfare expend itures can have prof ound effects on economic wellbeing reducing social welfare ex penditures would likely increase poverty rates the evidence also suggests that although tax reductions boost the economy in the short term they appear to have little effect on longterm economic growth

bases which are available online to subscribers the oecd works to make the data comparable across countries most of the data series are available for all the industrial countries considered in the report up to 2003 the data on social welfare expenditures are available only up to 2001 however monetary values for expenditures and revenues are in the currency of the country most of the tax and expenditures data are expressed as percentages of gdp this will provide measure of the resources used or transferred by the government relative to the amount of res ources available in the economy government spending and revenues vary over the cour of the business cycle and some of this variation may not reflect decisions made by the government the 10year averages are calculated for most of the economic series and these averages are used in the report to average out the effects of business cycle fluctuations in the few instances when monetary values need to be compared across countries the values are converted to u s dollars using purchasing power parities ppps ppps convert currency by equalizing the purchasing power of various currencies ppps capture price differences of market basket of goods between countries rather than differe nces in the value of the currencies that is exchange rates exchange rates fl uctuate based on the supply of and demand for currency and can change even when prices are stable in the two countries
