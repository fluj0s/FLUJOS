information about nevada department of human resources v hibbs see crs report rl31604 suits against state employers under the family and medical leave act analysis of nevada department of human resources v continueda leave plan that permitted its employees up to seven months of unpaid sick leave ragsdale was terminat ed after her request for additi onal leave beyond the sevenmonth allowance was exhausted and she was unable to return to work because wolverine world wide never informed ragsdale that 12 weeks of leave under the leave plan would count as her fmla leave ragsdale s ought relief based on the fmla regulation while the court recognized that the secret ary of labors judgment in issuing the regulation must be given cons iderable weight it also acknow ledged that the regulation could not stand if it was arb itrary capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute20 in this case the court maintained that the regulation was invalid because it altered the fmlas cause of action in fundamental way the regulation transformed the companys failure to give notice along with its refusal to grant her more leave into an actionable violation 21 the court noted that to prevail under fm enforcement pr ovisions an employee must prove as threshold matter that the em ployer interfered with restrained or denied the exercise of fmla rights moreover the court observed that even when an employer has engaged in such misconduct the fmla does not provide relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation22 the fmla regulation at issue established an irrebuttable presumption that an employees exercise of fmla rights was impaired without any empirical or logi cal basis for the presumption23 although wolverine world wide had granted ragsdale more than 12 week s of leave the regulation if upheld would permit her to obtain reinstatement and the other relief provided under the statute by granting such relief absent showing of c onsequential harm the regulation worked an end run around important limitations of the statut remedial scheme24 the court contended that the regulation relieves em ployees of the burden of proving any real impairment of their rights and resulting prejudice25 in nevada department of human resources v hibbs the court concluded that state employees could recover money damages from state in federal court for violation

v garrett 531 us 356 2001 blatchford v native village of noatak 501 us 775 1991 in enacting the fmla congress relied on its power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment as well as its authority under the commerce clause of article i however congress may not abrogate the states sovereign immunity pursuant to its article i power over commerce 28 see 29 usc 26114aiii the term employer includes

minimize the potential for employment discrimination on the basi s of sex by ensuring that leave is available for eligible medical reasons and for compelling family reasons on genderneutral basiswork with the nevada depa rtment of human resources welfare division after being told that he had exhausted his fmla leave the court considered the case to resolve split among the us courts of appeals on the question of whether an individual may sue state for money damages in federal c ourt for violation of section 102a1c although the cons titution does not provide generally for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting states it is unders tood that congress may abrogate states immunity in federal court if it makes its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to valid exer cise of its power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment27 because the language of the fmla provides clearly for an employee to seek relief in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction against public agency the court focused on whether congress acted within its constitutional authority when it sought to abrogate the states immunity28 section 5 of the fourteenth amendment gr ants congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees of section 1 of th fourteenth amendment including equal protection of the laws by enacting appropriate legislation29 in the exercise of its authority under section 5 congress may enact prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduc t as way of preventing and deterring unconstitutional conduct30 however to be valid such legi slation must exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prev ented or remedied and the means adopted to that end31 the fmla operates to protect the right to be free from genderbased discrimination in the workplace32 review of the fmlas legislative record by the court indicated that stereotypebased beliefs about the allocation of family dutie s still existed at the time of the measures enactment employers continue d to rely on those beliefs to establishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22090crs6 33 hibbs 538 us at 730 34

moreover congress recognized that the state leave policies that existed prior to the fmlas enactment were limited and would do little to combat stereotypes about the role s of male and female employees34 for example prior to the fmlas enactment seven states had childcare leave provisions that applied only to women35 given these findings the court c oncluded that congre ss was justified in enacting the fmla as remedial legislation in sum the states record of unconstitutional participation in and fostering of genderbased discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justif the enactment of prophylactic section 5 legislation36 focusing specifically on section 102a1 c the court maintained that the provision is congruent and proportional to the ta rgeted violation t he fmla is narrowly targeted at the fault line between work and family precisely where sexbased overgeneralization has been nd remains strongest and aff ects only one aspect of the employment relationship37 the court also cited the fmlas limitations as evidence of its being congruent and proportional for ex ample the statute pplies only to employees who meet specified tenure requirements employees must give advance notice of foreseeable leave 12 weeks rather than longer period wa s selected as the appropriate leave floor these and other limitations led the court to find that section 102a1 is congruent and proportional to its remedial object and can be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior38 because the fmla was found to be va lid exercise of congresss power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment and because the statute provides clearly for relief against public agency including the govern ment of state or political subdivision the court concluded that money damages are available to state employees when the state fails to comply with the fmla
