g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 this report provides an overview of major issues facing veterans health care during the 110th congress the reports primary focus is on veterans and not military retirees while any person who has served in the armed forces of the united states is regarded as veteran military retiree is someone who has generally completed full active duty military career almost always at least 20 years of service or who is disabled in the line of military duty and meets certain length of service and extent of disability criteria and who is eligible for retired pay and broad range of nonmonetary benefits from the department of defense dod after retirement veteran is someone who has served in the armed forces in most but not all cases for few years in early adulthood but may not have either sufficient service or disability to be entitled to postservice retired pay and nonmonetary benefits from dod 1 generally all military retirees are veterans but not all veterans are military retirees for the purposes of veterans benefits veteran is defined as person who served in the active military naval or air service and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable2 currently there are two health care systems that care for servicemembers and veterans the defense health program dhp in the dod provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active duty military personnel and other eligible beneficiaries3 once they are discharged from their respective service branches servicemembers become eligible for care and treatment provided by the

of america the nation has provided benefits in varying degrees to those who have worn the uniform and suffered physical disabilities in service to the nation for instance in 1718 the colony of rhode island enacted legislation that provided benefits not only to every officer soldier or sailor who served in the colonys armed services but also to the wives children parents and other relations who had been dependent upon slain servicemember the physically disabled were to have their wound carefully tended and healed at the colonys expense while at the same time an annual pension was provided to

or other dependent relatives5 while pension and disability benefits provided to veterans were gradually increased and in some cases decreased since the early colonial period hospital and medical care for veterans on level similar to the care provided today was not available until world war i the v health care system has evolved and expanded since world war i congress has enlarged the scope of the v as health care mission and has enacted legislation requiring the establishment of new programs and services through numerous laws some narrowly focused and others more comprehensive congress has also extended to additional categories of veterans eligibility for the many levels of care the v now provides longer health care system focused only on serviceconnected veterans the v has become

understand eligibility for v health care v as enrollment process and its enrollment priority groups unlike medicare or medicaid v health care is not an entitlement program contrary to numerous claims made concerning promises to military personnel and veterans with regard to free health care for life not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from v 26 prior to eligibility reform in 1996 all veterans were technically eligible for some care however the actual provision of care was based on available resources27 the veterans health care eligibility reform act of 1996 pl 104262 established two eligibility categories and required vha to manage the provision of hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system based on system of priorities 28 pl 104262 authorized v to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with serviceconnected disabilities former prisoners of war veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards such as agent orange veterans whose attributable income and net worth are not greater than an established means test and veterans of world war i these veterans are generally known as higher priority or core veterans 29 the other category of veterans are those with serviceconnected disabil ities and with attributable incomes above an established means test pl 104262 also authorized v to establish patient enrollment system to manage access to v health care as stated in the report language accompanying pl 104262 the act would direct the secretary in providin g for the care of core veterans to establish and operate system of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities at the same time it would vest discretion in the secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate 30 furthermore pl 104262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources the committee report accompanying pl 104262 states that the provision of hospital care and medical rvices would be provided to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations acts for these purposes such language is intended to clarify that these services would continue to depend upon discretionary appropriations31 26 for detailed

to manage the delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care the new eligibility standard was created by congress to ensure that medical judgment rather than legal criteria will determine when care

further evaluating these 11804 to determine whether they have actually suffered tbi or whether the symptoms they exhibit are due to other causes such as ptsd or other combatrelated stress representative sample of 127 recently completed evaluations indicated that 41 veterans received definitive diagnosis of tbi suggesting that about onethird 3228 of the veterans who screen positive have actually suffered traumatic brain injury tbi is the result of severe or moderate force to the head where physical portions of the brain are damaged and functioning is impaired co mmon problems after tbi include headache decreased memory slow mental processing poor attention inability to tolerate sound sleep disturbance and irritability closely related to cognitive impairment are emotional issues such as ptsd depression and anxiety disorders these psychological issues often interact with the physical injury to decrease patients overall health status and adherence to medical regimens those who experience tbi may behave impulsively because of damage that removes many of the brains checks on the regulation of behavior without the limits provided by these higher brain functions these individuals may overreact to seemingly innocent or neutral stimuli 88 the outcome of tbi is particularly relevant for understanding ptsd because the amnesia that often occurs with tbi challenges the role of traumatic recollections in the etiology of ptsd studies have shown that in the absence of factual recall individuals have delusions or reconstruct memories of trauma these individuals may retain the delusional memories better than the factual events hence traumatic recall does not have to be accurate or factual to be part of ptsd 89

say that the unpredictable timing if not uncertain funding amounts inherent in the yearly discretionary appropriations process is major management problem for the v furthermore veterans groups have stated that congresss failure to enact appropriations bills by the beginning of the fiscal year adds further strain on the v health care system by postponing the hiring of new medical staff foregoing medical facility maintenance and repairs and thereby compromising on the quality of health care provided to veterans therefore national veterans organizations have been calling for assured funding for veterans health care this has also been called mandatory funding by other veterans advocates this discussion will use mandatory funding to refer to these policy proposals to understand mandatory funding proposals it is essential to understand how v programs are funded presently under current law v programs are funded through both mandatory and discretionary spending authorities the following programs are among mandatory spending programs cash benefit programs that is compensation and pensions and benefits for eligible survivors readjustment benefits education and training special assistance for disabled veterans home loan guarantees and veterans insurance and indemnities each of these programs is an appropriated entitlement that is funded through annual appropriations 91 with any entitlement program because of the underlying law the government is required to provide eligible recipients with the benefits to which they are entitled whatever the cost congress is obliged to appropriate the money necessary to fund the obligation if the amount congress provides in the annual appropriations act is not enough it is obliged to make up the difference in supplemental appropriation like other entitlement programs spending automatically increases or decreases over time as the number of recipients eligible for benefits varies certain of these v entitlement benefits are indexed for inflation the benefit amount will increase automatically based on the measured increase in the costofliving adjustment the remaining v programs primarily health care medical facility construction medical research and v administration are funded through annual discretionary appropriations each year congress takes up the matter of providing budget authority for discretionary programs as such the amount of funds vha can spend on discretionary programs is determined by the amount of its appropriation generally the mandatory funding proposals that have been suggested by veterans advocates are based on formula that takes into account the number of enrolled and nonenrolled veterans eligible for v medical care and the rate of medical care inflation proponents believe that mandatory funding will eliminate the yeartoyear uncertainty about funding levels and close the gap between funding and demand for veterans health care opponents believe that with these proposals spending for vha will increase significantly as enrollment in the v health care system soars in most of the proposed funding formulas automatic funding increases are primarily based on enrollment figures furthermore critics believe that static funding formula cannot adequately take into consideration the changing needs of veterans which could affect the funding level necessary to provide different mix of services and that congress is better able to evaluate the funding needs through the current annual appropriation process for instance not all enrolled veterans use the v health care system in given year should the number of users grow 91 for detailed explanation on appropriated entitlements see crs report rs20129 entitlements and appropriated entitlements in the federal budget

funding would be available for the additional patients with increased utilization of health care services during hearing in the 109th congress chairman buyer of the house veterans affairs committee stated that according to the c ongressional budget office cbo mandatory funding would cost nearly halfatrillion doll ars over ten years that would be costly experiment in contrast the strong discretio nary budgets of the past decade have proven responsive to change92 however cbo stated that although the bill would primarily affect funding for health care services provided by vha it also would result in some savings in direct spending for other government programs primarily medicare and medicaid93 as highlighted by some budget analysts changing veterans medical care into mandatory budget authority may not solve the issue of closing the gap between funding and demand for veterans health care congress can place caps on spending for mandatory programs through budget reconciliation language which would limit spending on veterans health programs 94 since congress can act to change the formula or cap th spending amounts the issue of uncertainty in funding amounts may not be resolved either in recent testimony before the house veterans affairs committee henry j aaron of the brookings institution stated that converting the vha to mandatory funding would not entirely insulate it from budgetary pressures c ongress could cut the per person funding amount or exclude certain groups of veterans from the formula used for computing annual funding 95 the veterans health

group 8 veterans already enrolled in v as health care system is expected to decline from 127 million in fy2005 to 122 millio n in fy2006 this is mostly due to projected death rates for these veterans

would be eligible to participate in the program about 41000 veterans were ultimately deemed eligible to enroll of those veterans about 8300 veterans participated v attributes low participation to the fact that many veterans had already received v services by the start of the program according to the v the tpb program incurred administrative costs associated with contacting private physicians to suggest formulary alternatives as many of them had prescribed medications that were not on v as formulary v has discontinued this pilot program there was considerable interest in the 108 th and 109th
