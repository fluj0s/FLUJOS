the power of congress to investigate5 generally speaking congresss authority to investigate and obtain information including but not limited to confidential information is extremely broad while there is express provision of the constitution or specific statute authorizing the conduct of congressional oversight or investigations the supreme court has firmly established that such power is essential to the legislative function as to be implied from the general vesting of legislative powers in congress 6 the broad legislative authority to seek and enforce informational demands was unequivocally established in two supreme court rulings arising out of the 1920s teapot dome scandal 1 see generally ronald l goldfarb the contempt power 2d ed anchor books 1971 2 compare jurney v maccracken 294 us 125 destruction of documentary evidence which had been subpoenaed by committee of congress can constitute contempt with marshall v gordon 243 us 521 1917 publication by us attorney of letter critical of congress could not constitute contempt because it did not directly obstruct the legislative process the jurney decision also upheld the use of the inherent contempt power to punish past contempt

senates inherent contempt power the supreme court described the power of inquiry with the accompanying process to enforce it as an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function the court explained legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite informationwhich not infrequently is truerecourse must be had to others who possess it experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain that which is needed all this was true before and when the constitution was framed and adopted in that period the power of inquirywith enforcing processwas regarded and employed as necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislateindeed wa s treated as inhering in it thus there is ample warrant for thinking as we do that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised 8 in sinclair v united states9 different witness at the congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of congress the witness had noted that lawsuit had been commenced between the government and the mammoth oil company and declared i shall reserve any evidence i may be able to give for those courts and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee 10 the supreme court upheld the witnesss conviction for contempt of congress the court considered and rejected in unequivocal terms the witnesss contention that the pendency of lawsuits provided an excuse for withholding information neither the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted nor the lawsuits themselves operated to divest the senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws 11 the court further explained that it may be conceded that congress is without authority to compel disclosure for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits but the authority of that body directly or through its committees to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits 12 subsequent supreme court rulings have consistently reiterated and reinforced the breadth of congresss investigative authority for example in eastland v united states servicemen s fund the court explained that the scope of congresss power of inquiry is as penetrating and far reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the constitution13 in addition the court in watkins v united states described the breadth of the power of inquiry according to the court congresss power to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as 7 273 us 135 17475 1927 8 id 9 279 us 263 1929 10 id at 290 11 id at 295 12 id 13 421 us 491 504 n 15 1975 quoting barenblatt v united states 360 us 109 111 1960

power of congressional inquiry to cases of wrongdoing it emphasized however that congresss investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department the investigative power the court stated comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste15 the first congresses held inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement by government officials 16 and subsequently in series of decisions the court recognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the executive branch were unduly hampered17 accordingly the court now clearly recognizes the power of the congress to inquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies of government18 the inherent contempt power is not specified in statute or constitutional provision but has been deemed implicit in the constitutions grant to congress of all legislative powers in an inherent contempt proceeding the offender is tried at the bar of the house or senate and can be held in custody until such time as the contemnor provides the testimony or documents sought or until the end of the session inherent contempt was most often used as means of coercion not punishment statutory criminal contempt provision was first enacted by congress in 1857 in part because of the inadequacies of proceedings under the inherent power in cases of criminal contempt the offender is cited by the subcommittee the committee and the full house or senate with subsequent indictment by grand jury and prosecution by the us attorney criminal contempt unlike inherent contempt is intended as means of punishing the contemnor for non compliance rather than to obtain the information sought statutory civil contempt procedure applicable only to the senate was enacted in 1978 under that procedure witness who refuses to testify before senate committee or provide documents sought by the committee can after being served with court order be held in cont empt of court and incarcerated until he agrees to testify moreover the house and senate have authorized standing or special committees to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas 19 14 354 us 178 187 1957 15 id 16 id at 182 17 id at 19495 18 id

both by the english parliament20 and by the american colonial assemblies21 congresss first assertion of its contempt authority occurred in 1795 shortly after the ratification of the constitution at the time three members of the house of representatives reported that they had been offered what they interpreted to be bribe by men named robert randall and charles whitney22 the house of representatives interpreted these allegations as sufficient evidence of an attempt to corrupt its proceedings and reported resolution ordering their arrest and detention by the sergeantatarms pending further action by the house23 the matter was then referred to special committee on privileges which reported out resolution recommending that formal proceedings be instituted against messrs randall and whitney at the bar of the house24 in addition the resolution provided that the accused be questioned by written interrogatories submitted by the speaker of the house with both the questions and the answers entered into the house minutes25 the resolution also provided that individual members could submit written questions to the accused26 upon adopting the resolution and after considerable debate the house determined that the following procedures be adhered to first the complaining members were to submit written signed information to the accused and for publication in the house journal in addition the accused were to be provided counsel the right to call witnesses on their behalf the right to crossexamination of the complaining members through written questions submitted to the speaker and adequate time to prepare defense 27 proceeding was held at the bar of the house and on january 4 1796 the house by vote of 7817 adopted resolution finding mr randall guilty of contempt to and breach of the privileges of this house by attempting to corrupt the integrity of its members in the manner laid to his charge28 the house ordered mr randall to be brought to the bar reprimanded by the speaker and held in custody until further resolution of the house29 mr randall was detained until january 13 1796 when he was discharged by house resolution mr whitney on the other hand was absolved of any wrongdoing as the house determined that his actions were against memberelect and had taken place away from the seat of government30 20 mays treatise on the law privileges proceedings

that almost question was raised with respect to the power of congress to punish nonmember for contempt according to one commentator who noted that many of the members of the early congress were also members of the constitutional convention and thus fully aware of the legislative practices of the time it was substantially agreed that the grant of the legislative power to congress carried with it by implication the power to punish for contempt31 four years later the senate exercised its contem pt power against william duane who as editor of the aurora newspaper was charged with the publication of libelous article concerning the senate and one of its committees mr duane was ordered by senate resolution to appear before the bar of the senate and make any proper defense for his conduct in publishing the aforesaid false defamatory scandalous and malicious assertions and pretended information32 at his initial appearance before the senate mr duane requested and was granted the assistance

senate34 mr duane was subsequently held in contempt of the senate for his failure to appear not for his alleged libelous and defamatory publications35 as result he was held in the custody of the senate for several weeks before the senate by resolution instructed that he be released and tried by the courts36 the senates contempt of mr duane generated considerably more debate concerning congresss contempt authority majority of senators argued that the senates contempt power was an inherent right of legislative bodies derived not specifically from the constitution but rather from the principle of selfpreservation which results to every public body from necessity and from the nature of the case37 moreover senators supportive of this position argued that their reasoning was firmly supported by english and colonial practices as well as the practice of the state legislatures finally the majority asserted that if congress did not possess contempt power it would be vulnerable to the disruption of its proceedings by outside intruders38 while the senates exercise of its contempt pow er was not without precedent many senators disputed these claims arguing that all powers sought to be exercised by congress must be specifically derived from the constitution that because the contempt power is not among the enumerated powers given to congress the power is reserved to the states and the people in addition the minority argued that congress unlike the english parliament or state legislatures was intentionally not granted the plenary powers of sovereignty by the constitution and thus could not claim any inherent right to selfpreservation 39 as an alternative the minority proposed 31 cs potts power of legislative bodies to punish for contempt 74 u p enn l rev 691 720 1926 32 2

williams of north carolina introduced letter before the house from john anderson which representative williams interpreted as an attempt to bribe him46 following its 1795 precedent the house adopted resolution ordering the sergeantatarms to arrest mr anderson bring him before the bar of the house upon mr andersons arrest however debate erupted on th floor of the house as the motion for referral to the committee on privileges to adopt procedures was considered several members objected to the houses assertion of an inherent contempt power they argued as the minority senators had in mr duanes contempt that neither the constitution nor the general laws afforded the congress such an inherent power to punish for actions that occurred elsewhere 47 relying on the 1795 precedent and examples from the british parliament and state legislatures the committee was formed and it adopted resolution requiring mr anderson to be brought before the bar of the house for questioning by the speaker48 at his appearance mr anderson like mr randall and mr whitney before him was afforded counsel and permitted to present the testimony of eleven witnesses ultimately mr anderson was found in contempt of congress and was ordered to be reprimanded by the speaker for the outrage he committed and discharged into the custody of the sergeantatarms 49 mr anderson subsequently filed suit against mr thomas

the supreme court heard the case in february of 1821 and concluded that the congress possessed the inherent authority to punish for contempt and dismissed the charges against mr dunn50 the court noted that while the constitution does not explicitly grant either house of congress the authority to punish for contempt except in situations involving its own members such power is necessary for congress to protect itself the court asserted that if the house of representatives did not possess the power of contempt it would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may meditate against it51 the courts decision in anderson does not define the specific actions that would constitute contempt rather it adopted deferential posture noting that it is only necessary to observe that there is noth ing on the facts of the record from which it can appear on what evidence the warrant was issued and we do not presume that the house of representatives would have issued it without fully establishing the facts charged on the individual 52 the anderson decision indicates that congresss contempt power is centered on those actions committed in its presence that obstruct its deliberative proceedings the court noted that congress could supplement this power to punish for contempt committed in its presence by enacting statute which would prohibit all other insults which there is any necessity for providing53 the court in anderson also endorsed the existing parliamentary practice that the contemnor could not be held beyond the end of the legislative session54 according to the court since the existence of the power that imprisons is indispensable to its continuance and although the legislative power continues perpetual the legislative body ceases to exist on the moment of its adjournment or periodical dissolution it follows that imprisonment must terminate with that adjournment 55 since anderson was decided there has been an unresolved question as to whether this rule would apply with equal force to contempt by the senate since it is considered continuing body56 the senate it appears has only addressed this issue once in 1871 regarding the contempt of two recalcitrant witnesses zl white and hj ramsdell57 during these contempt proceedings the senate found itself near the end of session and the question arose as to whether the senates acquiescence to the anderson rule would provide adequate punishment after vigorous debate the senate instructed the sergeantatarms to release the prisoners immediately upon the final 50

arrested and tried under the houses inherent contempt power the house ad judged mr kilbourn in contempt and ordered him detained by the sergeantatarms until he purged himself of contempt by releasing the requested documents and answering the committees questions 61 mr kilbourn filed suit against the speaker the members of the committee and the sergeantat arms for false arrest the lower court held in favor of the defendant dismissing the suit mr kilbourn appealed and the supreme court reversed holding that congress did not have general power to punish for contempt 62 while the court appeared to recognize that congress possessed an inherent contempt power it declined to follow anderson v dunn s expansive view of congresss authority moreover the court rejected any reliance on the english and

parliament nor from the adjudged cases in which the english courts have upheld these practices nor taking what has fallen from the english judges and especially the later cases on which we have just commented is much aid given to the doctrine that this power exists as one necessary to enable either house of congress to exercise successfully their function of legislation 63 the court held that the investigation into the real estate pool was not undertaken by the committee pursuant to one of congresss constitutional responsibilities but rather was an attempt to pry into the personal finances of private individuals subject that could not conceivably result in the enactment of valid legislation according to the court because congress was acting beyond its constitutional responsibilities mr k ilbourn was not legally required to answer the questions asked of him in short the court held that person can be punished for contumacy as witness before either house unless his testimony is required in matter into which that house has jurisdiction to inquire and we feel equally sure that neither of these bodies possesses the general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen 64 in addition the court indicated that the investigation violated the doctrine of separation of powers because judicial bankruptcy proceedings were pending relating to the collapse of the real estate pool and therefore it might be improper for congress to conduct an investigation that could interfere with the judicial proceedings65 the court specifically challenged congresss assertion that there were other viable remedies available to the government to retrieve the lost funds66 thus the court concluded that the resolution of the house of representatives authorizing the investigation was in excess of the power conferred on that body by the constitution that the committee therefore had lawful authority to require kilbourn to testify as witness beyond what he voluntarily chose to tell that the orders and resolutions of the house and the warrant of the speaker under which kilbourn was imprisoned are in like manner void for want of jurisdiction in that body and that his imprisonment was without any lawful authority 67 finally in dicta the court indicated that the contempt power might be upheld where congress was acting pursuant to certain specific constitutional prerogatives such as disciplining its members judging their elections or conducting impeachment proceedings although the precedential value of kilbourn has been significantly limited by subsequent case law the case continues to be cited for the proposition that the house has power to probe into private affairs such as the personal finances of an individual on which legislation could not be enacted the doubts raised by kilbourn about the scope of congresss contempt power have essentially been removed by later cases sanctioning the use of the power in investigations conducted pursuant to congresss authority

conduct of individuals to the extent that the matters are subject to congressional regulation70 for example in mcgrain v daugherty which involved senate investigation into the claimed failure of the attorney general to prosecute certain antitrust violations subpoena was issued to the brother of the attorney general mallie daugherty the president of an ohio bank when daugherty refused to comply the senate exercised its inherent contempt power and ordered its sergeantatarms to take him into custody the grant of writ of habeas corpus was appealed to the supreme court the courts opinion in the case considered the inve stigatory and contempt powers of congress to be implicit in the grant of legislative power 71 the court distinguished kilbourn which was an investigation into purely personal affairs from the instant case which was probe of the operation of the department of justice according to the court the subject was plainly one on which legislation could be had and would be mate rially aided by information the investigation was calculated to elicit 72 the court in mcgrain was willing to presume that the investigation had been undertaken to assist the committee in its legislative efforts73 g11g151g145g142g155g142g151g157g561g5g152g151g157g142g150g153g157g561 congresss inherent contempt power is not spec ifically granted by the constitution but is considered necessary to investigate and legislate effectively the validity of the inherent contempt power was upheld in the early supreme court decision in anderson v dunn and reiterated in mcgrain v daugherty under the inherent contempt power the individual is brought before the house or senate by the sergeantatarms tried at the bar of the body and can be imprisoned in the capitol jail the purpose of the imprisonment or other sanction may be either punitive74 or coercive75 thus the witness can be imprisoned for specified period of time as punishment or for an indefinite period but not at least by the house beyond the end of session of the congress until he agrees to comply one commentator has concluded that the procedure followed by the house in the contempt citation that was at issue in anderson v dunn is typical of that employed in the inherent contempt cases these traditional methods may be explained by using as an illustration anderson v dunn in 1818 member of the house of representatives accused anderson nonmember of trying to bribe him the house adopted resolution pursuant to which the speaker ordered the sergeantatarms to arrest anderson and bring him before the bar of the house to answer the charge when anderson appeared the speaker informed him why he had been brought before the house and asked if he had any requests for assistance in answering the charge anderson stated his requests and the house granted him counsel compulsory process for defense witnesses and copy of the accusatory letter anderson called his 69 barry v united states ex rel cunningham 279 us 597 1929 70

is cited for contempt under the inhe rent contempt process prompt judicial review appears to be available by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus77 in such habeas proceeding the issues decided by the court might be limited to whether the house or senate acted in manner within its jurisdiction78 and b whether the contempt proceedings complied with minimum due process standards79 while congress would not have to afford contemnor the whole panoply of procedural rights available to defendant in criminal proceedings notice and an opportunity to be heard would have to be granted 80 also some of the requirements imposed by the courts under the statutory criminal contempt procedure eg pertinency of the question asked to the committees investigation might be mandated by the due process clause in the case of inherent contempt proceedings81 although many of the inherent contempt precedents have involved incarceration of the contemnor there may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines as an alternative such fine would potentially have the advantage of avoiding court proceeding on habeas corpus grounds as the contemnor would never be jailed or detained drawing on the analogous authority that courts have to inherently impose fines for contemptuous behavior82 it appears possible to argue that congress in its exercise of similar inherent function could impose fines as opposed to incarceration additional support for this argument appears to be contained in dicta from the 1821 supreme court decision in anderson v dunn the court questioned the extent of the punishing power which the deliberative assemblies of the union may assume and exercise on the principle of self preservation and responded with the following analogy and the nature of the case furnish the answerthe least possible power adequate to the end proposed which is the power of imprisonment it may at first view and from the history of the practice of our legislative bodies be thought to extend to other inflictions but every other will be found to be mere commutation for confinement since commitment alone is the alternative where the individual proves contumacious 83 76 thomas l

certain cases where the congress had authority to investigate it may compel testimony in the same manner and by use of the same means as court of justice in like cases specifically the court noted that whether the power of punishment in either house by fine or imprisonment goes beyond this or not we are sure that person can be punished for contumacy as witness before either house unless his testimony is required in matter into which that house has jurisdiction to inquire 84 while the language of these cases and the analogous power possessed by courts seem to suggest the possibility of levying fine as punishment for contempt of congress we are aware of and could not locate any precedent for congress imposing fine in the contempt or any other context in comparison with the other types of contem pt proceedings inherent contempt has the distinction of not requiring the cooperation or as sistance of either the executive or judicial branches the house or senate can on its own conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt furthermore although the contemnor can seek judicial review by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus the scope of such review may be relatively limited compared to the plenary review accorded by the courts in cases of conviction under the criminal contempt statute there are also certain limitations on the inhere nt contempt process though the contemnor can be incarcerated until he agrees to comply with the subpoena imprisonment may not extend beyond the end of the current session of congress 85 moreover inherent contempt has been described as unseemly cumbersome timeconsuming and relatively ineffective especially for modern congress with heavy legislative workload that would be interrupted by trial at the bar86 because of these drawbacks the inherent contempt process has not been used by either body since 193587 proceedings under the inherent contempt power might be facilitated however if the initial factfinding and examination of witnesses were to be held before special committeewhich could be directed to submit findings and recommendations to the full body with only the final decision as to guilt being made by the full house or senate although generally the proceedings in inherent contempt cases appear to have been conducted at the bar of the house of congress involved88 in at least few instances proceedings were conducted initially or primarily before committee but with the final decision as to whether to hold the person in contempt being made by the full body89 84 kilbourn v

as has been indicated although the majority of the inherent contempts by both the house and the senate was conducted via trial at the bar of the full body there is historical evidence to support the notion that this is not the exclusive procedure by which such proceeding can occur this history when combined with 1993 supreme cour t decision addressing the power of congress to make its own rules for the conduct of impeachment trials90 strongly suggests that the inherent contempt process can be supported and facilitated by the conduct of evidentiary proceedings and the development of recommendations at the committee level actually the consideration of the use of committees to develop the more intricate details of an inquiry into charges of contempt of congress da back to the very first inherent contempt proceedings of messrs randall and whitney in 1795 as discussed above in these cases the house appointed committee on privileges to report mode of procedure the committee reported the following resolution which was adopted by the full house of representatives resolved that the said robert randall and charles whitney be brought to the bar of the house and interogated by the speaker touching the information given against them on written interrogatories which with the answers thereto shall be entered into the minutes of the house and that every question proposed by member be reduced to writing and motion made that the same be put by the speaker that after such interrogatories are answered if the house deem it necessary to make any further inquiry on the subject the same be conducted by committee to be appointed for that purpose 91 according to the annals of congress the committees language sparked debate concerning the proper procedures to be used including discussion regarding whether the use of such select committee was proper92 at least one representative was convinced that the select committee was alone competent to taking and arranging the evidence for the decision of the house93 while others noted that the investigation of facts is constantly performed by select committees the committees report is not to be final it is to be submitted to the house for final decision94 it was recommended that the subject should be remanded to committee which would save good deal of time95 other members however objected to the use of select committee to hear evidence of this magnitude on the grounds that it would be highly improper for the witness to be sworn by select committee and that committee to send for the members and have them sworn and examined in that private way however troublesome and difficult the house must meet all the questions and decide them on this floor96 ultimately it appears that none of the proceedings in this case was conducted before select committee that said congresss interpretation of its own powers and prerogatives is significant it is clear that during the very first exercise of congresss power of inherent contempt the house 90 see united states v nixon 506 us 224 1992 91 see 2 hinds precedent supra note 22 at 1599 emphasis added 92 see 5 nnals of cong 188 1792 93 see id statement of rep baldwin 94 id

proceedings could occur before committee rather than at the bar of the house this early precedent was finally invoked in 1836 when after the assault of reporter robert codd by reporter henry wheeler on the house floor the house committed the examination of contempt and breach of privilege to select committee the house adopted the following resolution empowering the committee to conduct contempt investigation resolved that select committee be forthwith appointed whose duty it shall be forthwith to inquiry into an assault committed within the hall of the house of representatives this morning while this house was in session and for and on account of which two persons are now in custody of the sergeantatarms and said committee are to make their report to this house and that said committee be authorized to administer oaths and to cause the attendance of witnesses 97 the committees report noted that mr wheeler admitted his offense and included recommendation that the punishment not be vindictive98 the report also contained three resolutions that were considered by the full house the first found mr wheeler guilty of contempt and breach of the privileges of the house and was adopted the second which was amended on the floor prior to adoption excluded mr wheeler from the floor of the house for the remainder of the session finally the third resolution which called for mr wheeler to be taken into custody for the remainder of the session was also amended on the floor prior to adoption to simply discharge mr wheeler from custody 99 another example of the use of select committee to hear contempt trial occurred in 1865 when it was alleged that mr ap field assaulted congressman william kelley similar to the contempt proceedings of mr wheeler the house adopted the following resolution authorizing select committee to conduct an examination of the charges be it resolved that select committee of five members be appointed by the speaker to inquire into the said alleged breach of privilege that the said committee have power to send for persons and papers and to examine witnesses and that the committee report as soon as possible all the facts and circumstances of the affair and what order if any it is proper for this house to take for the vindication of its privilege and right and duty of free legislation and judgment 100 during the debate on the resolution it was observed that proceeding in this manner would avoid trial by the full house which in the words of one member would consume great amount of the public time which there is pressing need to apply to the business of the government it is better that the course should be adopted which is contemplated by the resolution 101 97 2 hinds precedent supra note 22 at 1630 98 see id see also hrept 792 24th cong

that it had heard the testimony of several witnesses concerning the incident including the voluntary statement of mr field102 also according to the committee mr field was present for each of the witnesses and in fact several of them were heard from at his request moreover all of the witnesses were subject to examination or crossexamination by mr field103 at the committees recommendation resolution directing the speaker to issue warrant for mr fields arrest by the sergeantatarms for the purpose of bringing him before the speaker for reprimand was adopted 104 it does not appear that mr field or his counsel was permitted to be present during the houses consideration of the committees report nor does it appear that he was afforded an opportunity to address the house prior to his formal reprimand in fact during the course of the reprimand the speaker expressly referred to mr field having been tried before committee of their members and ordered to be reprimanded at the bar of the house by their presiding officer105 which may be interpreted as indicating that the committees proceedings were deemed to be sufficient in the eyes of the house

of congress there has been judicial ruling directly confirming the congresss interpretation of its own contempt powers in 1993 however the supreme court decided united states v nixon 106 which while not contempt case involved an analogous delegation of authority by the senate to select committee for the purposes of hearing evidence regarding the impeachment of two federal judges specifically the impeached judges challenged the senates procedure under rule xi of the rules of procedure and practice in the senate when sitting on impeachment trials which provides that in the trial of any impeachment the presiding officer of the senate if the senate so orders shall appoint committ ee of senators to receive evidence and take testimony at such times and places as the committee may determine and for such purpose the committee so appointed and the chairman thereof to be ected by the committee shall unless otherwise ordered by the senate exercise all the powers and functions conferred upon the senate and the presiding officer of the senate respectively under the rules of procedure and practice in the senate when sitting on impeachment trials unless otherwise ordered by the senate the rules of procedure and practice in the senate when sitting on impeachment trials shall govern the procedure and practice of the comm ittee so appointed the committee so appointed shall report to the senate in writing certified copy of the transcript of the proceedings and testimony had and given before the committee and such report shall be received by the senate and the evidence so received and the testimony so taken shall be considered to all intents and purposes subject to the right of the senate to determine competency relevancy and materiality as having received and taken

senate having the entire trial in open senate107 judge nixon argued that the use of select committee to hear the evidence and witness testimony of his impeachment violated the senates constitutional duty to try all impeachments according to judge nixon anything short of trial before the full senate was unconstitutional and therefore required reversal and reinstatement of his judicial salary the court held the issue to be nonjusticiable political question chief justice rehnquist writing for the court based this conclusion upon the fact that the impeachment proceedings were textually committed in the constitution to the legislative branch in addition the court found the lack of finality and the difficulty in fashioning relief counselled against justiciability 108 according to the majority to open the door of judicial review to the procedures used by the senate in trying impeachments would expose the political life of the country to months or perhaps years of chaos 109 the court found that the word try in the impeachm ent clause did not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the senate110 justice souters concurring opinion noted that it seems fair to conclude that the impeachment clause contemplates that the senate may determine within broad boundaries such subsidiary issues as the procedures for receipt and consideration of evidence necessary to satisfy its duty to try impeachments 111 the courts affirmation of the senates procedures with respect to the appointment of select committees for impeachment trials clearly indicates that the use of committees for contempt proceedingswhether they be standing legislative committees or select committees created by resolution for specific purposeis permissible exercise of each houses article i section 5 rulemaking power as such it would appear that one of the suggested reasons for the apparent abandonment of the use of congresss inherent contempt power namely that it became to cumbersome and time consuming to try contemptuous behavior on the floor of the body is longer compelling the ability to utilize the co mmittee structure for trials evidentiary hearings and other procedural determinations appears to be supported not only by the historical records of previous contempt proceedings but also by the courts decision in nixon while the court in nixon addressed the permissibility of using select committees in impeachment trials it says nothing about the rights or privileges that would be required to be afforded to the accused similarly in any contempt proceedings before congressional committee the question of rights and privileges remains one that has not yet been directly addressed by the courts according to the supreme court in groppi v leslie the past decisions of this court strongly indicate that the panoply of procedural rights that are accorded defendant in criminal trial has never been thought necessary in legislative contempt proceedings the customary practi ce in congress has been to provide the contemnor with an opportunity to appear before the bar of the house or before comm ittee and give answer to the misconduct charged against him 112 107 id at 227 n 1 emphasis added 108 id at 739 109 id quoting united states v nixon 938 f2d 239 246 dc cir 1991 110 id at 740 111 id at 748 souter j concurring 112 see groppi v

right to be heard would traditionally be left largely to the legislative body113 this deference to congress in establishing its own rules and procedures is consistent with the more recent decision in nixon thus it would appear that while there is definitive answer to the question of what rights the committee hearing contempt proceeding would be required to afford114 so long as the minimum protections of notice and opportunity to be heard are provided the courts it seems will not interfere with congresss decisions regarding proper procedure congressional precedent would also appear to be useful guide to the question of what process is due review of early exercises of inherent contempt discussed above indicates that the following procedures have been established attachment by the sergeantatarms appearance before the bar provision for specification of charges identification of the accuser compulsory process provision of counsel hearing determination of guilt and imposition of penalty according to one commentator this traditional procedure was followed by both houses of congress until they abandoned it for more convenient statutory device 115 since these procedures appear to be in excess of what the court instructed was required in groppi it would seem reasonable to conclude that any inherent contempt proceeding that conforms with these traditions would likely satisfy judicial review g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g5g155g146g150g146g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g157g142g150g153g157g561 between 1795 and 1857 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the house and senate eight of which can be considered successful in that the contemnor was meted out punishment agreed to testify or produce documents such inherent contempt proceedings however involved trial at the bar of the chamber concerned and therefore were seen by some as timeconsuming cumbersome and in some instances ineffectivebecause punishment could not be extended beyond houses adjournment date 116 in 1857 statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted117 largely as result of particular proceeding brought in the house of representatives that year the statute provides for judicial trial of the contemnor by united states attorney rather than trial at the bar of the house or senate it is clear from the floor debates and the subsequent practice of both houses that the legislation was intended as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure not as substitute for it criminal contempt referral was made in the case of john w wolcott in 1858 but in the ensuing two decades after its enactment most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than by the criminal contempt method apparently because members felt that they would not be able to obtain the desired information from the witness after the criminal proceedings had been instituted118 with 113 id at 503 114 while the supreme court in groppi limited its holding to requiring only notice and the opportunity to be heard the lower court in the same case suggested that the following rights were also necessary representation by counsel the ability to compel the attendance of

house of representatives according to reports the investigation was hindered by the refusal of newspaper reporter james w simonton to provide answers to certain questions posed by the committee121 the select committee responded by reporting resolution citing mr simonton for contempt as well as introducing bill122 that was intended to more effectually enforce the attendance of witnesses on the summons of either house of congress and to compel them to discover testimony123 it appears that there were printed house or senate committee reports on the measure though it was considered in the house by the select committee and in the senate by the judiciary committee124 continued chronology indicates that from 18571934 congress relied on its inherent contempt power almost exclusively despite the availability of the criminal statute see id moreover becks detailed history indicates that in at least 28 instances witnesses who were either threatened with or actually charged with contempt of congress purged their citations by either testifying or providing documents to the inquiring congressional committees see id 119 2 usc 192 2000 as result of congressional classification of

there was opposition to the bill on several fronts some members proposed an amendment expressly codifying congresss contempt power for failure to comply with requests for documents or testimony thereby resurrecting the view that congress did not possess any in herent power to punish for contempt125 others argued that congresss inherent contempt powers rendered the proposed bill unnecessary126 still other members opposed the bill on the grounds that it violated the fourth and fifth amendments of the constitution because it sanctioned unreasonable searches and seizures compelled persons to incriminate themselves and violated the prohibition on persons being punished twice for the same offense double jeopardy 127 in response to arguments that such statute was unnecessary given congresss inherent authority to hold individuals in contempt supporters made clear that the proposed bill was not intended in any way to diminish congresss inherent contempt authority 128 rather supporters of the bill saw it as designed to give congress additional authority and to impose additional penalties on witness who fails to appear before an investigat ing committee of either house or who appearing fails to answer any question129 the main concern of proponents seems to have been congresss ability to impose adequate punishments for contempts that occur near the end of session especially in the house where the prevailing view was that the courts opinion in anderson v dunn130 prohibited terms of incarceration that extended beyond the adjournment of session131 with respect to the arguments surrounding the fourth and fifth amendments supporters asserted that the bill provided the protection of the judiciary via judicial trial for the potential contumacious witnesses moreover supporters argued that the bill removed such witnesses from the passions and excitement of the hallwhere partisans may frequently in political questions carry into the measures of punishment their party hostilities132 the bill was ultimately passed by both the house133 and the senate134 according to one commentator the bill was adopted for three reasons first to increase the power of either house of congress to punish for contempt in cases of contumacy of witnesses second to comp criminating testimony third reason although undoubtedly minor one was that the effect of the enactment of this legislation would be to remove the trial of cases of contempt of either house of congress from their respective bars to the courts where passion and partisanship would not influence the 125 see eberling supra note 88 at 309 see also supra notes 8489 and accompanying text 126 id at 311 127 id at 309 128 42 cong globe 34th cong 3d sess 404 1857 sta tement of mr orr

and who fails to do so or who appears but refuses to respond to questions is guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of up to 100000 and imprisonment for up to one year 2 usc 194 establishes the procedure to be followed by the house or senate if it chooses to refer recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution rather than try him at the bar of the house or senate under the procedure outlined in section 194 136 the following steps precede judicial proceedings under the statute 1 approval by committee137 2 calling up and reading the committee report on the floor 3 either if congress is in session house approval of resolution authorizing the speaker to certify the report to the us attorney for prosecution or if congress is not in session an independent determination by the speaker to certify the report138 and 4 certification by the speaker to the appropriate us attorney for prosecution139 the criminal contempt statute and corresponding pr ocedure are punitive in nature it is used when the house or senate wants to punish recalcitrant witness and by doing so to deter others from similar contumacious conduct 140 the criminal sanction is not coercive because the witness generally will not be able to purge himself by testifying or supplying subpoenaed documents after he has been voted in contempt by the committee and the house or senate consequently once witness has been voted in contempt he lacks an incentive for cooperating with the committee however although the courts have rejected arguments that defendants had purged themselves141 in few instances the house has certified to the us attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts were not necessary where compliance with subpoenas occurred after contempt citations had been voted but before referral of the cases to grand juries142 under the statute after contempt has been certified by the president of the senate or the speaker it is the duty of the united states attorney to bring the matter before the grand jury 135 eberling supra note 88 at 316 136 the language of 194 does not provide complete picture of the process for more detailed explanation of the workings of the

us attorney to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary the case law that is most relevant to the question provides conflicting guidance in ex parte frankfeld 144 the district court for the district of columbia granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus sought by two witnesses before the house committee on unamerican activities the witnesses were charged with violating 2 usc 192 and were being held on warrant based on the affidavit of committee staff member 145 the court ordered the witnesses released since the procedure described as mandatory by the court146 had not been followed the court in dicta not central to the holding of the case observed that congress prescribed that when committee such as this was confronted with an obdurate witness willful witness perhaps the committee would report the fact to the house if it be house committee or to the senate if it be senate committee and that the speaker of the house or the president of the senate should then certify the facts to the district attorney it seems quite apparent that congress intended to leave measure of discretion to either the speaker of the house or the president of the senate under such circumstances but made the certification of facts to the district attorney mandatory proceeding and it left discretion with the district attorney as to what he should do about it he is required under the language of the statute to submit the facts to the grand jury 147 similarly in united states v united states house of representatives 148 case that involved the applicability of the section 192 contempt procedure to an executive branch official the same district court observed again in dicta that after the contempt citation is delivered to the us attorney he is then required to bring the matter before the grand jury149 conversely in wilson v united states 150 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit concluded based in part on the legislative history of the contempt statute and congressional practice under the law that the duty of the speaker when certifying contempt citations to the united states attorney during adjournments is discretionary not mandatory one 151 the court reasoned that despite its mandatory language the statute had been implemented in manner that made clear congresss view that when it is in session committees contempt resolution can be referred to the us attorney only after approval by the parent body when congress is not in session review of committee s contempt citation is provided by the speaker or president of the senate rather than by the full house or senate152 this review of committees contempt citation according to the court may be inherently discretionary in nature 143 2 usc 194

directions in seeking grand jury indictment153 in wilson the defendants convictions were reversed because the speaker had certified the contempt citations without exercising his discretion154 from this holding it may be possible to argue that because the statute uses similar language when discussing the speakers duty and the duty of the us attorney that the us attorneys function is discretionary as well and not mandatory as other courts have concluded alternatively despite the similarity in the statutory language there is an argument that the functions of the speaker and the president of the senate are so different in nature under the statutory scheme from those of the us attorn ey that to conclude that the function of the prosecutor was intended to be discretionary simply because that is the interpretation given to the function of the presiding officers is contrary to the understanding and intent of the 1857 congress that drafted the language 155 nevertheless it should be noted that the courts have generally afforded united states attorneys broad prosecutorial discretion even where statute uses mandatory language156 moreover prosecutorial discretion was the basis of the decision of the us attorney not to present to the grand jury the contempt citation of environmental protection agency administration anne gorsuch burford157 while upholding the validity of 2 usc 192 and 194 the courts have recognized that they are criminal provisions and have reversed convictions for contempt where limitations dictated by the language of the statute itself or the constitution have been exceeded 158

congressional subpoena this view is most fully articulated in two opinions by the dojs office of legal counsel olc from the mid 1980s160 and has been the basis of several recent claims with respect to pending congressional investigations161 the position of the doj was prompted by the outcome of an investigation by two house committees into the environmental protection agencys epa implementation of provisions of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 superfund subpoenas were issued by both committees seeking documents contained in epa s litigation files 162 at the direction of president reag an epa administrator burford claimed executive privilege over the documents and refuse d to disclose them to the committees on the grounds that they were enforcement sensitive163 subcommittee and ultimately the full house committee on public works and transportation approved criminal contempt of congress citation and forwarded it to the full house for its consideration164 on december 16 1982 the full house of representatives voted 259105 to adopt the contempt citation165 before the speaker of the house could transmit the citation to the united states attorney for the district of columbia for presentation to grand jury the doj filed lawsuit seeking to enjoin the transmission of the citation and to have the houses action declared unconstitutional as an intrusion into the presidents authority to withhold such informatio n from the congress according to the doj the houses action imposed an unwarranted burden on executive privilege and interferes with the executives ability to carry out the laws166 the district court for the district of columbia dismissed the dojs suit on the grounds that judicial intervention in executivelegislative disputes should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted167 in addition the court noted that ultimate judicial resolution of the validity of the presidents claim of executive privilege could only occur during the course of the trial for contempt of congress168 the doj did not appeal the courts ruling opting instead to resume negotiations which resulted in full disclosure and release of the all the subpoenaed documents to the congress169 throughout the litigation and subsequent negotiations however 160 see prosecution for the contempt of

grand jury for its consideration on the grounds that notwithstanding the mandatory language of the criminal contempt statute170 he had discretion with respect to whether to make the presentation the issue was never resolved because the ultimate settlement agreement included withdrawal of the houses contempt citation in its initial 1984 opinion olc revisited the statutory legal and constitutional issues that were not judicially resolved by the superfund dispute the opinion concluded that as function of prosecutorial discretion us attorney is not required to refer contempt citation to grand jury or otherwise to prosecute an executive bran ch official who is carrying out the presidents direction to assert executive privilege171 next the olc opinion determined that review of the legislative history of the 1857 enactment of the criminal contempt statute and its subsequent implementation demonstrates that congress did not intend the statute to apply to executive officials who carry out presidential directive to assert executive privilege 172 finally as matter of constitutional law the opinion concludes that simply the threat of criminal contempt would unduly chill the presidents ability to effectively protect presumptively privileged executive branch deliberations173 according to the olc opinion the presidents exercise of this privilege particularly when based upon the written legal advice of the attorney general is presumptively valid because many of the documents over which the president may wish to assert privilege are in the custody of department head claim of privilege over those documents can be perfected only with the assistance of that official if one house of congress could make it crime simply to assert the presidents presumptively valid claim even if court subsequently were to agree that the privilege claim were valid the exercise of the privilege would be so burdened as to be nullified because congress has other methods available to test the validity of privilege claim and to obtain the documents that it seeks even the threat of criminal prosecution for asserting the claim is an unreasonable unwarranted and therefore intolerable burden on the exercise by the president of his functions under the constitution 174 the 1984 opinion focuses almost exclusively on the criminal contempt statute as that was the authority invoked by congress in the superfund dispute in brief footnote however the opinion contains discussion of congresss inherent contempt power summarily concluding that the same rationale that makes the criminal contempt statute inapplicable and unconstitutional as applied to executive branch officials apply to the inherent contempt authority we believe that this same conclusion would apply to any attempt by congress to utilize its inherent civil contempt powers to arrest bri ng to trial and punish an executive official who asserted presidential claim of executive privilege the legislative history of the continued

statute was intended to be coextensive with congress inherent civil contempt powers except with respect to the penalties imposed therefore the same reasoning that suggests that the statute could not constitutionally be applied against presidential assertion of privilege applies to congress inherent contempt powers as well 175 the 1986 olc opinion reiterates the 1984 reasoning adding the observation that the power had not been used since 1935 at that time over 50 years and that it seems unlikely that congress would dispatch the sergeantatarms to arrest and imprison an executive branch official who claimed executive privilege 176 the 1986 olc opinion also suggests that then current supreme court opinions indicated that it was more wary of congress exercising judicial authority and therefore might revisit the question of the continued constitutional validity of the inherent contempt power177 factual legal and constitutional aspects of these olc opinions are open to question and potentially limitations for example with respect to the argument that us attorney cannot be statutorily required to submit contempt citation to grand jury despite the plain language of the law such statement appears to be analogous to grant of socalled pocket immunity by the president to anyone who asserts executive privilege on his behalf178 the courts have concluded that the government or in this case the pr esident may informally grant immunity from prosecution which is in the nature of contract nd therefore its effect is strongly influenced by contract law principles179 moreover principles of due process require that the government adhere to the terms of any immunity agreement it makes180 it appears that president has implicitly immunized executive branch officials from violations of congressional enactments at least once in 1996 during dispute over the constitutionality of statute that made it requirement for all public printing to be done by the government printing office 181 at the time the doj in an opinion from olc argued that the requirement was unconstitutional on its face directed the executive branch departments not to comply with the statute as passed by congress and noted that executive branch officials who are involved in making decisions that violate the statute face little to litigation risk including it appears risk of prosecution under the antideficiency act182 for which the doj is solely responsible183 such claim of immunization in the contempt 175 id at 140 n 42 internal citation omitted 176 cooper memo supra note 160 at 86 177 id

constitutional questions while it is true that the president can immunize persons from criminal prosecution it does not appear that he has authority to immunize witness from congressional inherent contempt proceeding arguably an inherent contempt proceeding takes place wholly outside the criminal code is not subject to executive execution of the laws and prosecutorial discretion and thus appears completely beyond the reach of the executive branch furthermore as previously indicated inherent contempt unlike criminal contempt is not intended to punish but rather to coerce compliance with congressional directive 184 thus finding of inherent contempt against an executive branch officials does not appear to be subject to the presidents pardon power185as an inherent contempt arguably is not an offense against the united states but rather is an offense against house of congress likewise it appears that the same arguments would be applicable to potential civil contempt by congress the assertion that the legislative history of the 1857 statute establishing the criminal contempt process demonstrates that it was not intended to be used against executive branch official is not supported by the historical record the floor debates leading to the enactment of the statute make it clear that the legislation was intended as an alternative to not substitute for the inherent contempt authority186 this understanding has been reflected in numerous supreme court opinions upholding the use of the criminal contempt statute187 close review of the floor debate indicates that representative h marshall expressly pointed out that the broad language of the bill proposes to punish equally the cabinet officer and the culprit who may have insulted the dignity of this house by an attempt to corrupt representative of the people188 moreover language from the floor debate indicates that congress was aware of the effect that this language would have on the ability of persons to claim privileges before congress specifically the sponsor of the bill representative orr was asked about the potential instances in which the proposed legislation might interfere with recognized common law and other governmental privileges such as the attorneyclient privilege 189 to support an investigation such as one that probed the propriety of secret service fund to be used upon the discretion of the executive department190 or to support inquires about diplomatic matters191 representative orr responded that the house has and would continue to follow the practice of the british parliament which does not exempt witness from testifying upon any such ground he is not excused from continued 183 see memorandum for emily c hewitt general counsel gsa involvement of the government

in the same debate proposed amendment to expressly recognize the attorneyclient privilege in the statute was overwhelmingly defeated193 with respect to the secret service fund representative orr explained that this house has already exercised the power and authority of forcing disclosure as to what disposition had been made for the secretservice fund and it is right and proper that is should be so under our governmentunder our system of lawsunder our constitutioni should protest against the use of any money by an executive authority where the house had not the right to know how every dollar had been expended and for what purpose 194 representative orrs reference was to contentious investigation in 1846 regarding charges that daniel webster while secretary of state had improperly disbursed monies from cret contingency fund used by the president for clandestine foreign operations the charges led the committee to issue subpoenas to former presidents john quincy adams and john tyler president polk sent the house list of the amounts in the contingent fund for the relevant period which was prior to his term but refused to furnish documentation of the uses that had been made of the expenditures on the grounds that sitting president should not publically reveal the confidences of his predecessors195 president polks refusal to provide the information was mooted by the actions of the two investigatory committees established by the house former president tyler testified196 and former president adams filed deposition197 detailing the uses of the fund during their administrations in addition president polks secretary of state james buchanan was subpoenaed and testified198 ultimately mr webster was found innocent of any wrongdoing from these references it appears that the house was in 1857 sensitive to and cognizant about its oversight and investigative prerogatives visavis the executive branch it therefore appears arguable that in the context of the debate the contempt statute was not intended to preclude the houses ability to engage in oversight of the executive branch finally olcs contention that the criminal contempt statute has only been used once in the burfordsuperfund dispute appears to be based on the fact that the contempt of anne burford was the only contempt voted on by the full house of representatives significantly prior to the superfund dispute committees and subcommittees of the house of representatives 199 had voted contempt citations against secretary of state henry kissinger 1975 secretary of commerce rogers c b morton

punishment216 since the statutes enactment in 1979 the senate has authorized the office of senate legal counsel to seek civil enforcement of subpoena for documents or testimony at least 6 times the last in 1995 none has been against executive branch officials the civil contempt process is arguably more expeditious than criminal proceeding where court may more closely scrutinize congressional procedures and give greater weight to the defendants constitutional rights the civil contempt procedure also provides an element of flexibility allowing the subpoenaed party to raise possible constitutional and other defenses eg the privilege against selfincrimination lack of compliance with congressional procedures or an inability to comply with the subpoena 217 without risking criminal prosecution civil contempt however has limitations most notable is that the statute granting jurisdiction to the courts to hear such cases is by its terms inapplicable in the case of subpoena issued to an officer or employee of the federal government acting in their official capacity218 enacted as part of the ethics in government act of 1978 early draf ts of the civil contempt statute did not include an exception for federal government officers and employees acting within the scope of their duties it appears that the section was drafted primarily in response to the district courts dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of an ervin committees request for declaratory judgment regarding the lawfulness of its subpoena of president nixons tape recordings219 thus one of the purposes of the statute was to expressly confer jurisdiction upon courts to determine the validity of congressional requests for information during the course of the debates regarding this legislation the executive branch strongly opposed conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts to decide such sensitive issues between congress and the executive branch testifying before subcommittee of the senate committee on governmental operations thenassistant attorney general antonin scalia argued that weighing the legislatures need for information against the executives need for confidentiality is the very type of political question from which the courts should abstain 220 in response congress 216 the act specifies that an action contempt proceeding or sanction shall not abate upon adjournment sine die by the senate at the end of congress if the senate or the committee or subcommittee certifies to the court that it maintains its interest in securing the documents answers or testimony during such

federal officers and employees acting in their official capacity however as noted in report from the house judiciary committee in 1988 the exclusion was to apply only in cases in which the president

of representatives cannot pursue actions under the senates civil contempt statute discussed above there are numerous examples of the house by resolution affording special investigatory committees authority not ordinarily available to its standing committees such special panels have often been vested with staff deposition authority and given the particular circumstances special panels have also been vested with the authority to obtain tax information as well as the authority to seek in ternational assistance in information gathering efforts abroad 222 in addition several special panels have been specifically granted the authority to seek judicial orders and participate in judicial proceedings223 for example in 1987 the house authorized the creation of select committee to investigate the covert arms transactions with iran irancontra as part of this resolution the house provided the following authorization 3 the select committee is authorized to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance and testimony of such witnesses as it deems necessary including all inte lligence materials however classified white house materials and to obtain evidence in other appropriate countries with the cooperation of their govern ments 8 the select committee shall be authorized to respond to any judicial or other process or to make any applications to court upon consultation with the speaker consistent with house rule l 224 the combination of broad subpoena authority that expressly encompassed the white house and the ability to make any applications to court arguably suggests that the house contemplated the possibility that civil suit seeking enforcement of subpoena against white house official was possible by virtue of the resolutions language it appears reasonable to conclude that the house decided to leave the decision in the hands of the select committee consistent with house rule l now house rule viii governing subpoenas225 it may be noted then that while the house select committee did not attempt to seek judicial enforcement of any of its subpoenas the authorization resolution did not preclude the possibility among the more prominent attempts at utilizing the authority to make applications in court granted by house of congress to select committee occurred during the investigation into the continued senate comm on government operations 94th cong 1st sess

secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition issued an order requirin g that former major richard v secord execute consent directive authorizing the release of his offshore bank records and accounts to the committee226 when mr secord refused to sign the consent directive the committee sought to obtain court order directing him to comply227 while the committee did not prevail in the secord litigation the matter was not disposed of on jurisdictional grounds specifically the district court noted its jurisdiction pursuant to 28 usc 1364 as mr secord was private citizen moreover there is mention or indication of any challenge to the committees ability to seek such an order rather the case was decided on fifth amendment grounds with the court holding that there was testimonial aspect to requiring the signing of the consent directive 228 thus the court concluded that the committees order was violation of mr secords fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 229 review of modern house precedents indicates at least 5 other special or select committees that have been granted via house resolution both subpoena authority as well as the ability to seek and participate in judicial actions these include the october surprise investigation230 the white house travel office inquiry231 the house campaign finance investigation232 the select committee on national security commercial concerns233 and the teamsters election investigation234 again while there is record to indicate that any of these committees utilized their authority to participate in judicial proceedings to bring civil subpoena enforcement action the resolution language appears to indicate that such suit was authorized by the full house potential hurdle to resolution by the house of representatives authorizing the pursuit of civil court order is the jurisdiction of the federal courts such jurisdiction specifically federal district court jurisdiction where civil action for enforcement of congressional subpoena would be brought is derived from both article iii of the constitution and federal statute article iii of the constitution states in relevant part that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states 235 the supreme court has interpreted the language arising under broadly essentially permitting federal jurisdiction to be found whenever federal law is potentially important ingredient of case 236 conversely the federalquestion jurisdiction statute first enacted in

interpreted by the court to be much narrower in scope as the court explained in verlinden bv v central bank of nigeria although the language of 1331 parallels that of the arising under clause of art iii this court never has held that statutory arising under jurisdiction is identical to art iii arising under jurisdiction quite the contrary is true the many limitations which have been placed on jurisdiction under 1331 are not limitations on the constitutional power of congress to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts art iii arising under jurisdiction is broader than federalquestion jurisdiction under 1331 238 the fact that the statutory jurisdiction provided by congress is narrower than the constitutions grant of judicial power may give rise to an argument that the statutory grant of jurisdiction cannot be used by the house should it merely adopt resolution authorizing subpoena enforcement proceeding to be brought in court following this argument to its conclusion might suggest that both houses of congress must pass law signed by the president which authorizes civil enforcement action to be brought in federal district court because mere onehouse resolution will not suffice to provide such jurisdiction we have found court or commentator that has expressly adopted this argument it therefore remains unclear whether the existing statutory language for jurisdiction can be definitively said to be inadequate rather the limited supreme court and other federal court precedent that exists may be read to suggest that the current statutory basis is sufficient to establish jurisdiction for civil action of the type contemplated here if the representative of the congressional committee is specifically authorized by house of congress to act in 1928 the supreme court decided reed v the county commissioners of delaware county pennsylvania 239 which involved special committee of the united states senate charged by senate resolution with investigating the means used to influence the nomination of candidates for the senate240 the special committee was authorized to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance of witnesses the production of books papers and documents and to do such other acts as may be necessary in the matter of said investigation241 during the course of its investigation into the disputed election of william b wilson of pennsylvania to the senate the committee sought to obtain the boxes ballots and other things used in connection with the election 242 the county commissioners who were the legal custodians of said materials refused to provide them to the committee thus necessitating the lawsuit the supreme court after affirming the powers of the senate to obtain evidence related to matter committed to it by the constitution243 and having passed laws calculated to facilitate such investigations244 nevertheless held that it was without jurisdiction to decide the case the senate had relied on the resolutions phrase such other acts as may be necessary to justify its authority to bring such suit according to the court howev er that phrase may not be taken to include everything that 238 verlinden bv v central bank of nigeria

result the court held that the senate did not intend to authorize the committee or anticipate that there might be need to invoke the power of the judicial department petitioners are not authorized by law to sue246 the court in reed made mention of the jurisdictional statute that existed at the time rather the court appears to have relied on the fact that the senate did not specifically authorize the committee to sue therefore absent particular nguage granting the power to sue in court there can be basis for judicial jurisdiction over such suit247 read in this manner reed appears to suggest that had the senate resolution specifical ly mentioned the power to sue the court may have accepted jurisdiction and decided the case on its merits such reading of reed is supported by recent district court ruling involving the question of whether congress authorized judicial enforcement of member demands for information from executive branch agencies in waxman v thompson 2006 opinion of the district court for the central district of california248 the plaintiffs all minority members of the house government reform committee sought court order pursuant to 5 usc 2954 and 7211often times referred to as the rule of sevengranting them access to department of health and human services records related to the anticipated costs of the medicare prescription drug implementation and modernization act of 2003249 the court in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction addressed the argument made by the plaintiffs that 5 usc 2954 which requires that an executive agency on request of the committee on government operations of the house of representatives or of any seven members thereof shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee 250 implicitly delegated to members to right to sue to enforce their informational demands251 the court in rejecting this argument relied on the supreme courts holding in reed v county commissioners 252 specifically the court noted that reed s holding put congress on notice that it was necessary to make authorization to sue to enforce investigatory demands explicit if it wished to ensure that such power existed253 according to the court like the senate resolution at issue in reed because 2954 is silent with respect to civil enforcement it stands to reason that the congress never intended to provide the members with the power to seek civil judicial orders to enforce their document demands the argument that mere onehouse resolution is not sufficient to provide jurisdiction also derives support from the ruling in senate select committee on presidential campaign activities v nixon 254 1973 decision by the district court for the district of columbia in senate select committee the court held that there was jurisdictional statute available that authorizes the court to hear and decide the merits of the committees request for declaratory judgment mandatory injunction and writ of mandamus arising from president nixons refusal to produce tape recording and other documents sought by the committee pursuant to subpoena duces 245 id at 389 246 id 247 it

several potential bases for jurisdiction 28 usc 1345 united states as plaintiff 28 usc 1361 action to compel an officer of the united states to perform his duty 5 usc 701706 the administrative procedure act and of particular relevance here 28 usc 1331 the federal question jurisdiction statute256 focusing on 28 usc 1331 the court noted that the statute at the time contained minimum amount in controversy requirement of 10000 exclusive of interest and costs257 the court stated that the satisfaction of minimum amountincontroversy is not technicality it is requirement imposed by congress which the courts may not dispense with at their pleasure 258 because the select committee could not establish theory under which the amount in controversy requirement was satisfied the court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction259 senate select committee may still be cited for the proposition that absent specific congressional enactment congress may not seek to enforce subpoena in federal court it is important to note however that not only have subsequent cases held that where fundamental constitutional rights are involved this court has been willing to find satisfaction of the jurisdictional amount requirement for federal question jurisdiction260 but also that congress specifically removed the amount in controversy requirement for federal question jurisdiction in 1980261 given these developments combined with the reading of reed v county commissioners suggested above it appears possible to argue that specifically authorized congressional committee may bring civil action to enforce subpoena using 28 usc 1331 as basis for federal question jurisdiction such an argument has been suggested by the district court in waxman v thompson the ruleofseven case discussed above according to the court in waxman the holdings of reed senate select committee and united states v att262a case involving the intervention by house committee chai rman into lawsuit by the department of justice which was attempting to enjoin compliance with committee subpoena by att suggest that legislative branch suits to enforce requests for information from the executive branch are justiciable if authorized by one or both houses of congress 263 while we have found instance where committee of either the house or senate has attempted to use this argument to enforce subpoena it appears to be consistent with both the plain meaning of the statute and reasonable interpretation of the existing case law although as indicated prior to the 110 th congress there have been previous attempts by house of congress to seek civil enforcement of bpoenas in federal court authorized solely by 255 id at 61 256 id at 5561 257 28 usc 1331 1970 258 senate select committee

appear to be closely analogous on several occasions the house of representatives has authorized via house resolution the intervention by counsel representing house committee into civil litigation involving congressional subpoenas in june of 1976 subpoenas were issued to the american telephone and telegraph company att by the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce the subcommittee was seeking copies of all national security request letters sent to tt and its subsidiaries by the fbi as well as records of such taps prior to the time when the practice of sending such letters was initiated 265 before tt could comply with the request the department of justice doj and the subcommittees chairman representative john moss entered into negotiations seeking to reach an alternate agreement which would prevent tt from having to turn over all its records 266 when these negotiations broke down the doj sought an injunction in the district court for the district of columbia prohibiting tt from complying with the subcommittees subpoenas the house of representatives responded to the litigation by authorizing representative moss to intervene in the suit on behalf of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and the house of representatives267 specifically the authorization for intervention was accomplished by house resolution which provided that chairman moss was to represent the committee and the full house to secure information relating to th privacy of telephone communications now in the possession of tt for the use of the committee and the full house 268 in addition the resolution authorized chairman moss to hire special counsel use not more than 50000 from the contingent fund of the committee to cover expenses and to report to the full house on matters related as soon as practicable269 the resolution was adopted by the house by vote of 180108 on august 26 1976270 chairman mosss intervention into the proceedings was noted by the district court and does not appear to have been contested by either tt or the doj271 chairman moss remained an intervener pursuant to the house resolution through the

subcommittee promptly authorized subpoena for the documents and chairman moss filed resolution for authorization from the house to allo w him to intervene with special counsel in the suit that ashland oil had filed seeking to enjoin the ftc from transferring the documents to the subcommittee 272 the district court granted chairman mosss motion to intervene and ultimately refused to grant the

antitrust dispute for the purpose of obtaining access to documents subpoenaed by subcommittees from party to the litigation the subpoenaed documents had been obtained through litigation discovery and were thus subject to standing court protective order the district court refused to modify its protective order allowing the party to comply with the subpoena 277 the subcommittee chairmen appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit on appeal the fifth circuit entertained motion to dismiss by one of the plaintiffs on the grounds that the chairmen had not obtained authorization from the full house of representatives before filing their initial motion before the district court the plaintiffs relied on what was then rule xi cl 2m2b of the rules of the house of representatives which provided that compliance with any subpoena sic issued by committee or subcommittee may be enforced only as authorized or directed by the house 278 the committee chairmen responded by arguing that the rule was not applicable as they were not seeking to enforce their subpoenas but rather were seeking modification of the district courts protective order279 therefore according to the chairmen they did not require authorization from the full house of representatives to appear in court280 272 see generally ashland oil inc v ftc 548 f2d 977 dc cir 1976 see also hres

specifically that the house rules require house authorization not only for direct enforcement of subpoena but also in any instance when house committee seeks to institute or to intervene in litigation and of course to appeal from court decision particularly when the purpose is as here to obtain the effectuation of subpoena281 the court also extensively relied on the ashland oil precedent noting that similar to this case the chairman in ashland oil was not seeking to enforce subpoena rather merely attempting to prevent an injunction from being issued 282 the failure of the chairmen to obtain an authorization resolution from the full house in this case necessitated the dismissal of their appeal without any decision on the merits283 as neither att ashland oil nor in re beef raised any questions regarding the jurisdiction of the federal courts it appears possible to argue that all that is legally required for committees the house general counsel or houseretained pr ivate counsel to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas or other orders is that authorization be granted by resolution of the full house absent such authorization it appears that the courts will not entertain civil motions of any kind on behalf of congress or its committees while some may still argue that law passed by both houses and signed by the president conferring jurisdiction is required it may be plausibly argued that taken together the combination of reed s requirement that congressional authorization to sue be by express language the willingness of federal courts to accept properly authorized interventions and the fact that the federal question jurisdiction statute longer contains an amount in controversy requirement suggest that if an authorization resolution by the house can be obtained there is likelihood that reviewing court will find legal impediment to seeking civil enforcement of subpoenas or other committee orders 284

as legislation is often given meaning by the gloss of legislative reports administrative interpretation and long usage so the proper meaning of an authorization to congressional committee is not to be derived alone from its abstract terms unrelated to the definite content furnished them by the course of congressional actions297 it appears that the clear articulation of committee jurisdiction in both the house and senate rules combined with the express authorization of special committees by resolution has effectively eliminated the use of jurisdiction as defense to contempt proceedings

congress such as the authority of each house to discipline its own members judge the returns of the their elections and to conduct impeachment proceedings 298 although the early case of kilbourn v thompson299 held that the investigation in that case was an improper probe into the private affairs of individuals the courts today generally will presume that there is legislative purpose for an investigation and the house or senate rule or resolution authorizing the investigation does not have to specifically state the committees legislative purpose300 in in re chapman 301 the court upheld the validity of resolution authorizing an inquiry into charges of corruption against certain senators despite the fact that it was silent as to what might be done when the investigation was completed the court stated the questions were undoubtedly pertinent to the subject matter of the inquiry the resolutions directed the committee to inquire whether any senator has been or is speculating in what are known as sugar stocks during the consideration of the tariff bill now before the senate what the senate might or might not do upon the facts when ascertained we cannot say nor are we called upon to inquire whether such ventures might be defensible as contended in argument but it is plain that negative answers would have cleared that body of what the senate regarded as offensive imputations while affirmative answers might have led to further action on the part of the senate within its constitutional powers nor will it do to hold that the senate had jurisdiction to pursue the particular inquiry because the preamble and resolutions did not specify that the proceedings were taken for the purpose of censure or expulsion if certain facts were disclosed by the investigation the matter was within the range of the constitutional powers of the senate the resolutions adequately indicated that the transactions referred to were deemed by the senate reprehensible and deserving of condemnation and punishment the right to expel extends to all cases where the offense is such as in the judgment of the senate is inconsistent with the trust and duty of member 296 360 us 109 117 1959 297 see

was without legitimate object and so encroach upon the province of that body indeed we think it affirmatively appears that the senate was acting within its right and it was certainly not necessary that the resolutions should declare in advance what the senate meditated doing when the investigation was concluded 302 in mcgrain v daugherty 303 the original resolution that authorized the senate investigation into the teapot dome affair made mention of legislative purpose subsequent resolution for the attachment of contumacious witness declared th at his testimony was sought for the purpose of obtaining information necessary as basis for such legislative and other action as the senate may deem necessary and proper the court found that the investigation was ordered for legitimate object it wrote the only legitimate object the senate could have in ordering the investigation was to aid it in legislating and we think the subject matter was such that the presumption should be indulged that this was the real object an express avowal of the object would have been better but in view of the particular subjectmatter was not indispensable the second resolutionthe one directing the witness be attacheddeclares that this testimony is sought with the purpose of obtaining information necessary as basis for such legislative and other action as the senate may deem necessary and proper this avowal of contemplated legislation is in accord with what we think is the right interpretation of the earlier resolution directing the investigation the suggested possibility of other action if deemed necessary or proper is of course open to criticism in that there is other action in the matter which would be within the power of the senate but we do not assent to the view that this indefinite and untenable suggestion invalidates the entire proceeding the right view in our opinion is that it takes nothing from the lawful object avowed in the same resolution and is rightly inferable from the earlier one it is not as if an inadmissible or unlawful object were affirmatively and definitely avowed 304 moreover when the purpose asserted is supported by reference to specific problems which in the past have been or in the future may be the subject of appropriate legislation it has been held that court cannot say that committee of the congress exceeds its power when it seeks information in such areas305 in the past the types of legislative activity which have justified the exercise of the power to investigate have included the primary functions of legislating and appropriating306 the function of deciding whether or not legislation is appropriate307 oversight of the administration of the laws by the executive branch308 and the essential congressional function of informing itself in matters of national concern309 in addition congresss power to investigate such diverse matters as foreign and domestic subversive activities310 labor union corruption311 302 in

others312have all been upheld by the supreme court313 despite the courts broad interpretation of legislative purpose congresss authority is not unlimited courts have held that committee lacks legislative purpose if it appears to be conducting legislative trial rather than an investigation to assist in performing its legislative function314 furthermore although there is congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure315 so long as congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power the judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the motives which spurred the exercise of that power316 g18g142g155g157g146g151g142g151g140g162g561 two different issues of pertinency arise in regard to contempt prosecution317 first witnesss refusal to answer questions or provide subpoenaed documents will be punished as contempt only if the questions posed or documents requested by the committee are in the language of the statute pertinent to the question under inquiry 318 in determining general questions of the pertinency of inquiries the courts have required only that the specific inquiries be reasonably related to the subject matter under investigation319 given the breadth of congressional investigations the courts have long recognized that pertinency in the legislative context is broader than in the judicial context which relies primarily on the law of evidences standard of relevance for example the dc circuit has stated that legislative inquiry may be as broad as searching and as exhaustive as is necessary to make effective the constitutional powers of congress judicial inquiry relates to case and the evidence to be admissible must be measured by the narrow limits of the pleadings legislative inquiry anticipates all possible cases which may arise thereunder and the evidence admissible must be responsive to the scope of the inquiry which generally is very broad 320 the second pertinency issue concerns the fifth amendments due process

undisputable clarity it is the duty of the investigative body upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto to be meaningful the explanation must describe what the topic under inquiry is and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it 322 in addition according to commentators witness is entitled to understand the specific aspect of the committees jurisdiction under its authorizing resolution or house or senate rule to which the question relates323 finally it appears that the committee must specifically rule on pertinency objection and if the objection is overruled inform the witness of that fact before again directing him to answer the question the court has also observed that witness migh t resort to several sources in determining the subject matter of an investigation these include but are likely not limited to the house or senate resolution authorizing the committee inquiry b the committees resolution authorizing the subcommittee investigation c the introductory statement of the chairman or other committee members d the nature of the proceedings and the chairmans response to witnesss objections on the grounds of lack of pertinency324 g25g146g149g149g143g158g149g151g142g156g156g561 conviction for statutory criminal contempt cannot be sustained unless the failure to appear before the committee to produce documents or to respond to questions is willful intentional act325 however an evil motive does not have to be established326 because of the willfulness requirement and to satisfy constitutional due process standards when witness objects to question or otherwise refuses to answer the chai rman or presiding member should rule on any objection and if the objection is overruled the witness should be clearly directed to answer327 it has been observed that there is talismanic formula which committee must use in directing witness to answer but he should be clearly informed and not left to the risk of guessing upon pain of criminal penalties whether the grounds for his objection to answering are accepted or rejected and if they are rejected he should be given another chance to answer328 the procedure to be followed in responding to witnesss objections to questions has been

has turned on weighing of the legislative need for disclosure against any possible resulting injury 334 more particularly the process of committee resolution of claims of attorney client privilege has traditionally been informed by weighing considerations of legislative need public policy and the statutory duty of congressional committees to engage in continuous oversight of the application administration and execution of laws that fall within their jurisdiction335 against any possible injury to the witness in the particular circumstances of any situation committee may consider and evaluate the strength of claimants assertion in light of the pertinency of the documents or information sought to the subject of the investigation the practical unavailability of the documents or information from any other source the possible unavailability of the privilege to the claimant if it were to be raised in judicial forum and the committees assessment of the cooperation of the witness

compelling character336 moreover the conclusion that recognition of nonconstitutionally based privileges such as attorneyclient privilege is matter of congressional discretion is consistent with both traditional british parliamentary and the congresss historical practice337 although there is limited case law with respect to attorneyclient privilege claims before congressional committees338 appellate court rulings on the privilege in cases involving other investigative contexts eg grand jury have raised questions as to whether executive branch officials may claim attorneyclient work product or deliberative process privileges in the face of investigative demands339 these rulings may lead to additional arguments in support of the long standing congressional practice the legal basis for congresss practice in this area is based upon its inherent constitutional prerogative to investigate which has been long recognized by the supreme court as extremely broad and encompassing and which is at its peak when the subject is fraud abuse or maladministration within government department340 the attorneyclient privilege is on the other hand not constitutionally based privilege rather

which is to be narrowly construed and has been confined to the judicial forum341 while court has recognized the inapplicability of the attorneyclient privilege in congressional proceedings in decision directly addressing the issue342 an opinion issued by the legal ethics committee of the district of columbia bar in february 1999 clearly acknowledges the longstanding congressional practice343 the occasion for the ruling arose as result of an investigation of subcommittee of the house commerce committee into the circumstances surrounding the planned relocation of the federal communications commission to the portals office complex344 during the course of the inquiry the subcommittee sought certain documents from the portals developer mr franklin l haney mr haneys refusal to comply resulted in subpoenas for those documents to him and the law firm representing him during the relocation efforts both mr haney and the law firm asserted attorneyclient privilege in their continued refusal to comply in addition the law firm sought an opinion from the dc bars ethics committee as to its obligations in the face of the subpoena and possible contempt citation the bar committee notified the firm that the question was novel and that advice could be given until the matter was considered in plenary session of the committee 345 the firm continued its refusal to comply until the subcommittee cited it for contempt at which time the firm proposed to turn over the documents if the contempt ci tation was withdrawn the subcommittee agreed to the proposal346 subsequently on february 16 1999 the dc bars ethics committee issued an opinion vindicating the action taken by the firm the ethics committee interpreting dc bar rule of professional conduct 16d2a347 held that an attorney faced with congressional subpoena that would reveal client confidences or secrets has professional responsibility to seek to quash or limit the subpoena on all available legitimate grounds to protect confidential docum ents and client secrets if thereafter the congressional subcommittee overrules these objections orders production of the documents and threatens to hold the lawyer in contempt absent compliance with the subpoena then in the absence of judicial order forbidding the production the lawyer is permitted but not required by the dc rules of professional conduct to produce

party action to enjoin compliance348 but allows the attorney to relent at the earliest point when he is put in legal jeopardy the opinion represents the first and thus far the only bar in the nation to directly and definitively address the merits of the issue in the end of course it is the congressional committee alone that determines whether to accept claim of attorneyclient privilege

common law rules of evidence as well as statutory enactments recognize testimonial privilege for witnesses in judicial proceeding so that they need not reveal confidential communications between doctor and patient husband and wife or clergyman and parishioner 349 although there is court case directly on point it appears that like the privilege between attorney and client congressional committees are not legally required to allow witness to decline to testify on the basis of other similar testimonial privileges350 it should be noted however that the courts have denied claims by the white house counsels office of attorney work product immunity in the face of grand jury subpoenas that have been grounded on the assertion that the materials sought were prepared in anticipation of possible congressional hearings351 in addition court decisions indicate that various rules of procedure generally applicable to judicial proceedings such as the right to crossexamine and call other witnesses need not be accorded to witness in congressional hearing352 the basis for these determinations is rooted in congresss article i section 5 rulemaking powers353 under which each house is the exclusive determiner of the rules of its own proceedings this rulemaking authority as well as general separation of powers considerations 348 direct suit to enjoin committee from enforcing subpoena

courts have emphasized the requirements discussed above concerning authorization for the investigation delegation of power to investigate to the committee involved and the existence of legislative purpose362 while the court has recognized the application of the first amendment to congressional investigations and although the amendment has frequently been asserted by witnesses as grounds for not complying with congressional demands f or information the court has never relied on the first amendment as grounds for reversing criminal contempt of congress conviction363 however the court has narrowly construed the scope of committees authority so as to avoid reaching first amendment issue364 in addition the court has ruled in favor of witness who invoked his first amendment rights in response to questioning by state legislative committee365 in 1976 investigation of the unauthorized publication in the press of the report of the house select committee on intelligence the committee on standards of official conduct subpoenaed four news media representatives including daniel schorr366 the standards of official conduct committee concluded that mr schorr had obtained copy of the select committees report and had made it available for publication although the ethics committee found that mr schorrs role in publishing the report was defiant act in disregard of the expressed will of the house of representatives to preclude publication of highly classified national security information it declined to cite him for contempt fo r his refusal to disclose his source367 the desire to avoid continued its 54 decision the court concluded that the need of the grand jury for the information outweighed first amendment considerations but there are indications in the opinion that the infringement of protected first amendment rights must be broader than necessary to achieve permissible go vernmental purpose and that states interest must be compelling or paramount to justify even an indirect burden on first amendment rights id at 699700 see also gibson v florida legisla tive investigation committee 372 us 539 1963 applying the compelling interest test in legislative investigation

in the committees decision on the contempt matter368 in another first amendment dispute the special subcommittee on investigations of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce in the course of its probe of allegations that deceptive editing practices were employed in the production of the television news documentary program the selling of the pentagon subpoenaed frank stanton the president of cbs directing him to deliver to the subcommittee the outtakes relating to the program369 when on first amendment grounds stanton declined to provide the subpoenaed materials the subcommittee unanimously voted contempt citation and the full committee by vote of 2513 recommended to the house that stanton be held in contempt370 after extensive debate the house failed to adopt the committee report voting instead to recommit the matter to the committee371 during the debate several members expressed concern that approval of the contempt citation would have chilling effect on the press and would unconstitutionally involve the government in the regulation of the press 372 g8g152g158g155g157g145g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 several opinions of the supreme court indicate that the fourth amendments prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is applicable to congressional committees however there has not been an opinion directly addressing the issue 373 it appears that there must be legitimate legislative or oversightrelated basis for the issuance of congressional subpoena374 the fourth amendment protects congressional witness against subpoena which is unreasonably broad or burdensome375 the court has outlined the standard to be used in judging the reasonableness of congressional subpoena petitioner contends that the subpoena was so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the fourth amendment adequacy or excess in the breath of the subpoena are matters variable in relation to the nature purposes and scope of the inquiry the subcommittee s inquiry here was relative1y broad one and the permissible scope of materials that could reasonably be sought was necessarily equally broad it was not reasonable to suppose that the subcommittee knew precisely what books 368 id at 4748 additional views of representatives spence teague hutchinson and flynt 369 the outtakes were portions of the cbs film clips

therefore the subpoena could only specify with reasonable particularity the subjects to which the documents relate the call of the subpoena for all records correspondence and memoranda of the civil rights congress relating to the specified subject describes them with all of the particularity the nature of the inquiry and the subcommittees situation would permit the description contained in the subpoena was sufficient to able petitioner to know what particular documents were required and to select them adequately 376 if witness has legal objection to subpoena duces tecum or is for some reason unable to comply with demand for documents he must give the grounds for his noncompliance upon the return of the subpoena as the dc circuit stated if the witness felt he could refuse complian ce because he considered the subpoena so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure within the prohibition of the fourth amendment then to avoid contempt for complete noncompliance he was under an obligation to inform the subcommittee of his position the subcommittee would then have had the choice of adhering to the subpoena as formulated or of meeting the objection in light of any pertinent representations made by the witness 377 similarly if subpoenaed party is in doubt as to what records are required by subpoena or believes that it calls for documents not related to the investigation he must inform the committee where witness is unable to produce documents he will not be held in contempt unless he is responsible for their unavailability or is impeding justice by not explaining what happened to them378 the application of the exclusionary rule to congressional committee investigation is in some doubt and appears to depend on the precise facts of the situation it seems that documents which were unlawfully seized at the direction of congressional investigating committee may not be admitted into evidence in subsequent unrelated criminal prosecution because of the command of the exclusionary rule379 in the absence of supreme court ruling it remains unclear whether the exclusionary rule bars the admission into evidence in contempt prosecution of congressional subpoena which was issued on the basis of documents obtained by the committee following their unlawful seizure by another investigating body such as state prosecutor 380 376 mcphaul 364

although it has never been necessary for the supr eme court to decide the issue in dicta it has been indicated that the privilege against selfincrimination afforded by the fifth amendment is available to witness in congressional investigation381 the privilege is personal in nature382 and may not be invoked on behalf of corporation383 small partnership384 labor union385 or other artificial organizations386 the privilege protects witness against being compelled to testify but generally not against subpoena for existing documentary evidence387 however where compliance with subpoena duces tecum would constitute implicit testimonial authentication of the documents produced the privilege may apply388 there is required verbal formula for invoking the privilege nor does there appear to be necessary warning by the committee389 committee should recognize any reasonable indication such as the fifth amendment that the witness is asserting his privilege390 where committee is uncertain whether the witness is in fact invoking the privilege against self incrimination or is claiming some other basis for declining to answer the committee should direct the witness to specify his privilege or objection391 the committee can review the assertion of the privilege by witness to determine its validity but the witness is not required to articulate the precise hazard that he fears in regard to the assertion of the privilege in judicial proceedings the supreme court has advised continued found it unn ecessary to decide whether calandra applies to committees but indicated that even

implications of the question in the setting in which it is asked that responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result to reject claim it should be perfectly cl ear from careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case that the witness is mistaken and that the answers cannot possibly have tendency to incriminate 392 the basis for asserting the privilege was elaborated upon in lower court decision the privilege may only be asserted when there is reasonable apprehension on the part of the witness that his answer would furnish some evidence upon which he could be convicted of criminal offense or which would reveal sources from which evidence could be obtained that would lead to such conviction or to prosecution therefore once it has become apparent that the answers to question would expose witness to the danger of conviction or prosecution wider latitude is permitted the witness in refusing to answer other questions 393 the privilege against selfincrimination may be waived by declining to assert it specifically disclaiming it or testifying on the same matters as to which the privilege is later asserted however because of the importance of the privilege court will not construe an ambiguous statement of witness before committee as waiver394 where witness asserts the privilege the full house or the committee conducting the investigation may seek court order which directs the witness to testify and b grants him immunity against the use of his testimony or other evidence derived from his testimony in subsequent criminal prosecution395 the immunity that is granted is use immunity not transactional immunity neither the immunized testimony that the witness gives nor evidence derived therefrom may be used against him in subsequent criminal prosecution except one for perjury or contempt relating to his testimony however he may be convicted of the crime the transaction on the basis of other evidence 396 the application for the judicial immunity order must be approved by majority of the house or senate or by twothirds vote of the full committee seeking
