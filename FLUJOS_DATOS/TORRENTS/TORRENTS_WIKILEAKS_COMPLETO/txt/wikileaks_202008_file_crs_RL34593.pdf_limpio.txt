divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34593infringement of intellectual property rights and state sovereign immunity summary the eleventh amendment to the us constitution provides that the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citiz ens or subjects of any foreign state although the amendment appears to be focused on preven ting suits against state by nonresidents in federal courts the us supreme c ourt has expanded the concept of state sovereign immunity to reach much further th an the literal text of the amendment to include immunity from suits by the states own citizens and immunity from suits under federal law within st ates own court system as result of two landmark s upreme court decisions in 1999 florida prepaid and college savings bank the eleventh amendment cu rrently bars an individual from successfully seeking damages from state for violations of federal intellectual property laws unless the state clearly cons ents to being sued through waiver or congress legitimately abrogates state sovereign immunity valid waiver exists only where state has clearly submitted itself to federal jurisdiction courts have interpreted this rule to validate waiver in several scenarios where state voluntarily removes case to federal court where state voluntarily initiates and participates in the litigation where the case is part of one continuous action in which the state previously waived its immunity where state enacts legislation waiving its sovereign immunity or where state ente rs contract containing provision in which the state specifically submits to federal court jurisdiction in the case of dispute absent these form s of clear waiver state doe s not relinquish its privilege of sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity to suit under federal intellectual property laws is valid only wh achieved through congressional statute passed pursuant to the enforcement power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment valid statute passed pursuant to 5 will be limited in scope and remedy pervasive and unredressed constitutional violation the supreme court has previously invalidated congressional attempts to abrogate state sovereign immunity in intellectual property lawsuits against state governments where there has been clear waiver by the state nor abrogation of state sovereignty by congress party cannot obtain damages from state under federal law the injured party may however sue the individual official responsible for the violation for prospective injunctive relief under the ex parte young doctrine in order to obtain this kind of nonmonetary relief the party must show continued violation of federal law and an adequate connection between the named official and the actual violation in response to florida prepaid and college

false advertisinginfringement of intellectual property rights and state sovereign immunity in accordance with the doctrine of fe deralism the american constitutional system divides privilege nd power between the central national government and the individual states significant constitutional conflicts often arise however where the legitimate exercise of power at one level is incompatible with the legitimate exercise of power at the other the convergence of state sovereign immunity and federal intellectual property law provides one example of the complicated interaction between the powers of the federal government the state and the individual and the inevitable conflicts that arise as all three attempt to exercise their established powers and rights the eleventh amendment to the us constitution with limited exceptions bars an individual from suing state under federal law without the states consent while states may consent to suit by waiving the privilege of sovereign immunity in limited circumstances congress may also abrogate or overrule that immunity by passing statute pursuant to the enfor cement power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment1 there are times however when state may decide against waiving its sovereign immunity and congress is unable to abrogate sovereign immunity pursuant to the fourteenth amendment in these situations an individual is barred from suing state for monetary damages for violation of federal law intellectual property has emerged as one area wher congress has been unsuccessful in abrogating sovereign immunity and states ve not expressly chosen to waive their constitutionally protected privilege of immunity therefore individuals may not recover damages under federal patent copyright or trademark law for infringements perpetrated by

the federal circuit in blueport co llc v united states 533 f3d 1374 fed cir 2008 determined that the dmca contains express waiver of sovereign immunity and that 28 usc 1498b does not apply because

remedies differ when the defendant is the federal government in copyright nd patent infringement cases federal government infringement of copyrigh t or patent may give rise to cause of action that is governed by statute 28 u sc 1498 this law provides that if the federal government uses pa tented invention without the authorization of the patent holder or if the federal g overnment infringes

that the federal government remains fully liable for all forms of reliefboth monetary and injunctive that ar provided under the lanham act in the case of trademark infringement 29 yet when state governments and state institutions such as stateowned universities infringe copyrights patents or trademarks the ip owner currently has very limited legal recourse because of the us supreme courts jurisprudence concerning the eleventh amendment this case law has produced what some consider an anomalous outcome state ma own copyright patent or trademark and sue to enforce its rights in federal

1an introduction to the eleventh amendment and state sovereign immunity shortly after the revolutionary war two citizens of south carolina sued the state of georgia to recover revolutionary war debt owed by the state the case eventually made its way to the us supreme court where in chisholm v georgia the court noted that article iii of the cons titution specifically granted the federal courts jurisdiction over suits between state and citizens of another state31 the authorization came as considerable surprise to the states which had each relied on the immunity from suit that had commonly accompanied state sovereignty in direct rebuke of chisholm congress and the states immediately acted to protect state sovereign immunity through the ratification of the eleventh amendment the first amendment to the constitution subsequent to the bill of rights the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state32 though the language of the amendment appears to bar only suits against state by nonresidents the supreme court has interpreted the doctrine of sovereign immunity to also bar suits by citizens against their own state33 the eleventh amendment therefore protects states from being sued in federal court w ithout their consent in both federal question and diversity cases34 the court expanded the purview of the amendment in alden v maine to include immunity from suit under fede ral law within states own court system35 in hans v louisiana the court considered whether the grant of federal jurisdiction found in article iii of the cons titution negated state sovereign immunity36 in holding that it did not the court characterized the eleventh amendment as specific attempt to overturn the courts misinterpretation in chisholm rather than an affirmative amendment to the original structure of the constitution the eleventh amendment had not constituted change in the constitution the court determined but re storation of the or iginal and intended constitutional design this interpretation allowed the court to expand sovereign immunity beyond the confines of the nguage of the eleventh amendment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34593crs6 37 517 us 44 1996 38 id at 723 the eleventh amendment rest ricts the judicial

until 1996 that the court attemp ted to define the extent to which congress had the authority to abrogate sovereign immunity where state refused to waive its protection in seminole tribe of florida v florida the supreme court reasoned that because the eleventh amendment was ratified after article i of the constitution congress could not abrogate st ate sovereign immunity pursuant to any legislative power granted under the numerated powers of article i 837 the court did however suggest that congress could abrogate sovereign immunity through statute passed pursuant to the 5 enforcement power of the fourteenth amendment because that legislative authority was granted subsequent to the ratification of the eleventh amendment38 it became clear following seminole tribe that any attempt by congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity would have to be justified under the fourteenth amendment the road to florida prepaid and college savings bank from 179039 to 1962 court had dismissed suit for alleged intellectual property infringement by state on eventh amendment sovereign immunity grounds40 an individual was free to recover damages from state that was guilty of copyright patent or trademark infringemen t then in 1962 copyright infringement action against an iowa school district was dismissed by the eighth circuit court of appeals for lack of jurisdiction under the eleventh amendment41 the issue simmered until 1985 when the suprem court dismissed an employment discrimination case on sovereign immun ity grounds because congress had not provided the requisite une quivocal language in th rehabilitation act of 1973 necessary to abrogate state sovereign immunity42 the court in atascadero state hospital v scanlon held that federal statutes purpor ting to abrogate state sovereign immunity must clearly express congresss in tent to provide remedy for individuals filing suit against state43 the federal circuit cour t of appeals then applied atascadero in chew v california in holding that the patent act did not contain the requisite unmistakable lang uage of congressional intent necessary to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity44 congress concerned about the integrity of its intellectual property laws and unwilling to accept the proposition that states could enjoy the protections of fede ral intellectual property law without recognizing

unequivocally abrogated state sovereign immunity and subjected the states to suits for monetary damages brought by individuals for violation of federal copyright trademark or patent law in 1999 sensing growing tension be tween state and federal power the supreme court granted certiorari to review two companion cases out of the third circuit and federal circ uit court of appeals48 dealing directly with the abrogation of state sovereign immunity under the prca and the trca49 college savings bank had been awarded patent for its financing methodology based on certificates of deposit and annuity contracts designed to guarantee investors funds for future college expenses the state of flor ida soon adopted college savings banks methodology and created the florida prep aid postsecondary education expense board the board to issue similar financing options to its own residents consequently college savings bank filed two separate actions seeking damages from the board in the first action florida prepaid v college savings bank college savings bank filed claim for patent infringement against the board under the prca50 in the second action college savings bank v florida prepaid college savings bank filed claim alleging false and misleading advertising by the board under the trca51 in defense the board argued that both the prca and the trca were an improper attempt by congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity the united states intervened in both cases in support of college savings bank the principal issue in florida prepaid was whether the prca had legitimately abrogated state sovereign immunity from suit for patent infringement college savings bank argued that congress had lawf ully done so pursuant to the due process clause by ensuring an individual an adequa remedy in the case of deprivation of property perpetrated by the state in the fo rm of patent infringement the board responded that the prca wa s passed pursuant to congre sss enumerated article i powers rather than its powers under the fourteenth amendment and therefore constituted invalid abrogation under seminole tribe the district court agreed with college savings bank and denied

of the fourteenth amendment to do so52 the prca had specifically made states instrumentalities of states and officers and employees of states acting in their official capacity subject to suit in federal court by an person for infringements of patents53 however the supreme court overturne d the federal circuit decision holding that the prca was not valid use of the 5 enforcement power of the fourteenth amendment and therefore not legitimate abrogation of state sovereign immunity54 in reaffirming that congress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to article i powers the court applied its holding in city of boerne v flores55 to determine whether the prca was aimed at securing property protections guaranteed under the fourteenth amendment rather than passed pursuant to article i 8 clause 856 while admitting that patents were property protected by the due process clause the court held that because congress had not shown sufficient evidence of widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights nor adequately considered the availability of alternative remedies under st ate law the prca was so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent uncons titutional behavior57 the principal issue in college savings bank was whether the state of florida had indirectly waived sovereign immunity by electing to engage in federally regulated activity knowing that such conduc t would subject it to suit under federal law college savings bank argued that congress had lawfully abrogated state sovereign immunity in trademark infringement actions through the trca alternatively college savings bank argued that florida had waived sovereign immunity by voluntarily engaging in the activity of selling and advertising for profit educational investment vehicle in interstate commerce after being put on notice by the clear language of the trca that it would be subject to liability for doing so58 the district court was not swayed by college savings banks arguments and dismissed the case the court of ppeals for the third circuit affirmed the supreme court affirmed the dismissa l holding that floridas actions did not constitute waiver the court first brushed aside the petitioners abrogation argument reasoning that neither of the trcas false or misleading advertisinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34593crs9 59 the court explained that while trademarks are constitutionally cognizable property interests in which their owners have the ri ght to

id at 672 61 id at 676 62 as explained above college savings bank concerned only the false and misleading advertisement provisions of the federal nham act 15 usc 1125a and not the provisions of the lanham act that pertain to infringement of trademarks thus the supreme court did not definitively rule on the issue of trademark infringement and state sovereign immunity nor has it opined on this matter in any other subsequent case the court has also not directly addressed the issue of state liability for copyright infringement however federal court of appeals has applied florida prepaid in holding that the copyright remedy clarification act was an improper exercise of congressional power chavez v arte publico press 204 f3d 601 607 5th cir 2000 similarly federal district court has ruled

1883provisions related to in terests that would qualify as prope rty interests protected by the due process clause59 and were therefore not passe d pursuant to the fourteenth amendment60 the court devoted large part of its opinion to rejecting college savings banks argument that florida had waived sovereign immunity through its knowing par ticipation in an activity that would subject it to suit under the trca the majority refused to recognize any form of constructive waiver in sovereign immunity instead waiver could only be found where the state voluntarily invoked federal jurisdiction or where the state makes clear d eclaration that it intends to submit itself to federal jurisdiction61 florida had done neither as result of florida prepaid and college savings bank the eleventh amendment currently bars an individual from successfully seeking damages from state for federal patent and likely copyright and trademark infringement62 unless the state has clearly consented to the suit through waiver or congress has successfully abrogated state sovereign immunity pursuant to valid use of its legislative power under the fourteenth am endment the specifics of these two avenues that would permit state to be sued waiver and abrogation are discussed in detail below state waiver of sovereign immunity although state sovereign immunity is personal privilege which it may waive at its pleasure the court will only recogn ize waiver in instances where the state has explicitly shown its intent to waive immunity63 the college savings bank court held that waiver would onl be

not constitute clear declara tion of waiver of imm unity in the federal system illustrating the importance of state sovereign immunity the court equated the requirements for waiver of sovereign immunity by state to the requirements for waiver of protected constitutional right by an individual65 in order to convey the seriousness with which the court would approach the standard for waiver of states right to immunity in federal court the majority opinion in college savings bank specifically overturned existing precedent relating to waiver implied by the states actions rather than through express consent at issue in parden v terminal r of ala docks dept was statute congress had passed that authorized employment discrimination suits by employees of any employer operating railroad in interstate commerce66 the parden court held against strong dissent that by operating railroad in interstate commerce alabama must be taken to have accepted that condition and thus to have consented to suit67 by participating as common carrier in interstate commerce th state had impliedly or constructively waived sovereign immunity the petitioner in college savings bank used the parden precedent to argue that florida by engaging in the activity of selling and adve rtising forprofit educational investment vehicle in inte rstate commerce with the knowledge that doing so would subject it to suit under the trca had impliedly waived its immunity68 the court refused to accept the argument after outlining the many cases that had narrowed the legitimacy of constructive waiver under parden the court expressly overruled the parden anomaly there is little reason to assume actual consent based upon the states re presence in field subject to congressional regulation69 even where state is on notice that participation in given field could subject it to suit under fede ral law merely ente ring the regulated field does not amount to volunt ary decision to waive immunity in overruling parden college savings bank made clear that federal court would require explicit evidence of an intent to waive sovereign immunity before allowing case against state to proceed while this case barred the recognition of an implied waiver based on gene ral state participation in regulated field other cases have wrestled with the extent to which states may invoke federal court jurisdiction and waive

removes case from state court to federal court70 in lapides v board of regents the court clearly distinguished between the repudiated parden style constructive waiver and waivers effected by affirmative litigation conduct such as removal71 paul lapides professor at the university of geor gia had brought suit against the board of regents of the university system of georgi for violation of st ate and federal civil rights law the state of georgia joined with their codefendants to remove the case to federal district court and asked for di smissal of the claims under state sovereign immunity the court limiting its holding to those situations in which state has expressly waived immunity in the underlying state court pr oceedings held that where state voluntarily removes case to federal court it engages in affirmative litigation conduct sufficient to waive sovereign immun ity in reaching its holding the court expressed concern over the unfair tactical advantages and selective use of immunity that state would enjoy by removing case to federal court72 lapides however left unclear exactly what affi rmative litigation conduc t would qualify as waiver the federal circuit court

grounds of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity on appeal the federal circuit reversed the district court decision holding that where state initiates an administrative pro ceeding with ensuing judicial review the state cannot both retain the fruits of that action and bar the losing party from its statutory right of review74 by voluntarily commencing and participating in the pto interference action the state had waived its privilege of s overeign immunity with respect to judicial review of that decision in federal court the appellate court grounded its decision on the supreme courts

the argument pointing out that none of the cases biomedical cited supporte d the extension of state waiver to separate action instead all had involved the application of states waiver of immunity in the same continuous proceeding82 the court did acknowledge the existence of situations in which concerns of unfairness inconsis tency and selective use of immunity would be so significant as to outweigh the courts policy not to extend waiver to separate legal acti on similar concerns existed in the biomedical case however that were sufficient to preclude dhs from asserting immunity83 in

regents for trademark infringement related to the universitys use of the mark the university moved to dismiss the counterclaim on the grounds that the university is branch of the state of wisconsin and thus entitled to sovereign immunity88 the federal court granted the motion nd dismissed the software manufacturers counterclaim in reaching these decisions the court first examined the validity of congresss attempt to abrogate state immunity from trademark infringement suits pursuant to the trademark remedy clarification act noting that the supreme courts decision in college savings bank considered only the liability of states for claims brought under the false and misleadin g advertisement provisions of the federal lanham act and not the statutes tradem ark infringement provisions the district court concluded that it is unlikely the supreme court would reach different conclusion in trademark litigation89 citing that the trcas legislative history had not found pattern of trademark infringem ent by the states and that it had not seriously discussed fourteenth amendment concerns to justify abrogation the federal court ruled that the trca is not cong ruent and proportional to any fourteenth amendment injury and thus the trca wa s unconstitutional and fails to abrogate state immunity from trademark infringement suits90 with respect to the waiver issue the district court explained that th state of wisconsin has not constructively waived its immunity by participating in the federal trademark system while acknowledging that college savings bank had held that congress may condition gift on the waiver such as grant of funds to the state upon waiver of immunity the trademark remedy clarification act does not condition states receipt of federal trademark registrati on on waiver of sovereign immunity rather the court explained the trca seeks to expose all states to liability regardless of their participation in the federal trademark system91 the court also determined that wisconsin had not waived its immunity by appealing the ttabs cancellation decision to federal court because its invocation of federa l jurisdiction was not voluntary here the software manufacturer had initiated the administrative proceedings by petitioning the ttab to can cel the states trademark and the state was simply contesting unfavorable d ecisions in suits brought against it92 the supreme court set the standard for waiver of state sovereign immunity in college savings bank generally we will find waiver either if the state voluntarily invokes federal c ourts jurisdiction or else if the state makes clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to our jurisdiction93 state must clearly submit itself to federal jurisdiction and cannot constructively or

federal circuit and other federal di strict courts have interpreted this rule to validate waiver where state voluntarily removes case to federal court where state voluntarily initiates and participates in the litigation where the case is part of one continuous ac tion in which the state previously waived its immunity where state enacts legislation waiving its sovereign immunity or where state enters contract containing provision in which the state specifically submits to federal court jurisdiction in the case of dispute absent these forms of clear waiver state does not relinquish its privilege of sovere ign immunity under the eleventh amendment congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity although state sovereign immunity is common law privilege preserved by the eleventh amendment under limited situati ons congress may abrogate or override state immunity in given subject matter in seminole tribe the supreme court held that congress could not abrogate state s overeign immunity through statute passed pursuant to any of its article i powers however the court left the door open for abrogation by statutes passed pursuant to th 5 legislative enforcement power of the

what measures can be taken to prevent constitutional violations the city of boerne court held that there must be congruence and proportionality between th injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end95 in order to show the required proportionality congress must identify conduct transgre ssing the fourteenth amendments substantive provisions and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such conduct the florida prepaid court applied the city of boerne test to the prca and found the evidence of pate nt infringements by the states to be lacking

had failed to adequately consider the availability of state law remedies the court explained that re patent infringement by the state does not violate the due process clause rather only where the state provides remedy or only inadequate remedies to injured patent owners for its infringement of their patent could depriva tion of property without due process result98 where the state provides an adequate remedy or the necessa ry process prior to infringing patent there is violation of due process an statute that abrogated state sovereign immunity in situation where the patent infringement did not amount to constitutional violation of due process would thus be overboard the record showed congress had barely considered the availability of state remedies to patent infringements by the state99 because congress had not presented sufficient evidence of widespread and persisting deprivations of constitutional rights had not adequately considered the availability of state re medies and had not ad equately tailored its legislation to cover only those patent infringements by the state that constituted constitutional violations the prca was s out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object as to be considered an invalid use of the 5 enforcement power100 thus the abrogation provision of the prca was held to be invalid in 2000 the fifth circuit elaborated on the florida prepaid abrogation standard and applied the precedent to copyright law in chavez v arte publico press101 the plaintiff sued the university of houston for copyright infringement under the crca for publishing the plaintiffs book without her consent relying on florida prepaid the university invoked sovereign immunity as defense the court quickly recognized that copyright similar in na ture to

congresss 5 enforcement power and therefore valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity under florida prepaid in holding that the crca doomed in the wake of florida prepaid was not valid use of congresss 5 power the court gleaned functional threepart test from the supreme courts florida prepaid decision102 first the court must consider the nature of the injury and whether the states conduct

there was little documentation by congress of state contract or takings remedi and congress had refused to consider the possibility of granting states concurrent jurisdiction over copyright claims finally the court must consider the breadth of coverage of the legislation florida prepaid made clear that not all patent infringements violate the constitution negligent patent infringement for instance as opposed to an intentional violation woul d not constitute violati on of due process in chavez the court reasoned that because copyright infringement required finding of an intent to infringe any valid abrogation statute would have to limit its scope to include only intentional property infringements by the st ates that amounted to violation of due process107 florida prepaid chavez and other cases have not completely closed the door on federal abrogation of state sovereign immunity in the intellectual property realm if congress could show substantial incr ease in intentional intellectual property infringements by the states perhaps the courts would reconsider the existence of widespread pattern of infringement and uphold an abrogation attempt ten years after

prospective injunctive relief with congress unable to successfully ab rogate state sovereign immunity an individual may only recover damages where state has unequivocally expressed its consent to suit through clear waiver there are however limited alternative remedies available for indivi duals in those situations where the state has not waived its immunity while an aggrieved party may be able to recover monetary damages under state contract conversion or takings law the most likely relief for plaintiff in these situations would be to sue an i ndividual state officer in his or her official

provides avenue to recover monetary damages an individual may obtain court order forcing state officials to cease th eir unlawful conduct in ex parte young the supreme court established this prospective remedy in order to mitigate wrongs resulting from the state sovereign immunity defense and to pr event continued viola tions of federal law by state officials113 to satisfy the ex parte

immunity in the intellectual property area before enjoying the protections of federa l intellectual property law this provision created reasonable incentives for states to waive immunity without obliging them to do so122 this provision raised some constitutional concerns as to the apparent voluntariness of the states decision to waive their sovereign immunity critics argued that the waiver provision was simply veiled attempt at the same congressional abrogation of state sovereig n immunity struck down by the court in florida prepaid and college savings bank 123 the states strong financial interest in protecting its intellectual property may make the option of either waiving immunity or relinquishing recovery for pr operty infringements forced waiver124 critics also argued that the act violated the doctrine of unc onstitutional conditions which at its core means the government may not require person to give up constitutional right in exchange for discretionary benefit conferred by the government125 the act asked states to give up their constitutional right to state sovereign immunity in exchange for the benefits of federal intellectual property protections pr

the justices in florida prepaid and college savings bank the act specifically limited abrogation to those instances where the property infringement constitutes violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment or the takings clau of the fifth amendment129 the abrogation provision was narrowly tailored to onl include infringements amounting to constitutional violations in an attempt to ameliorate the supreme courts concern over the scope of the previous abrogation provisions found in the crca trca and prca critics argued however that this provision of the act still would not amount to valid abrogation of state sove reign immunity contending that regardless of the narrowly tailored statute the instances of unremedied intellectual property infringements by the states simply do not occur with the frequency required to classify abrogation as use of the fourteenth amendment enforcement power the act never made it out of committee the 1999 senate bill was referred to the
