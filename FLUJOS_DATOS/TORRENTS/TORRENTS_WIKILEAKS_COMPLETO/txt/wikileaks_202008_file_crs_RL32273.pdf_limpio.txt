proposed interstate air quality iaq rule appeared in the federal register january 30 2004 for pm25 the proposed rule finds that the inters tate transport of sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox from 28 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly to downwind nonattainme nt for ozone the proposed rule finds that interstate transport of nox from 25 states and dc contributes significantly to downwind nonattainment of the 8hour standard with the iaq rule epa proposes regi onwide emissions cap for nox and so2 to be implemented in two phases 2010 and 2015 based on the methodology employed in the proposed rule epa estima tes reductions of bout 70 from baseline emissions in 2015 epas met hodology determined the caps by applying highly cost effective pollution controls on electric generating units epa has presented the proposed iaq rule and the accompanying proposed mercury hg rule as suite of integrat ed air actions to reduce emissions of three pollutants so2 nox and hg the two proposed rules are integrated in such way that the technologies reducing so2 and nox emissions under the iaq rule also reduce enough hg emissions to meet the modest 2010 reduction re quirements of the proposed hg rule this combination of requirements and tec hnology allows utilities to meet the requirements of both rules without installing three different control technologies one for each pollutant as epa does not provide costbenefit analysis of hg reductions it is not possible to quantitatively determine whether this decision is economically efficient in terms of potential hg benef its foregone by not imposing more stringen t reduction requirement however from the broader perspective of the interaction of the proposed rules with the underlying clean air act caa ther is resulting lack of integration it is likely to be argued that the proposed rule simply represents another layer on an already multilayered cake calle d the clean air act adding regionwide annual cap and trade program onto regulatory structure whose foundation is healthbased national standards that focus on the local c oncentration of pollutants in the ambient air presents numerous difficulties as result there are multiple inconsistencies between the proposed rule and other provisi ons of the caa these conflicts are not surprising there is little epa can do to resolve them out by regulation if the administrations goal is to restructure caa compliance strategies toward market oriented cap and trade programs without creating more layers and conflicts it is possible

program focused on electric generators and intends on issuing proposed capand trade model program rule to encourage that option background why did epa do it in 1997 epa finalized new naaqs for both pm25 and ozone4 the new naaqs for ozone revised the previous ozone naaqs by tightening the standard from 012 parts per million ppm to 008 ppm increasing the averaging time from 1 hour to 8 hours and measuring compliance by averaging concentrations rather than by counting individual peak concentrations exceeding the standard the new pm25 naaqs was set at an annual maximum concentration of 15 micrograms per cubic meter ugm3 based on the 3year av erage of annual arithmetic mean pm25 concentrations from one or more co mmunityoriented monitors and 24hour concentration of 65 ugm3 based on the 3year average of the 98th percentile of 24 hour pm25 concentrations at each populationor iented monitor within an area epa has taken cautious approach to implementing the two naaqs attempts to coordinate the new 8hour standard w ith the previous 1hour standard proved difficult and subject to considerable litigation in the case of the pm25 standard comprehensive monitoring data were vailable

set in motion the clean air acts sip process under section 110 the promul gation of the revised ozone naaqs and the new pm25 naaqs meant that the sips of many states were longer adequate to bring those states into compliance by the statutory deadline under section 110k5 if epa finds sip inadequate it must require the affected state to submit revised sip that includes sufficient measures to bring that state into compliance this is known as sip call in the case of the 8hour and pm25 naaqs the process of developing effective compliance strategies is complicated by the problem of transported air pollutants under section 110a2d sips must in clude adequate provisions to prevent sources within that state from contributing significantly to nona ttainment in one or more downwind states finding th at interstate transport of so2 and nox contributes significantly to ozone and pm25 nonattainment the epa issued the proposed interstate air quality rule iaq in december 2003

before the naaqs nonattainment sips are re quired epa justifies the submission of transported air pollutant sips by upwind states before the submission of nonattainment sips by downwind states on the basis of section 110a12 and section 172b of the clean air act and on policy considerations8 epa argues that the upwind reductions will facilitate planning by downwind states and that downwind states will benefit from the relatively ear ly reductions because they themselves contribute to nonattain ment elsewhere how did epa come up with all its determinations the proposed iaq rule is based on ries of determinations by epa with respect to pollution transport costeffective pollution control and compliance feasibility these determinations are ma within the sip process of sections 110k5 and 110a2d 9 significant contribution the pivotal finding by epa in the proposed iaq rule is that affected stat significantly contribute to nonattainment in downwind states this determination defines the geographic scope of the proposed rule for states in the eastern united states ep conducted series of modeling runs to determine the contribution vari ous upwind states are projected to make to areas in the eastern us projected by epa to be in nonattainment in 2010 and 2015 for ozone nonattainment significant contribution was defined by epa as the product of three factors 1 actual amount of tran sported pollution from upwind states that contribute to nonattainment in downwind states 2 how often contributions over specific thresholds occur and 3 the comparative amount of the upwind transportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs6 10 proposed interstate air quality rule pp 46004601 11 for modeling purposes the district of columb ias emissions were combined with those of maryland

of the 31 states east of or bordering the mississippi river on 47 easte rn downwind counties states whose maximum contribution was estimated at ss than 2 parts per billion ppb andor contribute less than 1 percent to total non attainment were screened out after evaluating the remaining eastern states on the three criteria above on 47 eastern downwind counties 25 states were found to make significant contribution to non attainment11 those states are shown in figure 2 for pm25 naaqs epa modeled the emissions impacts of 41 states on 57 eastern downwind counties12 because the controlling pm25 naaqs is the annual standard epa only considered two of the three factors listed for ozone in determining significant contribution actual amount and comparative amount13 in the proposed rule epa is suggesting that th threshold for determining significant contribution be 015ugm3 one percent of the nnual standard of 15 ugm3 based on that threshold epa found 28 states and th district of colu mbia were projected to contribute significantly to 2010 pm25 nonattainment these states are shown in figure 2 as an alternative epa modele d emission contributions if the threshold was more stringent 010 ugm3 this threshold added two states to the list of contributors north dakota and oklahoma epa does not specify the process by which it determined that interstate transport of pollution is not significant contribut or to nonattainment in states such as california arizona or montana the proposed rule simply states in analyzing significant contribution to nonattainment we determined it was reasonable to exclude the western us including the states of washington idaho oregon california ne vada utah and arizona from further analysis due to geography meteorology and topography based on these factors we concluded that the pm25 and 8hour ozone nonattainment problems are not likely to be affected significantly by po llution transported across these states boundaries therefore for the purpose of assessing states contributions to nonattainment in other states we have only analyzed the nonattainment counties located in the rest of the us14 the rule provides other specific basis for epas determination that western nonattainment areas should not be subject to the rigorous modeling eastern non attainment areas were none of the ex tensive modeling conduc ted for nonattainment areas

contribution the proposed iaq rule move s toward developing costeffective remedy maintaining the need to base its remedy on highly costeffective reductions epa examined the potential balance of local control to interstate controls along with the availability and timing of costeffective pollution control measures in upwind states projecting nonattainment areas in 2010 epa concluded that for many pm25 nonattainment areas it would be difficult if not impo ssible to reach attainment unless transport is reduced to much greater degree and over much broader regional area than by the simultaneous adopti on of local controls within specific nonattainment areas in addition we found that much of the air quality improvement that did occur in downwi nd areas with this strategy was due to reductions in transported sulf ate attributable to upwind so2 emissions15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs8 16 specifically epa modeling indicated th at from 22 to 96 of projected 2010 non attainment is due to

were less dramatic but still significant enough for epa to conclude that further regional reductions were warranted16 calling for combination of local and interstate transport control epa developed criteria for determining highly costeffective transport control levels so2 and nox are emitted by variety of sources as indicated in figure 3 below sulfur dioxide is primarily emitted by stationary sources particularly coalfired electric generators in the case of nitrogen oxides mobile sources are the primary source although stationary sources particularly electri c generators and industrial boilers make substantial contributions to the overall totals generally arguing that electric generators provide d the most costeffective emission reduction source and that data were lacking on other stationa ry sources epa focused on reductions from electric generators to determine emission budg ets in contrast for the nox sip call large industrial combustion sources were included in epas costeffectiveness calculationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs9 focusing on electric generators 25 mw or greater epa developed threshold for controlling transported pollutants by comparing the average and marginal costs of other so2 and nox regulatory actions along with other factors specifically epa compared the average and marginal costs of installing fluegas desulfurization fgd and selective catalytic reduction scr technologies on electric generators with the average and marginal costs of other regulatory actions including best available control technology bact determinations individual state actions new source performance standards nsps and various mobile source decisions comparing the costs presented in table 3 with previous regulatory actions epa found these costs to be highly costeffective applying these highly costeffective control technologies on electric generators epa determined the final regionwide cap presented in table 1 table 3 projected control costs for

assumption that states would solely target electric generators for control epa proceeded to determine th appropriate statewide emission budgets for so2 epa attempted to meld the proposed rules allocation scheme with the existing title iv acid rain program with both programs based on electric generators epa proposes to ssentially have states requi re twoforone redemption of caa title iv allowances during phase 1 and threefortwo redemption of title iv allowances during phase 2 such redemption ratios would represent 50 reduction during phase 1 and 67 during phase 2 for nox epa would calculate emission budgets for affected units by multip lying nox emission rate specified in the proposed rule by the units historical annual heat input similar to the allocation formula for title iv the proposed rule would set the nox emission rate at 015 lbmmbtu during phase 1 increasing the stringency to 0125 lbmmbtu during phase 2 the baseline for the annual heat input for each unit would be the highest annual input for any year 1999 through 2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs10 17 propose interstate air quality rule p 4617 18 these installations are in addition to th 14gw of fgd and

proposed rule would divide the mandated reducti ons into two phases beginning in 2010 and 2015 the deadline for phase 1 was determined by epa based primarily on an analysis of available boilermaker labor17 based on the assumption th at all reductions would come from electric generators and from the installation of fgd and scr epa argues that 49 gigiwatts gw of additi onal scrubbers and 25 gw of additional scr units would be necessary to m eet the 2010 phase 1 requirement18 epa believes this to be the maximum feasible fgd and scr construction that can be completed by the year 2010 epa does not provide detailed analysis of its justification for choosing 2015 for the deadline for phase 2 indeed it doesnt provide the amount of additional control technology installa tion necessary to achieve the incremental reduction instead epa states the following to justify 2015 for phase 2 the epa recognizes that the power sector will need to devote large amounts of capital to meet the control requirements of the first phase controls installed in 2010 will generally be the largest and easiest to install subsequent controls will need to be installed at more plants and under more challenging circumstances we believe that deferring the second phase to 2015 will provide enough time for companies to overcome these technical challenges and raise additional reasonablypriced capital needed to install controls19 cap and trade epas preferred implementation strategy is regionwide cap and trade program focused solely on electri c generators under the proposed rule if states choose to cap emissions from their electric generators they do not have to require reductions on any other type of mission source stationary mobile or area if state chooses to control electric generators it must impose cap b ecause this category may feasibly implement cap20 states are encouraged to submit sips that follow the guidelines epa would provide in model cap and trade program to be promulgated later it is ep as hope that states will join together to make the system regionwide such as the case with the nox sip call however states could not be forced to join regionwide program just as with the nox sip call nor to restrict affected sources to electric generators under the proposed rule there would be two cap and trade systems one each for so2 and nox each would cover the sa 28 state area defined by the pm25 significant contribution finding and operate on an annual basis as both pollutants contribute to the pm25 problem specific treatme nt of nox emissions reductions is provided for in the

the proposed rule court review of the nox sip call suggested that epa could be very aggressive in defining signif icant contribution quoting the court in michigan v epa epa focused on the following epa has determined that ozone has some adverse health effects however slight at every level citing national ambient air quality standards for ozone 62 fr 38856 1997 without consideration of cost it is hard to see why any ozonecreating emissions should not be regarded as fatally significant under section 110a2dii21 emphasis in original more stringent threshold for signif icant contribution could result in more states being involved in the reduction scheme likewise the stringency of the highly costeffective criteria for determining actual budgets could be questioned ep has based its re duction

northeastern part of the country final recommendations were made in 1997 24 specifically for utility sources epa used nox emission rate of 015 lb nox mmbtu to determine budget allocations for area

pr oposed nonroad diesel engine standards see proposed ozone transport rule and appendix b otag recommendations 62 federal register 6031860420 november 7 1997previous regulatory actions similar to its criteria in the nox sip call however epas own costbenefit analysis suggests that control costs could rise dramatically without jeopardizing the very favorable cost benefit results as stated by epa the benefitcost analysis concludes that substantial net economic benefits to society are likely to be achieved as result of the reduction in emissions occurring as result of this rulemaking the results detailed below show that this rule would be highly beneficial to society with annual net benefits in 2010 of approximately 55 billion 58 billion be nefits compared to social cost of approximately 3 billion and net bene fits in 2015 of 80 billion 84 billion benefits compared to social costs of 4 billion all amounts are reflected in 199922 thus it could be argued that highly co steffective could be interpreted in way to justify greater reductions based on the costbenefit analysis rather than relying on the proposed rules rationale that is based on the proposed rules comparative cost with other regulatory actions epas choice of focusing only on electric generators may also raise questions given the costbenefit analysis the recommendations of the ozone transport assessment group otag

sources in the final nox sip call epa calculated st ate emission budgets based on five sectors electric utility nonutility sources area s ources nonroad engines and highway vehicles budgets were based on cost effective reductions with substantial reductions required from ectric generators and from nonutility sources indeed epa used 70 reduction requirement for large i ndustrial fac ilities and ract control generally 2550 for smaller sources24 in the proposed iaq rule epa generally released the other stationary source components from the proposed rule because of lack of data however epa does not explain why it felt it had sufficient data in 1997 to propose nox sip call that included these sources but doesnt have sufficient data to include these sources in the proposed iaq rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs14 25 nicholas dipasquale deput secretary pennsylvania partment of environmental protection testimony before the us envi ronmental protection agency on the proposed utility mercury reductions and interstate air quality rules philadelphia pennsylvania february 25 2004 p 6 26 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4617 27 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4617 epa does not make clear whether or not its discussion includes installations embedded in the baseline along with the additional installations required by the proposed rule third aspect of the scope of the rule that may raise questions is the decision to exempt the west from consideration as indicated in figure 1 the west has significant areas out of compliance with the pm25 standard the 8hour ozone standard or both as noted earlier ep does not present any detailed analysis justifying its choice to exclude the west with the court decision looking favorably on an aggressive interpreta tion of significant contribution the highly favorable costbenefit analysis and the significant problems of 8hour ozone and pm25 non attainment in parts of the west particular ly in california some will maintain more comprehensive analysis is in order final parameter of the proposed rule that may raise questions is the timing of the reductions for states facing attainment deadlines and the prospect of imposing costly local controls costeffective emi ssions reductions from the proposed iaq rule are viewed as critical as stated by pennsylvania pennsylvania endorses the comments submitted by the ozone transport commission these comments list number of concerns that the states in the ozone transport region have with the i aqr the most important concern with the iaqr is that the reductions do not come soon enough compliance with the proposed emissions caps is not require d until after the 8hour ozone and the pm25 attainment dates and therefore cannot be relied upon for control measures to meet these ambient standards25 epa argues that 2010 is the earliest that reductions can feas ibly be mandated taking into account regulatory economic nd engineering considerations however questions may be asked about the magnitude of reductions that are feasible by 2010 in the proposed rule epa focuses on the av ailability of skilled boilermakers as an important constraint on installing contro l technology specifically fgd and scr26 arguing that demand for pollution control equipment and skilled boilermakers would come during narrow window 18 months at the end of the compliance period epa concludes in developing the first phase control levels we intended to maximize the total control installations possible and t hus total reductions considering the constraint on boilermaker labor while getting similar reductions for both pollutants this results in predicted reductions of between 40 and 50 percent for both pollutants in the first phase27 obviously if more phase din installation schedule was assumed by epa the labor constraint could be lessened allowing add itional control technology installations to occur httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs15 28 epa argues that an 18 mont h period 21 months before the deadline is the crunch time for boilermaker labor assuming the boilermakers begin shifting to phase 2 projects 3 months before the phase 1 deadline ie while the phase 1 installations are being tested and assuming 3 month testing period after phase 2 installations the phase 2 deadline would be 18 months after the phase 1 deadline july 1 2011interestingly if epas logic used to justify its phase 1 schedule is applied to its smaller phase 2 schedule the resulting phase 2 deadline could arguably follow phase 1 by only18 months july 1 2011 this would be based on seamless rotation of design construction nd test personnel from phase 1 to phase 228 if the lesser reduction required for phase 2 meant fewer labor constraints the deadline could be moved up this scenario would provide continuous employment for the industry maintaining quality labor pool rather than the startst opstart scenario provided by epas 2015 deadline however epa modifi ed its logic for justifying its 2015 phase 2 deadline from an analysis focused on labor to qualitative argument focused on potential sitespecific technical problems with further installations and potential utility financing problems as quoted earlier epa provides details connected with its proposed 2015 deadline what about the nox sip call in the proposed rule epa stresses th similarity of the proposed rules methodologies to those of its previous nox sip call although the methodologies used by epa to develop the proposed rule may rest substantially on the nox sip call there are differences between the two rules that may raise questions first because the nox sip call focuses on ozone attainment it is seasonal control program mayseptember in contrast the proposed rules nox trading program would be run on an annual basis this pres ents questions because the proposed rules scope is different from that of the nox sip call for example massachusetts rhode island and new hampshire are under either the nox sip calls or the ozone transport commissions trading scheme fo r seasonal control of nox but are not covered under the proposed rule the nox sip call includes larg industrial boilers along with electric generators in its trading program the proposed rule focuses on electric generators alone the details of the proposed iaq rules trade and cap program are not addressed in the proposed rule epa intends to address transitional and compatibility issues along with providing affected states with model cap and trade program in supplemental notice of proposed rulema king snpr for electric generators during phase 1 the transition may not be di fficult as the mandated emissions rate for phase 1 is the same as it is for the nox sip call 15 lbmmbtu although the proposed programs baseline ear and annual basis are diffe rent however for states and industrial sources that c ould be left in much sma ller seasonal trading program the economic impact could be substantial as most sources move to the larger annual trading program set up under the proposed rule httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs16 29 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4631what about consistency with title iv working to develop regional cap and trade so2 program raises issues with respect to the statutory nationwide so2 cap and trade program created under title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments title iv of the 1990 caa amendments required the reduction of so2 emissions from electric generators from about 15 million tons in 1988 to 895 million tons by january 1 2000 in addition it mandates that the 895 million ton cap be maintained into the future requiring new so2 emitting utility plants to offset their emissions with further reductions from existingfacilities to implement the program title iv created comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so 2 during or after specific year issued by epa the allowances are allocated to existing power plants according to formulas provided in title iv the utility receives the allowances for given plant regardless of the actual operation of the plant for example utility may choose to shut down an existing power plant and use those allowances to offset emissions from two or more newer cleaner facilities generally power plant that commenced operation after enactment receives allowances requiring it to obtain allowan ces from the existing pool of allowances in order to operate utility may trade allowances nationally as well as bank allowances for future use or sale epas attempt to add more stringent regional system to nationwide program raises several questions the most obvious is the creation of large quantity of surplus title iv allowances developing as sources in the regional control area reduce emissions these allowances could potentially be used by states not participating in the proposed rule phenomenon commonl called leakage epa believes this will not be big problem arguing the potential for leakage is dependent upon the size of the region the large eastern trading region proposed in todays rule which is based upon addressing pm25 is not likely to result in significant leakage because the region is large enough to take advantage of the physical limitations in the electricity grid that prevent large power movements from the east to the west or vice versa through the western interconnect29 epa proposes to require states to modi fy title iv allowances for affected powerplants requiring twoforone and th reefortwo transactions as discussed previously p 10 modifying title iv allowances could be source of contention however allowances are not cast in c oncrete by the 1990 caaa as noted an allowance is limited authorization to emit so2 title iv states explicitly that an allowance is not property right and that nothing in this title or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the united states to terminate or limit such authorization s ection 403f the senate report on title iv from which this language originated elaborates on this provision with the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs17 30 senate report 101228 december 20 1989 p 321 31 regional haze program 64 federal register 35714 july 1 1999 32 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4587the purpose in characterizing the legal or property status of allowances in new section 403f of the act is to make clear that regulatory actions taken subsequent to the issuance of allowances are not subject to the takings clause of the us constitution allowances are in large part simply iterations of each units permit under this title since the permits will be in effect legally binding statements of each units emissions limitation obligations under the pollution control program established herein the subsection makes clear that should the congress or the administrator limit revoke or otherwise modify the allowances or the underlying regulatory program established by new title iv of the act or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto the us government will not be obliged to compensate allowanceholders for loss of the allowances or any loss in their value allowances are but the means of implementing an emissions limitation program which can be altered in response to changes in the environment or for other reasons of public policy30 thus epa may have significant flexibility in modifying title iv allowances in response to changes in the environment or for other reasons of public policy however the proposed iaq rules attempt to modify and restrict title iv allowances may nonetheless be subject to litigation what about other caa titles besides the programs disc ussed above the proposed ru would have effects on other provisions of the clean air act particularly the re gional haze program31 and potential section 126 petitions the reductions required under the proposed rule would have the effect of reducing regional haze in the eastern us epa requests comment on the extent to which the requirements of the proposed ru could satisfy th requirements of its regional haze program presumably th is would include the requirement under section167a of the caa that certain existin g sources install best available retrofit technology bart to protect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas in addition epa requests comment on whethe r the emissions cap under the proposed rulemaking could be expanded to states out side the iaq control region to assist them in meeting their regional haze obligations32 epa does not discuss the potential problems so2 emission leakage could have on the regional haze program in the west second caa provision potentially affect ed by the proposed rule concerns petitions filed under secti on 126 under section 126b any state or political subdivision may petition epa for finding that any major source or group of stationary sources located in another state is emitting pollutants that significantlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs18 33 epa is to respond to the petition within 60 days if the petition is granted the offending sources must cease operations within 3 months unless the sources comply with emission controls and compliance schedules as determin ed by epa to bring them in compliance with the section 34 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4580 35 for more on the proposed hg rule see james mccarthy mercury emissions to the air regulatory and gislative proposals crs report rl31881 36 epa estimates its proposed utility hg rule will achieve about 29 reduction in 1999 levels by 2010 under previous epa hg rules for municipal waste combustors and medical waste incinerators reductions of over 90 from 1990 levels were achieved the firm adaes claims its activated carbon injection aci technology is available now and proven to achieve hg reduction of over 90 in utility applications see httpwwwadaescom for information on other hg control technologies see the institute of clean air companies website for recent technical papers and presentations httpwwwicaccom contribute to the nonattainment of naaqs by the downwind state33 under the nox sip call epa along with several st ates that had filed section 126 petitions to force upwind states to reduce nox emission affecting their ability to meet the 1hour ozone naaqs agreed to use the threat of action under section 126 as backup to the nox sip call if that rule was derailed by the courts in the proposed rule epa proposes to use any section 126 petitions w ith respect to pm25 or 8hour ozone in the same manner34 however it is not clear that petitioning states will agree with epa that program with 10 year compliance schedule meets the spirit and letter of section 126 third interaction between the proposed rule and the caa is controls on mercury hg emissions from coalfired electric generators in announcing the proposed iaq rule in december 2003 the administration also announced companion proposed hg rule for electric generators35 the hg proposal attempts to integrate its reduction require ment with the nox and so2 requirements of the iaq rule by mandating hg reductions that can be achieved by the technologies that would be used to achieve the iaq rule the re sult is modest reduction in hg compared with the levels of reductions achieve d under epas previous regulations on municipal waste combustors and on medi cal waste incinerators or achieved by utility hg control technology that has been fieldtested and is being actively marketed commercially36 epas integrated approach allows electric generators to meet its proposed hg limits without having to insta ll specific hg control technology such as has been installed on incinerators and other facilities however if the iaq rule is stalled then the economic advantage of the integration for hg control will be lost in contrast if the hg rule is stalled the iaq will achieve the modest reductions entailed in the hg rule without the rule in any case the hg rule most likely will be the source of extensive litigation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs19 37 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4580 38 for more on clear skies and other proposed multipollutant legislation see larry parker and john blodgett air quality multipollutant legislation in the 108th congress crs report rl31779what about clear skies the proposed rule is not the bush administrations preferred means of addressing the transported air pollution problem37 its preferred means is the clear skies act hr 999s 485 introduced in the 108th congress clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emissions caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through trad eable allowance program the emissions caps would be imposed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 201838 however noting the uncertainty of the legislative process epa believes the proposed rule is the prudent course the administrations preference for clear skies is not hard to understand for variety of reasons the larger market and additional time provided by the national scope and extended deadlines of clear skies promise less expensive remedy compared with the proposed iaqhg rules in terms of cost per ton of pollutant reduced the national scope also eliminates issues of leakage and lack of western coverage that may create controversy for th proposed iaq rule the statutory nature of clear skies means changes in the title iv allowance program and the nox sip call would be definitive perhaps more importantly clear skies d eals directly with many of the caa interface issues raised bove clear skies modifications to caa provisions to resolve problems that othe rwise could arise include new statutory standards for so2 nox particulate matter and hg for new sources that would replace nsps modi fied sources could opt in and be exempted from bact determinati ons laer determinations bart requirements new source review nsr and maximum achieveable control technology mact requirement s the latter with respect to hg existing sources can also receive these exemptions if they agree to meet particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide missions within 3 years of enactment exemption for steam elect ric generating facilities from hg regulation under section 112 of the caaa relief from enforcement of an section 126 petition before 2012 however these changes raise questions of their own that could enlarge the debate on the clean air act beyond the increased use of market mechanisms in addition there is yet to be vote on clear skies or any other multipollutant control bill in this congress whether the propos ed rule will encourage or discourage such vote this year is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs20 39 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4645 40 proposed interstate air quality rule p 4647what is next the 60 day public comment period for th proposed rule ends on march 30th with much of the public focus on the accompanying proposed mercury rule the interstate air quality rule has not received much attention however if promulgated the proposed rule would have farreaching effects in terms of economics environmenta l impact and policy in terms of economics there are different perspectives at work the economic perspective embodied in the proposed rule may best be described as cost effectiveness approach cost curves are constructed and compared with an eye toward finding the most costeffective reduction level the knee in the cost curve at this point the proposed rule is ma ximizing the reductions achieved per dollar spent accordingly the proposed rule sets its reduction targets in this vicinity to increase the likelihood that reductions will be economically efficient the proposed rule includes several market mechanisms ch as trading and banking to encourage affected parties to seek the most efficient solution to their compliance problem likewise deadlines are set with cost considerations in mind implementing environmental goals through market mechanisms thereby allowing polluters to choose their lowest cost abatement acti ons represents general elevation of economic efficiency as the guiding principle of decisionmaking this focus is more evident when one considers the inter action between the proposed interstate air quality rule with the proposed mercury rule second economic perspective on settin g reduction targets under the proposed rule would be to base it on costbenefit analysis the difference between the costs and benefits of the proposed rule is an or der of magnitude in fa vor of the benefits this number is based primarily on one benefit reduced premature fatalities among adults resulting from reduced pm 2539 other potential categor ies of benefits are not assessed40 if one were to adopt the classi c economic perspective of setting the marginal cost of control at the marginal benefit received it is highly likely that the reductions mandated by the proposed rule would be higher likewise deadlines might be advanced to achieve the benefits quicker this pproach of defining highly costeffective reductions is not discussed in the proposed rule economics appears to be defined in the proposed rule as costs to the electric utility industry alternative perspectives are not addressed environmental impacts addr essed by the proposed b ill derive primarily from sulfur dioxide control the phase 1 nox requirements for electric generators are similar to those of the nox sip call ozone is not focus even to the point of ignoring the seasonal nature of the problem in favor of an nnual reduction program as result the primary benefits of the proposed rule are from pm25 compliance and avoidance of related so2caused impacts such as regional haze the focus on so2 is in line with epas costbenefit analysis that quantifies benefits mostly from so2 control httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32273crs21 41 environmental protection agency clean air proposals promise sharp power plant pollution reductions press release december 15 2003however from the perspective of the proposed rules environmental goal of addressing nonatta inment of the pm25 and ozone naaqs in downwind states complementary focus on the characteristics of the ozone problem might seem appropriate in this case refinement of the proposed rule with respect to ozone would be necessary the nox sip call is seasonal program because ozone is seasonal problem if epa wishes to keep the annual nox program proposed in the rule because of its pm25 and regional haze advantages seasonal weighting factor might be considered to ensure greater nox reductions during the ozone season while allowing greater emissions at other times of the year whether this would have positive or negative effect on the overall costbenefit of the rule can not be determined quantitatively as epa did not estimate many benefits of ozone reduction thus while more focus on nox and conse quently on ozone could make the proposed rule more effective it is unclear if it would be more economically efficient from policy standpoint epa has presen ted the proposed interstate air quality rule and the accompanying proposed mercury rule as suite of integrated air actions to reduce emissions of three pollutants so2 nox and hg41 the two proposed rules are integrated in such way that the technologies reducing so2 and nox emissions under the interstate air qua lity rule also reduce enough hg emissions to meet the 2010 reduction requirements of the pr oposed mercury rule this combination of requirements and technology allows utilities to meet the requirements of both rules without installing three di fferent control technologies one for each pollutant if the hg reduction were more stringent utilities could be forced to install activated carbon injection aci in add ition to the fgd and scr technologies assumed to be chosen under the proposed in terstate air quality rule as epa does not provide costbenefit analysis of hg reductions it is not possible to quantitatively determine whether this decisi on is economically efficient in terms of potential hg benefits foregone by the lower reduction requirement however from the broader perspective of the interaction of the proposed rules with the underlying clean air act there is resulting lack of integration it is likely to be argued that the proposed rule simp ly adds another layer on an already multi layered cake called the clean air act adding regionwide annual cap and trade program on top regulatory structure w hose foundation is healthbased national standards that focus on the local concentration of pollutants in the ambient air presents numerous difficulties as result there are multiple inconsistencies between the proposed rule and other provisions of th clean air act these conflicts are not surprising there is little epa can do to resolve them through regulati on if the administrations goal is to restructure caa compliance strategies toward market oriented cap and trade programs without creating more layers and conflicts it is possible statutory solution will be necessary
