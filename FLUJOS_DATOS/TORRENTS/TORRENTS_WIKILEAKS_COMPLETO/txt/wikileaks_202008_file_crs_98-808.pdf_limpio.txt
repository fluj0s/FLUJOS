ngs the definition of perjury has not changed great deal otherwise since the framing of the constitution blackstone described it as crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question there are three general federal perjury laws one 18 usc 1621 outlaws presenting material false statements under oath in federal official proceedings second 18 usc 1623 bars presenting material false statements under oath before or ancillary to federal court or grand jury proceedings third 18 usc 1622 subornation of perjury prohibits inducing or procuring another to commit perjury in violation of either section 1621 or section 1623 in most cases the courts abbreviate their description of the elements and state that to prove perjury under section 1623 the government must establish that the defendant 1 knowingly made 2 false 3 material declaration 4 under oath 5 in proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the united states the courts generally favor the encapsulation from united states v dunnigan to describe the elements of section 1621 witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony rather than as result of confusion mistake or faulty memory section 1622 outlaws procuring or inducing another to commit perjury whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years or both 18 usc 1622 the false statement statute 18 usc 1001 is closely akin to the perjury statutes it outlaws false statements in any

covers more than court proceedi ngs the definition of perjury has not changed great deal otherwise since the framing of the constitution blackstone described it as crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question1 federal perjury laws are found principally in chapter 79 of title 18 of the united states code2 the chapter consists of three sections section 1623 under which perjury involving judicial proceedings is most often prosecuted today the historic perjury provision section 1621 now used primarily for cases where section 1623 is unavailable and in sentencing enhancement cases and section 1622 that outlaws subornation of perj ury section 1001 of title 18 statute much like the perjury laws but without the requirement that the offender have taken an oath outlaws material false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of any federal agency or department and to limited extent within the ju risdiction of any federal court or congressional entity none of the four are rico predicate offens or money laundering predicate offenses 3 the laws relating to aiding and abetting accessories after the fact misprision and conspiracy4 however 1 iv blackstone commentaries on the laws of england 13637 1769 italics in the original transliteration added blackstone actually borrowed from coke and noted the various penalties to which it was subject the next offense against public justice is when the suit is past its commencement and come to trial and that is the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury which is defined by sire edward coke 3 inst 164 to be crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question the law takes notice of any perjury but such as is committed in some court of justice having power to administer an oath or before some magistrate or proper officer invested with similar authority in some proceedings relative to civil suit or criminal prosecution for it esteems all other oaths unnecessary at least and therefore will not punish the breach of them for which reason it is much to be questioned how far any magistrate is justifiable in taking voluntary affidavit in any extrajudicial matter as it now too frequent upon every petty occasion since it is more than possible that by such idle oaths man may frequently in soro conscientiae incur the guilt and at the same time evade the temporal penalties of perjury the perjury must also be wilful positive and absolute not upon surprize or the like it also must be in some point material to the question in dispute for if it only be in some trifling collateral circumstan ce to which regard is paid it is not more penal than in the voluntary extrajudicial oaths beforementioned subornation of perjury is the offence of procuring another to take such false oath as constitutes perjury in the principal the punishment of perjury and subornation as common law has been various it was antiently death afterwards banishment or cutting out the tongue then forfeiture of goods and now it is fine and imprisonment and never more to be capable of bearing testimony but the statute 5 eliz c9 if the offender be prosecuted thereon inflicts the penalty of perpetual infamy and fine of 40 l on the suborner and in default of payment imprisonment for six months and to stand with both ears mailed to the pillor perjury itself is thereby punished with six months imprisonment perpetual infamy and fine of 20 l or to have both ears nailed to the pillory but the prosecution is usually carried on for the offence at common law especially as to the penalties before inflicted the statute 2 geoii c25 superadds power for the court to order the offender to be sent to the house of correction for seven years or to be transported for the same period and makes it felony without benefit of clergy to return or escape within the time id 2 prohibitions against misconduct very much like perjury are scattered throughout the united states code the most widely prosecuted is probably 18 usc 1001 discussed infra that outlaws material false statements made with respect to matter within the jurisdiction of department or agency of the united states for discussion of 18 usc 1503 and 1505 which outlaw corrupt endeavors to impede the due administration of justice before the courts and executive tribunal and the due exercise of the

congress enacted section 1623 to avoid some of the common technicalities embodied in the more comprehensive perjury provisions found in subsection 16218 and thus to facilitate perjury prosecutions and

but the phrase proceedings ancillary to court or grand jury proceedings does cover proceedings to take depositions in connection with civil litigation14 as well as variety of pretrial proceedings in criminal cases15 including habeas proceedings16 bail hearings17 venue hearings18 or suppression hearings19 the supreme courts observation that statement that is misleading but literally true cannot support conviction under section 1621 because it is not false20 applies with equal force to perjury under section 162321 similarly perjury cannot be the product of confusion mistake or faulty memory but must be statement that the defendant knows is false22 although this requirement may be satisfied with evidence that the defendant was deliberately ignorant or willfully blind to the fact that the statement was false23 on the other hand question that is truly ambiguous or which affirmatively misleads the testifier can never provide basis for finding of perjury as it could never be said that one intended to answer such question untruthfully 24 yet ambiguity will be of avail if the defendant understands the question and answers falsely nevertheless25 materiality is perhaps the most nettlesome of perjurys elements it is usually said that statement is material if it has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of the decisionmaking body to whom it is addressed26 this definition is not easily applied when the precise nature of the underlying inquiry remains somewhat undefined such as in grand jury proceedings or in depositions at the discovery stage of civil suit on the civil side the lower federal courts appear divided between the view 1 that statement in deposition is material if truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit and 2 that statement is material if the topic of the statement is 13 dunn v united states 442 us 100 11112 1979 14 id united

outcome of the underlying civil suit for which the deposition was taken27 in the case of perjury before the grand jury rather than articulate single standard the courts have described several circumstances under which false testimony may be considered material28 in any event statement is less material because it did not or could not divert the decisionmaker29 the courts seem to have had less difficulty dealing with materiality issue characterized as the perjury trap doctrine the doctrine arises where witness is called for the sole purpose of eliciting perjurious testimony from him30 under such circumstances it is said the tribunal has valid purpose to which perjurious statement could be considered material the doctrine poses bar to prosecution in most cases however since the government is usually able to identify some valid reason for the grand jurys inquiries 31 subsection 1623c permits perjury conviction simply on the basis of two necessarily inconsistent material declarations rather than showing that one of the two statements is false32 27 united states v wilkinson 137 f3d 214 225 4th cir 1998 comparing united states v kross 14 f3d 751 754 2d cir 1994 and

made under oath it is not enough to show that one was made under oath and the other was made in the form of an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury33 moreover the statements must be so inherently contradictory that one of them of necessity must be false34 some years ago the supreme court declined to reverse an earlier ruling that the general rule in prosecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment 35 subsection 1623e permits perjury conviction without compliance with this traditional two witness rule36 since the two witness rule rests on the common law rather than on constitutional foundation it may can be abrogated by statute without offending constitutional principles37 most of the other subsections of section 1623 are designed to overcome obstacles which the common law placed in the path of successful perjury prosecution subsection 1623d in contrast offers defense unrecognized at common law the defense is stated in fairly straightforward terms where in the same cont inuous court or grand jury proceeding in which declaration is made the person making the declaration admits such declaration to be false such admission shall bar prosecution under this section if at the time the admission is made the declaration has not substantially affected the proceeding or it has not become manifest that such falsity has been or will be exposed 18 usc 1623d although phrased in different terms the courts seem to agree that repudiation of the false testimony must be specific and thorough 38 there is some disagreement whether recanting defendant must be denied the defense if both the substantial impact and manifest exposure conditions have been met or if the defense must be continued within the period of the statute of limitations for the offense charged under this section in any prosecution under this section the falsity of declaration set forth in the indictment or information shall be established sufficient for conviction by proof that the defendant while under oath made irreconcilably contradictory declarations material to the point in question in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury it shall be defense to an indictment or information made pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection that the defendant at the time he made each declaration believed the declaration was true united states v dunn 442 us 100 108 1979by relieving the government of the burden of proving which of two or more

1623c requires variance in testimony that extends beyond mere vagueness uncertainty or equivocality even though two declarations ma differ from one another the 1623c standard is not met unless taking

presence of either condition dooms the defense39 early construction required that defendant establish both that his false statement had not substantially affected the proceeding before his recantation and that it had not become manifest that his false statement would be exposed40 one more recent appellate case however decided that the defense should be available to witness who could show want of either an intervening adverse impact or of likely exposure of his false statement41 even without the operation of subsection 1623d relatively contemporaneous corrections of earlier statements may negate any inference that the witness is knowingly presenting false testimony and thus preclude conviction for perjury42

false testimony rather than as result of confusion mistake or faulty memory45 perjury is only that testimony which is false thus testimony that is literally true even if deceptively so cannot be considered perjury for purposes of prosecution under section 162146 moreover section 1621 requires compliance with the two witness rule to establish that statement is false under the rule the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not sufficient to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused as set forth in the indictment as perjury 47 thus conviction under section 1621 requires that the government establish the falsity of the statement alleged to have been made by the defendant under oath by the testimony of two independent witnesses or one witness and corroborating circumstances48 if the rule is to be satisfied with corroborative evidence the evidence must be trustworthy and support the account of the single witness upon which the perjury prosecution is based 49 the test for materiality under section 1621 is whether the false statement has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed50 conviction under section 1621 requires not only that the defendant knew his statement was false which he does not believe to be true but that his false statement is willfully presented there is but scant authority on precisely what willful means in this context the supreme court in dicta has indicated that willful perjury consists of deliberate material falsification under oath51 other courts have referred to it as acting with an intent to deceive52 or as acting intentionally53 although contemporaneous correction of false statement may demonstrate the absence of the necessary willful intent to

made his statement omitted fact he was obliged to disclose or included with his false documentation ie that the defendant knew that his statement was false when he made it or which amounts in law to the same thing consciously disregarded or averted his eyes from the likely falsity73 prosecution for violation of section 1001 requires proof of materiality as does conviction for perjury and the standard is the same the statement must have natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed 74 there is need to show that the decision maker was in fact diverted or influenced75 conviction for false statements or false documentation under section 1001 also requires that the statements or documentation be false that they not be true76 and the same can be said of the response to question that is so fundamentally ambiguous that the defendants answer cannot be said to be knowingly false77 on the other hand unlike the perjury provision of section 1623 there is safe harbor for recantation or correction of prior false statement that violates section 100178 prosecutions under subsection 1001a1 for concealment rather than false statement or false documentation must also prove the existence of duty or legal obligation not to conceal79 continued 72 united states v gonzales 435 f3d 64 72 1st cir 2006 73 id united states v
