6204c26 shspec138 professional attitude rundown on prepchecking there are several things that monitor the success of auditing one of these is professional attitude the substance of the professional attitude is that someone is here to be healed and the auditor is going to heal him regardless of the pcs politics religion or pace etc the auditor is professional who is healing beings who need healing it doesnt matter who the pc is this is very hardboiled attitude actually an auditor is as good as he can assume professional attitude towards the pc in front of him regardless of any personal opinions or the pcs opinions creed etc that attitude alone has brought the healing professions along through the trillenia there are splinter groups of healers who may be far more effective than medical doctors but who dont have professional code of conduct these practitioners are far less well respected because they are not that professional or they havent created belief in the public that they have professional attitude this is also why husbandwife teams dont audit each other well there is too much personal concern and too little professional attitude as an auditor you will have terrific wins when you realize that case is case matter what the pcs body looks like and when you audit with professional attitude having professional attitude is also necessary because failure to do so will get in the way of your processing results push it home and stand by it where the public is concerned and you will inherit the world of healing where other splinter groups have not this doesnt necessarily mean having particular mockup or appearance it just means that anyone who comes for processing gets audited as himself dont process anyone because of anything just process him this will become very comfortable attitude to have in session one with additives or personal quirks it will result in public trust you had also better not be an auditor after the session or the pc will tend to continue to be in session after the session is supposed to be over act like an auditor during the session not before or after the public demands only that they be treated by someone who is interested in them if you always do good job both technically and professionally you will be in good shape technical perfection itself is very impressive prepchecking is harder to do than routine 3 processes it is the first test of whether an auditor knows his business furthermore if you cant do good job prepchecking you will never do good job on routine 3 there will always be something missing dont ever decide what should read and what shouldnt observe prepchecking gets the pc in session and frees up his attention so he can be audited it can also give fantastic changes and gains if run searchingly as total psychotherapy of this lifetime it completes the work of freud and any cathartictype therapy it is therefore very comprehensible to the public it could he used to help someone clean up some troublesome area if you expect too much of prepchecking however you will have some loses the basic thing that has been going wrong in running routine 3 is that the auditor doing the process was also trying to do sec check or ruds session trying to mate an eagle with shark this also accounts for the fact that people couldnt find goals because the ruds were out you cant combine sec checking or prepchecking session with routine 3 session but green auditor will try if the auditor starts to give one sort of session but finds he has to go on to another sort of session he gets the impression of loss of control of the pc if keeping the pcs ruds in is that big problem he shouldnt be doing routine 3 processes he should be on cchs prepchecks also get him used to being model sessioned and get him so that he will stay in session you will have enough difficulty with routine 3 without adding the difficulty of prepchecking at the same time the whole reason routine 3 kept being varied and moved around was that the ruds kept going nut on people and they werent able to find items prepchecking is the remedy for that it sets the pc up so that when you list you can just list and find goals terminals and oppterms it is luckily also very interesting to the pc from the viewpoint of auditor training routine 3 processes are too hard on case to be done wrong they cant safely be used as training activity prepchecking though it is harder and has the liability that you can miss withholds with devastating results is better training activity the theetieweetie case walks around with the idea that everybody should know all the time this is the perpetual missed withhold case he is in bad shape whenever you ask him question you get missed withhold because you should have known the answer if you ask three questions you miss three withholds he thinks everyone should know everything he is thinking so there is mass of continuous missed withholds prepchecking will handle it as keyout on 3dxx you will come up with an item like swami and then the circuit ceases but these cases are hell to prepcheck because they think you must know if they know so they dont have any withholds they have never done anything you have to know this phenomenon so you can straighten it all out that is the hard case to prepcheck not the sinner prepchecking is not easy but it is very precise and must be done very professionally since your personal reaction and personal interest interjected into the session ruins the pcs willingness td get off real overts he will only give up safe withholds if you have anything but calm professional attitude it is also necessary to keep missed withholds cleaned up particularly if he gets misemotional on you auditors have terrible time getting this through their heads and just pulling the missed withhold prepchecking is easy to do if it is done right it makes doing routine 3 ridiculously easy by comparison also
