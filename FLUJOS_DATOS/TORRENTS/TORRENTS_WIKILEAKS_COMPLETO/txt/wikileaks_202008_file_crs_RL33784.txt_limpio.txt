analyst in public finance domestic social policy division linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division minimum wage characteristics of lowwage workers and their families summary in may 2007 president george bush signed supplemental appropriations bill hr 2206 pl 11028 that raised the basic federal minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 an hour the minimum wage increased to 585 in july 2007 it will rise to 655 in july 2008 and to 725 in july 2009 several states have minimum wage rates that are higher than the current january 2008 federal minimum wage of 585 pl 11028 also extended the minimum wage on the us mainland to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi and american samoa the federal minimum wage standard for an individual employee has become part of the policy discussion about alleviating poverty among families supported by lowwage workers it is viewed by some as tool to encourage labor force participation among members of lowincome families by making work more financially rewarding others assert that raising the minimum wage is not the most effective way to assist lowincome families with earners in part because many lowwage workers do not live in lowincome families accordingly this report analyzes not only the individual characteristics of workers by their hourly wage rate but also the characteristics of the families in which they live the report does not address the arguments of proponents or opponents about the advisability of raising the minimum wage compared to the typical worker paid an hourly wage employees who earned below 725 per hour in 2005 were more likely to have been women of hispanic origin young ie ages 16 to 24 or old ie age 65 and above lacking high school diploma in service and sales occupations eg waitresses and cashiers respectively working parttime ie less than 35 hours week and not represented by labor union larger proportion of working women than men young workers than primeage workers ie 25 to 54 years old and parttimers than fulltimers for example may gain from 210anhour increase in the federal minimum wage the families of hourly workers paid less than 725 an hour in 2005 more often were poor receiving welfare and lacking health insurance coverage from any source individuals who earned less than 725 an hour were more likely than higherpaid persons to be secondary earners in their families but substantial share of lowwage workers were the sole earners in their families some 29 of hourly workers who earned under 725 an hour in 2005 lived in families with incomes of 20000 or less another 26 lived in families with incomes from 20001 to 40000 about one fourth of these lowwage workers were spouses in marriedcouple families with or without children and some 13 were single parents another 12 were teenagers ie 16 to 19 years old at the other end of the spectrum 13 of hourly workers paid below 725 an hour lived in families with annual incomes of more than 100000 in contrast to the pattern among lowincome families over onehalf of the lowwage workers in these highincome families were teenagers 56 this report may be updated if issues warrant

federal minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 an hour1 the minimum wage was increased to 585 in july 20072 it will rise to 655 in july 2008 and to 725 in july 2009 several states have minimum wage rates that are higher than the current january 2008 federal minimum wage of 585 this report examines characteristics of workers and their families who may benefit directly from an increase in the federal minimum wage3 the first part of the report provides information on the demographic and social characteristics eg age education of hourly workers who are paid less than 725 an hour as well as the characteristics of the jobs they hold eg occupation and part timefulltime hours and the characteristics of the families in which they live eg family income welfare receipt some argue that raising the minimum wage is an effective way to alleviate poverty among families supported by lowwage workers higher minimum wage may raise their incomes and it may encourage greater labor force participation among members of lowincome families others assert that raising the minimum wage is not an effective way to aid lowincome families because many lowwage workers do not live in lowincome families or because many lowincome families do not have 1 in addition to basic minimum wage the fair labor standards act flsa has lower minimum wage rates for tipped employees certain new hires under the age of 20 fulltime students who work parttime and handicapped persons the flsa also includes number of exemptions from the minimum wage for additional information about the federal minimum wage and legislative activity see crs report rl33754 minimum wage in the 110th congress by william g whittaker 2 until july 2007 the basic federal minimum wage had not been raised since september 1997 3 in addition to employees who may benefit directly from an increase in the federal minimum wage some employees may benefit indirectly in order to maintain internal differences in wages between jobs some firms may raise the wages of workers earning above the proposed increase in the federal standard crs2 earners thus the last section of the report examines characteristics of the families of lowwage workers legislation in the 110th congress on january 10 2007 the house approved hr 2 which would have raised the federal minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 an hour the minimum wage on the us mainland would have been extended to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi on february 1 2007 the senate adopted substitute to hr 2 the senatepassed version of hr 2 would have raised the minimum wage to 725 extended the federal minimum wage to cnmi and provided an estimated 83 billion from fy2007 to fy2016 in tax cuts for business the tax cuts would have been offset by package of revenue increases4 the house on february 16 2007 passed hr 976 its version of tax cuts for business as passed by the house hr 976 was titled the small business tax relief act of 2007 the senate did not act on this version of hr 976 instead text similar to s 1893 the childrens health insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 was later substituted for the housepassed version of hr 976 on march 23 2007 the house approved hr 1591 supplemental appropriations bill to fund the wars in iraq and afghanistan and for other matters in the house hr 1591 included provision that would have raised the federal minimum wage to 725 and extended the mainland wage to both cnmi and american samoa5 the senateversion of hr 1591 approved on march 29 also raised the minimum wage and extended the federal wage to cnmi but not american samoa the conference agreement on hr 1591 raised the federal minimum wage from 515 to 725 an hour and extended the mainland minimum wage to both cnmi and american samoa citing the bills timetable for withdrawing us troops from iraq and other matters president bush vetoed the measure on may 1 2007 the next day an attempt to override the veto in the house failed by vote of 222 to 203 with twothirds vote needed to override the veto on may 10 2007 the house approved hr 2206 second supplemental appropriations bill the house and senate approved the final measure on may 24 and the bill was signed into law by president bush on may 25 2007 pl 11028 like previous measures hr 2206 raised the minimum wage in steps from 515 to 725 the federal minimum wage was extended to both cnmi and american samoa the minimum wage in cnmi was raised to 355 an hour beginning 60 days after the date of enactment in american samoa the minimum wage that applied to each industry was raised by 050 an hour 60 days after the date of enactment in both territories the minimum wage will rise by 050 an hour annually until the 4 for discussion of tax benefits in the senatepassed version of hr 2 see crs report rl32275 small business tax preferences significant legislative proposals in the 110th congress by gary guenther 5 for more information on the minimum wage in cnmi and american samoa see crs report rl34013 the federal minimum wage and american samoa by william g whittaker and crs report rl30235 minimum wage in the territories and possessions of the united states application of the fair labor standards act by william g whittaker crs3 minimum wage in the two territories is equal to the minimum wage on the us mainland hr 2206 also directed the us department of labor through the bureau of labor statistics to conduct study of the impact of the increase in the minimum wage and to project the impact on living standards and employment of further increases in the minimum wage in cnmi and american samoa the department of labor must report the findings of the study later than eight months after the date of enactment of hr 2206 ie january 2008 word about the data this report examines the wages of workers paid by the hour the data are from the current population survey cps which is household survey conducted by the census bureau for the bureau of labor statistics bls although most workers are covered by the minimum wage requirements of the flsa the cps does not ask workers if they are covered by the act the congressional research service crs used data from the monthly cps for 2005 and the 2006 annual social and economic asec supplement to the cps to analyze the wages and family incomes of hourly workers that is employees paid an hourly wage rather than weekly or annual salary or rate based on the quantity of goods or services produced ie piece rate6 the analysis does not include self employed persons as provided in the flsa the hourly wage shown in the tables that follow consists of cash payments only ie the value of employmentbased benefits are not included fuller explanation of the data and methodology used in this report appears in the appendix in this report hourly workers who earned less than 725 an hour in 2005 are sometimes referred to as lowwage workers the phrase is used for the sake of brevity in the private sector in 2005 the average wage of nonmanagement employees was 1611 an hour according to bls survey of employers glimpse of what follows compared to the typical worker paid an hourly wage employees who earned below 725 per hour in 2005 were more likely to have been women of hispanic origin young ie age 1624 or old ie age 65 and above lacking high school degree in service and sales occupations working parttime ie less than 35 hours week and not represented by labor union 6 the minimum wage provisions of the flsa apply to workers paid on an hourly salary or some other basis commerce clearing house labor law reporter wages hours chicago commerce clearing house 2006 p 38953 thus some salaried and piece rate workers may benefit directly or indirectly from an increase in the federal minimum wage crs4 the families of these lowwage workers were more likely than other families in 2005 to have been poor receiving welfare and lacking health insurance coverage from any source individuals who earned less than 725 an hour were more likely than higher paid persons to be secondary earners in their families but substantial share of lowwage workers were the sole earners in their families whereas lowwage workers in higher income families very often were teenagers lowwage workers in lower income families often were spouses in married couple families with or without children or single parents social economic and demographic characteristics of lowwage workers this section of the report examines selected demographic and labor market characteristics of lowwage workers gender women were overrepresented among lowwage workers in 2005 almost 7 million of the more than 11 million hourly workers who earned under 725 an hour were women 601 in contrast women accounted for smaller share of all hourly workers 502 see the top and middle panels of table 1 it also appears that relatively more working women than men might gain from higher federal minimum wage as shown in the bottom panel of the table 181 of all female hourly workers earned below 725 per hour in 2005 compared to only 121 of men race and hispanic origin minorities particularly hispanics comprised larger shares of workers paid below 725 an hour than they did of all hourly workers in 2005 as can be seen in the middle panel of table 2 hispanics who may be of any race and black non hispanics might benefit more than white nonhispanics from boost in the federal minimum wage almost 25 million out of 125 million hispanics employed on an hourly basis or almost one in five earned less than 725 an hour in 2005 although relatively fewer black nonhispanics 169 were paid less than the proposed minimum wage level an even smaller proportion of white nonhispanics 137 might have seen their pay increase if the federal minimum wage had been 210 per hour higher in 2005 see the bottom panel of table 2 crs5 table 1 distribution of hourly workers by gender and hourly wage 2005 under 725 an hour total total hourly under

country other than the united states were slightly overrepresented in the lowwage workforce with the foreignborn comprising 187 of persons paid under 725 per hour in 2005 as opposed to 160 of all hourly paid workers7 see the middle panel of table 3 as shown in the bottom panel of the table relatively more foreignborn than nativeborn workers might gain from minimum wage increase 177 versus 146

cps note details may not add to totals because of rounding age according to the data in the middle panel of table 4 young workers 16 to 24 year olds made up disproportionate share of individuals paid under 725 an hour in 2005 over onehalf of hourly workers paid below the proposed federal minimum wage were between 16 and 24 years old 277 teenagers 235 2024 year olds in contrast these young workers accounted for much smaller proportions of all hourly workers 73 teenagers 143 2024 year olds substantial percentage of young workers might be affected directly were the minimum wage ro rise nearly three out five teenagers paid an hourly wage might 7 in this report foreignborn persons include both citizens and noncitizens of the united states the cps does not ask noncitizens if they are legal permanent residents nonimmigrants who are in the united states temporarily eg visitors or guest workers or whether they are in the country without authorization therefore in this report foreignborn persons include legal immigrants legal nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens crs7 see their earnings increase if the federal standard goes to 725 per hour similarly one in four workers between 20 and 24 years old might get pay raise see the bottom panel of table 4 an aboveaverage share of older workers also might benefit from an increase in the wage standard while 151 of all hourly workers were paid under 725 per hour in 2005 182 of workers age 65 and over earned this hourly rate table 4 distribution of hourly workers by age and hourly wage 2005 under 725 an hour total total hourly under 515

details may not add to totals because of rounding crs8 education educational attainment is considered proxy for skill level or productivity ie output per hour worked which is difficult to measure directly because firms reward workers based in part on their skill levels educational attainment usually is positively related to earnings level ie lower wages are associated with less schooling it thus is not surprising that many workers paid below 725 per hour have fairly limited formal education see the middle panel of table 5 almost 7 of every 10 lowwage workers in 2005 either lacked high school diploma or had completed only high school in fact the least educated group was overrepresented in the lowwage workforce while employees who did not attend or complete high school comprised fully 381 of hourly workers earning under 725 per hour they made up just 167 of all workers paid on an hourly basis table 5 distribution of hourly workers by education and hourly wage 2005 under 725

professional degree 1000 34 07 28 966 source calculated by crs from the cps note details may not add to totals because of rounding crs9 it could be argued that these findings partly reflect the previously discussed overrepresentation of youth among lowwage workers because some of these youngsters probably are still attending school they might only briefly be members of the lowskilled lowwage labor force as shown in the bottom panel of table 5 344 of hourly workers ages 16 and older who lacked high school diploma as of 2005 earned under 725 an hour if instead hourly workers ages 25 and older are examined not shown in table 5 thereby limiting the sample to persons more likely to have completed their schooling the proportion of workers without high school diploma earning below 725 an hour drops to 2168 in other words perhaps one of every five permanently lowskilled adults paid on an hourly basis might gain from the proposed 210 rise in the federal minimum wage occupation most hourly workers employed in jobs that paid less than 725 an hour in 2005 were clustered in two occupational groups as shown in the middle panel of table 6 the single largest concentration 462 were employed in service occupations eg food preparation building cleaning health care support personal care and protective support another 192 of lowwage workers were employed in sales and related occupations eg retail and personal services sales workers both these figures were much larger than the occupational groups presence among all hourly paid workers 222 and 101 respectively although total employment was relatively small an estimated 623000 hourly workers the only other occupational group considerably overrepresented among lowwage hourly workers were farming fishing and forestry occupations 21 versus 08 for all hourly workers according to crs estimates not shown in table 6 one of every two hourly workers employed in food preparation and service occupations was paid less than 725 an hour in 2005 half of these workers may be tipped employees eg waiters waitresses hosts and hostesses who under the flsa must be paid at least 213 an hour provided they receive at least 302 an hour in tips for total hourly pay of at least 5159 those tipped employees who currently earn less than 725 an hour in wages and tips would likely benefit directly from an increase in the basic minimum wage to 725 an hour tipped employees who currently receive more than 725 an hour in wages and tips may not benefit much aboveaverage share of hourly workers in sales occupations might benefit if the basic federal minimum wage increased to 725 an hour for example based on crs estimates not shown in table 6 about two in five cashiers and similar share of counter and rental clerks might see their pay increase if the basic minimum wage is raised by 210 an hour an increase of this size also might affect 8 data discussed in the text of this report that are not shown in the tables are available

fulltime workers ie persons employed for 35 or more hours week are paid at lower rate as result parttimers should have greater propensity for low wage employment as shown in the bottom panel of table 7 parttime workers were four times more likely than fulltime workers to have earned under 725 per hour in 2005 351 compared to 88 about 64 million parttimers or over one half of persons paid below 725

individual low wage workers the remainder looks at characteristics of the families of lowwage workers10 in this report 827 of workers who earned less than 725 an hour in 2005 lived in families where family is defined as group of two or more related people living together11 families thus could include husband and wife with or without children single parent with one or more children and siblings living with grandparent the remaining 173 of lowwage hourly workers examined in this report lived alone or with unrelated individuals in 2005 proponents of higher minimum wage argue that raising the federal standard will improve the financial situation of lowincome working families12 opponents assert that raising the minimum wage is not the most effective way to assist these 10 the data in tables 1 through 8 are monthly averages for calendar year 2005 ie an estimated 756 million hourly workers the 2005 family information in tables 9 through 15 is for hourly workers in march 2006 ie an estimated 738 million hourly workers see the appendix for an explanation of the data and methodology used in this report 11 majority of workers who earned 725 or more an hour lived in families in 2005

workers do not live in lowincome families13 in addition an increase in the federal minimum wage will not raise the incomes of low income families that have earners unless the higher wage standard entices members of these families to enter the labor force and obtain employment14 some argue however that higher minimum wage could harm lowwage workers and their families by causing job loss or reducing the rate of lowskilled job creation15 family income and poverty status over onehalf of workers paid less than 725 an hour lived in families with incomes of 40000 or less16 see the middle panel of table 9 according to crs estimates not shown in table 9 about onefourth 259 of lowwage workers in families with incomes of 40000 or less were spouses in marriedcouple families with or without children some 134 were single parents17 another 119 were teenagers at the other end of the spectrum 129 of workers who earned less than 725 an hour lived in families with annual incomes of more than 100000 over onehalf of the lowwage workers in these highincome families were teenagers 557 according to crs estimates another 135 was comprised of husbands or wives in marriedcouple families while just 10 were single parents 13 for example see richard v burkhauser and joseph j sabia raising the minimum wage another empty promise to the working poor washington employment policy institute august 2005 pp 69 14 crs estimates that in 2005 about onehalf 507 of people ages 16 and older in the civilian noninstitutional population who lived in poor families ie below the poverty income level lived in families with wage earners some 284 of people at least 16 years old who lived in near poor families lived in families that lacked wage earners near poor family is family with income between 100 and 199 times the poverty level these poor families may not have had wage earners because the members were retired younger members were in school workingage members were unemployed or for other reasons 15

survey of households the monthly cps is the source of the monthly national unemployment rate and of other labor market information the cps sample is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population ages 16 and older it does not include persons on active duty in the armed forces or persons in institutions such as nursing homes or correctional facilities in march 2006 about 54000 households were interviewed for the basic cps20 each month onefourth of the cps sample is asked questions about current earnings hourly wages are wages paid by the employer and do not include tips or fringe benefits21 hourly wages are wages before taxes and other deductions the data in tables 1 through 8 are averages for the twelve months of calendar year 2005 thus the number of hourly workers shown in tables 1 to 8 ie 756 million is monthly average for 2005 each year the annual social and economic asec supplement to the basic cps asks questions about individual and family earnings and income for the previous year thus in the 2006 supplement the survey collected information on individual and family earnings and income for 2005 tables 9 through 15 provide family information for 2005 for hourly workers in the march 2006 basic survey in march 2006 there were an estimated 738 million hourly workers limitations the cps has certain limitations for analyzing the impact of an increase in the federal minimum wage first the flsa includes number of exceptions and exemptions from the minimum wage the cps does not ask respondents if they are covered by the flsa thus some people who are paid less than 725 an hour may not be covered by the flsa and may not receive an increase in their hourly wage when the federal minimum wage is raised second the flsa allows for lower minimum wage rates for tipped employees certain new hires under the age of 20 fulltime students who work parttime handicapped persons and others higher basic minimum wage may not affect these workers22 20 us

interviewers manual available at httpwwwblscensusgovcpsintmantchtm chap 5 section b2 22 in addition estimates based on sample of households are subject to nonsampling and sampling error examples of nonsampling error include information that is misreported eg some respondents may round off their earnings and errors made in processing information that is collected sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire continued crs21 limitation of the methodology in this report pertains to annual earnings and family income in 2005 of hourly workers in march 2006 in march 2006 hourly workers may have been earning either more or less than they earned in 2005 some workers may not have had any earnings in 2005 eg they may have been new to the labor force in march 2006 as result the wages of hourly workers in march 2006 may not be the same as their hourly wage in 2005 similarly some workers who had earnings in 2005 may not have been employed or they were salaried and not hourly workers in march 2006 therefore they are not included in the analysis of annual earnings or family income for 2005 another limitation of the methodology is that in the cps primary family may include what the cps calls related subfamily for example an unmarried mother with dependent child may be living with her parents or married couple may be living with relatives in the cps the income of persons in related subfamily is included in the total income of the primary family this could have tendency to understate the number of lowwage workers living in lowincome families ie because the incomes of related subfamilies are included in the incomes of primary families on the other hand unmarried couples who are not living with relatives are treated either as separate individuals or if they have children as primary family and an unrelated individual this could have tendency to overstate the number of lowincome households ie because the incomes of unmarried couples are treated separately rather than together 22 continued population of households is surveyed for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33784
