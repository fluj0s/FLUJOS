the 108 th and 109th congresses to reauthorize the program those earlier reauthorization efforts had been marked by heated debate over provision that would have allowed for religious discrimination in the hiring of head start staff that provision was not incorporated into the bill that was passed into law this congress the latest reauthorization law includes provisions that do the following increase the authorized funding levels for the program revise the formula for allocating head start funds limit grantee designation periods to 5 years at which point the grant may be recompeted if

line increase the qualifications and training requirements for head start staff delineate the roles and responsibilities of grantees governing body and policy council and terminate further development

educational health nutritional and social services these services are intended to prepare children to enter kindergarten and to impr ove the conditions necessary for their success in later school and life the program is administered by the administration for children and families of the department of health and human services hhs which provides grants directly from the federal government to local entities as opposed to providing funding through the state these entities are called grantees and may be public or private agencies nonprofit or forprofit faithbased or secular there are currently over 1600 agencies that receive head start grants head start strongly emphasizes the involvement of families and the local community to assure that programs are responsive to the unique needs of each community flexibility in local program design and operation is encouraged and there is wide variation across the country in how head start services are delivered eg centerbased homebased or some combination as well as in local program costs sponsoring agencies and coordination arrangements with other social service programs head start operates both full and partday programsmost only during the school year some local head start programs do coordinate with other programs to lengthen the time of care both in terms of hours and the year fullday enrollment in head start is defined as six or more hours per day partday sessions must comply with minimum class time requirement of 35 hours the head start program was most recently reauthorized in december of 2007 with the enactment of the improving head start for school readiness act pl 110134 which reauthorizes the program through september 30 2012 the enactment of the bill hr 1429 into law followed unsuccessful efforts during the 108

waiver more than 15 of grantees total program costs may be for administration funds are awarded to over 1600 grantees at th discretion of hhs from state allocations determined by formula in law the formula for allocating the head start appropriation was significantly changed by the 2007 reauthorization and is described in more detail later in this report federal appropriations for head start included in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 total 6878 billion this amount marks decrease of 10 million from the amount appropriated in the fy2007 law 1 however on march 21 2008

pl 109 148 included 90 million in additional funding for head start to be used specifically for grantees serving children displaced by the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005 and to help with the costs of renovating head start facilities affected by the storms those funds were not allocated among all states according to the standard head start formula in effect at that time due to the targeted purpose of the funding the head start bureau took action to assess and address the needs of head start grantees in response to these hurricanes of the 90 million appropriated total of 74 million was awarded based on grantee requests the remainder was returned to the treasury the head start bureau urged all of its grantees to provide head start services to any displaced children and families relocated in their communities as result of the 2005 hurricanes on september 12 2005 hhs announced that it was making available 15 million for this purpose to help cover costs over 30day period grantees we re instructed to treat any preschoolaged child whose family was displaced from their home as incomeeligible with or without documentation the head start bureau anticipated that programs serving newly enrolled displaced children might struggle to meet certain head start regulations and issued guidance for requesting waivers in those areas moreover the bureau encouraged grantees to contact their regional federal offices with any concerns arising from serving evacuated families the regional offices were asked by hhs to collect data on daily basis from their respective grantees regarding the number of evacuee children being served by their programs and whether these children were new to head start or instead were previously enrolled in head start program in the community from which they had been displaced as result of hurricane katrina for copies of documents prepared by hhs relating to head starts role in responding to children and families affected by hurricane katrina as well as head start staff from centers affected by the hurricane see the following website httpwwwheadstartinfoorghurricane_rirhtm continued of fy2007 at level of 6888 billion

above 100 of the poverty line but below 130 provided poorer children and homeless children have been given higher priority in other words the income eligibility has not been raised to 130 acrosstheboard but rather for only percentage maximum of 35 of available slots and only in situations that have been approved by hhs if this eligibility provision in the new law had been in effect during fy2006 it would have meant that of the funded enrollment of 909201 up to 35 of those funded slotsapproximately 318000could have potentially been filled by children from families with incomes between 100 and 130 of poverty the cps data used to produce the estimates of eligibles in table 2 reveal that in 2006 over 15 million children were in households with incomes between 100 130 of

for allocating head start funds has been restructured significantly the following four major steps summarize how the head start appropriation is now allocated beginning with the fy2008 funding step 1 from the total amount of head start funds appropriated the states territories indian head start programs and migrant and seasonal programs are each allotted their same base grant amount and collaboration grant amount as in the prior year their base grant amount does not include amounts received for training and technical assistance see step 2 for training and technical assistance setaside in the event that the appropriation for fiscal year is less than the previous fiscal year each grantees funding level would be reduced proportionately step 2 at least 25 but not more than 3 of the total appropriation is reserved by the secretary for training and technical assistance at least 20 of these tta funds are to be used in early head start programs with the remai nder for use in head start programs of this remainder money for head start programs tta at least half is to go directly to head start agencies at least quarter is to be available to the secretary to support statebased tta system or national system supporting program quality and the remainder is for meeting performance standards and other activities at the secretarys discretion the secretary also reserves up to 20 million to fund research demonstration and evaluation activities of which not more than 7 million for each of fy20082012 is to be available for carrying out impact studies likewise the secretary reserves not more than 42 million for discretionary payments including payment for monitoring and corrective action activities step 3 if excess funds remain after allocating according to steps 1 and 2 all head start and early head start grantees will receive costofliving increase cola to maintain the service level of the prior year moreover additional funding will be allocated for indian head start ihs and migrant and seasonal head start mshspro grams to help increase their enrollment however the size of the cola and the am ount of additional funding for ihs and mshs depends upon the amount of excess appropriation available at this stage the law outlines three scenarios as outlined below scenario 1 provide full cola for each head start and early head start grantee to maintain the service level of the prior year provide an additional 10 million to indian head start grantees including indian early head start programs as well as 10 million to the migrant and seasonal programs for the purpose of increasing enrollment however if sufficient funds are not available to provide the full cola and the 20 million in total for indian migrant and seasonal program expansion then the allotment formula described in scenario 2 is to be applied provided funds are sufficient to do so if not scenario 3 comes into play

remaining for allocation in step 3 90 of it will be used to provide cola s of at least 50 rather than the full cola described in scenario 1 which would reflect the full increase in the consumer price index cpi u the other 10 will be split evenly betwee n indian head start 5 and migrantseasonal head start 5 for the purpose of expanding enrollment for fy2011 and each subsequent fiscal year the amount remaining for allocation in step 3 is to be used to provide colas to grantees and any remaining funds are to be divided equally between indian head start and migrant and asonal head start note over the fy20082012 period neither indian head start nor the migrant and seasonal head start is to receive more than 50 million each in these additional expansion funds scenario 3 in the event that sufficient funding is not available to fulfill the requirements outlined under scenario 2 then the excess funds remaining after steps 1 and 2 have been applied will be used to provide equal colas to all head star t and early head start grantees with funds made available for expansion of ihs or mshs enrollment step 4 this step applies to any funds remaining after allocation under step 3 scenario 1 or 2 of these remaining funds 40 are to be used for quality improvement purposes including compensation in hs and ehs programs 45 for expansion of programs and 15 for funding state advisory councils

allowed up to nine states to serve in this capacity the presidents ninestate pilot project proposal first introduced in the fy2005 budget was preceded by his more expansive proposal for fy2004 which would have allowed all states the option to administer head start provided they fulfilled certain criteria that initial proposal issued on february 3 2003 alongside release of the presidents fy2004 budget was included in press release announcing the presidents proposal to make changes to the head start program 10 this was followed by white house document outlining the administrations assessment of the status of the head start program and its plans for the program in the future11 the administration stated that the top goal of the head start reauthorization should be to improve both head start and other preschool programs to ensure that children are prepared to enter kindergarten the president asserted that states should have the opportunity to administer the program provided they demonstrate how head start will be coordinated with other preschool programs and services to emphasize developing skills and behaviors including language development prereading skills numeracy and

this bill to reauthorize head start was introduced and reported by chairman gregg of the senate health education labor and pensions committe on november 24 2003 there were significant differences between the house bill hr 2210 and the bill reported by the help committee most notably s 1940 srept 108208 unlike the housepassed hr 2210 would not have provided any state the option to administer the head start program nor would it have changed the law with respect to the nondiscrimination in hiring provision summary of many of the bills provisions follows the bill would have changed the way in which head start funds are allocated allowing not less than 4 to indians and not less than 5 to migrant and seasonal head start programs provided this could be done without reducing the total number of children funded by head start the bill would also have changed the way in which remaining funds after the setasides included in the 1998 law including exactly 2 for training and technical assistance would be allocated giving priority to grantees in states serving the smallest percentages of eligible children and distributing portion of the funds on competitive basis the bill would have provided 60 setaside of excess appropriation funds for quality improvement the percentage of funds allotted for the early h ead start program would have been maintained at 10 in fy2004 and would have gradually increased to 18 in fy2009 collaboration grants would have been awarded to each state by the secretary and each states governor would have designated state advisory council to advise states on collaboration between head start and other entities involved with early child care and education the bill would have authorized 90 million for the secretary to make maximum of 200 grants of at least 100000 per year for five years to head start agencies nominated by governors as centers of excellence in early childhood grants could have been used for purposes such as furthering best practices serving more children and providing additional training for staff the bill would have also addressed the population of children eligible for head start services by increasing the eligibility level to 130 of the poverty line programs would also have been required to keep an active waiting list at all times s 1940 would have required monthly enrollment reporting to the secretary and if actual enrollment were found to be lower than 95 of funded enrollment for period of year technical assistance would have been required to be provided to alleviate chronic underenrollment if the underenrollment were to persist after 18 months of technical assistance the bill would have allowed for the grantees base grant to be reduced by percentage reflecting the underenrollment the bill would have provided for the secretary to make training and technical assistance funds available to support regional or state system of early childhood education and training and technical assistance the bill also outlined variety of uses for those funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30952g10g142g138g141g561g21g157g138g155g157g497g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152 g158g151g141 g561g138g151g141 g561g11

full house one of the amendments offered and accepted on the house floor 220196 was the hotly debated provision to allow faithbased head start providers to discriminate in hiring based on religion on the senate side another bill s 1107 was approved by voice vote by the full health education bor and pensions committee but did not reach the floor the house bill would have designated that specified percentages of the total appropriation be reserved for indian head start programs as well as migrant and seasonal programs and the set aside for training and technical assistance would be changed from at least 2 to equal to 2 funding for early head start would have been maintained at 10 for each of fy2006fy2011 this house bill would have increased competition for head start grants requiring recompetition every five years for grantees shown to have deficiency grantees without deficiencies would have been designated as priority grantees and would not have been subject to recompetition in that fiveyear cycle priority grantees would have earned that designation in part by demonstrating active partnerships and collaboration with local educational agencies the bill would also have required that to be designated as head start grantee the head start agency must establish an independent board of director s which would have oversight responsibility for all program activities and finances although the boa rd would have been required to consult with its policy council of whom majority of members must be parents of enrolled or recently enrolled children policy councils would not have retained their regulatory authority to jointly approve or disapprove of many budget program and hiring policies they would have instead served in an advisory capacity on the house floor representative souder offered an amendment that would have maintained the policy councils decisionmaking authority but it failed by vote of 153266 hr 2123 would have put into law the requirement that each head start agency establish procedures for evaluating its delegate agencies and procedures for when necessary defunding them the bill also would have added to law new provisions regarding reduction of funding for grantees that exhibit chronic under enrollment reduction and redistribution of funds would occur only if actual enrollment still failed to reach 95 of funded enrollment after receiving technical assistance attempting to remedy the situation the house bill also would have made changes to grantees rights with respect to appealing any suspension or termination under hr 2123 grantee would have longer received reimbursement with federal head start funds for legal fees and other costs associated with waging an appeal as means of improving coordination among head start and other state and local early childhood education programs hr 2123 would have required that head start agencies enter into memorandum of understanding with those state and local entities and align all

this bill to reauthorize the head start act was introduced by help committee chairman enzi on may 23 2005 and approved by voice vote with amendments two days later by the help committee under s 1107 changes would have been made to the way funds are allotted among programs tribal programs would receive 4 of the tire head start appropriation and migrant and seasonal programs 5 provided that doing so would not reduce the total number of children served by head start programs exactly 2 of f unds would be reserved for training and technical assistance and state allotments would be based on amounts received in fy2005 updating the hold harmless from fy1998 with any remaining funds distributed not by the share of poor children under age 5 but instead by apportioning 65 of the remainder among states giving priority to those whose programs serve the lowest percentage of eligible children and awarding 35 of the remainder on competitive basis the percentage of funding reserved for early head start programs would have been increased like the house bill s 1107 would have increased competition for grant funds by requiring grantees to recompete for funding every five years the bill would have required agencies designated as head start grantees to assemble governing body which would have been required to receive regular and accurate information about program planning finances and performance data and to work with the grantees policy council and committee like the house bill s 1107 would have put into law the requirement that each head start agency establish procedures for evaluating its delegate agencies and procedures for when necessary defunding them the bill also would have added to law new provisions regarding reduction of funding for grantees that exhibit chronic under enrollment reduction and redistribution of funds would occur only if actual enrollment still fails to reach 95 of funded enrollment after receiving technical assistance attempting to remedy the situation similar to the bill introduced in the senate during the 108 th congress s 1107 would have authorized 90 million for the secretary to make maximum of 200 grants to head start agencies nominated by governors as centers of excellence in early childhood staff qualifications and degree requirements for head start teachers were also addressed by s 1107 among other provisions to increase staff qualifications the bill would have required except in cases where waiver could be grante d that by the end of fy2010 all head start teachers in centerbased programs have at least an associate degree relating to early childhood or related educational area with coursework relating to early childhood in states that have established state teacher requirements for their prek programs all head

provided they are not lower than head start requirements for states without established prek staff requirements 50 of head start teachers in those states programs would have been required to have ba

the 108th congress senate committee bill was the provision increasing income eligibility for head start from the poverty line up to 130 of the poverty guideline moreover any homeless child would have been deemed eligible for the program the bill also adopted the provision to commission national academy of sciences panel to review range of issues related to early childhood care and educationincluding assessments during the brief discussion of s 1107 prior to voice vote passage few democratic members of the committee did express concern regarding use of the national reporting

been rejected by the rules committee for floor consideration was the amendment pertaining to faithbased providers ability to discriminate in hiring the amendment subm itted by representative fortuño would have allowed faithbased head start providers to discriminate in their hiring of head start employees based on religionoverriding provision in head start law that bars this it also would have stipulated that 1 religious organizations be considered as head start providers on the same basis as other nongovernmental organizations and not be discriminated against because of their religious character 2 faithbased providers can retain their religious character and control of their internal governance 3 religious providers cannot be required to remove religious symbols and art 4 federal

fy2004 budget the administration contended that in order to impr ove coordination between head start and other federal state and local programs affecting preschool children the president plans to move responsibility for managing the head start program from the department of health and human services to the department of education14 it proposed that this transition begin in 2004 with the department of education assuming full responsibility for the program in 2005 however such transition would have required change to the head start statute and was not proposed in either the house or senate reauthorization legislation introduced in the 108th congress moreover the fy2005 budget did not mention any plan to transf er the head start program from hhs nor did any subsequent budgets

the presidents goal is to ensure that young children participating in existing preschool and head start programs are able to read by the time they reach third grade many head start advocates believed that the head start program should remain in hhs because head start offers wide variety of services beyond traditional education there was concern that transferring the program to the department of education could restrict head start to narrow classroom program without the broad set of human services currently provided opponents of the shift further suggested that moving the program from an agency where children receive comprehensive services to one focused on education would compromise the parental and community action strengths of head start when promoting the proposal in the fy2004 budget an aide to the president offered assurances that the proposed move was not intended to interrupt any of the social service components but rather to stress the most important part of head start which the president believed was literacy development at the time of proposing it the president described the transfer as consistent with his priorities and expressed hope that moving the program to the department of education would increase the chances of making every child proficient reader by third grade some of those in favor of keeping head start in hhs argued that head start currently focuses on getting children r eady for school including readiness in language and early literacy there is history of proposed transfers of the head start program in 1978 president carter proposed to transfer head start to the department of education edward zigler noted architect of head start was one of the most ardent opponents of the transfer for the reasons cited above although the reagan administration tried to includ head start in block grant president g w bush is the first president since carter to have recommended transfer of head start to the department of education
