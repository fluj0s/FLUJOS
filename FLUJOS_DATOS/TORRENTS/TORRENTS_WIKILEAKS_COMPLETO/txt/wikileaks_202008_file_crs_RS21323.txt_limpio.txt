specifically used the word force while at others it has used such terms as all means necessary of the 18 resolutions authorizing the use of force directly or implicitly and passed by the council between 1945 and may 1999 we found that the word force was used five times in some instances all means necessary did not really mean use of force the text of each was checked for content and context

the united nations they included boundary demarcation iraqkuwait observer mission weapons of mass destruction return of kuwaiti property compensation reparations sanctions general and arms embargo sanctions oil exportshumanitarian imports program and repatriation of kuwaiti and third country nationals the council also adopted resolution 688 on humanitarian intervention major distinguishing feature of resolutions 687 and 688 and at least four subsequent resolutions was the extent to which the council imposed obligations and duties that directly infringed on iraqs internal affairs iraq was obliged to accept onto its territory teams of inspectors in search of weapons of mass destruction that were to be destroyed andor removed iraq was obliged to accept international assistance for the housing protection and feeding of the segments of its population that had been subjected to and fled from gross human rights violations inflicted by the iraqi government although iraq was still subject to the economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 it was allowed to export limited amount of its petroleum products under an explicit set of provisions requiring tight control and monitoring3

setting up the oil for food program and resolution 1409 2002 further defining the oil for food program and expediting the humanitarian distribution process resolution 1051 1996 set up mechanism for

the council adopted resolution 1284 1999 creating new inspections mechanism the monitoring verification and inspection commission unmovic which until 2002 had not been able to operate within iraq during this time the council did not specifically authorize the further use of force to ensure iraqi compliance with resolution 687 1991 or any of its subsequent resolutions it did however refer to previously adopted resolutions including resolution 678 1990 and resolution 687 1991 iraq and the security council 2002 on november 8 2002 after nearly two months of consultation negotiation and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21323 debate the security council by vote of 1500 adopted resolution 1441 20024 in this resolution the council decided 1 to give iraq which has been and remains in material breach of resolutions final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations and 2 to set up an enhanced inspection regime it decided that iraq shall providea currently accurate full and complete declaration of all aspects of its programs to develop chemical biological and nuclear weapons ballistic missiles and other delivery systems by december 85 it decided that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted and failure by iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute further material breach and will be reported to the council for assessment the council decided that iraq shall provideimmediate unimpeded unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all including underground areas facilities buildings equipment records and means of transport which they wish to inspect as well as immediate unimpeded unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons whom unmovic or the iaea wish to interview the council directed unmovic and iaea to report immediately to the council any interference by iraq with inspection activities as well as any failure by iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations in addition the council decided that it would convene immediately upon receipt of report relating to iraqi noncompliance and recalled in that context that it had repeatedly warned iraq that it will face serious consequences as result of its continued violations of its obligations on september 12 2002 president bush in his address to the general assembly had focused on iraq and its failure to comply with various resolutions adopted by the security council he urged the security council to act in the face of such repeated violations 4 the security council held an open debate on iraq on october 16 and 17 2002 during the four meetings the 15 members of the council were joined by 51 members and three permanent observers in expressing their views on number of issues related to iraq and various options for response to president bushs general assembly speech 5 iraq submitted 12000 page declaration on december 7 2002 crs5 my nation will work with the security council to meet our common challenge if iraqs regime defies us again the world must move deliberately decisively to hold iraq to account we will work with the security council for the necessary resolutions the security council resolutions will be enforced the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable the question of the situation between iraq and kuwait is still on the councils agenda the council considers the situation under number of topics including biannual review of continuation of the iraqkuwait observation mission unikom the annual report of the resolution 661 sanctions committee the oil for food program report is required every 90 days and the quarterly report of the monitoring verification and inspection commission unmovic among the issues that faced council members as they worked to draft what became sres1441 2002 in response to president bushs request were the following what inspection regime will apply the preresolution 1441 2003 set of council resolutions included approval of the 1998 memorandum of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21323 understanding on access to presidential palaces in iraq and the 1999 establishment of unmovic that included an extensive or some would say expansive timetable for the conduct of inspections iraqs september 16 2002 acceptance of inspectors without conditions and us demands for inspectors to go anywhere anytime see anyone inspect anything at the time and place of the inspectors choosing would seem to require an additional resolution to revise inspection access some countries however seemed to prefer that additional council resolution be passed should deadline for iraqi compliance either with council resolutions or with unconditional inspections be set by the council before inspections start when should the council authorize actions that might be taken if iraq did not comply before or after the inspections phase some nations including the united states sought consequences authorization as part of single resolution on inspections and iraqi compliance while others preferred twostage process with specific authorization of force or its equivalence after inspections had been given chance to work iraq and the security council in 2003 during most of the first quarter of the year members of the security council continued to review the work of the unmovic and iaea as briefed and reported by the chief inspectors see crs report rl31671 iraq inspections for weapons of mass destruction by sharon squassoni and to consider what the councils next steps if any might be
