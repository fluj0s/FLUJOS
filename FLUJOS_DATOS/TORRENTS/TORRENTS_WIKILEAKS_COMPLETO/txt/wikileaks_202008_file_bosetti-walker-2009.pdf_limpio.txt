addressing these challenges their struggle to maintain the core mission of universities and ﬁnally implications for the future of higher education introduction there is considerable debate regarding whether universities are in crisis demise or merely in the process of restructuring to meet the needs of knowledgebased economy blackmore 2002 universities are robust institutions that have existed for almost millennium many of the medieval traditions and structures of these institutions have endured throughout the centuries making it difﬁcult for university leaders to bring about signiﬁcant changethe idea of the university characterised by community of scholars governed by academic authority protected from external interference and dedicated to the pursuit preservation and dissemination

in the produc tion of research or new knowledge knowledge driven economy is one in which the generation and the exploi tation of knowledge has come to play the predominant part in the creation of wealth it is not simply about pushing back the frontiers of knowledge it is also about the more effective use and exploitation of all types of knowledge in all manner of activity dti 1998 the world

economy the balance between knowledge and resources has shifted so far towards the former that knowledge has become perhaps the most important factor determining the standard of living todays most technologically advanced economies are truly knowledgebased cited in dti 1998 business industry and governments have acknowledged the signiﬁ cance of knowledge as the engine to drive their social and economic prosperity governments have responded by demanding broader access to higher education challenging postsecondary institutions to become more diverse to engage with the outside world to partner with the private sector to develop and apply knowledge to achieve public beneﬁt and to balance basic with applied research to address policy needs coaldrake 1999 in short these external demands make it difﬁcult for universities to remain small and disconnected from the outside world the values and practices that have governed an elite university system are longer sufﬁcient to address the externally imposed measures of quality value and good practice and demands for widened access to university education2 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell

for their institutions into the twentyﬁrst century the paper reveals the perceptions and spoken words of these leaders as they identify the key challenges shaping higher education their strategies for addressing these challenges their struggle to maintain the core mission of universities and implications for the future of higher education vicechancellors were selected as repre sentatives of broad spectrum of universities with consideration given to such factors as geographic location research assessment exercise ranking and institutional size the vicechancellors of the following institutions consented to participate in the study eric thomas from bristol university steven schwartz from brunel university robert burgess from university of leicester james drummond bone from university of liverpool graeme davis from university of london alan gilbert from university of manchester michael driscoll from middle sex university colin lucas from university of oxford graham upton from oxford brookes university and david vandelinde from university of warwick the data were collected in 20042005 and are based on approximately 15hour audiorecorded conversations with each vice chancellor following semistructured interview guide the audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and then returned to the vice chancellors for veriﬁcation and approval the transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes and insights related to higher education and lead ership in the knowledge economythe following are the key themes that emerged from the conversations the purpose of the university one of the most pressing concerns for vicechancellors is the fundamen tal challenge of globalisation and the demands of the knowledge economy on the traditional mission of the university and its important role in society there is an ideological struggle between economic views of the purposes of higher education the traditional liberal idea the bureaucratic drive of the state and the effect of the new right in framing educational policy since 1979 greatrix 2001 p13 the vicechancellor of oxford colin lucas cautions one of the greatest distortions is this sense that the only thing that universities are for is to drive the economy the core mission of universities is threatened by narrow value system the governments preoccupation with fostering culture of enterprise on building skills of entrepreneurship the promouk vicechancellors on leading universities 3 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdtion of research and on industryeducation relationships peters 2002 threatens the core purpose of the university and implies an emerging hierarchy of knowledge whose value is determined by economic mea sures and outcome this is illustrated by prime minister blairs dti 1998 view of the role and priorities of government as explained in the forward to the white paper on building the knowledgedriven economy the government must promote competition stimulating enterprise ﬂexibil ity and innovation by opening markets but we must also invest in british capabilities when companies alone cannot in education in science and in the creation of culture of enterprise and we must promote creative partner ships which help companies to collaborate for competitive advantage to promote longterm vision in world of shortterm pressures to benchmark their performance against the best in the world and to forge alliances with other businesses and with employees despite the interests of government vicechancellors are keenly aware of the signiﬁcant role universities play in not only providing the cement that keeps secular civilisation together through the transmission of human values gilbert university of manchester but also in their commitment to an ethical imperative of engaged democratic action in lopsided world as autonomous institutions they are extraordinarily important in their capacity to fashion solutions that government and the private sector cannot gilbertthere is an awareness of the pressing concern to preserve the academic traditions academic freedom and institutional autonomy that are the foundation stones of civilisation there is concern among these university leaders of the commodi ﬁcation of knowledge and the currency of holding university degree credentials from particular universities become positional goods we all know that education is commodity that can be bought and sold often at very high price so universities are busy doing that charging students large amount of money to study in england because it is popular destination branding and marketing take the font seat and education is in the back s schwartz brunel university reﬂecting on the traditional role of the university thevicechancellor of university of oxford is concerned that commodiﬁcation threatens to destroy not only scholarly democracy but civilisation itself these leaders in higher education discuss the importance of preserv ing knowledge democracies in university all academic disciplines are treated equally because the core mission of the university is to educate j drummond bone university of liverpool and to transform knowledge people and places thomas bristol university4 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdvicechancellors agree that there can be hierarchy of knowledge because universities are the last bastions where individuals have the freedom to study and unravel the mystery to ﬁnd that which is hidden to ﬁnd new knowledge of the mind body and socioeconomic ways in which we relate both as individuals and collectively on the physical and natural world around u s w ea r t here to say that there is something inherently better more valuable and more morale about trying to understand physical science i s it fair to ask whether the power of the inquisitive mind in humanities is less worthy of funding than some laboratory apparatus c lucas university of oxford the vicechancellor of oxford discusses the importance of sustaining knowledge democracies civilisations are sustained by knowledge democracieswhat universities do is produce generation after generation of responsible creative innovative dis tinct individuals who have learned in whatever subject they choose to study how to understand that which they mean to understand how to constitute meaning where none is visible how to make decisions how not to be misled by seemingly true or simplistic explanations how not to charge after fashion how to have conscience how to have beliefs and values and not to give way to temptations intimidators the racists and the fascists that underlie so much of the world in which we live if we dont have that we wont go on as culture civilised society c lucas while few vicechancellors would dispute the traditional roles of universities diminished government funding has forced some institutions to be more responsive to the needs of government business and industry i think that universities need to be real about the world in which they inhabit and they need to be real in thinking how they are business they are in business with higher education at their heart they are into marketing them selves competitiveness and global market challenges r burgess university of leicester universities are social as well as economic engines for society they are set up for the beneﬁt of the community to train people and they are often one of the largest employers in region outside of the public sector j drummond bone university of liverpool the vicechancellor of oxford brookes graham upton views the modern university as unique corporate business that is vital to innovation and community well being he explains we have to be more businesslike we have become regional resource for research and development and professional and business workforce development needs corporate funding and develop ment are the third stream of the universityuk vicechancellors on leading universities 5 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdthe vicechancellor of university of manchester alan gilbert acknowledges the need for universities to respond to government and market pressures he is concerned that universities become sidelined by their conservative refusal to compromise by protecting the core values of the university as leader he sees huge strategic concern that higher education has become locked into big business in the 21stcentury knowledge has become the most important currency in the global economy and unless universities become more adept and strategic in knowledge trans fer and meeting the training needs of business then there will be mass opportunities for other service providers to become involved in education solutions he cautions corporations will create private universities when they perceive that university training is inadequate too costly unfocussed and doesnt pay off in increasing employee loyalty however the commer cialisation of higher education needs to be constrained within the idea of the university as an autonomous institution former secretary of state for education david blunkett 2000 conﬁrmed the concerns expressed by vicechancellors regarding the future of universities and the role of the state in determining that future in the knowledge economy entrepreneurial universities will be as important as entrepreneurial businesses the one fostering the other the do nothing university will not survive and it will not be the job of government to bail it out universities need to adapt rapidly to the topdown inﬂuences of globali sation and the new technologies as well as the bottomup imperatives of serving the local labour market innovating with local companies and provid ing professional development courses that stimulate economic and intellec tual growth above all quality will be paramount diversity with quality will be the benchmark by which uk higher education will be seen and judged by those making choices as businesses individuals and nation states across the globe blunkett 2000 key external factors driving the transformation of universities diminished government funding diversity and quality assurance in the uk dfes 2003a white paper the future of higher education then secretary of state for education and skills charles clarke stated his concern that despite the strong history of success of the higher education system in england it is currently under severe pressure and at serious risk of decline dfes 2003a p13 he argued that universities need to improve high standards expand and widen access strengthen links with business and compete globally he outlined three challenges6 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdinternal to higher education the recruitment and retention of high calibre academic staff to improve and sustain teaching and research the maintenance of infrastructure for researching and teaching and assur ance that the investment in higher education is used to the best effect dfes 2003a p13 he goes on to acknowledge that the higher education sector has embraced lifelong learning research know ledge transfer social inclusion and regional and economic development and that it would be unreasonable to expect all higher education insti tutions to sustain all of these activities simultaneously at global and not just national levels of excellence dfes 2003a p 20 his recommen dation is to continue to have institutions diversify so they can play to their strengths and to consolidate research in fewer institutions so they can continue to compete with the best universities in the world dfes 2003a p13 the former secretary of state for education and skills made this point in 2000 in order to retain worldclass university research in an increasingly competi tive environment government support for research must be selective it is vital that we sustain world class excellence research funding is also very tightly focused some 30 institutions gain three quarters of all public research funds degree of selectivity which is comparable to that in the usa blunkett 2000 clarke concluded through the strategic application of scare resources individual institutions will be able to focus on what they do best while the sector as whole achieves wider range of objectives dfes 2003a p 20 this translates to some institutions concentrating on teaching while others focus on research the research assessment exercise is identiﬁed by vicechancellors as one of the major drivers toward the stratiﬁcation of institutions and among individual scholars institutions have been driven toward greater involvement in research by incentives in the funding mechanism and by criteria used to award status as university dfes 2003a when universities see themselves as sharing the same mission to be researchintensive institutions they become competitors rather than collaborators the vicechancellor of university of manchester sum marises the predicament as follows the gap between global population and access to higher education commer cialisation of higher education shortsighted government dealmaking aca demic conservatism the monocular expectation for all higher education institutions to be research intensive and organisational inﬁghting have created an unsustainable higher education paradigm gilbertuk vicechancellors on leading universities 7 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdanother vicechancellor commented research and refereed publication quotas is the new normative model being pressed by government policy around the world and the only sure result of that will be to make universities more expensive the bulk of universities cant afford to be research intensive ethomas bristol universitythe vicechancellor of brunel university highlights the problem of staff retention and poach ing of academic superstars to bolster research assessment exercise ratings there are 43 postsecondary institutions in london so turnover among faculty is very high tenure does not mean lot in regard to switching institutions1good people are never concerned about it salaries mean much more than tenure especially when you are living in an expensive place like london s schwartz in global knowledge economy competition to be among the top ten research universities in the world is serious challenge that involves attracting and retaining top academic faculty and students the biggest global challenge for uk universities comes from the four dominant american private universities harvard yale princeton and stanford because of their enormous endowments over 112 billion dollars that allow them to attract outstanding researchers and offer very competitive salaries attractive employment schemes and up to date facilities not only can they attract britains academic elite they can also buy the smartest international students through scholarships making it very difﬁcult for the uk to competethevicechancellor of oxford explains the americans succeed through the power of their ﬁnancial base backed by their political ﬁrepower in setting the agenda for how to deﬁne universities by what they do and what they should be spending their money on most universities in the uk ﬁnd it hard to escape that agenda c lucas widening participation and government intervention recent governmentwhite papers the future of higher education dfes 2003a and widening participation in higher education dfes 2003b made the claim that the social class gap in entry to higher education remains unacceptably wide and all of those who stand to beneﬁt from higher education despite their socioeconomic background ought to be encouraged to do sothe uk government aimed to enrol 50 per cent of the population in education before the age of 30this desired increase in participation comes along side the increased expectation for universities to maintain or increase their rank in the quality assurance and research8 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdassessment exercise these factors combined have resulted in new admission standards and fee structures and the emergence of institutions that specialise in meeting the needs of diverse learners traditionally admission to universities has been the responsibility of universities and collegesthey have been free to set their own admission criteria choose their own assessment methods and select their own students dfes 2004 p 2they have also been free to develop courses and programs of study that have been shaped by the research interests of faculty employed by the universitywhile the government acknowledges the right of universities and colleges to be selfdetermining they want to ensure that admission systems are fair and provide equal opportunity to all students regardless of their background to gain access to courses suited to their ability and aspirations dfes 2004 p 5 they have created the ofﬁce for fair access offa to consider monitor and approve university access agreements and to monitor universities efforts and progress in implementing its access agreements dfes 2004 p 6 the development of new courses and subjects involve an elaborate approval process requiring unprecedented justiﬁcation that addresses labour demand economic viability and the articulation of learning out comes and tuition fees according to the higher education leaders there is simply not enough supply to meet the student demand for access to universities in the united kingdomtop ranked universities retain their status by attracting the best and the brightest researchers researchers are rewarded for basic scientiﬁc inquiry publishing in scholarly journals and supervising gradu ate students the result of these increased pressures and expectations is that universities are compelled to be selective in admitting students on the one hand there is strong motive that universities are there to provide the knowledge to drive the economy hence you have to be very competitive producing the best means in these universities on the other hand there is the requirement for us to provide for all the various new demands that all institutions must provide for such as increased access for nontraditional parttime students c lucas university of oxford the vicechancellor of university of liverpool explains there is this rhetoric about widening participation as being democratic but the league table decisionmaking system is weighted toward traditional applicants from high ﬂying private schools j drummond bone it is difﬁcult for universities to overcome their position in these tables because the criteria are dominated by success in research and research funding gilbert university of manchester we heard that in higher education the top of the table is occupied completely by world class researchuk vicechancellors on leading universities 9 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdinstitutions if you want to be at the table or even near it youve got to bust gill to be able to say youve got world class research environment thomas bristol university universities leaders share the concern that governments have moved from being providers of funding for higher education to focusing on quality assurance since the late 1990s there has been surge in regu lations designed to assure consumer protection blunkett 2000 in his speech on higher education rationalised the role of government in cre ating system of external regulation for higher education to assure both quality and academic standards because high quality higher education is at the heart of the productive capacity of the new economy university leaders view these new regulations as mechanisms that reduce institu tional autonomy and indicate massive and unprecedented extension of the level of government and state control over the direction and delivery of higher education global markets and internationalisation the integration of an international intercultural or global dimension into the teaching research and service functions of universities is growing global trend among academic institutions knight 2003 2004 scott 1998 it is motivated by both ethical and economic factors blunkett 2000 explained the economic imperative behind internationalisation and in particular the recruitment of foreign fullfee paying students at the same time international student numbers are growing and competi tion to recruit them is intense countries are vying to ensure that overseas students choose their domestic universities and colleges and for very good reasonthese students not only bring economic gains vital as these are but cultural contact that enriches our communities and provides lifelong links between people across the world that is precisely why we now have governmentled strategy for international recruitment so that we can raise our market share in relation to our major competitors from 17 to 25 by 2005 we must have big aspirations even if we are small country it is absolutely clear that we must use the competitive advantage we have been given by the english language and the international reputation of our higher education system to make major strides in these markets blunkett 2000 university leaders acknowledge the deep inequities inherent in the current trends in globalisation and internationalisation of higher educa tion and feel that governments and universities in developed societies such as the united kingdom have an ethical obligation to respond to the persistent global divide in the provision of postsecondary education to qualiﬁed people for example in china and india there are three times10 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdmore qualiﬁed applicants than there are universities placements resulting in 70 million students denied access this is the stuff of revolutions cautions one vicechancellor gilbert university of manchester however diminished government funding has driven universities into the arms of business and industry and grabbing fullfee international students j drummond bone university of liverpool the vice chancellor of middlesex university michael driscoll explains that by recruiting international students who pay premium fees they have miti gated very difﬁcult funding position our international reimbursement has been very good weve been very successful very organised and able to compete since the late 1990s the uk has had over 140000 international students involved in academic programs under the auspices of british universities elsewhere in the world scott 1998 international students make up 13 of all students in uk higher education and bring in over billion pounds in fee income nationally hesa 2004 ukcosa 2004 the imperatives of the knowledge economy and the globally competi tive higher education market have resulted in universities adopting strat egies of proﬁt driven corporations which involves developing means to market higher education programs effectively and treating intellectual property as commodity altbach 2002 many universities have devel oped strategic alliances with academic institutions in other countries to accommodate student demand for access to higher education with programs that are culturally appropriate and of high quality through collaborative networking with other universities we work to develop symmetries recognizing that institutions must be culturally appropriate by working together both dominant culture and the developing culture traditions can be enriched gilbert university of manchester middlesex university has established ofﬁces internationally and created network of regional directors who not only help to recruit students who pay premium fees but are also able to support and deliver quality instruction around the globe the vicechancellor of university of bristol explains their involve ment in the worldwide universities network wun an alliance of 16 universities in the uk usa europe and china the purpose of wun is to do research dominantly in way that it cant be done otherwise the fundamental basis of where weve got to is that there is now problems of such complexity requiring multiple intellectual physical and human resources that single institutions cannot address them t h can only be addressed by powerful global alliance thomasuk vicechancellors on leading universities 11 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdit brings faculty members together in communities of interest and pro vides the brokering support and intellectual venture capital required to facilitate international projects he describes how the wuns collabo rative networking process works it follows an implementation sequence of identifying allies establishing an ict grid identifying research pri orities and shared student training system reﬂecting upon university of manchesters involvement in universi tas 21 alan gilbert explains the merit of establishing collaborative alliances to create solutions to the global problem of providing access to higher education and opportunities for universities on scale that none of them would be able to achieve operating independently or through traditional bilateral alliances globally differentiated strategies are needed rather than campusbased solutions that will only work in devel oped societies which constitute 15 of the world through the use of information technology we could invent online solutions that were cheaper and easier to gear up to very large multiples w thought it was possible to use the brand strength of an established university to create product in which people would have high conﬁdence universitas 21

stu dents employ over 80000 academics and researchers and have over 2 million alumni their collective budgets amount to over 10 billion us dollars partnership with business and industry universities have become power drivers of change and are critical to local and regional development because they produce people with knowledge and skills generate new knowledge and import it from diverse sources and apply knowledge in range of environments to assist universities to embark on these ventures government has devel oped the knowledge transfer partnerships kpt scheme which pro vides funding to help facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise between academia and business blunkett 2000 referred to universities as the seedbed for new indus tries products and services and the hub of the business networks and industrial clusters of the knowledge economy rationalised and focused12 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdgovernment funding has forced universities to become more entrepre neurial and aggressive in seeking new markets and sources of income for example warwick university earns over 54 of its income from non public sources and both city university and cranﬁeld business school generate nearly half of their income from the private sector university of oxford grew technology transfer by investing half billion us dollars in infrastructure and grew the university press to diversify its income another area of expansion for universities in meeting the professional and business work force development needs is through continuing pro fessional development in addition to providing traditional professional programs increasingly universities are providing short courses tailored to individual needs oxford brookes offers professional courses in business health care teacher education engineering architecture and planning brunel university offers degree programs that combine work and study and emphasise applied research they have joined the west focus consortium partnership of seven higher institutions that collaborate together to realize commercial and social potential and to engage with business and the local community universities are cre ating new business units staffed with full time management and aca demic and professional expertise contracted as required key internal challenges constraining transformation of universities modern universities have become big businesses they are large and complex organisations with thousands of faculty and staff annual budgets measured in the hundreds of millions offshore campuses global alliances and wide variety of revenue generating business operations in traditional university the vicechancellor was primarily the academic leader who raised revenue and defended the university against the dep redations of the outside world management and leadership positions were decided on the basis of academic authority and people were appointed on rotating basis administrative appointments were viewed as temporary service that took the scholar away from the real business of the university teaching and research however the knowledge economy has transformed many universities into professionally managed corporate organisations with nonacademic specialists responsible for areas such as human resource management ﬁnancial and investment planning marketing technology transfer and management of informa tion systems m driscoll university of middlesex for example brunel university ﬂattened the administrative structure of the universityuk vicechancellors on leading universities 13 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdso that there is only one management committee in the whole university and it includes the vicechancellor the deputy the provicechancellor and the heads of schools the vicechancellor explained we ﬁlled our senior management positions with people who had never worked in universities before the hr human relations person came from mining another from banking its probably made big difference to brunel and its ability to move in that people arent weighted down with lot of public service type history s schwartz graham upton sug gested most academics are happy if the place is running well and giving them what they want without them having to be on decisionmaking committee oxford brookes university in the modern university the vicechancellor is more commonly viewed as the chief executive ofﬁcer with executive authority to make decisions new administrative and ﬁnancial structures have focused on reducing bureaucracy and decision making processes to enable institutions to respond more quickly to global opportunities at university of manchester the ordinances of the university state more explicitly the president who is head of the institution is the ceo and an academic leader this change was in response to the impossible task for university president to get 3000 people to endorse each decision generating deep constitutional ambi guity making it difﬁcult for the university to respond to change gilbert university of manchester the vicechancellors in this study discussed number of strategies they have employed to lead their institution into the 21stcentury however the biggest challenge identiﬁed is the need to change the organisational culture and the traditional values of people working within the university the desire to remain complacent and internally focused impedes the transformation of universities to becoming nimble competitive interna tionally ranked institutions thomas university of bristol vice chancellors have to help colleagues to understand the nature of the competitive educational market to shift thinking in how the institution needs to be managed to raise aspirations about what the institution can achieve and to formulate strategic vision that people are willing to implement r burgess university of leicester the future lies in very smart planning highly skilled choice making and determining strategic focus c lucas university of oxford it is about institutions getting their core business right s schwartz brunel university the problem is that academic communities are not motivated by the short term from one university the view was expressed that the nature of research and the nature of the academic pursuit is about the long term the legacy you leave behind and what you are buildin g14 higher education quarterly 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell publishing ltdacademics are heavily committed to doing what is right g davis university of london unlike business or corporation the vice chancellor cannot simply tell people what to do because in university faculty members have academic freedom and can speak out against initiatives with impunity academics have more allegiance to their research discipline than to the university as whole this results in turf protection the vicechancellor needs to have network of people involved in intelligence gathering to be able to swiftly deal with even the faintest hint of revolution s schwartz brunel university according to one vicechancellor you have to lead with ﬂow and authorityy ou can never be out of touch with what faculty are thinking i fi nt h ee n df aculty dont follow you it isnt because they are stupid its because you are out of touch s schwartz the vicechancellor of university of liverpool leads by inﬂuence and attempts to inspire rather than control setting the tone for change helping people want to change and then facilitating the achievement of those changes he explains ou need to start by setting the agenda for change then you have to look at who is going to be driver or champion of that change who is going to be passenger and who quite frankly is going to stand against it j drummond bone the challenge is not simply to understand what the problems are but to get people to agree upon the strategies i f vicechancellors are detached from faculty and running too far ahead theyll be accused of tyranny or betrayal c lucas university of oxford changing perceptions in the university involves getting people to start thinking about major issues by looking at the data on the institu tion said professor burgess of the university of leicester academics like to make decisions based on evidence so if everything is done in the open and the reasoning behind why you are doing things is transparent then the academic community will live with it even though they may not like it t h academic community is such that they cant abide with feeling that there are deals being struck in political sense so that the undeserving perhaps get some form of preferred treatment against the deserving g davis university of london the vicechancellors were in agreement that the core instrument to the effective transformation of the university resides in the strategic plan and never losing sight of the goal being leader comes from being really committed to the value in what you are doing in the end in this kind of business the only sure reward is good conscience so youd better protect it ou cant expect everyone or even anyone to understand ou cant expect their applause there will be lot ofuk vicechancellors on leading universities 15 2009 the authors journal compilation 2009 blackwell

relentlessly strategic this means not just trying to move an institution incrementally but basically confronting it with the real issues that have to change profoundly it is about being highly strategic in aspiring to achieve very substantial change gilbert university of manchester implications for the future of higher education higher educational leaders whether discussing challenges strategies or reﬂecting on best leadership practices are clearly experiencing unprec edented changes shifts and developments in the structures systems strategies functions resources and services to their constituents eco nomic restraint and rolemandate diversiﬁcation together with funda mental community fragmentation place extraordinarily complex issues and dilemmas before higher education leaders with these challenges gardner 1995 152 said the only hope for vitality in largescale organi sations is the willingness of great many people throughout the organi sation to take the initiative in identifying problems and solving them the higher education leaders from the united kingdom that partici pated in this study are clearly guiding their institutions through the murky waters of the new economy by following gardners advice and not only identifying challenges but also developing strategies to overcome them what and how do key educational leaders think about the chal lenges in the context of the new economy the leaders who participated in this study identiﬁed the challenges facing universities as the changing mandate or purpose of the university diminished government funding and ﬁnding new sources of revenue to the institution widened access to the system commercialisation of higher education competitive interna tional markets government intervention and changing the internal culture of the university to respond to the demands of the new economy in nimble and efﬁcient manner what strategic orientations and practices do they engage in to adapt their work and

of the university in the regional and national community these leaders are cognisant of the important role universities play in generating the social and economic prosperity of their nation and in
