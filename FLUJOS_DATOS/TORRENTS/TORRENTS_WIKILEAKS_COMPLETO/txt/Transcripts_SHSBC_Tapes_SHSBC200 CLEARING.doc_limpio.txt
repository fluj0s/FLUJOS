clearing lecture given on 9 august 1962 thank you thank you very much whats the date audience 9th of august ninth of august what planet nine august ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture number one subject of lecture clearing series of two lectures here one of which is clearing in general and the second lecture will be on the specific technology of listing in which you will be very very interested all right what are you trying to do well youre trying to clear people now that may not be what youre trying to do according to your goal but unreactively you are of course quite happy to do just that therefore you should recognize that all processes are subordinate to this final end there are processes that compare with those that clear that is very much the case now you have to consider that an individual in order to be clearable has to be auditable so that therefore becomes part of clearing to the degree that it isassists clearing and if at any time an individual cannot be audited he of course cannot be cleared thats awfully plain isnt it thats one of these idiotic things the way to get up theacross the river is to get across the river you know but youre going to face this youre going to face this many times youre going to have somebody who is unauditable and youre trying to clear them well what do i mean by unauditable theres nothing very esoteric about the definition if the fellow cant talk and cant listen and cant respond he of course is unauditable so when were speaking of unauditable for the subject matter of clearing we have nothing to do with the old i think its kraepelin i think the fellows name was over in germany i thinkit really was i meanhe made up this scale of insanities and i dont knowvery germanic subdivisions of subdivisions into the subdivisions and all of this sort of thing and this terrific chart i mean its marvelous they took it over to the united states and they sort of amputated it down and cut out lot of the steps and then changed the definitions of those but aside from that alteris theyre using the same chart now thats states of sanity and you frankly dont have anything to do with state of sanity just make up your mind on that right there you got nothing to do with it i know it is an intriguing subject but consider it one of the lesser parascientology subjects that somebody should study sometime for masters thesis in university of scientology somewhere up the track when you cant teach him anything else you got the idea see its subordinate subject to scientology yet the whole world tries to force any activity in the field of the mind either into the field of insanity or the field of advertising now our difficulties are multiplied by the fact that the public at large believes that we have lot to do with sanity whereasnow im giving you technical truth what we had to say about insanity had to do with difficulties in auditing and other things in the past you see well just kind of lay all that aside and just skip it assign it to propaganda necessary statements efforts to keep organizations and auditors from getting themselves in trouble and you know so weve used this word insanity from time to time weve used this word sanity from time to time but actually we have business having anything to do with either because there isnt human being on earth today who is sane theyre all batty or they wouldnt be here its justits one of these definitions that proves itself you know you say is this fellow insane well you cant say hes insane because we dont know what the definition of that is but is he sane and we find him in small factory working someplace at drill press you see and he comes down to the drill press in the morning at 800 in the morning and he goes this waysee and he does this until 530 see and he does this five days week that guy must be crazy his total horizon is being retired someday by socialist government which of course having drained the population of taxes in the interim probably wont exist at the time of his retirement his complications are many but you couldnt say that he is taking the optimum solution out along the line and im afraid you could only define sanity you cannot define insanity and somebody who is sane could be defined as person who resolves problems for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics thats sane action we can define that i think you would agree with that im not shoving it down your throats as the definition of sanity we dont even have to have it as technical fact but i think youd rather agree with that as sane well when you look at the actions of human beings and their various tangles and so forth very few of their problems are solved with that equation so which of course rather debars them from the subject so we havent anything to do with sanity or insanitynothing the guys in spinbin that doesnt prove hes sane or insane or anything else see it proves nothing the only thing youre interested in is the auditability of person see the second youve got clearing as an absolute factthere it isyoure only then interested in the auditability of person so people fall into gradient scale of auditability which passes out down into scale of inauditability and thats what you should really study if youre going to study states of man and that sort of thing is are they auditable now that is very narrow look that is very narrow look because its technical look person who is not clear will not resolve things for the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics even firstgoal clear wont ordinarilyand i think you will find it borne out that you get second goal third goal and all of sudden theyre starting to really look around and observe things in that their equating and resolving problems and so forth will step up to that degreewill begin to match up to that particular definition of proper definition of solution to problem for the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics but look im talking to you nownot on basis of propaganda or what id like the world to believe or anything elseim just talking to you straight from the shoulder what i know and what i know is this there is processing short of clearing that is worth long and arduous hours see there is none now that weve got 3ga we can take look back along the line and we can see easily how hard we have worked for what tiny gains now thatsthose gains were well worth making my god lets not downgrade this fact they were well worth making but the gain we can make in comparison to these things by clearing is something like matchstick up against the empire state building you see the comparative values of these things are fantastic in compatheyre hardlytheyre not of the same order of magnitude hardly you see you got somebody over his headaches and he got along better with his family fine good wonderful nobody could do it before on this planet and therefore our existence has been justified but look we all of sudden have got our hands on fact here and this fact is 3ga and ive watched it now ive kept my eye on this and i just give it to you straight from the shoulder i mean what were doing has absolutelyhardly any comparative value with what weve done at all and the value of actual clearing is so great and it does so much for the person that to strike for lesser goal when that other goal of clearing is in your power of course is an awful waste of time so we become interested in auditability now every now and then theres one or another amongst you i start worrying about see that isnt anything that you disturb my dreams or something but i see how you are doing and how you are not doing and so forth and i start worrying i see your case going awry or something like that your instructors can tell youall i do is start push push along this line you know well how can we get him up into 3ga group you see and how can we somehow or other cut the corners on this and how can we press this one forward and how can we get this person to audit well enough so that he can receive some auditing and you see and its allits this kind of action that is taking place see and the difficulty that we face is actually not technical difficulty that an auditor faces to pc see here is little bit of different difficulty you are technicians you are scientologists you are scientists you are people who can do things with the human mind you practicallythis small confine herepractically all the people on earth who are experts on the subject are confined at this moment in this very small area see all right the trick is from my viewpoint to get somebody who can clear somebody else while being cleared see thats the stunt otherwise nothing else worksnot on this planet you see all right so were faced with this additional problem and your judgment on this course is liable to be warped little bit as to the auditability of somebody because hes not up in the 3ga group see there isnt anybody on this course who couldnt be that fast in the 3ga group you see you walk right straight in the front door and just go straight onto 3ga group providing there was requisite they pay for any of the auditing they get by auditing you see yet there was requisite we maybe could have staff of half dozen people and these people are all groomed up and student comes in and we audit that student to clear and then he walks on out the front door and gets lost in the vast multitude or something like this you see now that is not an optimum condition you may have disagreement with this and youre perfectly welcome to disagree with this because i point it out clearly as simply point of view my struggle has not been to clear people my struggle has been to get people to clear people you see now if we can do that weve got thiswe got it licked weve got this planet licked weve got the biggest breakthrough that has happened on this planetever there has never been comparable breakthroughall rightsuch as we have in our hands right this minute because we are doing that very thing and therefore its tremendous breakthrough so dont adjudicate your judgment as to who is clearable on the basis of somebody is in rudiments and havingness section see see dont go off to that degree hes in rudiments and havingnesses because he cant audit anybody well enough to receive auditing yet got the idea or hes working up till he can we dont have any unauditable cases here from standpoint of clearing now does that open your minds up little bit on this audience mmhm there isnt one in the place not one theres some dirty needles there are some people that have little difficulty to stay insession and all those things are curable by the very things which youre being taught that is to say you can give them some rudiments and havingness sessions and you can give them some prepchecking sessions and you can pull their overts and there goes their dirty needle and you can straighten them out and then you can take them right on through and find their goal now thatsthats the truth of the case dont you see you actually are not being subjected to inauditable cases and you arent now getting your point of view then straightened out just on this how bad off does person have to be to be unauditable how bad off is he well its pretty bad its pretty bad now ill tell you what makes them unauditable its how many overts they are secretly committing during the period of auditing thats factor now if you have got somebody so poorly under your thumb as an auditor see his control factor in the session poor and goes out and goes this you dont have them show up for sessions by reason of the fact that theyre dead drunk or in court or something like this dont you see there are lot of things getting in the road of your auditing all the time you see well thats what makes them unauditable more than anything else or he keeps coming into session with dirty needle you clean it up today and he comes in tomorrow and so forth you see you just cant now the person who can be cleaned up and who can somehow be bludgeoned into keeping his snoot clean long enough for you to read his needle see all rightthat is the lowest level of auditability now below that level you have the fellow who wont tell you who will never give any of his overts up who will not cooperate with you or be frank with you and from that point on there it all is i mean right on down to the fact that he cant talk at all see fromfor our purposes the communication level at which auditability ceases is where the person will not talk to the auditor frankly see now understand an auditors got lots of tricks and he can force lot of people to talk to him and he can force them under control and dire warnings you come in here just one more morning with that many overts the night before and ill pick up this emeteri wont audit you tomorrowill just pick up this emeter and break it over your head do you understand then youll owe for an emeter see got the idea when you go home tonight walk only on the left side of the street dont say word to your wife go to bed quietly dont have any fight this morning at breakfast because im not going to spend another two hours cleaning up your breakfast quarrel now keep it easy now and well have you through the knothole see you know i mean you could be that tough but that person that you could do that with that that would work on you see hes still in this band of auditabilitythe person that can be almost bludgeoned into giving up his withholds oh youauditor has lots of tricks this way well im willing to sit here the rest of the night theres the read wheres the overt im willing to sit here the rest of the night until you tell but are you just fold up the emeter and sit back in your chair yeah youve got all kinds of forcing tricks but you see theres band of people on which this doesnt work below that is only the people that you cant force to give up any overts you cant force them to be frank with you you know just cant make it any way you can possibly think of comes in here needle going bangbangbangbangbang bangbangbangbangbangbang bangbangbangbangbangbangbangand you say what have you done nothing what crimes have you committed in the last 24 hours nothing try any trick in the trade i havent done thing oh im telling you the truth ive always told you the truth see now were getting down now whether that personality is psychotic or neurotic or badly bent or anything else we couldnt care less see the personality is fact see we dont care what classifications or labels gets assigned to the personality we cant break through to smooth this case out enough now it isnt that our meter wont read you see thats not actuallythat would be on the apparent surface of it the debarring factor of course that makes it impossible too but its actually that this guys not going to sit still long enough and hes got so many curves on the line that youre never even going to clean up one goal look if you cant get him to talk to you how are you ever going to get any rudiments in or anything else you see regardless of whether you were auditing him on meter or not if you were to just lay meter aside and try to audit him up the line on the something or other youd just get pack of lies and of course the meterat the end of the session youd have to clean everything up at the end of session you see itd be mess so itthat person you see goes down into this other category and youre now down into the cch band now we call him unauditable for purposes of clearing but he is preparable almost anybody if theyre not dead and can talk is preparablealmost anybody that will be one of the great studies of tomorrow seethat isnt necessarily you study it today at all i was doing some work on it year or two ago i was thinking well how do you get whole institution of peoplepull the psychiatrist off their neckhow do you get whole institution of people tosome of them come through it you know i was thinking about well its rest and some food and give them some large objects that they can sit around in courtyards and just look at you seegood stable data other trickery of this particular character but you see they cant be audited but they might be prepared for auditing now lets take another level of extremity of prepared for auditing this fellow has cut artery and is pumping what gallonage he has in gore over the local pavement now he is not at that moment auditable you see by the time you had cleared the auditing command you see he has more fluid to pump through the blood system now now there is comparison between that as an immediate emergency action and preparing somebody so he can be audited see well naturally the thing to do is to put tourniquet on it and bandage him up somehow or another and square him around and get the emergency off of the situation and then you can probably audit himand undoubtedly should to get nice clean healing of such wound but youre going to find that on broader sense lot of human beings come into this categorya lot of them theyre quite few theres betsy ann who has migraine headaches and who wont talk to the auditor and who doesnt want to listen to anything about scientology doesnt want to hear about it and yap yap yap yap yap yap and is very angry with her husband all the time becausebecause he goes off with those scientologists and so forth and he is interested in that and he dontand so forth andisnt it terrible and so forth and theyre bunch of raaaaa and raauwraauw raaaruw and raauw and so onand my migraine headache is killing and yap yap yap yap yap yap you see and finally the husband comes around to you and says well look why cant you audit her well hes asking you to look down the long road you know cchs or maybe even just rest you seesomething of this sort now theres some fellow who has had the latest psychiatric operation they take an icecream scoop and go in through hole in the top of the skull you see and empty the gray matter out and so forth and hes lost all of his coordination he cant do anything and he cant talk and he cant do this well hes not necessarily throwawaynot necessarily you might be able to by cchs and other drills andbut even more fundamentally just by letting him recuperate bit and so forth he might get up to point where he could communicate to you somewhat theres fellow lying in coma hes cch case you can generally pull them through that you see you got all kinds of these cases down there theyreyou might say theyre not immediately auditable they are preparable for auditing now dont forget this that that fellows going to kick the bucketthe unauditable casesooner or later and hes going to pick up another body sooner or later you see and you catch him up the track somewhere so hes still not all the way goneproviding the technology is still there see thats the little question mark on that fact now i wouldnt spend any more time on any of the unauditable casesnow lets get back to some very factual facts herespend any more time on an unauditable case than is necessary to put them into state of finding their goal and listing it out now with some case thats five yearsthats five years of rehabilitation see manual operating with weaving or something you know and with somebody else thats five hours of prepchecking see its that variable there is case that cant be reached except the case that isnt there and will never hear of it now if the case is never there and will never hear of scientology yes he comes into the absolute that is theoretical absolute dont you see hes way out of sight see youre never going to lay your hands on him but to some degree others are preparable and some are just auditable you just sit down andwell you got banging needle and you sayuse some of your trickery you say now lets see gracie ann what question would be the most nerveracking question that i could think of betsy ann well am i virgin well are you virgin oh of course yes hahahaha oh yes yeah i sure am now you really get rock slam see and you say all right betsy ann now lets level with it well i cantcant talk to you about it you know well youve ended the session you say well when you come back to see tomorrow i want you to have made up your mind whether or not the withhold which you have there is worth going the next 200 trillion years in misery for and she comes back in and you say all right now betsy ann how about this question you didnt want to ask you well she said theres bill and joe and pete and tom and dick so on and so on and the priest in the village and so forth and the needle quiets down the needle quiets down you run little bit of ow and the bank stops shifting around and you say all right give list of your goals you got the idea whatever trickery whatever duress that is put on her is justified by those means thats safe thats it thats up to you to get the fellow or the girl to talk to you thats the case thats the lowest rung of case you probably will be having too much to do with now if you take somebody who is habitual drunk and he goes out and robs service stations every night to pay for his liquor every morning and hes doing this and hes doing that and hes doing something or other and he runs up five overts for every one you pull off dont you see his level of responsibility is just horrible and he cant seem to stay with it as far as youre concernedhe keeps giving you all kinds of trouble and so forth well please recognize youre dealing with an unauditable case like the case needs aneeds tremendous amount of therapy of some kind you probably need stockade man you know and turn the key on him and let him sit over in the corner under the sorrel brush and think it over for few days on water about the time when the dts are ready to kill him off say well its horrible what reactive bank can do you know slip it to him but it doesnt come under the heading so much of auditing you can spend fantastic quantities of time preparing case that is almost unpreparable and your heart will only get broken by that case see hes apparently auditable he actually isnt auditable you have to make up your mind about this see you cant force him into groove oh the case that can be forced into groove any way you can do it is of course auditable but this fellow cant really be forced into groove he cant really be made to go into session as far as youre concerned and so forth recognize that at this particular moment we dont have the tools of therapy necessary to handle such case which is possibly stockade and bottle of water you know and if we were to put him in the backyard and chain him to tree for few days even if hes chronic alcoholic do you know that neighborsneighbors being what they aretheyd probably complain therefore the littlest good to the fewest number of dynamics frankly the auditability of people depends in large measure on the sphere of influence of the scientologist see and when his sphere of influence is big enough thatall of them become auditable see heres grandma and shes going nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah at the family and that sort of thing and shes raising hell with them she holds all the purse strings tells them they cant do this and all that sort of thing and so forth and well right now there wouldnt be thing you could do about it but in another age you possibly could say grandma why the hell dont you get off your overts you know and shed say this is scientologist talking to i had better start singing you get the idea thats what reputation will do for you now not advocating rough stuff or anything like that with regard to such people im just trying to make it clear to you that youve got wonderful gift in your hands and you start spending five years trying to set up an alcoholic simply because his brother has million gabutnicks all of the people you could have cleared in five years remain unclear thats interesting isnt it and probably at the end of the game because your sphere of influence isnt as great as it should have been because you werent in there creating it you wont have even cleared this guys brother seenot him either i can see it now so youve got your sphere of action that would do the world the most good is the auditable casethe sphere of the auditable casewho can be audited gosh that goes down pretty far i could pull some people in off the street that would make you blink on the subject of whether they were auditable or not and id say person is perfectly auditable go on and audit one day girl comes ina girl comes in walks up to suzie and she was sitting at the registrars desk in phoenix arizonamany many many years agoand says to suzie something on the order of i want ron to audit and suzie says something or other something or other and take it in matter of course and starts to write the girls name down and says all right whats your name you know ill at least put her through the formalities here and the girl said well what is my name i think she even sat there trying to invent some names for herself or trying to guess at it she didnt have clue manshe didnt have clue and i think i gave her two sessionsan houroh something like an hour and half and something like an hour and threequarters life straightened out she went out and got married shes still around memory came back everythings fine obviously unauditable couldnt think of her name couldnt talk couldnt sit still on the run didnt know who she wasstrictly spinbin stuff dont you see but the difference was that she was perfectly willing to answer the auditors questions she was still in communication and although for while that needle might have been slamming around on the meter it calmed down pretty fast dont you see so do you get the difference here she was auditable strictly spinbin stuffyou know now psychiatrist would have said this is very sick neurotic girl yes she was she had compulsion to turn into prostitute in order to get even with her parents who were presbyterians she had compulsion to she was making good job of it too but see by all the textbooks this is spinbin case and by our textbooks she was quite auditable another girl because she had been in an institution came in and saw another registrar one time sheshad an institutional history long as your arm the registrar says well the person isnt processablecouldnt be look at the history you know out of this institution into that institution and here and there and the other place and wow see she was even rather gruesomelooking character and i said well idi better see about this and i didnt audit her by the way but i wanted to see whether or not she was auditable so i had her come in and put mockups in various corners of the room hold them therevarious kinds of mockups and hold them there stably and she could mock up anything and put it there and it would stay there just as it was and move it around perfectly in control of her mental pictures interesting huh quite auditable she got audited and away we go another girl comes in nice family everything is fine background beautiful all polished up so forthbeautiful parents very pretty shes well dressedshes this shes that shes the other thing auggggggggg shouldnt happen to an auditor shes got one of these automatically shifting banks she cant sit still one moment or the other one minute to the next she cant answer questions you say did you eat soup for lunch and she says hitlers good you know unauditable without terrific amount of rest and preparation and everything else and so proved to be you see it isnt what life has labeled them see now furthermore it really doesnt much matter how buggy they sound they could sound awful awful awful spinny and still be quite auditable the difference i suppose is this the fellow knows he can get better or that theres some hope or he should take crack at it and the other fellow who was unauditable knows there isnt any hope and there isnt any reason to take crack at it and you couldnt get better anyhow see i suppose that would be the handiest little rule of thumb by which to judge these two thingsjust fast like that fellow knows you cant get any better knows he isnt any better knows hes absolutely right in life and its everything that has been done to him you add all these things in dont you see he knows its everybody elses fault but you cant do anything to him that would ever make anything of it better and so forth thinks hes being totally sincere about itknows that any efforts to help anybody are based on trickery quackery i could run you off whole lot of this stuff but youve heard this in part or in full many times well you try to get that guy on the emeter and try to get him to talk and you cant read the needle and you cant do this and you cant do that but on the other hand you still might be able to straighten him out and change his mind dont you see such ease youd have to find out now its you who are the judge of this now it doesnt matter how buggy they sound to you on some of their ideas they can come around to you and say throgmagog is going to tip over the empire state building at any minute and i worry all the time because i own some stock in american tel tel and you wonder what the devil this has got to do with anything well some people can have nutty idea and know its nutty and other people have nutty idea and they dont know its nutty do you understand that how persons goal could make them sound utterly batty whereas theyre quite auditable its just goal see to keep buildings from falling down you see lets say thats the persons goal and the person is always found with their hand up against the side of the building keeping buildings from falling down you know police would lock them up you put them on an emeter theyre quite auditable so we get down to just this one criterion are people auditable well how much preparatory auditing should you do well to make them auditable on goals processes and thats the full answer now you can sit on somebodys chest that is doing some of the wildest things and still find their goal but i wouldnt make it any tougher on myself than i had to because lookahere finding goal is terrific stress and strain on the pc now nulling by mid ruds makes them much better makes them feel better is much calmer procedure and that sort of thing but theyve got to answer your questions and if you had pc who had sporadically dirty needles and wouldnt communicate with you and that sort of thing and youve tried to do something with and you get four goals nulled in threehour session you knowhahahahaoh next day you get two youre missing withholds all over the place and so forth i guarantee you about the third day youll get none see thatsthat is hitting it too early person is not really sufficiently insession to have goals process run on them see these are things which you have to develop judgment about i could lay you down lot of rules of thumb and so forth but the best way that youll learn is to do just exactly what you will do regardless of what i tell you here one of these fine days why youll be sitting there and somebody says oh saint hill graduate geewhiz haha well ill pay you an awful lot in order to find my goal and ive always wanted to have my goal found and so forth and you say well ii guess so yes all right fine and so forth and you say well i have to really do little bit of preparatory well ino the only condition under which ill be audited is if you find my goal right away without wasting any time on this other stuff you see because im really very hightoned person and youll be pulled in you say you wont but this will happen to you all of you sooner or later youve got your list of goals and you start down at the top to catchto catch catfish ahh its null ii guess youre in for it man because this will get worse not better because the pc is never as calm as he is at the beginning he gets less calm as he goes on now if theres anything wrong with the case at the beginning its going to be multiplied before you get to the end oh well that will be up to you but i want to tell you this about clearing there isnt anything wrong with anybody except hes upped himself basic purpose of some kind or other for reasons he has not nono reason to it and there it sits and then when this is disobeyed and so on then its all blocked off and then you get bank developed and then bunch of other purposes that he doesnt want get hooked up onto this so he does those and then pretty soon he doesnt know who he is and he picks up body and here we go you see and then he gets all kinds of thisas and thatas and the other things and he is indecisional and he is upset about this and hes upset about that well now look how you going to audit it well how you going to audit it with lick and promise little old light process im appalled at our impudence i am you know when i look at the tightrope walk that it takes to get somebody through to clear see when i look at it from research viewpoint its absolutely impossible to have ever found tightrope see you couldnt find that tightrope in all those grand canyons for you didnt even know what canyon you were trying to cross man and yet it works out very simple and theres really nothing to it youve got yourself ayou got yourself an action here like trying to chip away at mount rushmore with small boy scout hatchet and after youve been slugging at it for few hundred years you see why youve made slight dentinches deep now theres doubt but that we could do things nobody else could do we could bring about cessation of aches and pains and straighten people out and run grief charges and do all kinds of things this is all quite remarkable but when you look at it in comparison it doesnt compare in the first place almost anything you did to somebody was sooner or later going to cave in again he either had by some confidence engendered in himselfcould get gradient scale of peeling it off if he wasnt too solidly in the gpm and he could blow clear of that and park that over there someplace and he could live quite happily with it that was clear at any time this guy had the threat of this thing coming in on him again see so he lived just little bit of nervy life because he must have known thisinstinctively he must have known something of this he knew it wasnt all quite gone now when you start at itpeeling it down from the top like from where could you communicate to head thank you from where could you communicate to head his goal by the way is never to communicate to anyoneyou have this chance factor floating through all of your processing this chance factor is there all the time lord only knows what it will be only you and complete assessment will be able to tell and itll be some chance factor and that factor could be for you or that factor could be agin but in any event that factor is the monitoring factor of any results that you get all right we get this girl and we say how could you help your father and how could your father help you and how could you help your father and how could your father help you and we eventually find to our horror that her goal is to destroy all families now how the devil could we ever have opened that up at all or got anyplace with lesser process weird part of it is that we did but per hour of processing theres comparison like goals processing you sit down and you get this persons basic purpose and then youthe bank starts falling apart and all these other things take place and they clear and you havent got any bank there to go back on the track or to go up into the future or to be connected with or not connected with and its gone well that is infinitely desirable but the change that it makes in an individual is best viewed by you by the amount of havoc wrong goal found but not run can make on case now here is your index take anybody who has had wrong goal found now understand not run see this personthey had wrong goal found and just sit down with meter anddont do an instructors checkjust handle that goal as you would handle the to be tiger drill see see whatever the goal wasand just clean it that way and check with your pc and make sure that you clean it until all sensation and pain has gone off of it see that as an additional little actionjust make sure theres more pain left on that thing clean it very carefully just with drill with also attention to pain and you will strangely enough see more case gain than you have seen for some time well you say look to the degree it must have caved him in to have found the wrong goal youre looking in the wrong barrel thats what i thought the first time and then i finally got my wits wrapped around it and found out what was happening because it was fantastic just that you had found wrong goal on this personthat must have caved him in it must have ruined him because look at all the good it did to clean it up its not the finding of the goal the finding of the goal did keyin of what was there anyhow and it could have keyed in at any time and possibly has but you just pick it up as found goal and of course you clean up the whole goal in other words you call his attention to this goal hes become familiarized with this goal now by its suppressions invalidations and that sort of thing hes looked at it and hes confronted it and to large degree its blown and it has further effect on him which leads you to one of the wildest problems intensives you ever wanted to run and i dont know that anybody will ever run this problems intensive but they might and its one of the steps of finding goal you say to person all right write out all the problems that youve had in this lifetime that you want to do something about just write out list of these see he gives you list of 60 70 something like that and you say all right now what decision you can call it anything you want to would have solved and you take problem 1 see what decision would have solved problem 2 see what decision what decision you keep writing down this list of decisions now you dont date them theyre really goals you see you dont date them and you just go back to the beginning of them and you dust it off lightly with the to be tiger drill see to never drink again you see that was one of the thingsthat the decision would have solved that problem see to never drink again all right you say to never drink again you get read has that decision been invalidated you know go right on down through your to be tiger drill dont you see and clean up that whole lot and man that guy will have thought he will have had more processing than hundred and ninetynine hours of anything else you could have run on him except goals processing itself makes an interesting problems intensive doesnt it see its just little chunk of doing goals list and yet it works out into complete problems intensive and youll be utterly flabbergasted at the amount of relief the character will get off this itll look completely phenomenal to the person the reason you possibly wont do thisalthough this may turn out sooner or later i shouldnt condemn it in advancei should announce it to you of what it is its just discovery of how to run problems intensive and i shouldnt further evaluate it because you might be able to do this on somebody and find out mysteriously that they will go into session now and that they become auditable whereas they were only partially auditable before so it might have more value than i have experimented with at this moment but im just giving you the value of decisionthe value of goal just the value of goal with the mid ruds cleared on it on the nulling by mid ruds technique gives you more cessation of somatic more release and advance of case look these arent even the guys goals seetheyre nothing hes given you list of 60 what decision was oh hes made all these decisions at sometime or anotheryou just clear them up just asis nothing fancy about itpocketapocketapocketa well how long might it take you threehour session something like that the guys liable to come out at the other end of this session saying wow you know and just flying you know god hes longer an alcoholic and he doesnt beat his wife and you know things are marvelous gosh how did this ever happen to him well thats simply the value of decision because what is the reactive bank then but the basic decision or the basic postulate or the basic purpose which has on top of it then concatenation of purposesall of which are locks on the basic purpose every timethis is horriblebut every time he makes decision he puts new lock on the case wonderful way to do oneself in isnt it and he did it gratuitously to himself too nobody twisted his beams to make him do it yeah he will postulate anyhow this action might serve very well as tremendous training drill before somebody did 3ga but actually its simpler unless you had some remarkable difficulty with the pc that made him unauditable basically it is simpler just to get somebody to list 850 goals straighten out the list at the other end and start nulling do you see that fact has such value that it makes this other very important discovery kind of null and void thats an unhappy fact isnt it when you get down and look at it make this tremendous thing you know you canweve just made discovery whereby we snap our fingers to the right and left and say abracadabra and spaceship appears you see well thats nothing because its standing in the shadow of discovery whereby all we had to do was go whoooo and planet appeared its sort of dwarfed but theresthere is something that if you wanted to get reality on the somatic value and other values of cleaning up somebodys goals or decisionsyou want to get reality on just what that will do for caseyou could do that little drill and youveand waaaah wow this is nothing compared to what clearing is going to do but wow what would it do itll do lot do lot for case now possibly it will turn out suddenly to have some interesting value of its own or beyou can expect sooner or later that we may suddenly have alcoholics you do this with or something like that you know something might come up but theres clearing and there isnt any substitute for clearing and if you can clear people theres reason to do anything but clear people because it makes all that difference and its all right to say well soandso and suchandsuch and we ought to really prepcheck them lot and we ought to do this and ought to do that but frankly if theyre auditable and if theyve been prepchecked up into auditability theres certainly reason to go on prepchecking them the persons sitting there and theyre being good as pc and the needle stays clean and well what more do you want man well i always say the fellowthat this fellow isnt auditable i can hear this argument going on someplace you know this fellow isnt auditable why he just talks all the time about committing suicide so he talks about committing suicide whats that got to do with clearing him nothing he just made the decision too many times and he cant stop deciding it thats all he never is going to commit suicide while youre trying to find his goal hell be too curious to find out what it is you see actually the out of session behavior of the individual has nothing to do with it its only the insession behavior of the pc in which youre interested and if that insession behavior is adequate to clearingwhich is running down goals list and getting his goal and getting him to list the four lines on it and blow it clearwell there isnt any reason whatsoever why you should do it theres reason under the sun because if theres anything wrong with his morality or his ethical level or something like that it isnt going to straighten out by putting him in jail but it is going to straighten out by clearing him so heres the answer to this situation i hope to some slight degree ive solved for you perhaps some ethical problems with regard to this matter and cleared your mind up on who do you clear audience mmhm yes female voice yes very much so and when should you start clearing audience mmhm what we have in actuality is technique which is sufficiently powerful and sufficiently big and overwhelming that it actually bit defies graspa bit defies description its little bit hard to realize youre there you know its little bit hard to realize its there or it can be done and you really dont start realizing it until you clear somebody or until you yourself find your goal and suddenly say whoowhoowhawhawhats this whats this what happened ah look what we got our paws on now but frankly ever since this hashas been squared away so that thenow that youre finding some goals in nulling by mid ruds i was waiting until that proved itself out that wayand these other things theresthe lids off there is limit on the forward road believe there is nothing we are at that point of the crossroads for which we have been heading for long time and we were right there and we have arrived its going to take you long time to realize it perhaps its going to take other people in scientology long time to realize it but to grasp exactly what this means for this planet takes quite little bit of looking atquite little bit of looking at threequarters of asia became civilized just because few guys hoped that somebody might sooner or later be able to do it hey threequarters of asia just because somebody hoped they could do it you know they never did it well what are you sitting with now and what do you suppose is going to happen from here thats why i say its just little bit hard to confront this thing and of course youre in there it looks simple to you and so forth it is youre learning to audit this and that it was only last night in tv demonstrationyou saw how easy it was and looking at all that well i invite you just to lift your head just little bit from the technical fact and look at the broad implication of what has happened here this summer of 1962 its quite interesting may you never be the same again okay well i didnt mean to get too serious about the thing but itive been just kind of sitting looking at it lately and saying well ronnie ione guy suddenly got the idea it could be done and started operation bootstrap and some other guys came along and they started working on it and so forth and always in the past we have had the beautiful dream that the messiah comes down with sandals of gold with neon sign around his skulland he blows on this silver trumpet see and everybodys clear and that wasnt what happened at all there was some guy who was just guy and he started figuring and some other guys started to work on it and everybody was working on it and so forthand it happened perhaps its all out of scheduled from the archangels and perhaps it isnt on the blotter in the galactic council but it is happening and it didnt have to wait for the second coming of who was itbaal or whoever it was okay thank you
