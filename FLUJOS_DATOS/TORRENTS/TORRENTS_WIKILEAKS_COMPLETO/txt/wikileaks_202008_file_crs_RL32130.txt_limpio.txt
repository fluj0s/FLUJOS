nuclear weapon initiatives lowyield rd advanced concepts earth penetrators test readiness summary the bush administration completed its congressionallymandated nuclear posture review in december 2001 the review led to major changes in us nuclear policy it found that the cold war relationship with russia was very inappropriate and that this nation must be able to deal with new threats it planned to retain cold warera nuclear weapons which would suffice for many contingencies though at reduced numbers to complement these weapons so as to improve us ability to deal with new more dispersed threats in various countries the administration sought to explore additional nuclear capabilities accordingly the fy2004 request included four nuclear weapon initiatives 1 rescinding the ban that congress imposed in 1993 on rd on lowyield nuclear weapons 2 6 million for the advanced concepts initiative aci to begin certain studies of weaponrelated science and technology 3 15 million to continue study of the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep in which an existing bomb would be converted into weapon able to penetrate into the ground before detonating to improve its ability to destroy buried targets and 4 25 million to enable the united states to conduct nuclear test within 18 months of presidential order to test and for related purposes as compared with the current 2436 month time that was set shortly after the end of the cold war congress acted on these requests in the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 and acted on the latter three in the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations act pl 108 137 for fy2005 the administration requests 90 million for aci 276 million for rnep and 300 million for improving nuclear test readiness these initiatives are controversial supporters claim that the first three initiatives would enhance deterrence thereby reducing the risk of war and that some weapons that might result from the initiatives could enable the united states to destroy key targets in nations that may pose threat critics are concerned that these initiatives would lead to nuclear testing increase the risk of nuclear proliferation and make us use of nuclear weapons more likely regarding enhanced test readiness the administration argues that nuclear testing might be needed for example to check fixes to weapon types with defects and that 24 to 36 months is too long to wait critics are concerned that shortening the time to test could signal us intent to test and that renewed testing could lead to renewed interest in testing by other nations this report provides the policy context for the four initiatives for each it then presents description history fy2004 legislative actions the fy2005 request for all but lowyield rd and issues

test readiness for fy2004 the administration proposed four nuclear weapon initiatives that were small in terms of dollars and immediate impact but that would have large policy ramifications and could lead to major outlays if implemented over time congress considered all of them in the fy2004 national defense authorization act ndaa pl 108136 and considered all but the ban on rd on lowyield weapons which does not involve funding in the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations act ewdaa pl 108137 as well1 for fy2005 the lowyield rd ban was not at issue as congress lifted it in the fy2004 ndaa the administration requested funds for the other three items below rescission of ban on rd on lowyield nuclear weapons fy1994 legislation barred rd that could lead to production of lowyield nuclear weapons the administration proposed rescinding this provision advanced concepts initiative aci for fy2004 the administration requested 150 million for the robust nuclear earth penetrator and 60 million for other aci programs the latter include computer modeling remotely monitoring warheads and controlling their firing systems and studying how to design warheads with specific radiation outputs and other effects the fy2005 request is 276 million for the earth penetrator and 90 million for aci robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep the request would continue study of modifying an existing weapon to penetrate completely into the ground before detonating increasing its ability to destroy buried targets nuclear test readiness test readiness posture is the maximum time between presidential order to conduct nuclear test and the test itself since 1996 the us posture has been 24 to 36 months for fy2004 the administration requested 249 million to maintain this posture for which at least 150 million is needed and to begin changing it to 18 months the fy2005 request is 300 million 1 this report does not consider nucleararmed missile defense interceptors the administration requested funds for them for fy2004 and the senate passed by voice vote with debate an amendment by senators levin feinstein and stevens to bar use of fy2004 funds for work on such interceptors us congress congressional record may 21 2003 s6836 crs2 these initiatives are controversial many on both sides of the issue see them as gateway to new weapons they collectively give new impetus to the decadeslong debate over the role of nuclear weapons in promoting us security the four initiatives will likely be at issue for some years to come because they could lead to increased requests in the future while it costs nothing to lift the ban on lowyield rd doing so would presumably lead to lowyield rd that would have cost the fy2004 request for aci was 60 million but there were calls to increase its funding substantially the fy2004 rnep request was 150 million to continue study but after the study ends in fy2006 the request would grow sharply if congress and the administration decide to develop the weapon nnsa estimates that it would cost 83 million over three years to implement an 18month test readiness posture and 25 million to 30 million year to sustain it thereafter compared to the 10 million or so spent each year to maintain the current 24 to 36 month posture2 this report discusses these initiatives and the issues they raise this section presents background and key arguments subsequent sections provide history and issues for congress for each initiative the report is designed for those who want detailed introduction to the debate including its history those seeking arguments and counterarguments and those looking for answers to specific questions it will track congressional and executive actions on these initiatives through regular updates as developments warrant the broader context for the four initiatives during the cold war the focus of us nuclear policy was deterring or retaliating in response to soviet nuclear attack us nuclear forces were designed and sized for that contingency other contingencies in which the united states might have used nuclear weapons were much more remote and would have required far fewer nuclear weapons than responding to soviet attack defense planners dealt with them but as lesser included cases not requiring new weapons the end of the cold war led to reduction of the us nuclear weapons development effort the first bush administration halted nuclear testing except for safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile canceled weapons that were under development and withdrew most us battlefield nuclear weapons numbers of personnel in the nuclear weapons complex the facilities managed by the department of energy doe to develop test manufacture and maintain nuclear weapons dropped sharply at congressional direction the united states began moratorium on nuclear testing in october 1992 that is still in effect and worked to negotiate the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt ban on all nuclear explosions before the moratorium the united states conducted nuclear tests on an ongoing basis with the end of testing the clinton administration changed the test readiness posture to 24 to 36 months 2 us department of energy national nuclear security administration report to congress nuclear test readiness april 2003 p 1 crs3 the george w bush administration came into office with different stance on nuclear weapons policy which the september 11 attacks stiffened it delivered nuclear posture review npr to congress in december 20013 this classified study mandated by legislation4 spelled out the administrations views on the role of nuclear weapons strategic relationship with russia based on the threat of mutual annihilation had become very inappropriate5 according to jd crouch assistant secretary of defense for international security policy and the threat had become more diffuse the npr focused on nuclear capabilities deemed needed for various contingencies rather than mainly to counter the soviet nuclear threat that is the administration perceived wider range of possible uses for nuclear weapons quite different than the ussoviet nuclear war scenarios that dominated cold war strategy crouch said the capabilitiesbased approach argues that there may be multiple contingencies and new threats that we have to deal with were focusing on how we will fight not who or when6 to support this approach the npr envisioned new triad strike forces nuclear and nonnuclear defenses and an infrastructure better able to respond to military needs tied together by command and control intelligence and planning the goal was to assure allies and friends that the united states had credible nonnuclear and nuclear response options dissuade competitors through diverse portfolio of capabilities that denies payoff from competition deter aggressors and defeat enemies7 the npr called for retaining the capability to deter or respond to variety of contingencies and for retaining cold warera nuclear weapons at lower levels to do so with the demise of the soviet union and the september 11 attacks subset of targets terroristrelated facilities some of which had existed for decades assumed greater prominence one example is hardened and deeply buried facilities rogue and many other states have built such facilities which might house leaders and key communications facilities another example is facilities some deeply buried others not for producing or storing weapons of mass destruction wmd the end of the cold war also led to changed constraints on use of nuclear weapons in nuclear war with the soviet union assuring the immediate destruction of thousands of targets of all sorts would have been critical to national survival 3 for further information on

defense special briefing on the nuclear posture review january 9 2002 crs4 reducing fallout and collateral damage or damage to people and things that were not the intended targets was secondary in importance to achieving required probabilities of damage on targets warheads were typically designed to achieve that primary goal now nuclear weapons to hold at risk specific limited targets in rogue states in credible manner are judged to need several characteristics they would need to be able to counter threats that rogue states might pose such as hard and deeply buried facilities or production facilities for wmd weapons to attack buried facilities would have different characteristics than weapons to defeat chemical and biological agents they would be better able to minimize not eliminate collateral damage consistent with military objectives while this has long been goal of us nuclear policy earth penetration and increased accuracy sharply reduce the yield needed to destroy target making it more feasible to attain that goal they would need to be available readily if not immediately because the specific threat might become known with little warning they could be few in number while an allout nuclear attack on the soviet union would have struck thousands of targets the option of an attack on rogue state might involve handful of targets according to the national nuclear security administration nnsa8 the administration believes the broader range of capabilities of nuclear stockpile with these weapons will serve as more credible and hence more effective deterrent than the cold war stockpile we have today this more effective deterrent will make the use of nuclear weapons less likely9 some critics believe that the only use for nuclear weapons should be to deter and if necessary respond to the use of nuclear weapons against the united states10 they oppose attempts to develop nuclear weapons with lower yield and reduced collateral damage as blurring the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons even us use of lowyield atomic bomb they assert would result in firestorm of protest and worldwide opprobrium 8 nnsa is semiautonomous agency within the department of energy doe that has managed the nuclear weapons complex since 2001 this complex is composed of laboratories manufacturing plants and test site that design develop manufacture maintain and dismantle nuclear weapons and that also used to conduct nuclear explosions to test them before 2001 doe managed this complex directly through its office of defense programs 9 comments provided to the author by the national nuclear security administration august 18 2003 10 see for example union of concerned scientists global security nuclear weapons httpwwwucsusaorgglobal_securitynuclear_weaponsindexcfmpageid30 crs5 further they believe that the us nuclear arsenal has long been sufficient against range of threats hardened and deeply buried targets hdbts for example have existed for decades yet the first bush administration halted work on nuclear weapons then under development and halted nuclear testing except for safety and reliability effectively bringing work on new weapon types to close presumably that administration would not have taken these steps had it envisioned need for new weapon types the united states needs the active support of the entire international community in the war against terrorism many observers believe assistance may take many forms providing information to the cia on suspicious individuals safeguarding shipping containers securing radioactive material or closing bank accounts of suspected terrorists other nations will be more likely to cooperate on issues important to the united states it is argued if the united states cooperates with other nations on issues important to them one such issue is nuclear nonproliferation the united states pledged in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty article vi to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament in addition as an inducement in securing international support for extending the treaty indefinitely the united states and other nuclear weapon states pledged in 1995 to support the ctbt11 they made similar statement at the 2000 npt review conference12 critics maintain that the administrations nuclear initiatives are at odds with these pledges they argue that developing new or modified weapons runs counter to the npt pledge and that such weapons will ultimately require nuclear testing to ensure that they work reducing the time to conduct nuclear test supports future decision to test and to the critics implies an intent to test these positions may harm us security by undermining efforts to make worldwide cooperation on nonproliferation of nuclear and other wmd more effective even if some steps might be innocuous by themselves critics believe that many around the world will see the confluence of them as pieces of single policy and will infer that the united states is now much more willing to consider using nuclear weapons as an example of international concern over the new us policies the foreign ministers of the new agenda coalition brazil egypt ireland mexico new zealand south africa and sweden issued statement that said in part 4 the ministers stressed that each article of the npt is binding on the respective states parties at all times and in all circumstances 11 for further information on this treaty including subsequent senate action see crs issue brief ib92099 nuclear weapons comprehensive test ban treaty crs report 971007 nuclear testing and comprehensive test ban chronology starting

united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america to the 2000 npt review conference may 1 2000 available at httpwwwceiporgfilesprojectsnppresourcesnpt2000p5htm crs6 7 the ministers reiterated their deep concern at emerging approaches to the broader role of nuclear weapons as part of security strategies including rationalizations for the use of and the development of new types of nuclear weapons13 these positions may undermine us security critics fear by spurring nations that might be targets of us nuclear attack to step up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of the three axis of evil nations iraq the first target of us attack did not have nuclear weapons as far as is currently known having nuclear weapons to deter the united states may be consideration for north korea and iran both of which apparently have active programs to produce fissile material north korea has stated that it has several nuclear weapons while iran has declared that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes few in the united states believe that assertion even in military terms critics argue nuclear use would offer marginal to negative value deeply buried targets could be defeated not necessarily destroyed with conventional weapons destruction of entrances and air shafts or demolition by special forces the effectiveness of lowyield nuclear weapons for destroying biological or chemical agents is uncertain as discussed below and intelligence might be unable to locate targets in underground complexes as recent efforts to find iraqi wmd showed rendering nuclear weapons of any yield of little use nations could counter earth penetrators by burying facilities more deeply even lowyield or earth penetrating weapons would throw large amount of radioactive debris into the atmosphere substituting radioactive materials for biological or chemical agents may offer little advantage to the local population or us troops rd on lowyield nuclear weapons description provision in the fy1994 national defense authorization act barred rd that could lead to production by the united states of nuclear weapon of less than 5 kilotons kt14 that had not entered production by november 1993 in its fy2004 legislative proposals the administration asked congress to rescind this provision on grounds that it undercut us ability both to explore technical options that could deter or respond to emerging threats and to revitalize the nuclear weapons enterprise this provision is often referred to as the sprattfurse provision after its legislative authors representatives john spratt jr and elizabeth furse or as the plywd provision for precision lowyield weapon design the armed services committees considered the proposed rescission the appropriations committees did not do so because it involved money the fy2004 ndaa section 3116 repealed the sprattfurse provision but 1 made clear that the repeal did not 13 deep concern at the lack of progress declaration issued by the foreign ministers of the new agenda coalition united nations headquarters new york 23 september 2003 httpwwwacronymorgukdocs0309doc20htm 14 one kiloton is equivalent to the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt the yield of the hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons crs7 authorize the testing acquisition or deployment of lowyield nuclear weapon and 2 barred the secretary of energy from beginning engineering development or subsequent phases of work on lowyield weapon without specific congressional authorization with the provision lifted there is parallel request for fy2005 technical background military utility of 5kt weapons the debate over the sprattfurse provision treated 5 kt as critical because that was the threshold in the law those who would lift the ban argued that the ban made it difficult to train weapon designers and impossible to develop essential new weapons their opponents were concerned that lifting the ban would signal us interest in developing capabilities that would make the use of nuclear weapons more likely yet the threshold was of only slight relevance to the military or the weapons labs because very low yield nuclear weapons have uncertain military utility substantial advances would be needed in the understanding of lowyield weapon effects to assess the military utility and collateral damage of such weapons military utility derives from nuclearweapon effects that are prompt and that can be measured with reasonable precision damage from the blast wave falls into this category fallout and secondary fires eg fuel set afire do not for 500kt weapon the blast effects are highly predictable almost anything on the earths surface over large known area will be destroyed for comparison the hiroshima bomb had yield of 15 kt at the other end of the scale the blast effects of 500 pound conventional bomb are strongly influenced by accuracy height of burst local features etc for example hill or building can block or redirect the blast wave such factors also shape the effects of lowyield nuclear weapon and their influence increases as yield decreases modeling such factors is more complicated than for highyield weapons has been done to much lesser extent and depends more on unknown details such as buildings construction it may be that detailed engineering studies and computer models of the prompt effects of existing lowyield nuclear weapons could provide as much military value as designing new lowyield weapons 1979 report by the office of technology assessment elaborated on the problem of uncertain weapon effects in discussing 1kt terrorist nuclear weapon detonated at ground level in city the highly builtup urban structure in which the weapon is placed will significantly modify the resulting nuclear environment this occurs when the lethal range of effects shrink to such an extent that they are comparable to the size of urban structures it is indeed reasonable to expect that the blast effects of small weapon will be severely influenced by nearby structures having comparable dimensions preliminary calculations have confirmed this in summary the ranges of nuclear effects from lowyield explosion in the confined space of an urban environment will differ significantly from large yield effects but in ways that are very difficult to estimate15 15 us congress office of technology assessment the effects of nuclear war otans continued crs8 if the warsaw pact had invaded western europe during the cold war such uncertainties of lowyield weapons would have been immaterial for some missions an atomic demolition munition could destroy bridge and an artilleryfired atomic projectile could destroy troop concentrations more reliably than conventional munitions and in some situations as last resort to keep frontline troops from being overrun now though extreme accuracy may enable conventional weapons to destroy small targets and massive conventional bombing can attack troop concentrations at the same time this same accuracy may give lowyield nuclear weapons new military missions by enabling them to destroy targets that in the past would have required much larger weapons on the other hand lowyield weapons face uncertainties that render them of questionable value in going after key targets such as buried facilities for which details of the structure and its overlying earth and rock are poorly known this uncertainty increases as yield drops for reasons such as these george miller formerly associate director for defense and nuclear technologies at lawrence livermore national laboratory observed the vast majority of the low yield concepts that would provide substantial reductions in collateral damage have yields greater than 5 kt concepts in the less than 5 kt regime are at an early rd stage16 history through the fy2003 budget cycle the united states has had many lowyield weapons in the stockpile for decades17 in the wake of the 1991 persian gulf war the us military became more interested in them for attacking underground structures one news report stated that penetrating saddams hardened bunkers proved to be one of the most daunting tasks that faced the air force18 in late 1991 the air force reportedly asked alamos national laboratory to study very low yield warhead that could destroy underground bunkers19 1992 lawrence livermore national laboratory journal stated several possibilities for new types of weapons are being evaluated for prototype development these include lowyield earthpenetrating warheads for attacking underground command posts with minimum collateral damage20 doe 15 continued 89 usgpo may 1979 p 4546 16 personal communication august 15 2003 17 thomas dowler and joseph howard iii countering the threat of the wellarmed tyrant

fy1992 which it planned to continue in fy1993 and fy199421 at the same time many in congress and elsewhere sought to restrain us nuclear weapons development legislation mandated us nuclear testing moratorium which started in october 1992 and continues to the present and directed the president to provide plan for achieving multilateral ctbt by september 30 199622 preparations were underway in the in 1993 to begin ctbt negotiations in 1994 the npt review and extension conference which would decide whether to extend the treaty indefinitely was planned for april 1995 some saw testing and weapons development that could lead to testing as unhelpful to these efforts in 1993 the house armed services committee concerned over efforts by doe to study lowyield nuclear weapons included provision barring rd on these weapons in its version of the fy1994 national defense authorization act hr 2401 the committees report stated the committee is aware of recent efforts by the department of energy to perform concept and feasibility studies for designing very low yield nuclear weapons the committee opposes these efforts very low yield nuclear warheads threaten to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear conflict and could thus increase the chances of nuclear weapons use by another nation in addition the committee believes that the development of very low yield nuclear weapons undermines us efforts to discourage nuclear weapons development by other nations and would undercut us efforts to negotiate an extension of the nonproliferation treaty or comprehensive test ban finally the utility of very low yield nuclear weapons is questionable given the increasing effectiveness and availability of precision guided conventional munitions the committee therefore recommends provision sec 3105 that would direct the secretary of energy to discontinue the ongoing concept design work within the departments nuclear weapons laboratories and to refrain from any future feasibility engineering development or production work associated with very low yield nuclear weapons the committee further directs the secretary to work with the president and other interested agencies in discouraging the development of similar weapons in other countries23 the conference report summarized the house position noted that the senate bill had similar provision and stated the senate recedes with an amendment that would clarify that the prohibition applies to activities that could lead to production of new lowyield 21 us department of energy office of chief financial officer fy1994 congressional budget request volume 1 atomic energy defense activities doecr0012 april 1993 p 4546 22 sec 507 of pl 102377 energy and water development appropriations act fy1993 contains these requirements 23 us congress house committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 hrept 103200 washingtongpo 1993 p 427 crs10 weapons while the conferees agree that the provision is intended to prohibit research and development geared toward the production of any lowyield nuclear weapons by the united states the conferees recognize that there are instances where the department of energy may need to conduct research on these types of weapons for other purposes this would include research in the interest of counterproliferation on the designs of lowyield weapons as way to 1 understand others activities including potential terrorist threats 2 provide information for export control activities and 3 understand the potential damage that could be inflicted by the use of these types of weapons in addition the conferees agree that nothing in this section would prohibit the department of energy from performing the research and development necessary for modifications to existing weapons in order to address safety or reliability problems the conferees direct the secretary to work with the president and interested agencies in discouraging the development of similar weapons in other countries24 the final legislation pl 103160 november 30 1993 107 stat 1946 follows sec 3136 prohibition on research and development of lowyield nuclear weapons united states policy it shall be the policy of the united states not to conduct research and development which could lead to the production by the united states of new lowyield nuclear weapon including precision lowyield warhead b limitation the secretary of energy may not conduct or provide for the conduct of research and development which could lead to the production by the united states of lowyield nuclear weapon which as of the date of the enactment of this act has not entered production c effect on other research and development nothing in this section shall prohibit the secretary of energy from conducting or providing for the conduct of research and development necessary 1 to design testing device that has yield of less than five kilotons 2 to modify an existing weapon for the purpose of addressing safety and reliability concerns or 3 to address proliferation concerns d definition in this section the term lowyield nuclear weapon means nuclear weapon that has yield of less than five kilotons 24 us congress committee of conference national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 hrept 103357 usgpo 1993 p 840841 crs11 several years later the office of defense programs asked does general counsel about the legal meaning of this prohibition in memorandum of march 1999 she concluded as follows section 3136 would appear to prohibit the department from taking or supporting any action that could result in producing weapon with yield of less than 5 kilotons unless one of the following four exemptions applies 1 the activities are related to weapon that entered production prior to december 1993 2 the activities are supporting design of testing device 3 the activities are directed to modifying an existing weapon to address safety and reliability concerns or 4 the activities are supporting counterproliferation work as you can see the question of legality on any course of action involving lowyield nuclear weapons is highly fact dependent25 in its report on the fy2001 defense authorization bill s 2549 the senate armed services committee made clear the issue prompting does request to the general counsel and sought to redress that issue legislatively the committee recommends provision that would require the secretaries of defense and energy to assess requirements and options for defeating hardened and deeply buried targets the provision would expressly authorize the department of energy doe to conduct any limited research and development that may be necessary to complete such assessments the committee notes that recent legal interpretation of existing law raised questions regarding whether doe could participate in or otherwise support certain department of defense dod studies and options assessments for defeating hardened and deeply buried targets this provision removes any uncertainty and expressly allows doe to assist the dod with review of these targets and the options for defeating such targets the committee believes that doe should provide information and all other assistance required to help dod make informed decisions on whether 1 to proceed with new method of defeating hardened and deeply buried targets and 2 to seek any necessary modifications to existing law the committee is concerned that the ability to defeat hardened and deeply buried targets will continue to be significant challenge for the foreseeable future26 although the house bill did not include similar provision the conference bill hr 4205 did section 1044 report on the defeat of hardened and deeply buried targets required the secretary of defense in conjunction with the secretary of 25 memorandum from mary anne sullivan general counsel to thomas f gioconda brigadier general usaf principal deputy assistant secretary for military applications office of defense programs statutory prohibition on research and development of low yield nuclear weapons march 19 1999 26 us congress senate committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 srept 106292 106th congress 2nd session usgpo 2000 p 348 349 crs12 energy to conduct study on this topic due by july 1 200127 that section directed that the study review us requirements to defeat such targets and stockpiles of chemical and biological agents and related capabilities review plans to meet the requirements and determine the adequacy of the plans identify potential future hardened and deeply buried targets determine what is needed to defeat them and to defeat stockpiles of chemical and biological agents assess options to defeat such targets and determine the capability and cost of each option section 1044 gave the secretaries authority to conduct any limited research and development that may be necessary to perform those assessments further the conferees believe that doe should provide information and other assistance required to help dod make informed decisions on whether 1 to proceed with new method of defeating hardened and deeply buried targets and 2 to seek any necessary modifications to existing law28 the doddoe report required by section 1044 dated july 2001 contained rationale for lowyield nuclear earth penetrator weapons29 it stressed the problem that hardened and deeply buried targets hdbts posed to the united states our potential adversarys weapons of mass destruction wmd longrange missiles modern air defenses most sophisticated command and control systems national leadership in wartime and variety of tactical arms are increasingly concealed and protected by networks of hard and deeply buried facilities if the united states does not have the means to defeat these facilities and the threatening assets they protect adversaries may perceive that they have sanctuary from which to coerce or attack the united states its allies or its coalition partners with threats much more powerful than in past conflicts p 3 it discussed the potential problem posed by buried facilities containing chemical or biological weapons cbw ordnance employing fragmentation and blast effects will not accomplish this objective destroying agents within munitions or containers and may further worsen the situation by releasing agents into the atmosphere and surrounding environment in some situations there may be need for multiple types of payloads to accomplish several objectives for example in the case of cbw located within hardened facility the goals might be in situ neutralization of the agents plus accessdenial that prevents adversaries from recovering and using

report focused on conventional weapons special operations forces intelligence etc for defeating hdbts it also discussed the potential value of nuclear weapons for this mission especially lowyield penetrators dod and doe have completed initial studies on how existing nuclear weapons can be modified to defeat those hdbts that cannot be held at risk with conventional highexplosive weapons or current nuclear weapons p 4 we also must prepare for those unique and emerging strategic threats that are critical and well protected this will require additional investment in intelligence special weapons and counterwmd capabilities including nuclear weapons p 6 nuclear weapons have unique ability to destroy both agent containers and cbw agents lethality is optimized if the fireball is proximate to the target this requires high accuracy for buried targets it also may require penetrating weapon system given improved accuracy and the ability to penetrate the material layers overlying facility it is possible to employ much loweryield weapon to achieve the needed neutralization the ability to use lower yield would reduce weaponproduced collateral effects the current nuclear weapons

weapons or that another nation was developing in underground facilities wmd that could pose an imminent risk to the united states or that the repeal is in the national security interest of the united states32 before the amendment was debated representatives spratt and weldon subsequently modified it while the 1993 provision barred research and development which could lead to the production by the united states of new lowyield nuclear weapon the modification barred such development but not research and clarified development as follows the term development does not include concept definition studies feasibility studies or detailed engineering design work33 the amendment passed 36253 the senate bill did not have similar provision and the house provision was dropped in conference description of the phases of weapon development is needed to understand the subsequent discussion of legislation on lowyield rd and the other three nuclear initiatives the development of new nuclear weapons proceeds through series of defined phases dod and the atomic energy commission predecessor of doe entered an agreement on march 21 1953 defining these phases as follows phase 1 weapon conception phase 2 program study phase 2a design definition and cost study phase 3 development engineering phase 4 production engineering phase 5 first production phase 6 quantity production and stockpile and phase 7 retirement34 note that phase 2 involves some prototype and subsystem testing as well as paper and computer studies the key dividing line is between phase 2a design definition and phase 3 fullscale development in phase 2a alamos and lawrence livermore national laboratories the two laboratories that design the nuclear explosive components of nuclear weapons would generate one or more designs each for particular warhead personnel from sandia national laboratories which design nonnuclear components of warhead would participate in the two design teams at the end of phase 2a one option and laboratory would be selected new warhead has been designed since the 1980s in phases 3 and 4 which now would occur concurrently the phase 2a design would be turned into detailed design for producible weapon through computer simulation nuclear and nonnuclear testing etc for alterations and modifications of existing weapons those in phase 6 the phase structure above is repeated as the x in phase 6x though with some different names phase 61 concept assessment phase 62 feasibility study and option downselect phase 62a design definition and cost study phase 3 development engineering

background section 3143 of pl 107314 fy2003 national defense authorization act requirements for specific request for new or modified nuclear weapons required doe 1 to have single line item for all funds requested for rd that could lead to us production of new nuclear weapon in phase 1 2 or 2a or modified nuclear weapon in phase 61 62 or 62a or concept work occurring before phase 1 or 61 and 2 to request funds for each weapon activity in phase 3 or 63 or higher as separate line item further the legislation provided clear definition of key term 3 the term new nuclear weapon means nuclear weapon that contains pit or canned subassembly either of which is neither in the nuclear weapons stockpile on the date of the enactment of this act nor b in production as of that date36 while the move from phase 2a or 62a to phase 3 or 63 typically involves large increase in cost requiring each weapon in phase 3 or 63 to have its own line item enhances the visibility of these programs and prevents them from being lumped with other programs aiding congressional oversight and control of the process the explanatory language of this section of the conference report referenced the sprattfurse provision the conferees agree that nothing in this section may be construed to modify repeal or in any way affect the provisions of section 3136 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 37 legislative actions in the fy2004 budget cycle the administration in dod legislative proposals for fy2004 requests repeal of the sprattfurse provision restricting lowyield nuclear weapon rd its draft language states simply section 3136 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 pl 103160 107 stat 1946 is repealed38 the administration offered the following rationale section 3136 the socalled plywd legislation prohibits the secretary of energy from conducting any research and development which could potentially lead to the production by the united states of new lowyield nuclear weapon including precision low yield warhead 36 pit is the fissile core of nuclear weapon the pit and associated materials are called the primary stage detonating the primary provides the energy to detonate the canned subassembly term used to refer to the secondary stage that stage provides most of weapons energy through fission and fusion 37 us congress committee of conference

legislation has negatively affected us government efforts to support the national strategy to counter wmd and undercuts efforts that could strengthen our ability to deter or respond to new or emerging threats revitalized nuclear weapons advanced concepts effort is essential to 1 train the next generation of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers and 2 restore nuclear weapons enterprise able to respond rapidly and decisively to changes in the international security environment or unforeseen technical problems in the stockpile plywd has had chilling effect on this effort by impeding the ability of our scientists and engineers to explore the full range of technical options it does not simply prohibit research on new lowyield warheads but prohibits any activities which could potentially lead to production by the united states of such warhead it is prudent national security policy not to foreclose exploration of technical options that could strengthen our ability to deter or respond to new or emerging threats in this regard the congressionallymandated nuclear posture review urged exploration of weapons concepts that could offer greater capabilities for precision earth penetration to hold at risk deeply buried and hardened bunkers defeat of chemical and biological agents and reduced collateral damage the plywd legislation impedes this effort repeal of plywd however falls far short of committing the united states to developing producing and deploying new lowyield warheads such warhead concepts could not proceed to fullscale development much less production and deployment unless congress authorizes and appropriates the substantial funds required to do this39 the senate bill s 1050 as reported from the armed services committee contained this repeal section 3131 and added that nothing in the repeal shall be construed as authorizing the testing acquisition or deployment of lowyield nuclear weapon on may 20 the senate considered an amendment by senators feinstein and kennedy to rescind section 313140 the debate in which more than 20 senators participated aroused considerable interest senator feinstein argued that repealing the lowyield ban will begin new era of nuclear proliferation41 senator durbin said this bill is about to discard 50 years of american foreign policy and 50 years of american nuclear policy42 senator kyl said the reason lowyield weapons research is being sought is because the world has changed since the time we developed these huge megaton nuclear weapons the united states 39 us department of defense dod legislative proposals

offered an amendment to modify section 3131 by replacing research and development with development engineering thus the amendment would have barred development engineering that could lead to us production of new nuclear warhead senator warner offered an amendment to the reed amendment replacing the latter with the original committee amendment and adding section the secretary of energy may not commence the engineering development phase or any subsequent phase of lowyield nuclear weapon unless specifically authorized by congress45 the difference between the two amendments was summed up as follows mr reed essentially the functional difference between my amendment and your second degree is at this point under my amendment the administration would have to come and lift the prohibition under your amendment they would have to come and get an authorization i think that is the functional difference mr warner i think the senator is correct46 on may 21 the senate agreed to the warner amendment 5938 and agreed to the reed amendment as amended by the warner amendment 960 subsequently on may 22 the senate passed s 1050 as amended 981 and on june 4 passed hr 1588 the house version of the national defense authorization act for fy2004 striking all after the enacting clause and inserting the text of s 1050 the house armed services committee tackled the same subject as reported by the committee section 3111 of hr 1588 modified the lowyield provision substantially from the language the administration had requested adopting by voice vote an amendment by representative spratt47 the fy1994 provision is as follows b limitation the secretary of energy may not conduct or provide for the conduct of research and development which could lead to the production by the united states of

as of november 30 1993 has not entered production d effect on studies and design work nothing in this section shall prohibit the secretary of energy from conducting or providing for the conduct of concept definition studies feasibility studies or detailed engineering design work the amendment apparently drew the line separating permitted from prohibited activities between phase 2a62a and phase 363 the explanatory statement of the committee was somewhat clearer on this point the amendment would maintain the prohibition on development of new nuclear weapons with yields less than five kilotons but would allow research on such weapons including concept definition studies feasibility studies and detailed engineering design48 statement of additional views by representative spratt and 24 other democrats in the committees report on the bill elaborated the amendment permits research of such sub5kt weapons it prohibits development engineering referred to as phase 63 activities by the department of energy and later stages of development49 the amendment is more permissive than the original provision but less so than the one the administration had proposed apparently permitting work through phase 2a62a but barring subsequent development it also narrows the potentially broad applicability of the phrase which could lead to the production that phrase raises the prospect that paper study computer model or metallurgical experiment might be illegal if it could somehow be construed as leading to production with the new language that possibility would longer be enough to block such work rather the test would be whether the development or production is of an actual lowyield weapon the rule for hr 1588 did not provide for amendments to this provision the house passed the bill as amended on may 22 36168 conference issues and outcomes several aspects of the lowyield ban were potentially at issue in conference both bills sought to define which activities were permitted and which were barred in order to remove an ambiguity of the original legislation the issue of rd that could lead to the production by the united states of new lowyield nuclear weapon including precision lowyield warhead they approached the problem differently though the senate would have rescinded the lowyield rd provision while barring engineering development or subsequent phases of lowyield weapon without congressional approval the house would have retained the low yield ban while modifying it substantially the senate bill as amended clearly drew the line separating permitted activity and activity requiring explicit congressional 48 house armed services committee national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 p 434 49 ibid p 519 crs19 authorization between phase 2a or 62a and phase 3 or 63 the house language appeared to do the same thing but it was not completely clear that develop and detailed engineering design work referred to that same line it was unclear whether there were difference between the senates requirement for explicit authorization of engineering development or beyond and the requirement in section 3143 of pl 107314 for doe to include lineitem request for each new or modified nuclear weapon in phase 3 or 63 or beyond senior nnsa staff member held that while committee or conference report language would typically comment on weapons in phase 3 or 63 or beyond nnsa would view authorization and appropriations of funds for such weapons typically hundreds of millions of dollars as constituting the explicit authorization that the senates bill required but that in any event it would be up to congress to define what form of authorization sufficed50 the house agreed to the conference report51 36240 on november 7 2003 the senate agreed to the conference report 953 on november 12 the president signed the measure into law pl 108136 on november 24 the conference bill section 3116 adopted the senate provision section 3116 repealed the sprattfurse provision stated that the repeal shall not be construed as authorizing the testing acquisition or deployment of lowyield nuclear weapon and barred the secretary of energy from beginning engineering development or subsequent phases of work on lowyield weapon without specific congressional authorization the bill further required report by the secretaries of state defense and energy assessing whether or not the repeal of sprattfurse will affect the ability of the united states to achieve its nonproliferation objectives and whether or not any changes in programs and activities would be required to achieve those objectives the legislation thus clearly delineates what rd on lowyield nuclear weapons is prohibited eliminating point of confusion in the original provision and sets the requirement congressional approval for overriding that prohibition at the same time the requirement for an assessment of any changes in programs and activities needed to achieve us nonproliferation objectives is unclear both in terms of what those objectives are and how broadly the phrase any changes is to be interpreted such changes could range from developing new lowyield nuclear weapons to training more specialists in arabic to strengthening the international atomic energy agency and what definition of nonproliferation objectives is the report to use52 50 telephone

be much less salient issue in the fy2005 cycle than in the previous one lifting the sprattfurse provision was policy issue that was resolved last year and not budget issue some critics expressed concern that nnsa would use the lifting of the provision to develop new weapons in an interview of december 2003 however nnsa administrator linton brooks stated there is list of lowyield weapons were thirsting to develop thats misconception53 an nnsa manager with responsibilities in this area elaborated in march 2004 we have requirements from dod for low yield weapon research we definitely do not have funds identified specifically for that area of research we may get other requests between now and the start of fy2005 one or more could be for concepts that would delve into the low yield area so i cant and wont claim that none will be done in fy2005 just that as of today we arent planning any54 issues for congress would lifting the ban lead to acquisition and use of nuclear weapons supporters of the ban argue that new weapons would make acquisition and use of nuclear weapons more likely any new weapon would broaden the presidents range of options president might find options made available by current nuclear weapons to be unacceptable but new weapon might offer tradeoff between costs and benefits that tilts in favor of nuclear use critics further believe that the administration is seeking to lift the ban with the intention of building low yield weapons senator feinstein asked secretary of defense donald rumsfeld about it and he said its just study they did the same thing with the nuclear posture review oh its just an intellectual exercise i dont believe either of those not one whit and i think theres very clear march on to develop these weapons55 critics further argue that even research on lowyield weapons would lead down slippery slope to testing production deployment and use senator feinstein said the repeal of sprattfurse opens the door for america to begin to develop nuclear weapons again56 senator biden said that many supporters of the ban are concerned because we believe very much that if one of these weapons is developed it will ultimately be fielded and that lowyield weapons send dangerous signal to other countries whether intentional or not that we intend to fight nuclear war57 senator kennedy said mininuke is still nuke if we build it we will use it 53 the bush administrations views on the future of nuclear weapons an interview with nnsa administrator linton brooks arms control today januaryfebruary 2004 3 54 information provided by nnsa

opportunity those who would lift the ban see lowering the nuclear threshold and slippery slope to nuclear use as misreading of us policy and practice congress will decide if weapon is to move to phase 363 through the authorization and appropriations process approval would be far from automatic the provision repealing sprattfurse in the senate armed services committees bill s 1050 sec 3131 stated explicitly nothing in the repeal shall be construed as authorizing the testing acquisition or deployment of lowyield nuclear weapons senator kyl stated this is not an authorization all we are doing is removing selfimposed restriction on thinking about this on doing research59 further they note use of nuclear weapons has always been presidential decision and one that presidents treat as arguably the most weighty decision that they can make having more weapons or lowyield weapons does not mean that the united states will use them as senator warner observed the threshold for using nuclear weapons remains very high indeed the united states had large number of lowyield nuclear weapons in our inventory during the 50s 60s and 70s which have now been removed from the inventory during each of these decades there were significant national security challenges to the united states none of those challenges came close to reaching the nuclear threshold 60 would lowyield weapons make nuclear proliferation more likely those who would retain the ban assert that resuming lowyield rd could spur nuclear proliferation if the worlds only superpower requires for its security new types of nuclear weapons in addition to the ones it already has then this implies that other nations need nuclear weapons for their security as well building weapons that might be used against rogue states will not deter these states from building nuclear weapons it is argued but will instead lead them to develop such weapons of their own to deter us attack they maintain that although nonproliferation efforts have not been 100 percent successful they have served as an important restraint resuming lowyield rd could lead to nuclear testing critics argue likely leading to resumed nuclear testing by others the head of the nuclear directorate of russias defense ministry reportedly stated in january 2002 if any of the five countries officially possessing nuclear weapons starts testing nuclear munitions again and we consider our nuclear stockpile to be in critical state we too will carry out nuclear tests61 beyond that the npt is the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime which incorporates

treaty indefinitely they decided to do so but this extension was linked to set of nonproliferation objectives one of which was completing negotiations on ctbt later than 1996 accordingly as sidney drell and others argue decision to resume nuclear testing to build lowyield nuclear weapons could deal the nonproliferation regime fatal blow 63 those opposed to the ban reject the argument that studying lowyield weapons would lead to nuclear proliferation other nation has such prohibition so lifting it would simply move the united states to position of parity in that regard they assert nations will act in their own interests on decisions involving their security or ambitions the united states signed the ctbt in 1996 yet india and pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998 these critics question the npts utility north korea and apparently iran made substantial progress on their nuclear programs even while being party to that treaty nuclear programs in all four nations were underway decades ago long before the us ban on lowyield rd the bans opponents argue that us actions especially on something as remote as preliminary studies of possible weapons will not make other nations more likely to develop wmd to the contrary they believe us ability to respond to wmd proliferation efforts by rogue states may dissuade them from undertaking such actions in the first place as senator domenici said to permit weapons scientists to work in this area low yield weapons is part of the deterrent64 the bans opponents reject the contention that rd on new weapons will lead to nuclear testing as c paul robinson director of sandia national laboratories said i can categorically state that one is proposing returning to nuclear testing65 the united states has decades of experience with lowyield nuclear weapons including those with altered radiation outputs such as the neutron bomb of the 1970s use of existing tested designs perhaps with modifications not requiring testing would provide high confidence better understanding of the effects of lowyield weapons is crucial for understanding their utility yet key variables are how blast wave would interact with structures computer models and engineering studies would arguably provide the needed data would lowyield weapons offer military value some supporting the ban argue there is little meaningful use for lowyield weapons they

nuclear weapons another lesson of these wars is that if targets can be located they can often be defeated with conventional weapons deep burial large tunnel complexes with multiple barriers deception etc might make targets in rogue states difficult to destroy with nuclear weapons even if they can be located many potential targets are in cities but detonating lowyield nuclear weapon in or even near city could cause much collateral damage by one estimate 5kiloton weapon detonated near and upwind from damascus syria at depth of 30 feet would cause 230000 fatalities and another 280000 casualties within two years67 use of lowyield earth penetrator against the bunkers thought to house saddam in baghdad city of nearly 5 million people could have caused casualties on similar scale the bans

interest in lowyield weapons admiral james ellis commander us strategic command wrote that us strategic command is interested in conducting rigorous studies of all new technologies and examining the merits of precision increased penetration and reduced yields for our nuclear weapons68 at present in the view of those who would lift the ban on lowyield rd the ban makes it impossible to assess the value of the capabilities sub5kt weapons might bring to the stockpile or how they might be designed for specific missions the ban they assert imposes broader constraints on nuclear weapons designers as they seek to stay well away from any activities that could be construed as violating the sprattfurse provision senator sessions concluded it would be irrational to prohibit research that could

this latter program involves studies through phase 2a62a by small groups of weapons personnel at alamos livermore and sandia as well as liaison with dod commands alamos publication stated the aci

during much of the cold war the three weapons laboratories had teams of scientists and engineers studying advanced weapons concepts studies ranged from modifications of existing weapons to improvements for nextgeneration weapons to exploration of new weapons technologies and weapons for new missions tools used included laboratory experiments computer modeling data from past and ongoing nuclear tests and data from experiments the teams added to nuclear tests these teams were small perhaps halfdozen fulltime professional staff but during the cold war they drew on the large advanced and exploratory rd program that was major part of the core nuclear weapons programs at the laboratories team members new staff as well as experienced designers would typically work on advanced concepts for year or two team members would also interact with doe headquarters dod elements contractors and others with the end of the cold war and the end of nuclear weapons development the laboratories wound down their advanced concepts programs in the middle 1990s since then there have been statements emphasizing the value of the type of work that advanced concepts programs performed and subsequent calls for an aci to reestablish advanced concepts programs at the labs aci would recreate the small teams but would not reorient the bulk of the nuclear weapons program which is focused on sustaining current weapons through the stockpile stewardship program the chiles report of 1999 stated doe should also encourage the laboratories to continue their decades old practice of exploratory development programs since these programs have allowed experienced engineers and scientists to maintain their systems engineering skills and train new employees73 the foster panels fy1999 report stated the nuclear weapons complex should work on range of design and development tasks that exercise and sustain the capability to produce new weapon designs this provides both broader set of technical options to meet future needs and program for training new generations of stewards74 the purportedly leaked version of the nuclear posture review stated there are several nuclear weapon options that might provide important advantages for enhancing the nations deterrence posture possible modifications to existing weapons to provide additional yield flexibility in the stockpile

nuclear stockpile november 8 1999 p 12 crs26 next generation of weapon designers and engineers dod and nnsa will also jointly review potential programs to provide nuclear capabilities and identify opportunities for further study including assessments of whether nuclear testing would be required to field such warheads75 the administration now proposes to recreate these teams in july 2003 nnsa provided details on the fy2004 studies that the nonrnep part of aci would conduct76 perhaps 200000 would go for participation by the weapons labs in an air force concept study of enhancing and modernizing current warhead such as examining if any additional military characteristics are useful and feasible the balance would go for other laboratory studies specifically alamos would spend its funds on enhancing computer modeling and simulation capability and for mechanical testing sandia would continue study of mission endtoend command and control which would enable military personnel to know where warhead was at all times this would be applicable to conventional as well as nuclear weapons for example if laserguided bomb lost track of its laser signal because of fog or smoke endtoend command and control would indicate its location livermore would undertake an early study on design to effect ie designing nuclear weapons to obtain desired output characteristics these projects may or may not support research directly on lowyield nuclear weapons legislative actions in the fy2004 budget cycle for fy2004 the senate armed services committee recommended authorizing the full 210 million requested for advanced concepts77 the house armed services committee stated that aci had several important purposes such as exercising the weapons design process training the next generation of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers and understanding what adversaries might do in the area of nuclear weapon design accordingly the committee expressed its belief that nnsa should consider more significant future investment in these advanced concepts activities and recommends that nnsa proceed with its advanced concepts initiative forthwith78 amendments were offered on non rnep aci in the senate the house rejected an amendment by representative tauscher to transfer all funds from aci including funds for rnep to conventional programs to defeat hardened and deeply buried targets as

of the nuclear weapons program the committee found that flawed budget process raised questions about the legitimacy of nuclear weapon requests unfortunately the country possesses neither modern stockpile nor modern nuclear weapons complex instead both are largely carryovers from the cold war era after careful consideration the committee has concluded that much of the current situation results from flawed budget process the weapons activities portion of the nnsa budget is effectively insulated from any such intraagency tradeoffs dod sets requirements that another agency has to fund and doe treats the weapons activities budget as untouchable because dod set the requirements there needs to be serious debate about whether the approximately 6 billion spent annually on does nuclear weapons complex is sound national security investment until that debate occurs and the doe weapons budget request is subject to meaningful budget tradeoffs this committee will not assume that all of the proposed nuclear weapons requests are legitimate requirements79 this disconnect the committee stated led to new weaponrelated initiatives such as aci rnep and enhanced test readiness that overstretched nnsas management abilities it appears to the committee the department of energy is proposing to rebuild restart and redo and otherwise exercise every capability that was used over the past forty years of the cold war and at the same time prepare for future with an expanded mission for nuclear weapons nothing in the past performance of the nnsa convinces this committee that the successful implementation of stockpile stewardship program is foregone conclusion which makes the pursuit of broad range of new initiatives premature until the nnsa has demonstrated to the congress that it can successfully meet its primary mission of maintaining the safety security and viability of the existing stockpile by executing the stockpile life extension program and sciencebased stewardship activities on time and within budget this committee will not support redirecting the management resources and attention to series of new initiatives80 for these reasons it recommended eliminating the 60 million requested for aci the house passed hr 2754 on may 18 2003 37726 amendments were offered on aci rnep test readiness or any other weapons activities provisions weapons

be silent on it because of congressional interest in nuclear weapon programs conferees could also have considered directing doe to specify in detail the projects that futureyear aci requests will support nonrnep aci was at issue in the energy and water conference point of possible contention was whether conferees could arrive at compromise somewhere between the house and senate figures or if the funding request was so small relative to other nnsa projects that cut of say 50 percent would prevent one or two of the three labs from performing its planned study also at issue were the two amendments the senate passed an issue that implicitly faced energy and water conferees was the gulf between the house appropriations committee report which argued that pursuit of broad range of new

and exercise of design skills conducting preconceptual conceptual feasibility design and costing studies of options92 nnsa administrator brooks said that ideas for aci include the ability to destroy biological agents improved safety and security and more capable or robust weapon designs that might be developed without testing he felt that the effort probably will be focused on safety security

counterarguments come from critics of the program but others are presented as they might be made by the critics does deterrence require new types of nuclear weapons key aspect of the debate over aci and over lowyield weapons and rnep as well is the relationship between deterrence and new weapons george miller of livermore states deterrence is dynamic concept it has to continually evolve and be able to respond to changes that our adversaries will make in order to be relevant and effective thats what happened in the cold war the real question that is being debated is whether nuclear weapons will be allowed to develop in response to the changing world situation if they are to evolve modifications to the cold war arsenal will be required if for other reason than to limit collateral damage if they are not to evolve the nuclear arsenal will become irrelevant and will die away standing still is not stable95 critics assert that the only role of nuclear weapons is to deter other nations from using nuclear weapons against the united states or perhaps against its friends and allies for this purpose existing weapons are more than sufficient and their use is fully credible in this view there would be need for new weapons with the threat of usrussian nuclear war very low the administration is seeking something from nuclear weapons beyond deterrence goal set forth in the quadrennial defense review is that well targeted strategy and policy can dissuade other countries from initiating future military competitions96 the nuclear posture review amplifying on this point stated that diverse portfolio of capabilities denies payoff from competition97 the administration further argues that preemption may be needed to counter threats of wmd and that the united states may use all of our options in responding to an attack using wmd while these two statements do not state that the united states would use nuclear weapons preemptively neither do they rule out such use another goal of the current administration involves having potential adversaries take certain actions such as having iran open its nuclear facilities to inspection having north korea verifiably halt all work related to nuclear weapons or until recently having iraq cooperate fully with inspectors ideally these goals would be achieved through diplomatic economic or similar means but if those means do not suffice preemptive force might be threatened or as in iraq used coercion the 95 personal communication september 5 2003 96 us department of defense quadrennial defense review report september 30 2001 p 12

not take certain actions goes beyond deterrence which threatens to use force against states if they do take certain actions coercion works earlier in the threat chain with the intention of eliminating through diplomacy threat or force activities that could create threats rather than forestalling the use of existing capabilities one argument being that it is hard to know what is needed to deter rogue state shift from deterrence to something more whatever form that may take could lead to change in weapons desired to implement the new policy conventional or nuclear forces credible for deterrence might not be credible under the new approach would any regime believe us threat to use nuclear weapons new nuclear weapons especially loweryield weapons tailored to destroy specific targets render such threats more credible supporters argue acis supporters believe that the ability to respond to potential threats as aci is intended to do would promote us security john gordon former nnsa administrator said demonstrated ability to design develop and produce new warheads including small builds of special purpose weapons could be an important element in our overall deterrent posture such capabilities could act to convince an adversary that it could not expect to negate us nuclear forces for example by seeking to house vital command and control functions in hard deeplyburied installations98 us nuclear weapons able to hold at risk such targets could be used not only for deterrence but also for coercion and preemption in the view of critics deterrence and something more come from threat of regime change and that threat comes from conventional forces not nuclear forces new weapons in this assessment might not enhance deterrence even if tailored for specific missions as aci might do because rogue states would see use of new weapons as more credible than use of current weapons critics cite 1992 letter by the first bush administration setting forth presidential decision to modify us nuclear testing policy immediately to impose limits on the number purpose and yield of our tests the purpose of all us nuclear tests of our weapons will henceforth be for the safety and reliability of our deterrent forces99 omitted from this statement was weapons development as purpose for testing as developing new weapons typically required testing critics interpret the statement as indicating that there was need for new nuclear weapons if existing weapons were sufficient for us security in 1992 they assert these same weapons should suffice now at that time us nuclear weapons addressed as lesser included cases targets that are of current concern such as deeply buried targets and biological weapon storage sites additionally critics oppose the administrations policy of preemption and see 98 letter from john gordon administrator national nuclear security administration to the honorable john w warner chairman committee on armed services united states senate

control and disarmament agency and robert barker former assistant to the secretary of defense for atomic energy suggest several new warheads warheads with suppressed electromagnetic pulse for more effective missile defense reduced residual radiation warheads for low collateral damage and robust warheads for longer shelflife101 another possibility would be warheads for intercepting missiles armed with chemical or biological agents102 if these ideas are of mutual interest to doe and dod projects of this sort would appear to fall within the purview of aci critics question the value or feasibility of such weapons peter zimmerman physicist consultant to the senate foreign relations committee and formerly science adviser for arms control at the state department writes reduced residual radiation weapons would be similar to the neutron bombs made in the 1970s with very low fission yield for classified reasons they cannot be readily made today without compromise to higher priority programs suppressing electromagnetic pulse is very difficult because that would require capturing the many highenergy electrons liberated by nuclear explosion ultrarobust warheads could have been developed and tested decades ago but werent perhaps because the nuclear weapons community feared that that could have ended the need to test103 the administration and congress appear to have little if any interest in nucleararmed interceptors as noted earlier in 1989 report doe explained its low interest in more robust warheads it stated that the nuclear weapon laboratories were studying the feasibility of such warheads which would have reduced sensitivity to aging to material properties that might change slightly during remanufacture to tolerances of manufacture etc we cannot predict the success of this research program doe said and noted that such warheads would be less operationally efficient than the optimized warheads in 100 us department of defense dod news briefing secretary

such penalties are arguably less important than they were during the cold war and ultrarobust warheads accordingly more desirable because the united states plans to reduce the number of warheads carried by operationally deployed ballistic missiles105 and bombers can be loaded with fewer bombs and missiles making extra carrying capacity available on these systems is it technically feasible to use nuclear weapons to destroy stored bioweapon stockpiles if so is such use advisable one concept that aci might explore would be nuclear weapons for destroying chemical or biological warfare agents aci supporters advance it as main reason for studying new or modified weapons yet there is much less understanding of this topic than of rnep this section deals with attacks on biological warfare bw agents because some of them such as anthrax spores are more lethal than the most toxic chemical warfare agents on weightforweight basis it first addresses the technical feasibility of such attacks drawing heavily on the work of hans kruger106 and jonathan b tucker107 kruger is physicist and an authority on the effects of nuclear weapons on chemical and biological agents he led livermores weapons effects group from around 1973 to 1999 when he retired and is currently working at livermore on these issues tucker is senior researcher at the center for nonproliferation studies monterey institute of international studies he has written extensively on bw and was biological weapons inspector in iraq108 after considering feasibility this section addresses the advisability of such attacks taking into account political intelligence and collateraldamage issues and then offers several concluding observations feasibility in calculating the effects of nuclear weapons on bw agent kruger makes several assumptions about the target109 the agent would be stacked in steel barrels or larger containers in various configurations stored in the open or in typical warehouse it would be in the form of water slurry110 for which he used 104 us department of energy annual report to congress volume i program status of preparations for further limitations on nuclear testing required by

7 2003 crs35 water as surrogate for the purpose of computer modeling111 he stated that biological agent is typically stored in barrels or larger storage containers112 he further stated that bw agent in water slurry is conservative assumption because less radiation would reach the bottom of stack of barrels filled with water slurry than with eg dry anthrax powder113 while there may be various ways to neutralize bw agent without the cooperation of the country possessing such agent kruger argues that using nuclear weapon to neutralize bw agents requires applying lethal dose of radiation to all parts of the storage site nuclear weapons produce various forms of radiation x rays are stopped near the top of the material because they do not have enough energy to penetrate further gamma rays electromagnetic radiation of higher energy than xrays penetrate more deeply one study finds gamma rays of limited value in two cases studied attacking bw agent in an underground bunker one case with nuclear explosion inside the bunker and the other with the explosion in the ground but outside the bunker the amount of bioagents effectively irradiated by this process gamma rays will in all likelihood be small fraction of the total114 neutrons are the most effective mechanism they are more penetrating than gammas in addition neutrons generate gamma rays when they strike the target material gammas generated far down in the stack of stored agent can penetrate to the bottom of the stack the key to calculating the effects of nuclear weapon on bw agents then according to this argument is the number of neutrons and their energy level dose of neutrons and gamma rays sufficient to kill bw agent at the bottom of the stack would expose the rest of the stack to much greater dose the fireball of nuclear explosion would probably incinerate bw agents but radiation is more useful kill mechanism from military point of view because it can be calculated much more precisely if one knows the conditions under which the agent is stored currentlydeployed nuclear weapons which use combination of fission and fusion to produce an explosion must be detonated close to the ground creating much fallout in order to kill bw agents for greater height of burst the number and energy level of neutrons produced would be insufficient for this task115 111 kruger radiationneutralization

is from the radioactive fission products the two pieces into which uranium or plutonium atom splits when it fissions that is initially vaporized and then solidifies on the solid matter scooped up from the surface think of it as vapor plating type of process this results in relatively large particulates that drop sufficiently fast to reach the ground within few to few tens of kilometers from ground zero the same amount of radioactive fission products is present when the detonation occurs at such height that ground material is scooped up however now the fission products form much smaller particles that have much lower continued crs36 nuclear weapons can be made however that generate more neutrons such weapon is reduced blastenhanced radiation weapon such as the neutron bomb of the 1970s neutron bombs were controversial and are discussed further below for given yield these weapons produce an order of magnitude more neutrons than do standard lowyield nuclear weapons and the neutrons have higher energy level kruger calculates that 10kt weapon of this type burst at height of 10 meters would neutralize bw agents to radius of about 50 meters vs 10 meters for 10kt fission weapon at the same height of burst116 for comparison the hiroshima bomb had yield of 15 kt he notes several consequences of the increased neutron flux fusion warhead eg neutron bomb has larger sterilization area than fission warhead of equal yield another to significant consequence is that i can detonate fusion warhead at an altitude above the ground higher than the optimum altitude sufficiently high that the fireball does not touch the ground and still produce sterilizing dose at the very bottom of the barrel stack over militarily significant area avoiding fireball contact with the ground eliminates most of the local fallout this is not feasible for fission warhead117 if an adversary stored bw agent in an underground bunker the surrounding earth steel and reinforced concrete would significantly attenuate the neutrons from weapon that burst far enough from the bunker vertically or horizontally that the fireball did not enter it to destroy the agent an earth penetrator weapon epw would have to place the fireball inside the bunker the chief kill mechanism would be the heat of the fireball the effectiveness of which would be increased because the fireball would at first be concentrated within the structure the delayed radiation resulting from the fission debris would expose any remaining agent to further radiation dose118 critics question krugers postulated target as optimized for destruction by nuclear weapon the next few paragraphs focus on anthrax because it is one of the tougher bw agents to kill and is also one of the most militarily useful agents would nation make anthrax in aqueous form it is easier to make anthrax as waterbased slurry than fine powder according to tucker it appears that at the time of the 1991 gulf war iraq only had the capability to produce wet anthrax iraqi bw scientists appear to have worked during the 1990s to acquire the knowhow to produce dry powdered anthrax using closely related bacterium 115 continued settling velocity now the fission debris is spread over very much larger distance and as result the radioactive dose on the ground is very much lower personal correspondence september 24 2003 116

model system if country had the capability to produce dried powdered anthrax it would presumably store it in that form because of its much longer shelflife and the fact that dry powdered anthrax is much easier to disseminate as an aerosol from an aircraft sprayer system or missile warhead an office of technology assessment ota report of 1993 provides further information when anthrax bacteria are incubated under particular conditions they transform themselves into the rugged spore form which has long shelflife this sporeforming ability makes anthrax particularly well suited for delivery by missiles or bombs the spores are stable when suspended in air can survive explosive dissemination from bomb or shell and will live for several days if direct sunlight is avoided119 would nation need huge quantities of anthrax the ota report states that gram of anthrax in spore form theoretically contains some 10 million lethal doses120 the ability of single envelope with small quantity of powdered anthrax to shut down the capitol complex in october 2001 is case in point tucker states bioterrorist attack in confined space such as subway station would require few ounces of dry anthrax military applications or strategic attacks against cities would require much more material perhaps hundreds of pounds to attack large city as rough rule of thumb about kilogram of dry concentrated anthrax spores would be required to infect 50 percent of the people in square kilometer assuming efficient aerosol dissemination under optimal conditions kilo of dry anthrax is equivalent to much larger volume of wet slurry would nation make and store anthrax long before it intended to use it according to tucker nation would probably not make anthrax far in advance of use unless it had mastered the technology to produce dry powdered anthrax which has shelf life of several years wet slurry of anthrax will tend to coagulate after several months rendering it unusable as weapon thus country that possessed only wetanthrax technology would probably produce the agent shortly before use would nation store large quantities of anthrax aboveground attacking anthrax stored in shallow underground bunkers would require the use of epws to explode in the bunker otherwise the ground would shield the bunker from neutrons an epw would create much fallout and could cause other problems as detailed in the section on rnep below storing anthrax in bunker at depth considerably greater than that which epws could reach would 119 us congress office of technology assessment technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction otabpisc115 usgpo december 1993 p 79 120 ibid p 78 crs38 prevent neutrons heat and delayed radiation from radioactive material left by the nuclear explosion from reaching the bunker tucker states that since anthrax spores are quite rugged and are in state of suspended animation its reasonable to assume that ground shock alone would be unlikely to kill them reliably the statement from the ota report that anthrax spores can survive explosive dissemination cited above supports this point for further protection from neutrons an adversary could shield anthrax with material that reflects neutrons eg beryllium or that absorbs them eg polyethylene mixed with boron alternatively dry powdered anthrax could be hidden anywhere in small lots in which case its destruction would depend mainly on locating the agent once that is done various types of weapons and tactics might be used to neutralize it advisability critics point to number of intelligence hurdles successful attack would require detailed knowledge of the target such as storage configuration knowing the targets precise location would be crucial because of the very short range at which even an enhanced radiation weapon would sterilize bw agent yet as tucker notes during the 1991 gulf war many suspect bw production and storage facilities were targeted in error and several real facilities such as the alhakam factory which unscom121 later determined was iraqs largest anthrax production facility were totally unknown to us intelligence it would be important to know the type of agent because as kruger states the neutralizing dose of radiation for different bio agents varies by couple of factors of two compensating for uncertainty as to which agent was being attacked by using weapon able to neutralize the most radiationresistant agent could result in using weapon with yield several times larger than needed critics also note political problems with nuclear weapon development and use an attack that sought to minimize fallout would have to use reduced blastenhanced radiation weapons neutron bombs which the united states developed in the 1970s received intense domestic and foreign criticism as the capitalist bomb that spared property while killing people similar criticism would doubtless reemerge if the united states began program to develop such weapons especially if the intended targets were perceived to be rogue states in the third world the development program could require nuclear testing fueling further criticism critics assert that there are nonnuclear approaches to destroying bw agents according to one report the defense department is working on nonnuclear weapons for destroying chemical or biological agents destroying the actual chemical or biological material in iraq is task that may fall to agent defeat weapons being developed by the us navy and lockheed martin under program originally dubbed vulcan fire and now spearheaded by the secretive us defense threat reduction agency the htij1000 as it is 121 the established unscom the united nations special commission in 1991 to supervise the elimination of chemical and biological weapons and certain missiles in iraq following the gulf war see httpwwwunorgdeptsunscom for details crs39 called would be the fill inside the penetrating warhead used on the massive 2000pound gbu24 laserguided bomb and blu109 joint direct attack munition jdam used to attack underground bunkers122 that report states that the chemical reactions would generate intense heat that would destroy the biological and chemical agents and would generate other chemicals that would neutralize these agents123 michael levi director of the strategic studies project at the federation of american scientists suggested another approach to defeating hypothetical underground anthrax storage bunker in iraq us planners may not want to directly attack the bunker instead watch could be placed on the facility using satellite imagery coupled with armed unmanned aerial vehicles anyone or anything attempting to enter or leave the bunker would be destroyed making the anthrax inside unusable124 kruger rejects the idea of using conventional high explosives to neutralize bw agents for two reasons first he calculates that it would take huge quantity of these explosives perhaps hundreds of 500pound bombs to raise the temperature of the quantity of agent in typical storage site sufficiently assuming the agent was in water slurry similarly if acid were used instead of explosives to kill bw agent it would take very large quantity of acid second he argues that attacking bw storage site with conventional weapons would cause much more collateral damage than would an attack with nuclear weapons even standard lowyield weapons conventional weapons are likely to only kill small fraction of the agent while dispersing significant fraction of the remaining live agent my past dispersal calculations for generic target in country of current interest have shown collateral damage areas from dispersed bio agent that were very many ordersof magnitude larger than the fallout area for the ground burst of lowyield fission warhead125 it might be possible to deploy reduced blastenhanced radiation weapons without testing them such as by adapting designs made and tested several decades ago optimizing these weapons for defeating specific bw agents however could involve changes that would eventually lead to testing126 an attempt to seal off facility encounters at least two problems first us attack on rogue state with warning would be unlikely with warning that state 122 frank vizard extinguishing the threat scientific americancom february 18 2003

125 personal communication september 16 2003 126 information provided by livermore staff september 25 2003 crs40 could easily move materials and equipment to other sites before the attack indeed leaders who believed that their nation was at risk from us attack would probably make plans well in advance to do just that second some nations such as afghanistan and north korea have extensive tunnel networks that might provide undetected access at distance to military facilities connected to such networks conclusion it appears that under certain specific circumstances nuclear blast is technically capable of sterilizing bw agents one example would be large quantity of agent in aqueous solution stored at or near the earths surface with the location pinpointed within meters and with accurate intelligence as to the agent present and how it is stored the agent would have to be stored long enough that intelligence assets could locate it but not so long that it would deteriorate significantly another example would be depot with ton of powdered anthrax in which case relatively small amount as compared with hundreds of barrels of agent could do immense harm and it would be imperative to minimize the risk of anthrax escaping few would suggest though that nuclear weapons would automatically be the means of first choice for attacking bw agent nuclearweapon use entails clear political disadvantages the effectiveness of nuclear weapons in particular situations may be uncertain and nonnuclear means may be available whatever the case it appears likely that congress would examine closely any request to proceed to development engineering or production of nuclear weapons intended to destroy bw agents such examination might include the following questions how probable is the military scenario put forth to justify development and acquisition of these weapons how plausible is the scenario what are its flaws how broad or narrow are the circumstances under which the scenario exists would nuclear use be the only option in that scenario or could nonnuclear means suffice what is the state of progress on nonnuclear alternatives what are the military and political pros and cons of developing and acquiring these weapons can aci help in the fight against nuclear proliferation according to the fy2003 report of the foster panel second requirement defined in the npr is for advanced concept exploration work must proceed on future concepts and technologies to avoid technical surprises to attract and train future stockpile stewards and to assess intelligence information on the continuing development and proliferation of wmd and their delivery methods the panel emphasizes that it is essential for congress to be kept apprised of developments in foreign weapons programs and their potential implications for us security127 127 fy 2003 report to congress of the panel to assess the reliability safety and security of the united states nuclear stockpile p 3 crs41 aci could improve us understanding of potential terrorist nuclear weapons which could improve us ability to interpret fragments of intelligence to detect evidence of nations or groups working to develop nuclear weapons to detect the transport of such weapons and attempts to bring them into the united states and to disable such weapons it could also help avoid technical surprise by improving us ability to understand foreign weapon developments for example creating nuclear weapon designs consistent with the chinese or north korean weapons program may help the united states interpret intelligence clues to gain insight into the pace of the program its technological successes and failures and warhead characteristics acis supporters reject the claim that the program will encourage nuclear proliferation they argue that nations will decide to go nuclear for reasons far larger than aci even if aci encouraged proliferation that would not necessarily mean that the united states should halt the program it is likely supporters claim that north korea and iran are pursuing nuclear weapons out of fear of us conventional forces does this mean supporters ask that the united states should halt military modernization and shrink its conventional forces to keep those nations from going nuclear at the same time it is argued india and pakistan are pursuing nuclear weapons not because of us conventional or nuclear forces but because of threats that each sees from the other and that india sees from china these dynamics have nothing to do with aci acis critics maintain that designing new nuclear weapons tailored for use against targets in nonnuclear weapon states would undercut us nuclear nonproliferation efforts by in effect telling the world to do what we say not what we do these critics assert that the program is scarcely needed to improve us ability to understand nuclear weapons developments made by rogue states or terrorists us nuclear weapons experience accumulated over the past six decades provides ample information for interpreting intelligence clues connected with the design and fabrication of such weapons nor is aci needed to improve us ability to understand russian or chinese nuclear weapons programs the stockpile stewardship program has greatly increased us weapons knowledge arguably placing this nation in better position now to interpret intelligence data on russian and chinese nuclear programs than it was decade ago another argument is that rogue states want nuclear weapons to deter us nuclear forces north korean statement of august 2003 makes this point the bush administration openly disclosed its attempt to use nuclear weapons after listing the dprk as part of an axis of evil and target of preemptive nuclear attack this prompted us to judge that the bush administration is going to stifle our system by force and decide to build strong deterrent force to cope with it our deterrent force is means for selfdefence to protect our sovereignty128 128 kim yong il vice minister of foreign affairs for democratic peoples republic of continued crs42 thus it is argued nuclear weapons designed to threaten key targets in rogue states will only accelerate development of nuclear weapons by those states does aci offer unique value for the nuclear weapons enterprise acis proponents believe that the united states must retain weapons design capability because new weapons might be needed in the future such as to attack specific targets or to replace current weapons that deteriorate beyond the point of repair to that end it is further argued the united states should avoid situation in which it needs new weapon yet one at the labs has had the experience of designing one supporters see aci as complementing the stockpile stewardship program maintaining existing weapons involves predicting detecting and fixing problems with existing weapons designing new weapons however arguably involves different skills and thought processes just as editing differs from writing designer might be given target and required warhead characteristics yield weight compatibility with specific delivery vehicle etc and be tasked to design warhead that produces the required military effectiveness while minimizing collateral damage experienced weapon designers from all three labs have stated to nnsa headquarters that the current stockpile stewardship program maintenance of the enduring stockpile is not sufficient to provide the range of opportunities necessary to train and mentor the next generation of designers129 aci it is argued will provide such training the purportedly leaked npr stated that aci will provide unique opportunities to train our next generation of weapon designers and engineers130 alamos director john browne stated that aci articulates strategy for transferring nuclear warhead design knowledge and exercising design skills this initiative provides an outstanding opportunity for the nuclear weapons complex to ensure that existing expertise is transferred to future generation of stockpile stewards and to extend the frontline weapons lifetimes beyond that of the designers who designed and tested them131 aci will also develop new links between the weapons community and dod agencies it is helpful proponents believe for some members of the weapons community to have personal contacts with members of the us strategic command and the defense threat reduction agency among others to gain an understanding 128 continued korea text of speech delivered at sixcountry nuclear talks

technologies may be available the harshest critics of nuclear weapons believe that there is need to keep alive the skills to design new weapons current weapons they argue are more than sufficient and their designs have been proven until nuclear weapons are abolished these critics would maintain the existing stockpile in their view the multibillion dollar stockpile stewardship program is excessive for this purpose this school of thought would reject aci completely some critics of aci see value in maintaining design skills so as to improve us ability to understand warhead problems that may emerge to understand how changes made during refurbishment may affect weapon performance and to design replacement weapons should that be necessary such skills can be maintained they would argue by designing weapons similar to current ones rather than designing new types of weapons that approach would not require aci critics would question training as justification for aci the number of people trained by aci is very small and there are already training programs for junior staff in october 1998 sandia started an intern program twoyear course for new employees on the nuclear weapons program and sandias role in it in october 1996 alamos started the theoretical institute for thermonuclear and nuclear studies on nuclear weapons design for new personnel in that field132 some question whether aci as proposed for fy2004 offers useful plan for maintaining weapon design capabilities for example raymond jeanloz professor of earth and planetary science at university of california berkeley and member of the university of california presidents council133 argues that repackaging an existing bomb with work on the nuclear explosive component rnep working on lowyield designs an area extensively studied in the past including with underground tests or other ideas proposed for aci amount more to reworking old ground than to significantly exercising design activity134 there is need for new links between dod and the nuclear weapons establishment in the critics view because several doddoe groups have been in existence for many years these include the nuclear weapons council program officer groups and the stockpile assessment team of strategic commands strategic advisory group 132 us commission on maintaining united states nuclear weapons expertise report to congress and the secretary of

of the robust nuclear earth penetrator or rnep the ndaa provided the amount requested while the ewdaa provided 75 million the fy2005 request is 276 million the rnep study part of the advanced concepts initiative is examining the desirability and feasibility of modifying an existing b61 or b83 bomb to enable it to penetrate into the ground before detonating by so doing weapon of specified yield would have much greater effect against hardened and deeply buried targets such as are used in some rogue states to protect key assets than would nuclear weapon of the same yield burst on the earths surface modification would mainly involve strengthening the weapons case rather than changing the nuclear explosive package in the 1990s doe conducted similar modification converting some b61 bombs into b6111 earth penetrators modification that did not require nuclear testing if nnsa converts b61s or b83s into rneps current plans envision that the conversion would not require nuclear testing while the histories of earth penetrator weapons and the sprattfurse ban on low yield rd are intertwined repeal of that ban does not necessarily open the door to rnep the ban applied only to weapons under 5 kt rnep if it proceeds would be modification of the b61 bomb or the b83 bomb both of which are available in number of yields with the maximum said to be far above 5 kt further both have been in the stockpile for many years even if they had yields only below 5 kt the ban applied only to weapons that had not entered production by november 30 1993135 technical background structures can be hardened and deeply buried in an attempt to withstand an attack by conventional munitions such structures may be used to protect leadership biological agent production facilities nuclear weapon storage sites and other strategic targets reports reference such facilities in iraq north korea and iran136 doddoe report indicates that thousands of such structures exist worldwide many in nations that do not pose threat to the united states137 135 the definition of new weapon in pl 107314 section 3143 cited above appears to preclude the argument that modifications of the b61 or b83 would constitute new weapon 136 glenn kessler nuclear sites in iran worry us officials washington post december 14 2002 18 21 david fulghum iraqs hidden weapons are likely underground aviation week space

of hard and deeply buried targets p 8 crs45 while special operations forces or precisionguided conventional bombs might defeat deeply buried structures by attacking power supplies ventilation systems and exits these structures would probably have backup power supplies escape tunnels etc accordingly destruction would be surer means of completely eliminating the threat they pose facilities at shallow depths perhaps 10 meters are vulnerable to destruction by conventional munitions that penetrate the ground destruction of facilities buried at greater depths may require nuclear weapon during the cold war the united states deployed the b53 nuclear bomb weapon said to have yield of some megatons thousands of kilotons for such missions weapon of such high yield would create blast and fallout that would destroy surface structures and kill inhabitants out to many miles in the current environment president would be unlikely to order its use against target in rogue state so as to avoid killing very large numbers of civilians as c paul robinson president of sandia national laboratories said we would be selfdeterred from using highyield weapons138 figure 1 earth penetration reduces yield needed to destroy buried targets at issue insofar as the nuclear option is concerned is how to destroy hardened and deeply buried facilities with loweryield weapons much of the energy of groundburst weapon is reflected back into the air scientists on both sides of the larger debate agree that nuclear weapon that penetrates even short distance into the ground will transfer much more of its energy into ground shock which can destroy buried targets for example sandia reports that 1megaton 1000kiloton weapon burst on the earths surface has about the same effect on buried targets as 33kiloton weapon detonated at 5 meters depth most of the payoff comes from burying the weapon several meters in the ground especially for loweryield weapons 138 c paul robinson maintaining viable nuclear weapons program in test ban environment strong technical foundation in the laboratories address presented at the nuclear security decisionmakers forum march 28 2000 albuquerque nm httpwwwsandiagovmediaspeechesnsdmf2000doc crs46 burial beyond several meters produces diminishing returns139 figure 1 illustrates these points robert nelson reports similar data140 thus loweryield earth penetrator weapon epw can have the same effect on buried targets as much higheryield surfaceburst weapon this large reduction in yield in turn reduces fallout and blast damage common misconception is that detonating weapon few meters underground reduces fallout in fact weapon of specified yield detonated at shallow depth in wet soil will create more fallout than if it were detonated on the surface the reduction in fallout from lower yield though can offset the increase in fallout from shallow subsurface burst continuing the example just noted fallout with specific intensity 150 rads in 24 hours for an unsheltered person would by one calculation be generated over 2700 square kilometers by 1megaton surfaceburst weapon or over 150 square kilometers by 33kiloton weapon detonated at depth of 5 meters141 figure 2 illustrates these points though it assumes individuals would be sheltered figure 2 lower yield reduces fallout shallow depth of burst increases it loweryield weapons even epws may not suffice to destroy all buried targets stephen younger then associate laboratory director for nuclear weapons alamos national laboratory wrote some very hard targets require high yield to destroy them application of conventional explosives or even loweryield nuclear explosives will destroy such targets which might include hardened structures buried 139

superhard targets such as those found under certain russian mountains may not be able to be defeated reliably by even highyield nuclear weapons142 similarly robert nelson wrote lowyield nuclear epw would still only be able to destroy facilities relatively close to the surface very large yield 100 kt weapons are still required to destroy facilities buried under the equivalent of 100 m of concrete143 even lowyield epws would generate much fallout for example photographs of two nuclear tests show the fallout cloud generated by lowyield weapons buried hundreds of feet with the emplacement hole sealed test named des moinesa 29kiloton test conducted june 13 1962 at the nevada test site was buried in mountain pictures show huge cloud of radioactive dust with cars and pickups of spectators rushing away from it another test baneberry with yield of 10 kt was conducted december 18 1970 in vertical shaft some 900 feet deep at the nevada test site144 the fallout cloud rose about 10000 feet into the air145 and was tracked to the canadian border146 according to doe following baneberry new containment procedures were adopted to prevent similar occurrence147 the minimum depth of burial for even the smallest test is 600 feet148 an epw in contrast would be buried perhaps few tens of feet and the path by which it penetrated the earth would not be sealed fallout from such weapons would not be contained at all and standardyield epws under consideration would produce more fallout than lowyield epws improvements in accuracy also permit reduction in warhead yield for attacking buried targets four alamos scientists calculate that moderately hard structure buried at shallow depth could be destroyed by 15kiloton weapon with an accuracy of 100 meters or by 05kiloton weapon with an accuracy of 5 meters with both weapons burst on the surface earth penetration further reduces the yield needed 142 stephen younger nuclear weapons in the twentyfirst century alamos

underground nuclear explosions p 36 crs48 the combination of improved accuracy and earth penetration they argue sharply reduces the yield required and the collateral damage149 while the foregoing discussion has focused on technical aspects of nuclear weapon effects it must be kept in mind that even lowyield earth penetrator weapons could depending on the circumstances kill large numbers of people the calculation for such weapon burst near damascus cited above illustrates this point history through the fy2003 budget cycle interest in destroying buried targets traces back to the early days of the cold war when the soviet union first built underground command posts and missile silos current interest in epws for use against hdbts traces back to the persian gulf war as is detailed in the earlier section on lowyield rd this latter experience led to the development of the current epw the b61 mod 11 or b6111 b61 is the basic weapon while the mod number indicates modification converting the bomb to specific purpose delivery by particular aircraft etc the modification involved strong case and some internal strengthening because it entailed only minimal changes to the nuclear explosive package doe did not conduct nuclear tests of the weapon150 doe converted small number of older b617 bombs to b6111s in the mid to late 1990s the b61 11 however has its limitations the nuclear posture review stated according to purportedly leaked excerpts that the weapon has very limited ground penetration capability and cannot survive penetration into many types of terrain in which hardened underground facilities are located151 the growth in number of buried targets and the weaknesses of the b6111 led dod and doe to study rnep according to us strategic command officer our current arsenal developed in the cold war was not designed to address this growing worldwide threat of buried targets there are facilities today which we either cannot defeat even with existing nuclear weapons or must hold at risk using large number of weapons as result both the department of defense and the department of energy through the nuclear weapons council have approved study of how to effectively counter this threat this study of 149 bryan fearey paul white john st ledger and john immele an analysis of reduced collateral damage nuclear weapons comparative strategy

excerpts p 47 crs49 robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep will evaluate modifications to existing nuclear weapons that do not require nuclear testing152 linton brooks then acting administrator of nnsa provided further details on the study this study will examine whether or not two existing warheads in the stockpile the b61 and the b83 can be sufficiently hardened through case modifications and other work to allow the weapons to survive penetration into various geologies before detonating this would enhance the nations ability to hold hard and deeply buried targets at risk153 thus rnep would not necessarily be lowyield weapon john gordon then director of the national nuclear security administration stated in 2002 that the emphasis is on more standard yield system called an enhanced penetrator theres design work going on lowyield nuclear weapons154 the cited advantage of the higher yield is that while epws can destroy number of buried targets with less yield than surfaceburst weapon increasing yield increases the radius of damage to buried targets some of which may be too hard or too deep to destroy with lowyield weapon in july 2003 nnsa provided further detail on this topic the ongoing rnep study will select one of the two candidate bombs the study aims to retain all existing capabilities it is not part of the study to create new lower yields155 nnsa had planned to begin the rnep study in fy2002 by redirecting 10 million from directed stockpile work research and development program within stockpile stewardship156 as discussed below however fy2003 legislation had the effect of delaying this study into fy2003 for fy2003 the administration requested funds to begin this rnep study the planned budget for the study was 150 million year for fy2003fy2005 inclusive

included provision calling for national academy of sciences study on the short and longterm effects on civilians and military forces of an epw an aboveground nuclear explosion to destroy buried targets and use of conventional weapons to destroy wmd storage or production facilities158 representative markey offered an amendment on the house floor to bar permanently the use of funds to develop or test nuclear epw and to bar fy2003 funds for conducting feasibility study of that weapon the amendment was defeated 172243 on may 9 2002159 the senate armed services committee recommended eliminating funds for rnep and requiring the secretaries of defense and energy to report on rnep including military requirements employment policy targets and ability of conventional weapons to address types of targets that rnep would hold at risk160 the conference bill included the house provision for national academy of sciences study as of august 2003 it appears that the study will be completed around april 2004161 the conference bill fully funded rnep but barred obligation of fy2003 funds for it until 30 days after the report called for by the senate armed services committee had been submitted to the armed services committees dod submitted that report in classified form on march 19 2003 the study began on may 1 2003 with meeting of nnsa dod and nuclear weapons laboratory

amendment by senator dorgan to bar use of funds for rnep and adopted an amendment by senator nelson fl to require congressional authorization to start engineering development or subsequent phases of rnep in action on the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations bill the house appropriations committee recommended reducing rnep funds to 50 million for reasons noted earlier in the legislative actions in the fy2004 budget cycle section under aci the house appropriations committee recommended having rnep funds support penetration by conventional as well as nuclear weapons the committee directs that funding provided for the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep be used for research on the problem of deep earth penetration through hard or hardened surfaces including modeling and simulation of the use of advanced materials and varied trajectories and speeds the committee further directs that the national nuclear security administration nnsa coordinate the rnep research program with ongoing programs at the department of defense relating to research on earth penetration to maximize the dualuse applicability for both conventional and nuclear weapons164 the house agreed to this bill without amending the weapons activities account which includes rnep the senate appropriations committee recommended providing 15 million for rnep on september 16 as detailed under aci the senate tabled an amendment by senator feinstein to eliminate all fy2004 funds requested for rnep and adopted an amendment by senator jack reed that barred use of funds provided by hr 2754 for phase 3 or 63 or beyond for advanced nuclear weapon concepts including rnep conference issues and outcomes rnep was at issue in the energy and water development appropriations act conference action on it was of concern to many because of the four initiatives rnep is the one closest to deploying weapon in response to npr guidance non rnep aci studies are in early stages and enhanced test readiness and rescinding the lowyield ban are not weapons programs in contrast rnep if it proceeds would involve conversion of an existing weapon conversion under the current plan would not involve nuclear testing and would require much smaller production effort than would production of complete new weapons even if the conference decided to proceed with the rnep study and if congress later decided to proceed with the actual modification deployment would not likely be quick it took six years to develop the b6111 and certify it for acceptance into the nuclear stockpile165 though lessons learned from that

request volume 1 p 69 70 76 crs53 is submitted the budget for the next fiscal year is largely fixed without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could therefore not be implemented until the second fiscal year 2 alternatively without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could be implemented promptly only by taking the needed funds out of other programs similarly the move to phases 63 and 64 reflects how the program might be expected to advance if it proceeds the official however indicated that decision has been made on whether or not to proceed with rnep pending completion of the study169 the rnep study was initially projected to cost 45 million 15 million year for fy2003fy2005 the numbers however have changed for each year for fy2003 delay in submission of dod study required by the fy2003 national defense authorization act pl 107314 sec 3146 delayed the start of nnsas rnep study as result 60 million was spent of the 150 million appropriated for fy2004 congress cut the rnep appropriation to 75 million for fy2005 the request is 276 million vs the 150 million originally planned finally fy2006 not fy2005 will be the last year of the rnep study nnsa estimates the fy2006 request at 30 million the fouryear total is about 71 million owing to the uncertainties of the program nnsa could not as of early march 2004 project an rnep budget for fy2007fy2009 according to nnsa the studys cost has grown for number of reasons the 45 million did not take into account participation in the study by y12 plant which would make components of rnep or of pantex plant which would convert existing weapons into rneps their participation adds some 2 million doe has imposed additional project management requirements that add 2 million the rest of the increase comes from better definition of the requirements of the study refinement of cost estimates and an increase in surety safety security and use control of the proposed weapon on the latter point doe requires that any modifications of nuclear weapon look for ways to increase its surety170 nnsa says it has found ways to increase rnep surety and plans to do so critics are likely to view the outyear plan in the fy2005 budget request document as indicating an intent to proceed with rnep they may also question how the cost of the rnep study grew some 58 congress the media and others however have not generally had access to the information presented here on the rnep budget this report will add views of critics and others when they become available issues for congress would rnep promote deterrence in the post911 world new set of threats has come to the fore including threats from rogue states seeking wmd to deter rogue states rnep supporters maintain that the united states must hold

weapon surety program approved august 6 2001 section 4f crs54 only way to do so everet beckner nnsa deputy administrator for defense programs reportedly opined if weve got serious enemies in the world i would like them to be deterred as much as possible by our military capabilities i want them to be afraid of us171 similarly the house policy committee argued credible deterrence requires that the president be able to hold at risk the things most important to an adversary who would seek to attack america deep underground facilities including hardened bunkers and hardrock tunnels provide effective haven from attack the president should have options the options of conventional forces of precision conventional weapons and of nuclear weapons that are capable of holding all targets at risk172 critics question whether it is correct to apply the cold war model of deterrence to rogue states whose leaders might not be overly concerned about us nuclear attack on few facilities in their nation or about the casualties it would cause they might even expect to benefit from worldwide condemnation of the united states that an attack would likely generate furthermore some rnep critics argue that the use of any nuclear weapon would not be credible because of the massive damage and casualties that would result and thus would not enhance deterrence would rnep provide added military value rneps supporters note that the nuclear weapons council doddoe organization chaired by dod to coordinate nuclear weapons activities between the two agencies approved the conduct of the rnep study and that dod developed an operational requirements document for rnep that gives the desired specifications and capabilities173 they assert that rnep is not redundant with the b6111 because of the latter weapons limitations critics assert that nuclear epws are not needed they note brookss statement we have requirement to actually develop any new weapons at this time174 representative skelton stated the key to defeating hard deeply buried targets lies more in accuracy and penetration rather than the inherent explosive capability175 many conventional options are available for defeating such targets176 us forces demonstrated the ability of ground troops to attack tunnel complexes in afghanistan 171 john fleck should nuclear research resume albuquerque journal march 17 2003

endowment for international peace working paper 31 november 2002 p 1725 crs55 and the ability of precision conventional ordnance to destroy underground bunkers in iraq it would be better in this view to spend funds on improving the ability to destroy these targets with conventional means rather than on nuclear weapons would fallout from rnep bar use of the weapon critics of rnep point to at least one claim by epw supporters that lowyield epws would limit collateral damage sufficiently to contemplate their use177 rnep could well have significantly higher yields critics challenge this view they argue that epw could penetrate deeply enough to be fully contained so that the goal of benign earthpenetrating nuclear weapon is physically impossible178 as the descriptions of nuclear tests des moines and baneberry make clear for example nelson calculates one kiloton earthpenetrating mininuke used in typical thirdworld urban environment would spread lethal dose of radioactive fallout over several square kilometers resulting in tens of thousands of civilian fatalities179 under these conditions it is argued rnep would be unusable the vast resulting collateral damage to noncombatant populations would presumably limit employment of the weapon to retaliatory or intrawar preemptive use in scenarios of allout warfare involving another nuclear weaponstate with the resources to both construct such deeply buried targets and threaten the survival of the us as nationstate that is china and russia the weapon is strategically legally and morally unsuitable for preemptive or retaliatory counterproliferation warfare180 similarly representative frank stated we have said in afghanistan in iraq we are these days likely to be in an effort to rescue people from an oppressive government how welcome will our wagon be when it comes to nuclear arms do we tell the people of afghanistan do not worry we will free you from the taliban by using nuclear weapons within your country i think you undercut the whole notion that america can be coming to the rescue of the victims of oppression181 177 nelson lowyield earthpenetrating nuclear weapons p 2 references dowler and howard

may 9 2002 h2340 crs56 the argument over the extent of fallout rnep would cause is in the view of rnep supporters secondary to the key point which they contend is that circumstances might call for the use of this weapon president always has various military options and president since 1945 has chosen to use nuclear weapons nonetheless nuclear weapons might at some point be the only way to achieve critical military objective supporters argue in that case epws would be preferable in this view because they could achieve the desired result at lower yield and with less fallout than surfaceburst weapons for some such uses the b6111 might suffice but rnep may be needed for others would rnep have an adverse effect on nuclear nonproliferation on the issue of whether the united states should avoid researching epws in order to lead the rest of the world by example representative thornberry argued it is an interesting line of argument to say that we make the world safer when we tie our hands behind our back that the problem is with the united states and that if we would just set good example the saddam husseins and the kim jong ils and even the putins would fall right in line the problem is not american strength peace comes when america is strong and when america has additional options182 the united states in the view of rneps supporters will not cause other nations to abandon wmd programs by abandoning rnep nor they suspect would study development and deployment of rnep cause nations to pursue wmd programs they assert that deployment of the b6111 had such effect so they doubt that second epw would either critics see grave proliferation risks arising from rnep they ask how the united states can preach to rogue states to restrain their nuclear programs while this nation is exploring new nuclear weapon capabilities they see rnep as tailored for use against rogue states and fear that that implies us willingness to use the weapon for that purpose they foresee serious consequences from such use as representative markey said using one nuclear weapon will destroy our moral and political credibility to end the spread of weapons of mass destruction especially nuclear weapons183 in this view it is inconsistent for the united states to fight iraq because of wmd and then to develop wmd itself even studying rnep critics contend would imply that the united states is considering its use which could make nonnuclear weapon states accelerate their efforts to obtain nuclear weapons to deter us attack on them or to build new underground facilities at much greater depth will targets be available for rnep fewer nations hold potential future targets for rnep in early 2004 than was the case year earlier any government that emerges in iraq would in all probability be unable and unwilling to develop wmd for many years libya is in the process of giving up its wmd indeed president 182 us congress congressional record may 21 2003 h4506 183 ibid crs57 bush praised colonel muammar ghadafi of libya for making the right decision in ending its wmd programs184 moving from the strategic to the tactical level successful attack on deeply buried facility by an earth penetrator weapon would require precise targeting information yet events of the last year raise troubling questions on this score judging from press reports us intelligence failed to detect entire wmd programs in libya iran and north korea and detected chemical biological and nuclear weapon programs in iraq that apparently did not exist given that record critics may well question whether intelligence can be sufficiently precise and reliable to pinpoint underground bunkers to attack rneps supporters would note that iran and north korea pose much more serious nuclear threat than did iraq and libya iran agreed in december 2003 under pressure from britain france germany and russia to permit more intrusive inspections by the international atomic energy agency iaea it did so in order to prove that the iranian nuclear program is for civilian purposes gholam reza aghazadeh irans vice president was quoted as saying185 the inspections however discovered equipment and materials that could be linked to nuclear weapons186 shortly after these discoveries iran appeared to begin pulling back from full disclosure senior iranian official reportedly said that his country has given enough answers to the iaeas questions we have other research projects which we havent announced to the agency and we dont think it is necessary to announce to the agency187 north koreas statements have been contradictory and confusing for some time but press reports have presented evidence that that nation has program to produce highly enriched uranium plutonium and nuclear weapons and that it received aid from pakistan188 regarding the ability of tactical intelligence to provide the basis for nuclear weapon use rnep supporters would note that the bar against such use is extremely high but that many intelligence assets whether satellite imagery communication intercepts or information from defectors would be brought to bear to ensure that the target was in fact connected with wmd 184 us white

description during the cold war when the united states conducted nuclear tests on an ongoing basis it took 1824 months to prepare typical test with the end of the cold war and the start of moratorium on nuclear tests the clinton administration required us ability to conduct nuclear test in at most 24 to 36 months of presidential order to conduct the test dod and nnsa however found that it would take close to 36 months to test and they are uncertain as to their continued ability to test within even this length of time accordingly they recommended enhanced test readiness or moving to and maintaining posture in which tests could be conducted in less time they supported an 18month test readiness posture for fy2004 the administration requested 249 million to maintain the existing posture and transition to the 18month posture189 this figure is in addition to funds to maintain the nevada test site where nnsa would conduct any nuclear tests nnsa indicated that it has tightly integrated the test readiness and enhanced test readiness programs into one program called test readiness so that it would be difficult to split them into the two components of the requested 249 million however it would take at least 150 million to maintain the current 24 to 36month posture190 the ndaa provided the amount requested for test readiness the ewdaa did as well but conferees stated their expectation that nnsa would focus on restoring 24month posture before requesting significant additional funds to pursue an 18month posture consistent with the legislation nnsa plans to move toward 24month readiness posture in fy2004 and achieve it in early fy2005 it plans to reach an 18 month posture later in fy2005 and requests 300 million for fy2005 for test readiness technical background between 1951 and 1992 the united states conducted nuclear tests on routine basis with the numbers ranging from 96 in 1962 to 0 in 1959 and 1960 due to moratorium to 6 in 1992 the most recent year of us testing for total of 1030 tests191 as result the united states was always prepared to test although 18 189 us department of energy office of management budget and evaluationcfo department of energy

was minimal time to design and prepare most tests192 all us tests since 1963 have been held underground almost all at the nevada test site in october 1992 the united states began moratorium on nuclear testing that continues to the present ambassador linton brooks nnsa administrator said in december 2003 the policy of the united states is that there is not now need for testing he further stated that he did not see reason to resume testing in the next two or three years193 during the era of testing doe and its predecessors conducted several types of nuclear tests each with its own goals schedules and characteristics some are explained here it is useful to understand the differences in order to place test readiness in context weapons modification and development newdesign warheads ie those with new primary or secondary stage typically required nuclear testing most us nuclear tests were for weapons development in addition nuclear testing was occasionally used to understand problem in stockpiled warhead or to check fix made to correct the problem or for both purposes194 to conduct such tests the labs had to design the test fabricate oneofakind test device fabricate the diagnostics the elaborate set of instruments needed to gather the data and emplace and seal the device and diagnostics in shaft these tests typically required 18 to 24 months195 counting from when the test was placed on the test calendar until it was conducted196 most tests used standard diagnostics designing nonstandard diagnostics added time developing new warhead typically required several tests some fixes required one test others needed several most modification 192 us department of energy national nuclear security administration report to congress nuclear test readiness april 2003 p 6 193 the

explosion would affect military equipment materials electronics nuclear warheads etc by exposing them to radiation from nuclear explosion these tests typically used lowyield nuclear device designed to be reasonably predictable radiation source in these cases design and instrumentation of the device itself were not at issue the experiments required elaborate preparation such as creating vacuum chamber to test how xrays would affect satellites effects tests typically used horizontal tunnels and experimental chambers bored into mountain excavation of the site for one such test using three shifts day might take year198 planning the excavation emplacing the experiments and sealing the tunnels took added time such tests were inherently two to three year process199 small fraction of us tests were of this type stockpile confidence tests beginning in the 1970s doe would pull warhead from the field eg bomb deployed at bomber base modify it minimally as needed to make certain that its yield would not exceed the 150kt ceiling of the threshold test ban treaty and to make it compatible with testing procedures and test it the purpose was to assure that weapons produced in quantity and then deployed as distinct from oneofakind devices built for weapons development tests had the expected yield and met other basic performance criteria these tests typically used diagnostics comparable to weapon development tests but less complex than for effects tests they required less time for preparation than weapon development tests typically about year they were conducted in vertical shafts

experiments202 all these tests had yields below 20 kt203 such tests might be done in the future to respond to nuclear test by russia or china they would surely use existing instruments and nuclear devices and would probably involve experiments planned in advance to maximize their technical value nnsa finds that it may be feasible to conduct test of this sort in as little as six months though that posture would entail added costs compared to an 18month posture would divert personnel from other tasks and would require considerable advance preparation204 at present the only nuclearrelated tests that nnsa is conducting are subcritical experiments sces crs offers the following definition based on documents and on discussions with doe and laboratory staff subcritical experiments involve chemical high explosives and fissile materials in configurations and quantities such that selfsustaining nuclear fission chain reaction can result in these experiments the chemical high explosives are used to generate high pressures that are applied to the fissile materials twenty sces were held between july 1997 and september 2003 sces study the behavior of plutonium205 one common purpose is to determine if material changes induced by radioactive decay of aged plutonium would degrade weapon performance all have been held in tunnel complex about 1000 feet underground at nevada test site the united states sees them as consistent with the moratorium because they produce fission chain reaction they are also of value for maintaining the test site and exercising test related skills nnsa plans to conduct three sces in fy2004 and two or more in fy2005206 one of the fy2004 experiments named armando and two fy2005 tests unicorn and krakatau will be more complex than many of the earlier experiments unicorn for example will be the first conducted in vertical shaft dug from the surface according to nnsa initial site preparation for this experiment is underway this activity and the

u1a complex may be replaced by the joint actinide shock physics experimental research facility gas gun that accelerates projectile to high speed and sends it into mass of plutonium208 as result the schedule of subcritical experiments for fy2005 and beyond is uncertain209 in the future the most probable type of nuclear test as distinct from sces would be to resolve defect that emerged in stockpiled weapon to remedy safety or reliability problem such tests would probably be similar in form to weapon modification or development tests regardless of purpose any future tests would be the first done in conjunction with the stockpile stewardship program which came into existence after the moratorium began preparation for testing would involve three parallel tracks 1 technical work involving the nuclear explosive to fix warhead problem nnsa would assess the problem develop and implement solution and plan and execute test that would provide the precise information needed to certify the fix210 nnsa estimates that it would take around 18 months to prepare this type of test211 as discussed below some question this estimate technical preparation for other types of tests would take different lengths of time tests to make political statement could be done in less than 18 months if the needed support activities were in place and effects tests would take more than 18 months 2 support activities that can be done in advance to prepare for generic test such as conducting analyses of test safety training personnel who can prepare the diagnostic equipment for test

support activities for specific test would take specified length of time an nnsa source indicated that the need to spend 18 months to complete the first track is what led nnsa to select 18 months as the test readiness goal213 history through the fy2003 budget cycle when the 1992 moratorium started it was unclear how long it would last the legislation creating the moratorium permitted it to end sooner than july 1 1993 but president clinton continued it several times in the next several years at the same time he considered the possibility of return to testing his decision in august 1995 to press for true zeroyield ctbt as opposed to treaty permitting nuclear tests of very low yield was conditioned on several safeguards actions that the united states would take consistent with the treaty in order to protect us interests despite the loss of testing safeguard f was the understanding that if the president of the united states is informed by the secretary of defense and the secretary of energy that high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of nuclear weapon type which the two secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could longer be certified the president in consultation with congress would be prepared to withdraw from the ctbt under the standard supreme national interests clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required214 as result it was unclear how ready the nuclear weapons laboratories and the nevada test site should be to conduct nuclear test maintaining readiness to conduct test promptly would increase cost at the test site and the labs and require personnel to spend time on readiness rather than on ongoing tasks in november 1993 presidential decision directive president clinton decided to maintain the ability to conduct nuclear test in 24 to 36 months of presidential order to test this socalled test readiness posture was first established in fy1996215 congress the administration and others have expressed

resolution included number of declarations expressing the sense of the senate declaration 12e included the following language the united states is committed to maintaining the nevada test site at level in which the united states will be able to resume testing within one year following national decision to do so216 in its fy2001 report the foster panel argued that the current posture of 24 to 36 months was excessive and that the united states should not be in position where increasing test readiness was viewed as indicating major problem with the nuclear arsenal it noted some reluctance by nnsa and dod to increasing test readiness because the test moratorium seemed unlikely to end so that funds spent on test readiness would not be available for other projects it recommended test readiness posture of 312 months and having devices for nuclear testing available on short notice217 the purportedly leaked december 2001 nuclear posture review asserted that the current 23 year test readiness posture will not be sustainable as more and more experienced test personnel retire and the 23 year posture may be too long to address any serious defect that might be discovered218 there was some uncertainty over the state of test readiness in october 1999 secretary of defense william cohen in statement before the senate armed services committee maintained we would be able to conduct nuclear test within 18 months to two years of decision to do so219 the next day secretary of energy bill richardson testified the test site is up and running and ready while we are capable of fielding well instrumented test in 18 to 24 months my scientists tell we if pressed could conduct simple test in less than one year220 dod and nnsa conducted several studies between 1999 and 2003 to determine the time needed to conduct nuclear test and what the optimum posture should be based on these studies nnsa concluded that because of loss of expertise and degradation of some specific capabilities the us would more likely require about 36 months to test with less confidence in being able to achieve the 24month end of the range furthermore as time passes without further action the 36month posture is viewed as increasingly at risk221 216 us congress congressional record treaty with the russian federation on further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms the start ii treaty resolution

transition period and that sustaining it would cost 2530 million year thereafter for resources unique to nuclear testing vs about 15 million year for this purpose for the current posture assessed that the erosion of expertise over time due to retirements and the long time since the last nuclear test make the 2436 month posture more likely 36month posture with even that viewed as increasingly at risk and argued that 612 month posture would require substantial diversion of personnel and facilities at the laboratories and production plants and at the shorter end of that posture would represent major redirection of the stockpile stewardship program225 nnsa also noted that it costs some 225 million year to support general requirements at the nevada test site such as infrastructure personnel and equipment legislative actions in the fy2004 budget cycle in s 1050 section 3132 required the secretary of energy to achieve an 18 month nuclear test readiness posture by october 1 2006 and to maintain that posture thereafter if as result of the review for the report required by pl 107314 section 3142 the secretary in consultation with the administrator for nuclear security the head of nnsa determined that posture other than 18 months was preferable the secretary may and is encouraged to achieve and thereafter maintain that posture and shall submit report stating the preferred posture and the reasons for it nnsas report on test readiness however indicated preference for 18 months in hr 1588 section 3116 permitted doe to obligate not more than 40 percent of fy2004 funds for nuclear test readiness until 30 days after doe submitted the report required by pl 107314 section 3142 nnsa submitted that report dated april 2003 there were amendments to these provisions or any others on enhanced test readiness in the house or senate the house appropriations committee recommended eliminating the 249 million requested for enhanced test readiness on grounds of inadequate budget justification and dubious program credibility it was concerned with the openended commitment to increase significantly funding for the purpose of enhanced test readiness without any budget analysis or program plan to evaluate the efficiency or 224 us congress committee of conference national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 hrept 107772 107th congress 2nd session usgpo 2002 p 786 225 department of energy nuclear test readiness p 1 2 5 6 crs67 effectiveness of this funding increase226 it questioned nnsas ability to maintain an 18month readiness posture during test moratorium when that was the minimum time to prepare test when testing was ongoing it linked budget and program issues the committee will not spend money on perceived problem when the department of energy has not provided rationale or plan that addresses the underlying problems inherent in maintaining testing capability during testing moratorium227 the house passed hr 2754 as reported from the committee without amending the weapons activities section which includes test readiness the senate appropriations committee recommended providing the full 249 million requested but did not comment on the readiness program on september 16 the senate rejected an amendment by senator feinstein on various nuclear programs as detailed under aci one provision of the amendment would have barred use of funds in the bill for modifying the test readiness posture of the nevada test site to readiness posture of less than 24 months conference issues and outcomes with the house having eliminated the 249 million requested for test readiness and the senate having provided the full request the appropriation amount was at issue complicating decision the house eliminated 249 million for enhanced test readiness while the administration requested 249 million for test readiness some of the requested funds were to maintain the 24 to 36month posture and some were to transition to an 18month posture yet the house appropriations committee expressed concern over the latter even as it supports the continued maintenance of the nevada test site228 eliminating the 249 million would have eliminated funds for both postures if conferees decided to reduce funds for test readiness would they have eliminated the full request as the house voted to do or eliminated only the funds for moving to an 18month posture perhaps 99 million or settled on some other amount note that the nevada test site receives other funds for example the budget category nevada site readiness for which doe requested 396 million for fy2004 includes activities required to maintain the nevada test site nts that are not unique to the test readiness mission but do support the stockpile stewardship mission229 does submission of the test readiness report rendered moot the limit on obligations in the house defense authorization bill and the provision in the senate defense authorization bill regarding test readiness posture of other than 18 months those provisions were not at issue in conference while not matter in dispute between house and senate authorization conferees could have considered whether an 18month test readiness posture should be achieved by october 1 2006 as per the senate bill or by the end of fy2005 the date to which dod and nnsa agreed 226 us congress house committee on appropriations energy and water development appropriations bill 2004 hrept 108212 p 148149 227 ibid p 149 228 ibid p 148150 229 department of energy ft 2004 congressional budget request p 291 crs68 they could also have followed the house appropriations committees lead and required doe to provide more comprehensive justification before endorsing any approach the ndaa conference report did not address test readiness the ewdaa conference report provided the full funds requested but changed the test readiness posture the conferees recognize that test readiness activities in nevada were allowed to atrophy during the last decade under the current nuclear test moratorium however the conferees expect the nnsa to focus on restoring rigorous test readiness program that is capable of meeting the current 24month requirement before requesting significant additional funds to pursue more aggressive goal of an 18month readiness posture230 thus the conferees by basing their decision on the need for nnsa to restore 24month posture before proceeding to an 18month posture simultaneously avoided the issue of what aspects of test readiness would have been cut by reducing funds below the request expressed their support for reversing the atrophy of the test program pressed nnsa to restore rigorous test readiness program implied that it would be technically difficult to restore an 18month posture reflected concerns expressed by the house appropriations committee senator feinstein and others about moving to an 18month posture and left the door open to moving to that posture later the fy2005 budget cycle the fy2005 request for test readiness is 300 million231 as noted conferees on the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations conference report expect nnsa to move to 24month posture before requesting significant additional funds to move to an 18month posture nnsa indicates that that provision does not restrict its actions on test readiness it anticipates reaching 24 month posture in early to mid fy2005 and hopes to achieve an 18month posture by the end of fy2005232 unlike aci and rnep the budget document does not provide outyear budgets for test readiness nnsa estimates however that it can maintain an 18month readiness posture for 25 million year once it has established that posture which the fy2005 request would enable it to do issues for congress is an 18month test readiness posture desirable some see the current 24 to 36month posture as adequate in this view enhanced test readiness would divert resources as well as the time of experts to task that is unlikely to be carried out to the detriment of the ongoing stockpile stewardship program that has so far 230 committee of conference making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year

united states to maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing they believe that the current test readiness program has sufficient means to maintain skills such as subcritical experiments simulations and exercises they point to national academy of sciences panel that stated we judge that the united states has the technical capabilities to maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of its existing nuclearweapon stockpile under the ctbt provided that adequate resources are made available to the department of energys doe nuclearweapon complex and are properly focused on this task233 some fear that enhancing test readiness could have adverse international consequences one advocacy group was alarmed that the administration and congress would take steps toward resuming nuclear testing which would undo decades of arms control and set the stage for new arms race234 further us resumption of fullscale nuclear testing would threaten the viability of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty representative markey and 55 house colleagues wrote to the house appropriations committee that they are concerned that the proposed enhanced test readiness program will renew interest in testing among other nations235 stewardship may not require an 18month readiness posture in the view of those opposed to shortening the posture because test readiness could be improved on an ad hoc basis if needed it would in all likelihood take months to convince the president and congress that test was needed the interval between discovery of problem and political decision to test could be used for preliminary planning for the test reducing the time between the decision to test and the conduct of the test the other main purpose for testing beside stockpile stewardship is development of new weapons those favoring the current readiness posture see an 18month posture as irrelevant for that purpose the idea that the united states can only respond to particular threat by testing new weapon in 18 months and then producing and using it is not credible in this view given the massive us conventional and nuclear forces in being those who would enhance test readiness argue that the current posture is simply too long secretary of energy spencer abraham said should our scientists decide 233 national academy of sciences committee on technical issues related to ratification of the

nuclear test in much shorter time frame than the current three years236 nnsa says that the 24 to 36month posture has become closer to 36 month posture and even that is at risk as people formerly involved in the test program retire237 it is difficult to maintain skills that would be needed for resumption of testing under 24 to 36month posture it is argued because that posture implies that testrelated activities would only be minor part of the workload for staff who would be responsible for conducting nuclear tests more active test readiness program would sharpen their skills and help recruit people with skills needed for testing it may even prove infeasible to stabilize the posture at its present unsatisfactory level as skills will erode in this view the choice would be between continuing current trends and reversing them they dismiss charges that enhancing test readiness would lead automatically to testing decision to test would be decided separately by the president and congress those who would improve test readiness divide into two groups nnsa claims that 18 months is the optimal time an 18month posture is appropriate because this is the minimum time we would expect it would take once problem was identified to assess the problem develop and implement solution and plan and execute test that would provide the information needed to certify the fix an 18month posture also reflects what is cost effective while continuing to support other stockpile stewardship missions238 others feel that 18 months is too long as noted the senate called for one year test readiness posture and the foster panel recommended 312 month posture still others believe that changing the test readiness posture would have little practical significance because technical considerations determine the time needed to conduct various types of tests press report quotes raymond jeanloz member of the former nnsa advisory committee on this point the committee was told by the national nuclear laboratories that the nation would be able to perform test in 3 to 6 months if the goal was simply to produce an explosion he said from the labs point of view until they know why they would have to have test to address some hypothetical technical problem they dont know how long it would take them so this whole business of threeyear or oneandahalf year or halfyear delay before they can test is incredibly artificial he said239 236 spencer abraham facing new nuclear reality washington post july 21 2003 21 237 department of energy nuclear test readiness p 5 238 ibid p 6 239 david ruppe

council act 5 usc app and was reportedly disbanded in june 2003 ibid crs71 is an 18month posture feasible for stockpile stewardship or weapons development tests as discussed earlier tests to meet political need could be conducted rapidly while some complex tests such as effects tests would probably take longer than 18 months even with enhanced test readiness judging from history such tests would be rare at issue would be the time to conduct the most likely types of tests notably those to remedy problem in an existing warhead discovered through the stockpile stewardship program or those to design new warheads nnsa claims that an 18month posture should be feasible at the time of an active underground test program 18 months was minimal time to design and prepare most tests and is therefore reasonable indicator of the time that would be required to prepare device for testing if the details of the planned test are not known in advance240 critics respond that this argument is illogical if it took minimum of 18 months to prepare test when the test program was in full swing they ask how can the nuclear test program expect to establish that as maximum after more than decade without testing in the intervening years test expertise has eroded through disuse many people formerly in the test program have shifted to other areas or have retired or died fewer new staff have been trained with these skills than have left the test program construction crews would have to be found and trained new diagnostic instruments would have to be designed to replace technology from 1992 further nnsa would have to meet regulatory standards for environment safety and health added since 1992241 it may be possible to reach 18 months eventually but given the uncertainties costs and personnel issues it is uncertain when that could occur concluding observations debate over the four nuclear initiatives will in all likelihood continue for some years this report concludes by discussing some substantive and logical aspects of the debate that cut across the four initiatives the topics below speak to the nature of the debate in 2003 and may bear on it in future years four small issues or one large one supporters of the four initiatives argue that opponents are reading too much into the initiatives they are in this view unexceptional elements of nuclear weapons program each with its own justification supporters argue lifting the ban on lowyield rd simply permits scientists to study the full range of weapon issues as is the case for scientists in all other nuclear weapon states aci is for earlystage studies and rnep is just study that at most could lead merely to adding second type of earth penetrator weapon to the us inventory threeyear test readiness posture is much too long and testing may be needed for other purposes such as to check on fix to warhead type that developed defect as secretary of energy spencer abraham said 240 department of energy nuclear test readiness p 6 241 ibid p 10 crs72 we are not planning to resume testing nor are we improving test readiness in order to develop new nuclear weapons in fact we are not planning to develop any new nuclear weapons at all our goal is designed to explore the full range of weapons concepts that could offer credible deterrence and response to new and emerging threats as well as allow us to continue to assess the reliability of our stockpile without testing242 domestic and foreign critics see these measures as parts of whole military policy with lowered threshold against nuclear use they contend lifting the low yield ban will enable pursuit of moreusable weapons and aci will present the military with new weapon options in turn military requirements for these new weapons will lead to testing and enhanced test readiness will permit expedited testing and deployment of these weapons they view rnep as redundant since the united states has another nuclear penetrator the b6111 conventional penetrators and other nonnuclear options but believe rnep will make nuclear use that much more likely by giving the united states yet another nuclear option from this perspective these initiatives are consistent with other policy decisions such as the administrations policy of preemption its willingness to use all of our options its disregard for negative security assurances and its refusal to pursue the ctbt critics see this policy as extremely insensitive to world opinion at best and potentially dangerous nuclear preemption and use ambiguities and uncertainties the administrations policy statements leave crucial uncertainty in september 2002 the national security strategy of the united states of america stated to forestall or prevent attacks with wmd by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively243 and in december 2002 the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction stated the united states will continue to make clear that it reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force including through resort to all of our options to the use of wmd against the united states our forces abroad and friends and allies244 these two statements do not specifically declare that the united states will use nuclear weapons preemptively against possible wmd attacks nonetheless critics take them together as sign that the administration is contemplating just such course is the administration willing to rule out preemptive use of nuclear weapons it may prefer ambiguity on this issue whether because it has not reached decision or as tactic to extend deterrence but by removing ambiguity declaring that it would not use nuclear weapons preemptively the administration could reduce fears worldwide about possible nuclear war at issue for the administration is deciding whether the benefits of resolving this ambiguity outweigh the costs will the new weapons deter the administration expressing concern about the terrorist wmd threat discusses purpose of new or modified nuclear 242 spencer abraham facing new nuclear reality washington post july 21 2003 21 243 us president the national security strategy of the united states of america september 2002 p 15 244 us white house national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction december 2002 p 3 crs73 weapons as being to counter wmd facilities the administration may wish to clarify how the nuclear initiatives or any military means for that matter could deter or retaliate against terrorist wmd threat if the perpetrator is unknown or is known but has known address what targets would be attacked and would new weapons offer any advantage for such attacks are any assets of sufficient value to terrorists that holding them at risk might deter terrorist attacks if so would current us nuclear and conventional forces suffice for that purpose could the united states perhaps deter terrorist use of wmd by threatening to overthrow using conventional forces regimes that support terrorism or by threatening to destroy using nuclear or other forces facilities that these regimes see as critical there is more fundamental deterrence issue deterrence depends on holding at risk assets of great value to the leadership but while the united states was able to calculate what assets needed to be held at risk to deter the soviet union and vice versa the united states cannot simply assume that what deterred the soviet union would deter rogue states the leaders of nucleararmed rogue state might calculate that the united states would not use nuclear weapons against them because of the risk of international opprobrium or that us nuclear weapons would not have decisive effect on the regime because it could hide or bury its own wmd and the facilities of highest value to the leaders they might be willing to accept the use of several nuclear weapons against their country especially if they follow the us debates and come to believe that the united states would only use few lowyield weapons of limited effectiveness will research lead to testing acquisition and use key concern of opponents of nuclear testing is the prospect that aci rnep and lowyield weapons development could lead to nuclear tests one could imagine various ways in which these programs could lead to tests lifting the ban on lowyield rd for example might lead to aci developing new types of lowyield warheads earth penetrators chemical and biological agent neutralizers warheads with reduced neutron or enhanced gamma radiation output and warheads with reduced electromagnetic pulse future military interest in these warheads would in this view lead inexorably to testing yet there are plausible arguments that testing would not be needed the b6111 penetrator was converted from b617 bomb without testing and the rnep conversion anticipates converting an existing b61 or b83 without testing those warheads are available in number of yields it may be that loweryield option exists that would eliminate the need to develop newdesign epw the administration has enough confidence in nonnuclear interceptors to withdraw from the abm treaty in order to deploy system using them nuclear weapons tailored to destroy chemical and biological agents may not be needed the ability to destroy these agents is arguably much more dependent on precise intelligence than on weapon characteristics some doubt the efficacy of nuclear weapons to destroy such targets and some doubt that the advantages of avoiding contamination by chemical or biological agents outweigh the disadvantages of contaminating an area with radiation beyond that whether enhancing nuclear test readiness will lead to testing depends on policy rather than technical judgments on future weapons rd crs74 some critics of the administrations nuclear initiatives fear that studying nuclear weapon concepts or new weapons will lead to their use but that result is far from inevitable supporters reply nuclear weapons are an option available to the united states but so are conventional forces diplomacy and economic leverage the united states has had lowyield nuclear weapons continuously since the 1950s and might have benefitted tactically from using them in the korean war cuba and the vietnam war yet despite these military benefits and options presidents refrained from using these weapons it appears then that nuclear weapons would only be used as last resort on the other hand any new weapon would provide president with wider range of options for nuclear use president might find options made available by current nuclear weapons to be unacceptable but new weapon might tilt the tradeoff between costs and benefits in favor of nuclear use any new weapon has limits to its military value the claim that epws may be the only way to destroy certain hardened and deeply buried targets does not mean that any nuclear epw will destroy any such target rather nuclear epws would make difference only against some specified range of targets bunker hardened to given level and buried to depth x could be destroyed by conventional epw and buried more deeply at depth could not be destroyed by nuclear epw of 5 kilotons yield only if the facility is buried between depths x and would that epw make difference the united states could increase the weapons yield permitting it to destroy the bunker at greater depth but the target nation could counter by increasing the hardness of the bunker burying it deeper or camouflaging its location further the us intelligence may not know details of the geology above the bunker or of the layout of tunnel complex both of which may greatly affect the weapons effectiveness thus the weapon adds military value over only specific range of targets for other versions of
