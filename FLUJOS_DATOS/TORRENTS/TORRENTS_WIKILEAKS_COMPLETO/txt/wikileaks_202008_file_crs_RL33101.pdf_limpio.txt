kind of official recognition accorded to indian tribes1 they also seek this legislation because there is process by which federal administrative agency can accord such recognition to native hawaiian

and executive branches nd thus not susceptible to judicial scrutiny41 it found that since congress had not dealt with native hawaiian groups as governments doi regulations were implementation of congressional policy the tria l court also found that the regulations did not violate equal protection because they satisfied the rational basis test articulated in morton v mancari 42 and were legitimate exercises of the congressional power in indian affairs the appellate court viewed the issue diffe rently it did not focus on whether the decision to extend federal recognition to one group and not to another was political question instead it looked to the precise claim of the native hawaiians and determined that the constitutionality of dois decision to exclude native hawaiians from participating in the fe deral acknowledgment process is subject to judicial review under the federal ad ministrative procedure act43 it further determined that the deferential rationa l basis standard of morton v mancari applied since the regulations dealt with recognition of political entities excluding native hawaiians was found to meet the rati onal basis test because th acknowledgment regulations were viewed as being grounded in the i ndian reorganization act which has provision excluding hawaii44 the court noted that congress had similarly excluded native hawaiians from coverage under the i ndian selfdetermination and education assistance act45 the court also seemed to imply that congressional differentiation between indian tribes and native hawaiians dates back to the 19th century when treaties were entered into with the kingdom of hawa ii in 1875 and 1887 despite the existence of an 1871 law forbidding treaties with indian tribes46 it concluded that congress has evidenced an intent to treat hawaiian natives differently from other indigenous groups47 and has done so because t he history of the indigenous hawaiians who were once subject to government that was treated as coequal sovereign alongside the united states until the governance over internal affairs was entirely assumed by the united states is fundamentally different from that of indigenous groups and federally recognized indian tribes in the continental united states48 finally the appellate court looked at the differe nt sets of entitlements congress has established for native hawaiia ns and for indians and determined that it is rational for congress to establish two sets of programs for the two different groups and given that fact equally rati onal for doi to exclude native

expressed dissatisfaction with its decision to do so although we conclude that the department of interiors exclusion of hawaiians passes constitutional muster we recognize that in many ways the result is less than satisfactory we would have more confidence in the outcome if the department of interior had applied its expertise to parse through history and determine whether native hawaiians or some native hawaiian groups could be acknowledged on governmenttogove rnment basis it would have been equally rational if perhaps not more so for the department to have decided to undertake that inquiry in the first instance50 rice v cayetano in rice v cayetano 51 the supreme court struck down as violating the fifteenth amendment prohibition against racial discrimination in voting provision of hawaiis

did not involve th legitimacy of state programs benefitting native hawa iians nor did it involve the question of whether purely private native hawaiian organization could limit its franchise the issue was the legality of closing the voting rolls in an election for state office to everyone other than persons of native hawaiian lineage the court concluded that limiting voting to persons whose ancestors were in hawaii at specific time was essentially using ancestry as proxy for race 528 us 495 514 with respect to the argument advanced by the state of hawaii that limiting the voting to native hawaiians could be sustained under the same rationale that has been applied to members of indian tribes in cases such as morton v mancari the court stated if hawaiis restriction were to be sustained under mancari we would be required to accept some beginning premises not yet established in our case law among other postulates it would be necessary to conclude that congress in reciting the purposes for the transfer of lands to th state and in other enactments such as the hawaiian homes commission act and the joint resolution of 1993 has determined that native hawaiians have status

states and that trust relations hip has been established with native hawaiians by virtue of their state of dependency at annexation and has been manifested in the protective legisl ation enacted by congress since 1920 the descendants of native hawaiians share with the descendants of the native americans on the mainland or in the aleutian islands not only history of subjugation at the hands of colonial forces but also purposefully created specialized guardianward relationshi p with the government of the united states it follows that legislation targeting the native hawaiians must be evaluated according to the same understanding of equal protection that this court has long applied to the indians on the continental united states that special treatment be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the native peoples54 doe v kamehameha schools third recent decision doe v kamehameha schools 55 involved the admissions polic of the kamehameha schools

descendant of the dynasty that ruled hawaii in the 19th century its admission policy esse ntially excludes persons not able to trace their lineage to aboriginal inhabitants of the hawaiian islands ie those in hawaii before captain james cook the fi rst westerner who landed in 1778 the court found the policy to violate 42 usc 1981 federal civil rights statute that prohibits racial discrimination in the offering and making of private contracts the court found that there was requirement in the trust in strument that enrollment be limited to native hawaiians kamehameha had conceded that the admissions policy was based on race the court ruled that rather than the strict scrutiny standard applicable to racebased classifications in fourteenth amendment equal protection cases56 it would

arguments each of which was rejected by the court the first justification as an affirmative action plan was rejected because unlike affirmative acti on plans that had been upheld by the supreme court kamehamehas admission policy ignored the rights of other races58 the second inferring congressional intent as to how to interpret 1981 from scattered statutes was reject ed on relevance grounds as well as for lack of precedent the third whether special relationship exists with native hawaiians to preclude the racial classification was not analyzed because kamehame had conceded that the preference was based on race in dissent judge graber stated that she would have upheld the admission policy essentially she would infer congressional intent to permit the native hawaiian preference to continue at the ka mehameha schools by harmonizing 42 usc 1981 as amended in 1991 with another statute enacted that same year according to her reasoning congress in amending 1981 and in the same year

relinquished to the united states their claims to their inherent sovereignt as people over their nationa l lands either through the kingdom of hawaii or through plebisc ite or referendum and 2 expresses commitment of congress and the president among other things to acknowledge the ramification of the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii71 further findings include one that native hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly native areas in hawaii72 to maintain their separate identity as distinctive native community through cultural social and political institutions and to give expression to their rights as native people to selfdetermin ation selfgovernance and economic self sufficiency73 there are also findings to the effect that congress has declared that the united states has special responsibility for the we lfare of the native peoples of the united states including native hawaiians that it has identified native hawaiians as distinct group of indigenous native people of the united states within the scope of its authority under the constitution and has enacted scores of statutes on their behalf and that it has delegated broad authority to the state of hawaii to administer some of the united states res ponsibilities as they relate to the native hawaiian people and their lands74 there are specific findings that the united states has recognized and reaffirmed the special political and legal relationship with the native hawaiian people through the ad mission act and that the united states has continually recognized and reaffirmed that native hawaiians have cultural historic and landba sed link to the aboriginal indigenous native people who exercised sovereignty over the hawaiian islands that na tive hawaiians have never relinquished their claims to

do not view the legislation as racebased they align native hawaiians with indians and thereby subject to the provisions in the us constitution giving power to congress in indian affairs including the

the europeans82 at march 1 2005 senate committee on indian affairs hearing on s 147 hawaiis governor linda lingle directly confronted the charge that the legislation is racebased both by invoking the history of us treatymaking with the hawaiian kingdom and the history of the questionable events culminating in annexation as evidence of political and not racial relationship with the native hawaiian people she also claimed that without s 147hr 309 the treatment of native hawaiians is racebased discrimination when contrasted with treatment of indians and alaska natives with respect to sel fdetermination she stated the united states is inhabited by three indigenous peoples american indians native alaskans and native hawaiians while these three indigenous groups differ in culture history and anthropological origin all share three f undamental attributes 1 they were here long before any european explorer ever set foot on the north american continent or the hawaiian archipelago 2 they liv ed according to their own governmental structures on their homelands long before the federal government of the united states was imposed upon them and 3 the united states historically acknowledged their existence as distinct nations congress has given two of these three populations full self governance rights the native hawaiian government reorganization act allows native hawaiians to receive parity with the nations other indigenous peoples to withhold recognition of the native hawaiian people therefore amounts to discrimi nation since it would continue to treat the nations three groups of indigenous people differently83 in the rice v cayetano litigation moreover the ited states in its amicus brief took the position that congress has ready designated native hawaiians as group subject to

tribecongress has identified native hawaiians as distinct indigenous group within the scope of its indian affairs power and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility congress determination that native hawaiians constitute distinct indigenous group for whom it may enact special legislation is entirely rational native hawaiians have cultural historic and landbased link to the indigenous people who have exercised sovereignty over the hawaiian islands and that group has never relinquished its claim to its sovereignty or it sovereign lands petitioner seeks to derive from the indian commerce clauses reference to tribes requirement that congress may only take action on behalf of indigenous groups with presentday tribal governments to the framers of the constitution however an indian tribe was simply distinct group of indigenous people set apart by their common circumstances definition that native hawaiians satisfied in 1778 and satisfy today moreover congress has concluded that it has trust obligation to native hawaiians precisely because it bears responsibility for th destruction of their government and their loss of sovereignty over their land the constitution is not so selfdefeating as to make the very reasons that congress has concluded that it has trust responsibility serve as an obstacle to the fulfillment of that responsibility nor is the existence of tribal government necessary to make legislation on behalf of indigenous people nonracial congress does not extend services to native hawaiians because of their race but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of oncesovereign nation as to whom the united states has established trust relationship84 one of the factors at the base of the charge that the legislation is racebased is the use of lineal descent in defining the class of persons eligible for inclusion in the membership of the native hawaiian entity proponents of the legislation however note that the use of lineage and blood quantum is customary in federal indian law not only do many tribes require gree of indian blood for membership85 but the federal government has also used this as determinant of whether or not person is to be considered indian for specified purpose as early as 1846 the supreme court having to determine what indian meant in federal criminal statute concluded that it required both identif ication by tribe and blood quantum86 there are myriad federal statutes over the c ourse of united states history drawing distinctions based on blood quantum or lineal descent for example the indian reorganization act on which the regulations at issue in morton v mancari were based defines indian to includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33101crs21 87 25

hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the united states their claims to their inherent sovereignty as people over their national lands either through the kingdom of hawaii or through

has been contested recently by former senators slade gorton and hank brown in an article in the august 16 2005 wall street journal 16 they contend that the apology resolution distorted historical tr uths that the united states was not involved in the overthrow of queen liliuokalani in 1893 that there was resistance to the insurgents and that the qu een authored her own ouster by planning coup against the hawaiian constitution to recapture m onarchical powers that had been lost in strong democratic current in their view under the kingdom sovereignty was shared by native and nonnative citizens they claim th at there was 21 margin in the native hawaiian vote for statehood in 1959 and that th is refutes the statement in the apology resolution that native hawaiians never reli nquished sovereignty to the united stateshawaiian monarchy and wr ested sovereignty from the native hawaiian people111 succinct exposition of the view of hawaiis history that appears to be in accord with that taken in the apology resolution is as follows when captain james cook sailed into hawaii anywhere from 200000 to 1 million people lived in highly orga nized social system based on communal land tenure all land was held in trust by the king and the concept of fee simple did not exist while the hawaiians were governed by four separate chiefdoms they had uniform culture language and religion in 1810 king kamehameha unified the islands under the kingdom of hawaii with us and european assistance western traders saw riches of fur sandalwood and whales and king kamehameha allowed wide access to these resources in exchange for western support of his monarchy the united st ates as well as most of the world recognized the kingdom of hawaii as an independent sovereign by 1826 from 1810 to 1893 hawaii gravitated further into the hands of the west hawaiians introduced fee simple land ow nership to satisfy western interests the great mahele or great division ended the islands communal land arrangement by apportioning onethird of the land to the crown onethird to the government and onethird to native hawaiians in actuality native hawaiians although promised ownership in land they had cultivated received less than one percent of the allotted land and those who did receive land did not understand the nature of their title in fa ct many native hawaiians sold their land without comprehending the legal ramifications further the population of the islands changed dramatically the burgeoning westernowned sugar and pineapple plantations hungered

113 bruce feins testimony at 9 fein also asserts that native hawaiians are not separate community they are spread all over the united states and that there never was government of native hawaiians both becaus the kingdom had only one sovereign not sovereign people and because its subjects were native and nonnative alikelaborers creating an infusion of labor fro m asia germany and spain by the midnineteenth century native hawaiians were poor plagued by new diseases brought by foreigners and landless by 1900 native hawaiians constituted only half of the islands population the year 1893 marked the end of the hawaiian kingdom the monarch of hawaii queen liliuokalani sought to reestablish native control she had secretly written new constitution for hawaii to replace an earlier one written by western business interests in 1887 and forced upon previous king the constitution that the queen sought to replace guaranteed white landowners substantial control in hawaiian government liliuokalanis constitution in contrast would have eliminated western influence by granting voting rights exclusively to native hawaiians further her constitution would eliminate the many cabinet positions filled by american s those with commercial interests in hawaii panicked and within days the united states through its military troops retaliated with force queen liliuokalani with military force assembled near her palace relinquished power to the united states immediately us controlled provisional government sprang to life and sought annexation president cleveland however demanded the restorati on of the monarchy and declared the overthrow of queen liliuokalani an act of war by 1898 however president mckinley answered the call of manifest destiny and annexed hawaii suddenly 18 million acres became part of the united states without the payment of any compensation112 other commentators have ch allenged this interpreta tion and it has been argued that the monarchy was ove rthrown without the collusion of the united states or its agents the native hawaiian people enjoyed more inherent sovereignly under the kingdom than did nonnative hawaiians in an event sovereignty at the time of the overthrow rested with queen liliuokalani not the people the public lands of hawaii belonged more to native hawaiians th an to nonnative hawa iians and there was never legal or moral obligation of the united states or the provisional government after the overthrow to obtain the consent of native hawaiians to receive control over the crown lands113 the interaction of hawaiis history with that of the united states is matter of complex and multiple inter acting forces and indivi duals about which political scientists historians and contemporaneous observers ve disagreed

their land by virtue of inherent tribal sovereignty and federal statute116 since they are neither federal nor state governmental entities in their relationship to their members they are not subject to the restraints placed on government by the federal constitution117 for this reason congress enacted the indian civil rights act 25 usc 1301 et seq applying many of the safeguards of the fe deral bill of rights to indian tribal governments s 147hr 309 does not establish any civil or criminal jurisdiction or any specific limits on the jurisdiction of the native hawaiian governmental entity that may
