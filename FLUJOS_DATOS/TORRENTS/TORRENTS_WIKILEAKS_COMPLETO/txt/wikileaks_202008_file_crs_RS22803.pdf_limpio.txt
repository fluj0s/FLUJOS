the interest earned on bonds issued by other states and their political subdivisions1 some argue that these state tax schemes violate the commerce clause by discriminating against outofstate bonds courts in two states have examined this issue on november 5 2007 the us supreme court heard oral argu ments in one of these cases department of revenue of kentucky v davis the commerce clause provides that congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several states2 the supreme court has long held that the clause prohibits states from unduly burdening interstate commerce even in the absence of federal regulation this restriction known as the dormant or negative commerce clause reflects central concern of the framers that the new union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic balkanization that had plagued relations among the colonies and later among the stat under the articles of confederation3 thus the dormant commerce clause prevents state from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the nation as w hole as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its bor ders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear4 further rationale is that outofstate entities subject to any burden are likely not in position to use the states political process to seek relief5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22803crs2 6 see complete auto transit inc v brady 430 us 274 279 1977 7 pike v bruce church inc 397 us 137 142 1970 8 camps newfoundowatonna inc v town of harrison 520

14 id at 179596 internal citations omittedthe dormant commerce clause prohibits state laws that discriminate against interstate commerce6 thus while state law that regulates evenhandedly to effectuate legitimate local public intere st and has only incidental effect on interstate commerce is constitutionally permissible unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits7 the pike test discriminatory state law is virtually per invalid8 traditionally such laws have only been permissible if they meet the high standard of advancing legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by r easonable nondiscriminat ory alternatives9 it would appear therefore that the bond taxing scheme s used by almost all of the states which exempt the interest on stateissued bonds while taxing the interest on other states bonds are facially discriminatory and should be subject to high level of scrutiny however wrinkle to this analysis was added in april 2007 when the supreme court decided case united haulers assn inc v on eidaherkimer solid waste mgmt authority 10 in which plurality of the court subj ected facially discriminatory state law to lower standard of scrutiny because it be nefitted public entity as opposed to an in state private entity the challenged law required trash haulers to deliver waste to processing facility owned by public entity the court had previously struck down similar law11 but distinguished the two cases because the processing facility in the prior case was privately owned while the united haulers facility was publicly owned in united haulers the court found compelling reasons for distinguishing between state laws that favor governmental units and those that favor instate private entities over their competitors12 the court stating that any notion of discrimination assumes comparison of substantially similar entities reasoned that state and local governments are not substantia lly similar to private entities due to their public welfare responsibilities13 these responsibilities the court ex plained meant that laws favoring governmental units have any number of legitimate goals while laws favoring instate private entities generally represen t simple economic protectionism14 thus the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22803crs3 15 id at 1795 16 id at 1796 17 id at 1797 internal citations

cert granted 127 s ct 2451 2007reasoned such laws should not be viewed with equal skepticism15 the court explained that treating them equally would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government which was particular ly inappropriate when the challenged law addressed traditional g overnment function such as waste disposal16 majority of the court could not agree on the standard under which to examine laws favoring public entities plurality of four justices stated that the proper standard was the pike test that is whether the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to th putative local benefits17 the plurality did not find the challenged laws burden to be excessive to its benefits which included providing health and environmental bene fits and an effective way to finance wastedisposal services18 market participant doctrine the dormant commerce clause is not implicated when state acts as ma rket participant as opposed to ma rket regulator this is because the commerce clause responds principally to state taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national marketplace and there is indication of constitutional plan to limit the ability of the states themselves to operate freely in the free market19 the market participant doctrine does not apply when the state is acting in its governmental capacity by assessing and computing taxes20 court cases it appears only two cases have addressed whether state ws taxing interest earned on bonds issued by other states while exemp ting interest earned on bonds issued by that state violate the commerce clause in 1994 an ohio appellate court held in shaper v tracy21 that such treatment was constitutional in 2006 the ke ntucky court of appeals held the opposite in kentucky department of revenue v davis 22 in november 2007 the us supreme court heard oral arguments in davis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22803crs4 23 see shaper v

the shaper case an ohio court of appeals rejected the claim made by an ohio taxpayer that the stat bond taxing scheme was unconstitutional the court began by agreeing with the taxpayer that the market participant doctrine did not apply because ohio was acting as market regulator and not participant when it determined how to tax outofstate bonds23 however the court then ruled that the taxing scheme did not implicate the commerce clause because the scheme benefitted the state24 the court based this conclusi on on its analysis of the supreme courts commerce clause jurisprudence which the court found to only invol ve challenges to state actions giving in state private entities competitive advantage over outofstate entities and not challenges to state actions benefitting the state itself25 the court while noting that supreme court decision was directly on point found two cases to be useful the first was bonaparte v tax court26 in which the supreme court determined that state law exempting stateissued public debt held by residents while taxing nonresidents did not vi olate the full faith and credit clause27 the court placed significance on the supreme courts statements in bonaparte that the constitution does not prohibit state from including in the taxable property of her citizens so much of the registered public debt of another state as they respectively hold although the debtor state may exempt it fro m taxation or actually tax it and we know of provision of the constitution of the ited states which prohibits such taxation28 the second case was south carolina v baker 29 in which the supreme court held that the federal government coul d tax stateissued bonds30 while noting that the tax in baker was not challenged under the commerce clause the shaper court quoted the supreme courts statement that the owners of state bonds have constitutional entitlement not to pay taxes on income they earn from the bonds nd states have c onstitutional entitlement to issue bonds paying lower intere st rates than other issuers31 the court after noting that ohio had legitimate interest in tapping major source of tax revenue and bond purchasers are major beneficiaries of th public purposes for which the bond proceeds would be used concl uded by stating it could not hold the ohio law unconstitutional given the lack of any precedent to apply the commerce clause to this type of taxation scheme32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22803crs5 33 dept of revenue of kentucky v davi s 197 sw3d 557 562 ky ct app 2006quoting associated industries of missouri v

held that the states bond taxing scheme violated the commerce clause the court began by noting that th fundamental command of the commerce clause is that state may not tax transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the state and therefore discriminatory state laws were presumptively invalid33 based on this the court reasoned that clearly kentuckys bond taxation system is facially unconstituti onal as it obviously affords more favorable taxation treatment to insta bonds than it does to extr aterritorially issued bonds34 the court rejected the states ar gument that it should adopt the shaper courts holding stating that the shaper analysis was incomplete because potentially problematic and constitutionally infirm statute does not become permissible simply because it has not been previously f ound to be unc onstitutional35 the court also dismissed the relevance of the bonaparte decision because it dealt with the full faith and credit clause and not the commerce clause36 finally the court rejected the argument that kentuckys taxing scheme did not implicate the dormant commerce clause because the state was acting as market participant explaining that kentucy was market participant when issuing the bonds but mark et regulator when choosing how to tax its citizens37 the us supreme court heard oral arguments in the davis case on november 5 2007 transcript of the oral arguments is available on the supreme courts website at httpwwwsupremecourtusgovoral_arg umentsargument_transcripts06666pdf effect of united haulers on davis as discussed the supreme court decided united haulers just prior to granting certiorari in davis under the courts jurisprudence prior to united haulers it seems there was signifi cant chance that kentuckys bond taxing scheme would be unconstitutional because it facia lly discriminates against outof state entities and the courts jurisprudence suggested that such laws were impermissible unless the state could show the law served legitimate state purpose and there were other reasonable ways to advance that purpose this high level of scrutiny is generally fatal to the challenged state law the united haulers decision suggests different out come by indicating that less stringent analysis applies when the state law benefits state and local governments as opposed to instate private entities ques tions exist about how the court may apply united haulers to davis in part because only plurality in united haulers agreed it was appropriate to use the pike test in examining the permissibility of state laws benefitting public entities furthermore it is possible the court will distinguish davis from united haulers one basis for doing so is that the state law in

states tax treatment of bonds see also edward zelinsky davis incoherence of dormant commerce clause nondiscrimination tax notes at 5960 61 july 2 2007 argui ng that the supreme court should use davis to reconsider the dormant commerc clauses nondiscrimination concept because it makes sense that any tax expenditures can be transformed into an economically and procedurally equivalent direct expenditu re and the focus on protectionism and economic effect is overly broad because all state activity is protectionist in nature 41 see eg prudential insurance co v benjamin 328 us 408 434 1946 42 see quill v north dakota 504 us 298 31819 1992publicly owned entity over private entities while the one in davis benefits states over other states38 the courts analysis in united haulers was based on its finding that while any notion of discrimination assumes comparison of substantially similar entities governmental units and private entities are not substantially similar because the former have public welfare responsib ilities not imposed on the latter thus key question in davis seems to be whether kentucky is substantially similar to the other states whose bonds it taxes39 if so that could be constitutiona lly fatal for kentuckys bond taxing scheme on the other hand if the c ourt does apply an analysis similar to united haulers in davis this suggests that kentuckys taxing scheme would be constitutionally permissible policy concerns such as desi re to not upset the state bond market and the expectations of bond purchasers could provide additional justifications for the court to find the taxing scheme to be constitutional40 congressional authority to address the issue congresss authority under the commerce clau has been described as plenary and limited only by other constitutional provisions41 congress may therefore regulate by expressly authorizing the states to take an action that would otherwise be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce42 thus if the court were to hold that kentuckys taxing scheme violates the dormant commerce clause it appears congress could authorize such tax treatment so long as it did not violate any other constitutional provision
