geneticallyengineered ge roundup ready rr soybean seeds from the previous harv est practice prohibited in the united states for planting in subsequent years these groups also argu that south american farmers pay royalty fees on the saved see d unlike us farmers who are subject to technology fee when they purchase new seeds each year the cost saving to south american soybean growers on the technology fee alone nets out to about 8 to 9 per metric tona considerable co st advantage over us soybeans in the highly competitive international soybean market this practice also raises concerns

producti on and trade in genetically engineered ge crops controversy has emerged in recent years over the growing pirated use of roundup ready rr soybeans ge variety by producers in argentina and brazil2 this practice appears to provide competitive advantage to argentine and brazilian soybean exports and to be violation of the intellectual property rights ipr of the rr technology producer monsanto roundup ready soybeans roundup ready rr soybeans are genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate glyphosate also was developed by monsanto and is marketed under the brand name roundup rr soyb eans are patented in the united states by monsanto3 monsanto licenses the rr technology to seed companies which incorporate it into their conventional soybean varieties nd sell the ge seeds to farmers among other things the patent gives monsanto and those companies to whom it has licensed the technology more control in setting prices and restricting the pr oducts use for example us farmers pay technology fee estimated at 744 on each 50pound bag of rr planting seed4 in addition as part of signed purchase agreem ent us farmers are prohibited from saving seed from harvest for future planting or for resa to other farmers despite the additional cost and restrictions rr soybeans are favor ed over traditional varieties because they significantly lower production

particularly important to international oilseed markets since brazil represents essentially the last poten tial major source for nonge soybeans to world markets universal adoption of rr soybeans in argentina although rr soybean seeds are not patented in argentina monsanto has agreements with other seed firms in argentina allowing them to use the rr technology in their seeds as result argentine farmers have access to and have increasingly switched to rr soybean varieties in 2001 about 90 of argentinas soybean crop was planted to rr varieties7 the rr share of the 2003 crop is nearly 100 according to news reports an argentine seed law act 20247 1973 requires that all seeds must be certified for commercial use however argentine farmers have reportedly ignored this law and routinely save rr soybean seeds for planting or resale since the government does not enforce this law large black market for rr soybeans in argentina has developed that keeps seed prices low and discourages any attempts by monsanto or licensed companies to assess technology fees on rr soybeans according to monsanto it is not feasible to charge technology f ee on soybean seeds in argentina without patent protection8 as result argentine farmers save about 8 to 9 per metric ton on the technology fee9 this is considerable cost advantage over us soybeans in highly competitive international soybean

soybeans issued controversial rules governing the use sale and importation of ge soybeans under the rulings china will only accept ge soybeans that have been approved for export by the source country along with certain other conditions on january 10 2003 china rejected brazils initial application to export ge soybeans in part because brazil does not officially recognize the domestic production and export of ge soybeans in late march 2003 under pressure from producer groups the brazilian government announced temporar regulation 113 r113 as an interim measure allowing official sales of rr

wide range of exported food products in addition an important share of argentinas co rn crop is planted to ge corn varieties seeds of untraced origin in the future15 in addition brazilian soybean farmers are limited to planting ge seed stocks already on nd because r130 contains provision for importing or selling ge seeds in brazil also lack of any labeling protocol for ge crops is likely to complicate domestic marketing the lula government states that it is preparing comprehensive biosafety law to address these regulatory gaps but this legislation has been slow to emerge the lula government remains split on this issue the minister of agriculture favors prom pt legalization while the minister of environment is opposed and has asked fo r an environmental impact study before commercialization is allowed16 both ministers agree that rigid enforcement of existing regulations would mean the incineration of ll ge crops and the imprisonment of growers for 1 to 3 years at great cost to the countrys agricultural sector within brazil two principal camps argue against legalizing ge soybeans but for very different reasons some consumer and environmental groups argue that because the risks associated with ge crops are unknown th ey should not be legalized peasant groups such as the landless workers movement m st on the other hand are not against ge crops per but argue that legalizing ge crops will accelerate largescale farming and give control over brazils agriculture to multinational corporations such as monsanto17 brazilian producer groups claim that lack of access to rr technology would place them at competitive disadvantage in international markets to date significant market premium for nonge soybeans has emerged in either domestic or international markets sufficient to offset the cost advantages of adopting ge varieties given the rapid growth and widespread use of ge soybeans legalizing their commercial use may be the only viable solution for brazils government ge labeling in brazil brazils food labeling regu lation for products containing ge ingredients took effect on december 31 200118 the law mandates the labeling of all foods for human consumption when more than 4 of the ingredients are derived from ge commodities r113 the first temporary regu lation allowing ge soybean planting has imposed stricter ge labeling conditions on brazils food marketing system under r113 nonge soybeans are to be segregated with 0 tolerance level from ge soybeans19 in addition labeling is required on all shipments into or out of brazil with ge soybean

have significant market implications especially for global soybean markets first if brazil permanently legalizes ge soybeans nearly all about 90 of the worlds inte rnationally traded soybeans will be of ge varieties second decision in favor of ge crops will be nearly irreversible because of mixing in the distribution and transportation systems some analysts suggest that the current widespread planting of ge crops in br azil is already irreversible in short decision in favor of ge soybeans by braz il could do much to moot the debate about whether or not ge soybeans should be labeled or even traded because there simply would not be any major international supplier of nonge soybeans left us perspective according to the us trade representa tive the us is committed to policy of promoting increased intellectual property pr otection both through the negotiation of free trade agreements that strengthen existing international laws and through use of us statutory tools as appropriate22 the us administrations position regarding ge crops is that not only are food products made from ge crops as safe as their conventional counterparts but their production has the pot ential to spur agricultural productivity while benefitting the environment23 congress has generally supported this position for example both the senate sres 154 and the house hres 252 have passed resolutions in support of the administration s dispute settlement case at the world trade organization wto brought against the eur opean unions ban on imports of ge crops in hearings by the senate foreign relations

issue of rr soybean piracy in brazil was raised in testimony given by the asa and monsanto24 in the absence of patent protection in argentina or brazil accusations of ipr violationmay be difficult to
