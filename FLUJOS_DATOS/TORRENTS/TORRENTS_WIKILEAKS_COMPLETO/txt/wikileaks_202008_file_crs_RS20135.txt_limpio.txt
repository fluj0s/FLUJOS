1999 visit kerry dumbaugh specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary on april 8 1999 premier zhu rongji will begin his first official visit to the united states since his selection as chinas prime minister in march 1998 zhus visit is another important step in seemingly perennial effort to improve uschina relations although us policymakers have tried to lower expectations about the visits potential achievements there is widespread speculation that deal may be in the works that could pave the way for chinas accession to the world trade organization wto matter under negotiation for over decade now premier zhu has been candid about his hopes for such an agreement but both us and chinese government officials remain hamstrung by domestic political constraints that may make it difficult to reach accommodation on substantive matters president clinton is already under fire for his china policy which some critics allege has made too many concessions to beijing and has even compromised us national security although zhu is in stronger position at home his ability to make concessions sufficient for wto accession is constrained by chinas growing economic political and social problems some of which are the result of new painful reforms championed by zhu himself any agreement on wto that may come out of the zhu visit is therefore likely to be challenged by key constituencies in both countries background to current uschina troubles for the past decade the uschina relationship has continued to seesaw between notable improvements and frustrating setbacks eighteen months ago much about the relationship appeared destined to improve its prospects clinton administration officials continued to emphasize dialogue and engagement with chinese leaders and they believed that china had made important shifts in its willingness to abide by international agreements such as in its decision to minimize nuclear cooperation with iran hong kongs reversion to chinese rule anticipated with trepidation occurred without incident on july 1 1997 and despite the devastating financial crisis that affected all major asian countries beginning in late 1997 china appeared to be weathering the crisis relatively well congressional research service the library of congress crs2 and was applauded by american officials for not devaluing its currency the renminbi rmb taken in microcosm these developments suggested that greatly improved atmosphere was possible and they helped bring about the resumption of uschina summitry suspended since 1989 chinas president jiang zemin made state visit to washington in october 1997 and this was swiftly followed by president clintons state visit to china in june 1998 but concurrent with these positive developments unexpected challenges have also plagued the relationship and these appear to have intensified throughout 1998 and 1999 us officials are concerned about new chinese crackdown against political dissidence begun late in 1998 about reported buildup of missiles along the chinese coast facing taiwan and about the increasing us trade deficit with china chinese officials object strongly to us proposals involving theater missile defense tmd system in asia and they have warned of serious consequences if proposed tmd system should include defense of taiwan which beijing considers to be part of china disturbing reports surfaced in the american press suggesting darker aspect to the relationship one involving illegal chinese contributions to american political campaigns allegations that american aerospace companies may have illegally transferred sensitive satellite launch information to china and charges that china has conducted espionage in the united states problems also persist in the international arena while administration officials defend the engagement policy by referring to the benefits of chinese cooperation on north korea pakistan and india china is seen to be less cooperative in the security council on issues such as involvement in kosovo and macedonia1 it appears that both us and chinese officials are seeking ways to reduce tensions and reach accord on issues of mutual interest but while the willpower may be there given the significant constraints imposed by the current political environment many people are uncertain that meaningful agreement on substantive issues can be reached during zhus official visit in addition to disagreements with the united states over tmd chinese officials have strongly criticized the us decision in february 1999 to deny for security reasons export licenses to the hugh electronics corporation for 450 satellite intended for launch in china for its part the united states remains critical of chinas human rights record particularly in light of widespread recent reports about new crackdown against democracy activists in their efforts to form an independent political party us officials are also dealing with evidence that lax security procedures at us national science labs in the 1980s may have contributed directly to significant improvements in chinas nuclear weapons capabilities charge which chinese officials have denied the area most often mentioned as potential basis for accord is some type of forward movement on chinas application to join the world trade organization wto china is thought to have made its entry into the wto top priority and is frustrated that negotiations on its wto access have been going on for 13 years the united states contends that china needs substantially to reform its trade regime before it can gain wto entry china for its part has argued for more lenient accession terms that would allow 1 on february 25 1999 china used its security council veto to halt the extension of the peacekeeping force in macedonia in country since 1993 the vote was retaliation for macedonias recent diplomatic recognition of taiwan crs3 it to phase in needed reforms more gradually while many of these issues have yet to be resolved timing has become important this year for chinas wto accession since november 1999 wto ministerial meeting is likely to result in decisions that would make accession for nonmembers even more difficult thus 1999 is seen by many to be the last window of opportunity for chinas wto accession for the foreseeable future2 chinas goals and constraints china is now in the midst of decidedly ambitious 5year program for achieving series of sweeping reforms in economic and fiscal policy and in bureaucratic infrastructure among other things chinas leadership last year committed itself to keeping annual growth high and inflation low at 8 and 3 respectively3 reforming closing or privatizing chinas moribund stateownedenterprises soes and its frail and nearly insolvent state banks requiring the peoples liberation army pla to divest itself of its nonmilitary profitmaking corporate interests and reducing the bloated state bureaucracy including the number of government employees by as much as 50 although clearly such an ambitious reform program must have the active support of the senior leadership it is premier zhu rongji who is most closely associated with the reform agenda zhu has long had reputation for advocating the kinds of forwardlooking economic and structural reforms that american specialists have said china greatly needs in order to ensure its economic development goals often described as blunt spoken his directness and candor along with his willingness to hold live press conferences and take questions from reporters are generally perceived by americans as refreshing change from the usual staid approach taken by chinas senior leaders as premier position to which he was elevated in march 1998 for one 5year term zhu actively presides over and directs chinas state council bureaucracies thus he is not only considered the chief architect of chinas ambitious reform agenda but is also in charge of its implementation his position as head of the government bureaucracy gives him wideranging jurisdiction nevertheless he is most strongly associated with an economic portfolio and is often given the moniker of chinas economic czar although zhu in recent weeks has discussed number of the thornier issues in us china relations including tmd and taiwan he is thought to have placed chinas wto accession at the top of list of issues to discuss in washington according to chinese press reports zhu is putting together series of economic and trade measures that he hopes will result in an agreement with the united states on chinas accession to the wto4 although he has not gone into specifics about what these measures may be in 2 see crs issue brief 98014 chinas economic conditions and crs issue brief 91121

which he discussed broad range of issues in uschina relations zhu was quoted as saying that china was prepared to make the largest possible concessions for wto access this would be possible he said largely because continued economic reforms had given chinese leaders greater ability to supervise and regulate chinas economy 5 us trade experts have speculated that these concessions would include further reduction of tariffs on imports but according to zhus own statements chinese leaders also may be considering measures to allow direct foreign investment in key domestic markets that hitherto have been closed or highly restricted such as the telecommunications and electronics sectors banking services and possibly the agricultural sector6 only by encouraging competition in such sectors to quote zhu will there be ultimate benefit to these and other outdated and inefficient sectors in chinas economy7 even though zhu rongji may be willing to make significant concessions to assure chinas wto accession the more important question is whether he will be able to make them although he still appears to be in strong position politically at home the domestic reforms zhu has pushed for are painful cutting across wide group of constituencies that have vested interests in the status quo zhu remains potentially vulnerable to resistance and criticism from these groups many of whom are potential victims of the kind of international competition that wto obligations could bring almost exclusively the entities with something to lose from wto accession are part of the official state sector the private and entrepreneurial parts of the chinese economy already competitive stand to be the chief beneficiaries of wto membership this official concern about the state sector is serious complication in premier zhus efforts to gain support for substantive and meaningful economic concessions on wto zhus support for decision requiring the pla to sell off its moneyearning corporate interests for instance has won him few friends in chinas military establishment indeed key military leader vicechair of the crucial central military commission has been described in one press account as an unexpected leader in the say to zhu contingent in china8 there are others who may want to say to zhu ministers of state government bureaucracies faced with massive cuts in personnel and resources demobilized soldiers and workers at stateownedenterprises who may lose their jobs housing and medical care as result of soe reform some chinese and us economists also wonder whether such key protected sectors in china as telecommunications and agriculture can absorb the economic shock of an influx of highly competitive foreign imports without resulting in massive bankruptcies and widespread unemployment despite these constraints zhu is 4 continued 15 1999 in xinhua fbis online march 16 1999 5 ibid 6 in his march 15 press conference zhu said that china must introduce competition into the state telecommunications monopoly held by china telecom and suggested it was his intention to open the telecommunications market gradually to foreign investors he also suggested

commercially viable terms9 us goals and constraints according to administration officials broad range of issues in uschina relations will be on the table for discussion during premier zhus visit10 at the top of this us list are issues involving nonproliferation and chinas human rights record the latter being of particular congressional concern11 in addition according to one us official the united states will use the occasion of zhus visit to reaffirm our position on taiwan and to emphasize that the united states will continue to adhere to its obligations under the taiwan relations act12 in addition to these perennial concerns chinas potential wto membership is clearly also on the minds of us policymakers us trade officials have made number of trips to china within the last few weeks seen to be part of an intensive effort to reach accord on wto agreement and recent statements by us officials suggest that china has made substantial although still insufficient progress toward meeting wto requirements13 one recent trade publication has reported that china is offering to allow foreign investors 35 stake in telecommunications firms 40 stake in banks and 50 stake in insurance companies by the year 200514 still us officials have been endeavoring to lower expectations about the potential achievements of the zhu rongji visit in spite of the differences plaguing uschina relations many us policymakers find much to support in the principles behind chinas current reform agenda including new validation of the private sector the emphasis on market competition and attempts to place limits on the role of the communist state apparatus thus us officials may wish to find ways to support zhu rongji the reform agendas principal advocate in an effort to help him with his own political and economic problems in beijing an agreement paving the way for chinas wto accession would be the centerpiece of zhus visit and could 9 according to ustr charlene barshefsky the united

congressional tensions with the white house over broad range of issues in us china policy some have suggested that administration officials appear to have limited flexibility to make bold policy moves unless those actions have broad domestic support congressional actions congressional opinion remains divided on what the united states should seek to gain from premier zhus visit in dear colleague letter dated march 15 1999 proposing legislation to require prior congressional approval before the united states could support chinas wto accession senators jesse helms and fritz hollings stressed human rights and security issues saying the human rights situation in china has degraded significantly additionally we remain troubled by the allegations regarding the possible illegal transfer of technology to china as well as lingering questions over chinese espionage and involvement in us elections any trade agreement with china would be premature before these issues are resolved in floor debate on similar motion ultimately tabled by the senate senator hutchinson stressed common congressional themes skepticism about chinese promises doubts about whether china had made enough market reforms to fulfill wto obligations and objection to lowering the bar for china on terms of membership15 prospects despite the low profile being taken by us officials the frequency and apparent intensity of uschina talks over the last two months suggest that both sides believe they are close to an agreement on at least the basic framework for chinas future accession to wto membership how that agreement is viewed in the united states is likely to depend on whether the united states is perceived to have backed off of its insistence that china be admitted on commercially viable terms some have suggested that wto agreement could be made more palatable if it were followed by other agreements or understandings designed to appeal to unhappy constituencies on either side these could include understandings involving taiwans swift accession to the wto16 widely supported within congress and on chinas receipt of permanent mostfavorednation trade status mfn now officially known as ntr or normal trade relations something long sought by beijing and supported by some members of congress although failure to reach an understanding on wto during zhus visit something which chinese spokesman has said china is mentally prepared would not necessarily mean further erosion in us china relations it would indicate that agreements on far more fundamental differences in the relationship are not likely in the foreseeable future 15 senate floor debate on the hutchinson amendment to s 544 making emergency supplemental appropriations and rescissions the senate tabled the amendment 6930
