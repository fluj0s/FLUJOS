february 18 shared vision and structured dialogue meetings in ankara turkish mfa undersecretary sinirlioglu appealed for simultaneity between armenian protocols ratification and the minsk process registered increasing got dissatisfaction with iraqi pm malaki expressed hope usfi cg odiernos engagement would elicit substantive cooperation from the krg against the terrorist pkk urged higher profile usg involvment in the cyprus reunification talks and confirmed got interest in further dialogue on missile defense end summary iran 2 c burns strongly urged sinirlioglu to support action to convince the iranian government it is on the wrong course sinirliolgu reaffirmed the gots opposition to nuclear iran however he registered fear about the collateral impact military action might have on turkey and contended sanctions would unite iranians behind the regime and harm the opposition burns acknowledged turkeys exposure to the economic effects of sanctions as neighbor to iran but reminded sinirlioglu turkish interests would suffer if israel were to act militarily to forestall irans acquisition of nuclear weapons or if egypt and saudi arabia were to seek nuclear arsenals of their own he said the international communitys patience with iran had been met with the iranian refusal since october to work with the p5plus1 the clandestine enrichment facility near qom and tehrans recent decison to enrich its lowenriched uranium to 20 the iaeas creative proposal to fabricate new fuel assemblies for the tehran research reactor had stumbled on technically unfeasible iranian counteroffer for simultaneous exchange in iran of iranian fuel for fuel assemblies carefully constructed sanctions burns argued targeting the increasingly pervasive economic power of the iranian revolutionary guard corps would convey the international communitys unity and determination well keep the door open to engagement he stressed visibly disheartened sinirlioglu conceded unified message is important he acknowledged the countries of the region perceive iran as growing threat alarm bells are ringing even in damascus armenia 3 c sinirlioglu appealed for simultaneity between armenian protocols ratification and the minsk process he emphasized strong reaction against the protocols among ruling party mps had to be overcome before the government would hazard ratification effort he warned congressional passage of an armenian genocide resolution would complicate his governments domestic political calculations regarding ratification he said if something acceptable to azerbaijani president aliyev can found then we can move the protocols forward sinirlioglu suggested azerbaijan and armenias announcement of an agreed framework for minsk group progress would provide the got with the necessary political cover burns inquired about the prospect for progress on natural gas deal between turkey and azerbaijan sinirlioglu implied ankara 00000302 002 of 005 aliyev is holding an agreement hostage to turkeys handling of the protocols he doesnt trust us iraq 4 c sinirlioglu registered the gots increasing dissatisfaction with pm malaki and fear that he is tending to get out of control he is preoccupied with his political survival nevertheless sinirlioglu continued the got is in frequent contact with him the mfa hosted maliki advisors sadiq rikabi and tariq najmi to meetings 10 days prior sinirlioglu lamented irans efforts to influence the election he noted saudi arabia is also throwing around money among the political parties in iraq because it is unwilling to accept the inevitability of shia dominance there we want free transparent and fair election he said we need to forestall deepening of the sectarian divide 5 c after the march 7 elections sinirlioglu said turkey would initiate an effort to connect iraqi gas fields to the turkish grid via 300 kilometer pipeline costing usd 500 million he asserted the pipeline could begin pumping within two years he alleged iranian opposition to the pipeline because most of iraqs gas fields are in kurdish and sunni areas sinirlioglu advocated second pipeline that would give iraqi oil an alternative to the gulf as route to europe once the country is able to meet its opec quota he asserted the piplines construction would pull the several iraqi communities together into common project the creation of new common assets he said could be more important for its politically unifying effect than its economic impact 6 c sinirlioglu registered his appreciation for usfi commanding general odiernos recent visit he hoped for the early drafting of an action plan that would elicit more cooperation from the kurdish regional government krg against the terrorist kurdistan workers party pkk leadership harboring in northern iraq we want the krg to understand that working with us is important israel 7 c burns focused on turkeys strained relationship with israel sinirlioglu argued the problem is not bilateral but general he attributed increasing regional country frustration with israel to the stalled peace process especially on the palestinian track he blamed the lack of progress on israeli intransigence which caused regional stakeholders to question netanyahus goals he contended the humanitarian situation in gaza which is not punishment of hamas but of the gazan people fed turkish popular anger against israel even so bilateral cooperation with israel is continuing turkey is acquiring israeli military equipment notably heron uavs direct flights between the two countries are routine twoway trade is healthy he said tourism has dropped recently but will recover sinirlioglu described israeli defense minister ehud baraks midjanuary visit as very good he noted the mfa is exploring the possibility of arranging meeting between the two prime ministers on the margins of an international gathering returning to got obsession he recalled the turkeybrokered syriaisrael proximity talks which were shattered by cast lead israels december 2008 military operation in gaza burns noted syria places high value on turkeys role as mediator and repeated senator mitchells statement that turkeybrokered proximity talks can make an important contribution to the peace process ankara 00000302 003 of 005 syria 8 c sinirlioglu contended turkeys diplomatic efforts are beginning to pull syria out of irans orbit he said shared hatred for saddam had been the original impetus for their unlikely alliance now their interests are diverging once again pitching israelsyria proximity talks sinirlioglu contended israels acceptance of turkey as mediator could break syria free of tehrans influence and further isolate iran eu cyprus and greece 9 c sinirlioglu said turkeys eu accession is being obstructed by the politically motivated objections of several member states notably france austria and cyprus he reserved special criticism for president sarkozy he accused france of changing the rules midgame he contended french opposition to turkeys membership is deepening the cultural divide between christian europe and the muslim world wider audience is watching this 10 c he regretted perceived greek cypriot complacency regarding the islands reunification talks eu membership makes them invulnerable greek cypriots he said want the world to forget the progress achieved by the annan plan in 2004 they pretend relations between the islands two communities are an internal affair even though by treaty its been an international issue for 50 years talats crossvoting proposal sinirlioglu continued should have been breakthrough but the greek cypriots failed to react downer is frustrated sinirlioglu alleged and so are the turkish cypriots he implied the islands turkish community would register its frustration by voting out talat as trnc president in april he renewed turkeys appeal for higher profile direct usg involvement in the negotiations 11 c sinirlioglu welcomed greek pm papandeous belated response to erdogans october 30 letter seeking frank new discussion of the two neighbors several longrunning disputes he conceded papandreous delay is understandable in light of his likely preoccupation with greeces acute financial crisis based on papandreous response sinirlioglu said turkey expects to begin new talks with greece soon afghanistan pakistan and india 12 c burns opened the discussion on afghanistan with praise for turkeys military training and development contributions there sinirlioglu said turkey had chosen to focus on three afghan challenges the marriage of wahhabism and pashtun nationalism the chronic antagonism between afghanistan and pakistan and the countrys security forces deficit he said turkey plans to address the first by ramping up its education programs in afghanistan the second by pursuing its trilateral ankara process which sponsors meetings of senior afghan and pakistani ministerial and intelligence counterparts and the third by establishing police training center in kabul that aims for throughput of 5160 trainees per year keying off the last point amb tacan ildem who recently concluded an assignment as turkeys nato permrep declared the eupol police training effort in afghanistan failure he said the eus criticism of turkeys unwillingness to work directly with eupol is unjustified he argued since turkey does not have security agreement with the eu and is excluded from the ankara 00000302 004 of 005 european security and defense policy esdp the got lacks legal basis on which to cooperate with eupol we would like the eu to involve us not as third country but in view of our accumulated rights as candidate for membership he urged the usg not to coordinate bilateral agreements to support eu operations but instead to route all cooperation with the eu on security issues through nato 13 c deputy undersecretary for south asian affairs engin soysal led the discussion on pakistan he described the ankara process and the recent turkeysponsored afghanistan neighbors summit as turkish efforts to assert regional responsibility for south asias interlinked problems he said turkey had not invited india to the neighbors summit in deference to pakistani sensitivities however he claimed pakistan understands attempting to exclude india from the nascent south asian regional structures would be mistake he reported indian prime minister singh had requested president guls assistance with pakistan during the latters visit to new delhi the previous week acting on that request gul had phoned pakistani president zardari who was skeptical of indian intentions gul is planning to visit pakistan later this year soysal said iran is proposing quadrilateal summit which would include turkey afghanistan and pakistan but that proposal had yet to generate enthusiasm 14 c soysal turkeys former ambassador to pakistan said the pakistani military though displeased with zardari remains unwilling to intervene nevertheless senior officers patience may not be infinite zardari needs to increase the democratic legitimacy of parliament soysal offered nawaz sharif has become much more constructive player 15 c soysal urged nato training role in pakistan picking up from soysal tacan ildem suggested nato invite pakistani military officers to courses at oberammergau bosnia 16 c sinirlioglu registered the gots determination to resist perceived eu efforts to exclude turkey from the balkans particularly bosnia he identified effecting rapprochement between bosnia and serbia as turkeys immediate diplomatic goal for the region towards that end sinirlioglu said we convinced haris siladjdzic who had been in ankara the day before to cease references to serbian genocide the united states and turkey have agreed to disagree on the membership action plan map for bosnia nevertheless we value your involvement in the balkans bilateral european relations nato 17 c burns inquired about turkeys bilateral relations with europe sinirlioglu briefly recapped turkeys unhappiness with sarkozy he described his countrys relationship with austria as infected by the latters ethnic prejudice he complained belgium and denmark are reluctant to suppress terrorist pkkaffiliated organizations active in their countries tacan ildem added that as part of the 2009 potusbrokered deal that had overcome turkish objections to the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as nato secretary general denmark had promised to clarify its legal requirements prerequiste to acceding to turkeys request for the closure of roj tv pkk mouthpiece this still needed to be done ildem said 18 c picking up from ildem sinirlioglu recalled the ankara 00000302 005 of 005 potusbrokered deal had included an understanding that qualified turk would be considered for assistant secretary general instead he said german of uncompelling merit was selected we suspect deal between rasmussen and merkel ildem complained highlevel positions should be part of nato reform we missed an opportunity with the selection of the assistant secretary general sinirlioglu added we let rasmussen have secretary general because we trusted you missile defense 19 c sinirlioglu inquired about russias reaction on missile defense burns said the russians are much more relaxed towards the phased adaptive approach paa and we hope to have more conversations on missile defense bilaterally and eventually within the natorussia council sinirlioglu recalled pm erdogans request in his recent meeting with secdef gates that the iranian threat not be highlighted to justify paa 20 u participants turkey undersecretary feridun sinirliolgu deputy undersecretary engin soysal ambassador reha keskintepe director general for the americas ambassador tacan ildem director
