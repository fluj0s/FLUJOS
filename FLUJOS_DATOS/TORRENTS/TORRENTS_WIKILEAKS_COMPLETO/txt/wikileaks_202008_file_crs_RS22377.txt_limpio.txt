that the cse provisions contained in pl 109171 will reduce federal costs of the cse program by 15 billion over the five year period fy2006fy2010 this report will not be updated background over the years cse has evolved into multifaceted program while recovery of costs to provide cash welfare to needy families with children still remains an important function other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child support constitutes about 30 of family income 2001 data congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the cse program part d of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the following families automatically qualify for cse services free of charge families receiving cash tanf benefits title iva foster care payments title ive or medicaid coverage title xix collections on behalf of families receiving tanf cash benefits are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family usually through the state disbursement unit in 1996 congress passed major changes to the cse program as part of its reform of welfare since fy2002 when the authorization expired for the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and other related programs proposals for significant changes to the cse program have been linked to welfare reauthorization legislation pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 s 19321 among other things reauthorized httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and made substantive changes to the cse program cbo estimates that the cse provisions in pl 109171 will reduce federal costs of the cse program by 15 billion over the fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 for comparison of selected provisions see table 1 child support assignment and distribution policies pl 109171 the deficit reduction act s 1932 seeks to improve the cse program and raise collections in order to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent it simplifies cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthens the familyfirst policies started in the 1996 welfare reform law assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf cash benefits family must assign its child support rights to the state assignment rules determine who has legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support assignment covers any child support that accrues while the family receives cash tanf benefitsas well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support rights to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the assignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assignment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringassistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state note that pastdue child support payments are 1 the conference agreement on s 1932 the deficit reduction act of 2005 hrept 109362 was originally passed by the house on december 19 2005 it was then passed by the senate with amendments on december 21 2005 and subsequently was passed again by the house on february 1 2006 it was signed into law pl 109171 by the president on february 8 2006 crs3 referred to as arrearages if the assignment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages that accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program pl 109171 stipulates that the child support assignment only covers child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this means that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby any child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages will go to the family distribution of child support distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support collection is important because in many cases arrearages are never fully paid tanf families while family receives tanf cash benefits the states and federal government retain any current support and any assigned arrearages collected up to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377 cumulative amount of tanf benefits that has been paid to the family while states may pay their share of collections to the family they must pay the federal government the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to families and disregarded by the state in determining the familys tanf cash benefit pl 109171 provides incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves often referred to as familyfirst policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families pl 109171 will help states pay for the cost of their cse passthrough and disregard policies by requiring the federal government to share in the costs of the entire amount of child support collections passed through and disregarded by states pl 109171 will allow states to pay up to 100 per month or 200 per month to family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family to the family and would not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal government to share in the cost of the child support passthrough the state would be required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys cash tanf benefit cbo estimates that this provision will cost the federal government 140 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 this provision takes effect on october 1 2008 former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 beginning on october 1 2000 states must distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government crs4 one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before family receives tanf and after the family stops receiving tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf pl 109171 gives states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearages including arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program thereby pl 109171 allows states to simplify the cse distribution process by eliminating the special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under pl 109171 the federal government shares with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first cbo estimates that this provision will cost the federal government 283 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 this provision takes effect on october 1 2009 or at state option not before october 1 2008 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377 expansion or enhancement of collectionenforcement tools the cse program has numerous methods by which to obtain child support from noncustodial parents they include income withholding interception of federal and state income tax refunds seizure of lumpsum benefits lottery winnings and settlements withholding of drivers licenses professional licenses and recreational licenses of persons who owe pastdue child support seizure of assets from banks and other financial institutions denial of passports imposition of criminal penalties against noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support children who reside with custodial parents in another state and civil or criminal contemptofcourt procedures nonetheless in fy2004 states were collecting only 18 of child support obligations for which they collectively had responsibility for several years child advocates and members of congress have been pushing for more or enhanced cse tools pl 109171 includes provisions that 1 lower the threshold amount for denial of passport to noncustodial parent who owes pastdue child support 2 allow states to use the federal income tax refund offset program to collect pastdue child support for persons not on tanf who are longer minors 3 authorize the secretary of hhs to compare information of noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child support with information maintained by insurers concerning insurance payments and to furnish any information resulting from match to cse agencies so that they can pursue child support arrearages 4 allow an assisting state to establish cse interstate case based on another states request for assistance thereby enabling an assisting state to use the cse statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system for interstate cases 5 require states to review and if appropriate adjust child support orders of tanf families every three years and 6 require that medical child support for child be provided by either or both parents cbo estimates that these cse collection tools will reduce federal costs by about 36 million over the period fy20062010 the effective dates related to collection techniques vary few take effect immediately while others take effect between october 1 2006 and october 1 2009 crs5 financing provisions the federal government reimburses each state 66 of the cost of its cse program however it reimburses states at higher 90 matching rate for the laboratory costs of establishing paternity in addition the federal government pays states an incentive payment2 to encourage them to operate effective programs pl 109171 includes provisions that 1 establish 25 annual user fee for individuals who have never been on tanf but receive cse services and who have received at least 500 in any given year saving the federal government 172 million over the fiveyear period fy20062010 2 reduce the cse federal matching rate for the laboratory costs associated with establishing paternity from 90 to 663 saving 28 million over the five years and 3 eliminate the federal match on cse incentive payments that states in compliance with federal law reinvest back into the cse program saving 16 billion over the five years4 table 1 comparison of child support assignment distribution and financing rules under old and new law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377 old law new law pl 109171 child assignment rules stipulate who has stipulates that the child support assignment support legal claim on the child support only covers child support that accrues during assignment payments owed by the noncustodial the period that the family receives tanf rules parent generally child support owed thus child support owed before family before and during familys time on enrolls in tanf and after the family leaves tanf belongs to the state and federal tanf belongs to the family and child government and child support owed support owed during the time the family is on after the family leaves the tanf rolls tanf belongs to the state effective october belongs to the family 1 2009 october 1 2008 at state option 2 the cse incentive payment was statutorily set by pl 105200 in the aggregate incentive payments to states may not exceed 446 million for fy2005 458 million for fy2006 471 million for fy2007 and 483 million for fy2008 to be increased to account for inflation in years thereafter the incentive payment is based in part on five performance measures related to establishment of paternity and child support orders collection of current and pastdue child support payments and costeffectiveness in addition pl 105200 required mandatory reinvestment of child support incentive payments into the cse program or related activities 3 paternity establishment costs that are not associated with laboratory testing are reimbursed at the regular cse federal matching rate of 66 4 in addition pl 109171 establishes minimum funding level for technical assistance and the federal parent locator service fpls costing 4 million over the fiveyear period fy2006 fy2010 pl 109171 prevents funding for technical assistance which is equal to 1 of the federal share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families from going below the amount the state received in fy2002 similarly pl 109171 prevents funding for the fpls which is equal to 2 of the federal share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families from going below the amount the state received in fy2002 it is expected that the diminishing share of the cse caseload that receives cash tanf benefits together with the new rules related to assignment and distribution will result in the federal government receiving smaller amount of child support collections than it previously received crs6 old law new law pl 109171 child child support distribution rules for families who receive assistance from the support determine the order in which child state tanf or foster care requires the distribution support collections are paid when both federal government to waive its share of the rules the family and the state have competing child support collections passed through to claims on the money the general rule tanf families by the state and disregarded is that if the family is on tanf or by the state up to an amount equal to 100 receives federal foster care aid then per month in the case of family with one the state is paid first while family child and up to 200 per month in the case of receives cash tanf benefits the state family with two or more children effective can send some all or none of its share october 1 2008 of the child support collected to the family the state is required to send the federal government the federal share of any child support collected on behalf of tanf families if the family is not on tanf then the simplifies child support distribution rules to family is paid first however an give states the option of providing families exception occurs for former tanf that have left tanf the full amount of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22377 families if the child support is collected child support collected on their behalf ie via the federal income tax refund offset both current child support and child support program in such cases the state is paid arrearages including support payments first collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the federal government would have to share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first effective october 1 2009 october 1 2008 at state option financing welfare families are automatically requires families that have never been on rules enrolled free of charge in the cse tanf to pay 25 annual user fee when program nonwelfare families must child support enforcement efforts on their apply for cse services and states must behalf are successful ie at least 500 charge an application fee that cannot annually is collected on their behalf exceed 25 effective october 1 2006 in general the federal government reduces the federal matching rate for reimburses each state 66 of the cost laboratory costs incurred in determining of expenditures on its cse program paternity from 90 to 66 effective however for the laboratory costs of october 1 2006 establishing paternity the federal government reimburses states at higher 90 matching rate in addition the federal government prohibits federal matching of state pays states an incentive payment to expenditure of federal cse incentive encourage them to operate effective payments this means that cse incentive programs federal law requires states payments that are received by states and to reinvest cse incentive payments reinvested in the cse program are not eligible back into the cse program or related for federal reimbursement effective activities if incentive payments are october 1 2007 reinvested in the cse program they are reimbursed at the appropriate cse federal matching rate ie 66 for general activities or 90 for laboratory testing for paternity determination
