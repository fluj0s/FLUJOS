chávezs rise to power to venezuelans disillusionment with politicians whom they judge to have squandered the countrys oil wealth through poor management and endemic corruption central theme of his campaign was constitutional reform chávez asserted that the system in place allowed small elite class to dominate congress and that revenues from the staterun oil company petroleos venezuela sa pdvsa had been wasted although venezuela had one of the most stable political systems in latin america from 1958 until 1989 after that period numerous economic and political challenges plagued the country and the power of the two traditional parties began to erode former president carlos andres perez inaugurated to five year term in february 1989 initiated an austerity program that fueled riots and street violence in which several hundred people were killed in 1992 two attempted military coups threatened the perez presidency one led by chávez himself who at the time was lieutenant colonel railing against corruption and poverty ultimately the legislature dismissed president perez from office in may 1993 on charges of misusing public funds although some observers assert that the presidents unpopular economic reform program was the real reason for his ouster 1 the election of elder statesman and former president rafael caldera as president in december 1993 brought measure of political st ability to the country but the cald era government soon faced severe banking crisis that cost the government more than 10 billion while the macroeconomy began to improve in 1997 rapid decline in the price of oil brought about deep recession beginning in 1998 under president chávez venezuela has undergone enormous political changes with new constitution in place and even new name

g350g561from the outset critics raised concerns about chávez and his government they feared that he was moving toward authoritarian rule and pointed to his domination of most government institutions some argue that chávez had replaced the countrys multiparty democracy with political system that revolves around himself in essence cult of personality others pointed to chávezs open admiration of fidel castro and clos relations with cuba as disturbing sign other observers expressed concern about the increased role of the military in the government with chávez appointing dozens of retired and active duty officers to key positions as well as the mobilization of thousands of army reservists for social projects still other critics of chávez believed that he was trying to politicize the educational system by making changes to school curriculums they feared chávezs call for his followers to form political cells in schools hospitals and businesses in order to support his revolution and believe that such groups known as bolivarian circles could mirror cubas controversial neighborhood committees 2

to 191 million valid signatures with almost 12 million signatures that could be valid if individuals confirmed their signatures in reparo or repair period this meant that about 525000 signatures of

unclear whether president chávez would have been allowed to run for reelection but most observers believed th at the supreme court would have ruled that he was eligible to run one of the problems that plagued the opposition was that it did not have wellorganized or coherent political coalition as result it could have been difficult for the opposition to present single candidate who could have

explain president chávezs victory in the recall referendum the economy fueled by proceeds from high oil prices turned around in 2004 the president was able to use oil proceeds to boost social spending for the poor he made antipoverty programs an important focus of his administration another factor has been the strength of the opposition as noted above the opposition in venezuela has been fragmented and did not wage an effective campaign during the recall referendum even if it had won the referendum it was unclear whether it would have been able to present single candidate to challenge chávez in subsequent election after the august 2004 recall referendum president chávezs rule was further strengthened when his allies won majority of gubernatorial and municipal posts in elections held in late

contribute to the reduction of the fracture in venezuelan society nevertheless the eu lauded the steps taken by the cne to open the automated voting system to external scrutiny and to modify various aspects that were questioned by the opposition in particular the eu stated the cnes decision to liminate the digital fingerprint devices from the voting process was timely effective and constructive

question the wisdom of the oppositions boycott of the election and contend that the decision not to participate will erode its legitimacy according to jose miguel vivanco from human rights watch which has been critic of president chávez the oppositions tactics will not help them gain any ground and it will be difficult for them to present themselves as victims that deserve solidarity from the international community 18 other observers contend that the high abstention rate in the election could allow the opposition to question the legitimacy of the national assembly according to this view the boycott helped send message that democracy is at threat in venezuela and could bolster international support to press the chávez government for transparency and accountability

observers credit the governments numerous misiones or social programs as the key to the governments support and do not believe that venezuelans support for president chávez is ideologically based for

the august 2004 recall referendum and their boycott of the december 2005 legislative elections it managed to agree on single unified presidential candidate for 2006 manuel rosales who was governor of

the decision to include such popular measures in the reform as decreasing the work day would help ensure passage of the referendum its approval longer appeared certain in the days leading up to the vote there was growing opposition to the constitutional reforms including by number of student organizations business groups the catholic church and even some past supporters of president chávez such as the popular former minister of defense general raúl baduel various polls in november 2007 showed that those opposing the referendum had gained momentum and were in the majority 34 despite the polls

supported president chávez about 56 of the electorate participated in the referendum vote compared to almost 75 in the december 2006 presidential election about three million fewer voters supported the constitutional reform than voted for chávez in 2006 president chávez acknowledged these statistics in his concession speech pointing out the abstention of many of his supporters in contrast those rejecting the constitutional reform received almost 250000 votes more than opposit ion candidate manuel rosales had in the 2006 presidential election just slight increase there are number of factors that resulted in chávez supporters staying home for the referendum one of the most significant was former and current supporters of president chávez concerned that the chávez government is becoming too radicalized with power too concentrated in the presidency in the national assembly the podemos party democratic socialist party that had been supportive of the chávez government called the reform amendments constitutional coup and was the sole party to vote against the reforms its leader ismael garcía and other party members were dubbed traitors for opposing the reform effort the party which actively participated in the campaign had originally supported the establishment of constituent assembly to amend the constitution it is likely that the opposition of podemos contributed to the vote and also resulted in chavistas chávez supporters abstaining another significant defection from the chavista camp was the exwife of president chávez marisabel rodriguez who actively opposed the re form maintaining that it would concentrate absolute power rodriguez has significant political profile in venezuela and was member of the constituent assembly that drafted the current 1999 constitution which she maintains was product of legitimate and valid public debate 36 perhaps the most significant opposition from within the chavista movement was from retired general raúl baduel former commander of the ve nezuelan army and former defense minister who in early november 2007 labeled the reform proposal coup detat intended to abolish checks on the presidents expanding power 37 baduel had been one of chávezs closest advisors since he helped him return to power in april 2002 and reportedly commands respect among many chavistas and within the venezuelan military38 badhuel asserted that the constitutional reform proposal was nothing less than an attempt to establish socialist state in venezuela he also cited the governments failure to address such severe problems as high rates of crime and violence inflation housing shortage and poor education and health care and maintained that the current constitution gives ample room for any decent and honest government to address these challenges 39 36 chris kraul despite outcry chávez plan likely to pass angeles times november 15 2007 37 simon romero venezuelan general likens chávezs proposals for constitution to coup new york

venezuelan economy and fall in poverty rates over the past several years several significant economic problems in venezuela contributed to the rejection of the constitutional reform inflation estimated at over 20 in 2007 has been the highest in the region price controls on basic staples like milk eggs and chicken have resulted in significant product shortages and long lines as domestic production has dwindled venezuelas currency is also significantly overvalued with substantial difference between the official exchange rate and the parallel market the economic difficulties caused venezuelans to question the governments management of the economy asking such questions as how booming economy could be experiencing so many problems as expected the political opposition also strongly criticized the proposed constitutional changes maintaining that the reforms would be means for president chávez to extend his power and remain in office indefinitely while steering venezuela towards cubanstyle totalitarianism opposition leader and former presidential candidate manuel rosales of the nuevo tiempo unt party called the proposed changes constitutional coup and warned that the reform would further exacerbate shortages for basic products as the country moves toward socialist system 40 an important aspect of the oppositions campaign was that it concentrated on the substance of the reforms and was not focused on chávez himself such strategy proved less threatening for chávez supporters who could op pose the reform or abstain from voting and still support chávez as their president through 2012 university students which took the lead in the demonstrations against the governments closure of radio caracas television rctv in may 2007 also played major role in defeating the constitutional reform by taking the lead in street protests on november 7 2007 some 80000 thousand students marched to the supreme court calling on the judicial body to suspend the referendum students also played major role in the final demonstration of the campaign which mobilized more than 100000 people in caracas on november 29 2007 with their ability to mobilize demonstrators students emerged as perhaps the most prominent and visible opponents of the constitutional reform effort and some observers believe that the reform would not have been defeated had it not been for the st udents historically students in venezuela have often played an important role in political change including most notably in the overthrow of dictator marcos pérez jiménez in 1958 the student movement that emerged in 2007 was not discredited by the chávez government despite attempts to portray them as spoiled children of the oligarchy the catholic church in venezuela which crit icized the constitutional reform effort as concentrating power in the hands of the president and favoring authoritarianism also likely had some influence on the vote in october 2007 venezuelan bishops issues public statement on the reforms maintaining that the proposition of socialist state was contrary to the fundamental principles of the existing constitution and asserting that the reforms would restrict liberties and represent step backward in progress on human rights 41 venezuelan human rights groups also actively questioned and criticized the constitutional reforms forum for life coalition

of the right of due process from the list of rights that cannot be suspended during state of emergency the forum also opposed the reform to article 338 which would have removed the time limit on state

rejection of the constitutional reform c ould improve public confidence in the electoral process in the past critics have often portrayed the national electoral council cne as dominated by the chávez government and questioned the outcome of elections in the aftermath of the win some opposition politicians claimed that the reform was defeated by much larger margin but opposition leaders including manuel rosales of the unt agreed with the cnes numbers which are listed on the electoral bodys website down to the level of each voting site and table 43 such level of transparency should increase confidence that venezuela can conduct free and fair elections nevertheless while many observers lauded the cne for the conduct of the vote on election day government critics still claim that during the electoral campaign the cne sided with the government on many decisions and did nothing to stop the government from using its considerable resources to fund the campaign in favor of the reform for example caracas was blanketed with propaganda in favor of the reform the cne was also widely criticized including by the nongovernmental venezuelan domestic election observer group electoral eye for the several hour delay in releasing the vote results which contributed to increased tension across the country until the vote was announced for opposition parties such as the centerleft unt and centerright primero justicia the rejection of the reform demonstrates that they can oppose the chávez government at the ballot box and win going forward however it is obvious that th margin was very slim and that just small shift of votes less than 60000 for block and about 85000 for block b would have reversed the results observers assert that victory by such close vote suggests that the opposition will need to be unified and work with other former chávez supporters such as podemos to attract more electoral support the next electoral races will take place in november 2008 when state and local elections will be held and in december 2010 when national elections will be held for the national assembly for president chávez while the referendum vote was his first electoral loss he still wields considerable power as president while initially conciliatory in his remarks following the defeat of the referendum the president subsequently spoke disparagingly of those chavistas who abstained and vowed to continue efforts to get the constitutional reforms approved moreover observers point out that chávez could enact number of the reform proposals by decree or through the regular legislative process since he still has the support of most of the national 42 foro vida introduce acción inconstitucionalidad propuesta reforma tsj comunicado prensa foro vida caracas november 15 2007

chávez again floated the idea of another attempt at constitutional reform amendment in 2010 that would allow him to be reelected again in december 2012 but such move would be controversial given the defeat of the governments constitutional reform package in december 2007 it would also have to be an initiative proposed by signatures of 15 of the electorate that would be then subject to referendum 44 in 2008 the venezuelan government has moved forward with nationalizations in key industries in march 2008 the government nationalized two food companies maintaining that the takeover would improve production and distribution and help resolve food shortages in early april 2008 president chávez announced the nationalizations of the cement industry which involves taking majority shares in mexican french and swiss companies operating in venezuela and the countrys largest steel maker sidor an argentinecontrolled unit of the luxembourgbased company ternium venezuelan officials maintain that the cement nationalizations were justified because the companies were producing below capacity and exporting too much while the steel company had been bogged down in labor disput and criticized the company for exploiting workers 45 other observers have criticized the nationalizations as an attack on the private sector and as attempt by the government to improve the presidents popularity46 in early june 2008 chávez rescinded decree that he had made days earlier overhauling the countrys intelligence polices human rights groups and legal scholars had strongly criticized the extensive decree maintaining that it would force citizens to inform on one another in order to avoid prison terms and would force judges to cooperate with intelligence services 47 president chávezs popularity reportedly declined in the first quarter of 2008 with such problems as high crime rates food shortages and inflation contributing to the decline some reports in march 2008 maintained that support for his government had dropped to as low as 3448 reports later in the year however showed that chávez with popular support of about 50 had regained some of the support that he had lost earlier in the

are scheduled to be held on november 23 2008 which will be significant test for the political strength of president chávez and the opposition chávez has moved to unite his supporters into single party the united socialist party of venezuela psuv which was inaugurated in january 2008 although several parties that had supported chávez in the past declined to join the psuv held primary elections around the country on june 1 2008 to select candidates although the process was criticized for lack of transparency the vote also sparked protests in several states with some psuv members maintaining that the candidacies were predetermined 50 as the election approaches there continues to be divisions within the psuv and government candidates fa ce opposition from former chavistas who are distancing themselves from the government51 the opposition initially had difficulty in agreeing on single slate of candidates so as not to split the opposition vote but by the end of september reportedly had agreed on unified candidate for governorships in all but one venezuelan state52 the opposition includes newer parties such as justice first project venezuela and new era nuevo tiempo unt leftist parties that defected from the chavista coalition such as the movement toward socialism mas and podemos and the traditional political parties from the past such as democratic action ad and the social christian party copei 53 one of the major problems for the opposition is that the venezuelan governments comptroller general disqualified 272 individuals down from most 400 originally disqualified from running for office purportedly for cases involving the misuse of government funds54 there were several challenges to venezuelas supreme court that the comptroller generals action violated the constitution but on august 5 2008 venezuelas supreme court upheld up the disqualifications the venezuelan government maintains that the majority of those disqualified are from the ranks of the its own supporters 55 although the list includes several highprofile opposition candidates among those excluded is leopoldo lópez the pop ular mayor of chacao who was seeking to run for mayor of caracas lópez filed complaint with the interamerican commission on human rights in the leadup to the election the chávez government has made number of radical moves that appear to be designed at least in part to have an effect on the elections as noted above chávez expelled the us ambassador and asserted that the united states was backing coup and assassination plot against him among venezuelan military officers his government also expelled two members of human rights watch and moved to strengthen venezuelas military relations with russia it is unclear whether these actions will result in success for the chávez government at the polls problems such as high crime inflation and food shortages could erode the governments electoral support moreover decree law announced in early

political strength to push toward authoritarian rule human rights watch maintains that the chávez government dealt severe blow to judicial independence by packing the supreme court with his supporters under new law that expanded the court from 20 to 32 justices since 2004 according to human rights watch the packed court has fired hundreds of provisional judges and granted to permanent judgeships to about 1000 others 60 the chávez government enacted broadcast media law in december 2004 that could allow the government to restrict news coverage that is critical of the government while in march 2005

the missions is that they are generally deinstitutionalized functioning primarily through parallel system that is not part of the bureaucratic apparatus of the state the missions have been funded through the governments central budget and allocations by pdvsa some observers contend that the work of the missions should be integrated into existing ministries and institutions of the venezuelan government in order to improve administration and oversight 72 there are currently some 20 social missions in venezuela covering wide array of services in the fields of education health nutrition the

misión ribas in the health field the misión barrio adentro inside the neighborhood mission consists of free health care clinics in historically marginalized areas throughout the country that are staffed primarily by cuban medical personnel the medical personnel live in the barrios and make home visits to those who are too ill to visit the community health clinics the government intends to gradually replace many of the cuban doctors with venezuelan doctors although there were more than 20000 cuban medical personnel serving in venezuela supporting the mission over the past year thousands reportedly have left leaving about 15000 as result number of the clinics reportedly have closed 76 july 2006 report published by the pan american health organization showed that the mission has had positive impact on the health of venezuelas poor the report maintains that there has been reduction in child mortality from diarrhea and pneumonia since the mission began operating and that medical

nutrition misión mercal attempts to ensure that poor venezuelans obtain staple foodstuffs the key component of the mission is the staterun mercal supermarket and grocery store chain where prices are subsidized by the government up to 40 less expensive than elsewhere 78 this mission also includes soup kitchens that provide daily free meals and service by which foodstuffs and meals are delivered to the homes of those living in extreme poverty the government claims that the mission has been successful by pointing to the fact that over 47 of venezuelans shop at mercal79 and that over nine and half million people have benefitted from the mercal mission in some way80 some observers have praised the missions for constituting an integrated package of poverty reduction measures that address the various conditions associated with poverty representing holistic approach to povertyreduction the missions are viewed by some as potentially more effective alternative to simple cash transfers which have been the primary basis for povertyalleviation programs in latin america some criti cs of the missions however maintain that they focus on alleviating the harsh conditions associated with poverty rather than addressing the structural roots of the problem they maintain that the missions are paternalistic and create dependency on the state among the poor without providing solutions to lift people out of poverty permanently some critics question the sustainability of the missions since they are funded primarily from oil revenues they argue that the missions will likely disappear or be

involved over the past several years us officials have expressed concerns about human rights venezuelas military arms purchases largely from russia its relations with cuba and iran and its efforts to export its brand of populism to other latin american countries declining venezuelan cooperation on antidrug and antiterrorism efforts also has been us concern since 2006 the department of state has

president chávez publicly urged the farc to end its armed struggle and release all hostages while strong political rhetoric from both us nd venezuelan officials in the 2002 to 2006 period contributed

brazil and uruguay president bush ignored the taunts and us officials emphasized that they wanted to focus on positive agenda of us engagement with latin america today us policy toward venezuela appears to be to refrain from getting into any unneeded conflicts or spats with president chávez and instead to focus on positive us agenda for the hemisphere while at the same time being open to

political support venezuelas ambassador to the united states asserted in july 2006 that oil cutoff comments by venezuelan officials includi ng president chávez only reflect what would be venezuelas response against aggression initiated by the us government127 once again in february 2008 president chávez once again threatened to stop oil exports to the united states this time if exxonmobil was successful in freezing billions in venezuela oil assets in dispute over compensation for its orinoco oil investments state department officials played down the threat pointing out that chávez has made the same threat in the past but has never cut oil128 week later on february 17 chávez said that he would only stop sending oil if the united states attacked venezuela 129 because of these comments however some observers have raised questions about the security of venezuela as major supplier of foreign oil there are also concerns that venezuela is looking to develop china as replacement market

embargo on venezuela since 2006 which ended all us commercial arms sales and retransfers to venezuela when the state department issued its first determination in 2006 it that it was based on venezuelas near lack of antiterrorism cooperation over the previous year citing its support for iraqi insurgents and irans development of nuclear capabilities the countrys status as safe haven for colombian and basque terrorist groups and its effort to derail hemispheric efforts to advance counterterrorism policies in the oas the determination was renewed in may 2007 and again in may 2008 according to the state departments country reports on terrorism 2007 report issued at the end of april 2008 president chávez continued his public criticism of us counterterrorism efforts and deepened venezuelan relationships with iran and cuba while his ideological sympathy for two colombian insurgencies the farc and the national liberation army and high levels of corruption among venezuelan officials have limited venezuelan cooperation with colombia in combating terrorism in addition according to the report venezuelan citizenship identity and travel documents remained easy to obtain
