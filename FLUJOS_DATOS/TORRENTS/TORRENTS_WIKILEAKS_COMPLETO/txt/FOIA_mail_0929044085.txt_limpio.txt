from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to folland chris ckfollandmetogovuk subject re variance problem date thu 10 jun 1999 154805 0100 cc dparkermetogovuktosbornueaacuk chris sorry to be flooding you with another email but i was discussing this with tim tim reminded of paper that hed written in that well known journal dendrocronologia ive sent down copy of the proofs to you both the paper has been in press for the last 2 years this must be the slowest journal in the world this has some more theory in it and some variance corrections for treering and temperature series we are going ahead with the method ive outlined over the last few emails tim and i have modified couple of things slightly 1 using the present combined dataset jones 1994 and parker et 1995 we will calculate monthly rbars for each 5 by 5 box the gridbox time series will be filtered with 30 year gaussian filter rbar will be calculated from the residual gridbox time series tim reckons that longer filter is better an analysis in the paper he suggests 40 years but this involves more problems with the ends so well go with 30 i dont think 203040 will make that much difference to the rbar values we are using the combined dataste for the estimation as this should produce better rbar values around coasts and islands if we used the land only dataset we would have real problems with isolated islands and with some coasts where all neighbouring boxes will be in one direction from the coastal box 2 having got fields of the monthly rbars well then apply the formula to the landonly dataset as youre doing something similar with the marine dataset we can remerge the two variance corrected datasets using davids merging growing land and neighbour checking program 3 we will then write this up as small paper for grl about the land only results both of you can be on this if you want we can decide later what to do about the merged dataset 4 applying the correction in real time in the future will mean that we will always be slightly changing approximately the last 15 years data because of the filter end effects best would seem to be to maintain the present version we have and apply this variance correction every few years eg the ipcc cycle cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
