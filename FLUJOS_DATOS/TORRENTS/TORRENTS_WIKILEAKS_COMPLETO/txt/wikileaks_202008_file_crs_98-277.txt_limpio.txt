1998 mark jickling economic analyst economics division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report explores the relationship between credit card debt and the fast growing rate of personal bankruptcy is the bankruptcy code so biased towards debtors that it encourages irresponsible andor fraudulent credit card borrowing or have lenders themselves been reckless in issuing credit cards to households with limited financial resources and sophistication legislation before the congress hr 2500 hr 2650 and s 1301 proposes reforms in bankruptcy law that would benefit credit card lenders by requiring certain debtors to repay their debts out of future income for an analysis of these proposals see crs report 9869a this report which will be updated only if significant new research is published or if new data become available consists primarily of economic analysis and does not presuppose an extensive knowledge of bankruptcy law bankruptcy and credit card debt is there causal relationship summary personal bankruptcy filings now exceed one million per year why should bankruptcies have risen to record levels during period when the economy has enjoyed two of the longest peacetime expansions in history with unemployment inflation and interest rates all falling something must have changed in household finance credit cards are among the usual suspects credit cards figure prominently in the debate over bankruptcy reform credit card lenders argue that bankruptcy makes it is too easy for debtors to avoid paying their debts creating an incentive for reckless or fraudulent borrowing and exacerbating recent losses to credit card loan portfolios they support legislation hr 2500 and s 1301 that would require some debtors to repay portion of what they owe opponents of such proposals including some consumer groups argue that the highpower marketing campaigns of credit card issuers amount to an irresponsible extension of credit to households with low incomes and little financial sophistication many of whom are then thrust into bankruptcy by any unforseen economic trouble does bankruptcy cause excessive losses to lenders or do lending practices cause bankruptcies credit card debt has grown rapidly since the early 1980s but it is still small share less than 11 of all household debt which is dominated by mortgage and home equity debt however the interest charged on credit cards is high and moreover it is sticky that is credit card lenders have not cut their rates when the general level of interest rates falls reasons for this stickiness may lie in structural and permanent features of the market or in unique historical circumstances in the credit card industrys development in any case dollar of credit card debt is more expensive than dollar of other debt since 1989 the aggregate debt burden debt payments as percentage of income of american families has been flat however the debt burden has fallen for upper income families and risen for lowincome families financial distress when more than 40 of income goes to debt service has also increased among lower income families have credit cards played role in these trends the debt burden arising specifically from credit cards appears to be minor 05 of income in 1995 but somewhat higher and rising for lowincome households could credit card borrowing by lowincome families though small in the aggregate be straw that broke the camels back and source of increased bankruptcy filings the percentage of families using credit cards to borrow has increased since 1983 with lowerincome families leading the rise however the median amount borrowed by lowincome families has not risen significantly the expansion of credit card loan volume is primarily attributable to upperincome borrowers increasing their balances and for these borrowers the overall debt burden has been falling the available aggregate data do not show that credit card debt has caused major shift in us

were sufficient to repay certain percentage of their debts they would be required to file chapter 13 wage earner bankruptcy under which they would turn over their income after deductions for living expenses to courtappointed trustee for distribution to their creditors chapter 13 is available under current law but only about 30 of bankruptcy petitioners choose it the rest prefer chapter 7 where one may give up certain assets to be sold for the creditors benefit and remaining unpaid debts with certain exceptions are immediately discharged or canceled leaving one free to make fresh start with future income unencumbered if this needsbased bankruptcy proposal is enacted and works as intended1 and significant numbers of bankruptcy filers repay portions of their outstanding debt in chapter 13 among the principal beneficiaries will be credit card lenders unlike loans that are secured by liens on the borrowers assets such as home mortgages and car loans credit card lending is unsecured in chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings unsecured creditors are the last to share in the liquidation of debtors assets and unsecured debt is the first to be discharged some forms of unsecured debt such as student loans are given priority by the bankruptcy code and are not discharged secured creditors on the other hand retain their right to foreclose on property pledged as collateral even after bankruptcy in typical chapter 7 consumer bankruptcy case the banks and other firms to whom credit card debt is owed see their claims extinguished and get nothing in return2 and their claims may often be substantial part of the debt that is discharged by the bankruptcy court since credit cards function as lender of last resort for many of those in financial distress3 given the nature of credit card debt and its treatment in bankruptcy one would expect some correlation between the incidence of personal bankruptcy and the losses experienced by credit card lenders figure 1 below compares the

identical this correlation helps explain why credit cards have been at the center of the debate over the ongoing epidemic of personal bankruptcy the increase in personal bankruptcy since the early 1980s during period when the united states has enjoyed two of the longest economic expansions ever recorded in peacetime is puzzling single factor can be identified with confidence as the principal cause but something must have changed in household finance4 credit cards are among the usual suspects even though credit card debt represents fairly small fraction of total household debt5 its rate of growth since 1980 has been the fastest of any component of that total in addition to growth in the volume of lending the credit card industry has been characterized by rapid change in other areas the number of major credit and debit cards in circulation has grown from just over 100 million in 1980 to about 500 million ten million more american families had credit card debt in 1995 than in 19836 4 for review of the suggested causes of increased bankruptcy filings see crs report 97637 one million personal bankruptcies in 1996 economic implications and policy options by mark jickling 5 credit card debt outstanding in september 1997 was less than 11 of total household debt see table 1 on page 4 below 6 according to the federal reserves survey of consumer finances crs3 the proportion of households with access to this form of credit has increased following direct mail and telephone solicitations by card issuers that have numbered in the billions and technology has created new uses for the cards at the gas pump in foreign cities in supermarkets on the internet etc and has made their use more convenient for instance clerks longer look though ledger of bad or stolen card numbers before each sale so that they have become nearly indispensable to many households even those that do not use the cards to borrow the relationship of credit cards to bankruptcy is controversial credit card lenders argue that the current bankruptcy code is too lenient toward debtors and encourages abuse since quick easy and relatively painless way to avoid repayment of unsecured debt is available many consumers are said to choose to file bankruptcy rather than live within their means the existence of the bankruptcy option following this line of reasoning causes irresponsible andor fraudulent behavior by borrowers which inevitably drives up loan losses credit card issuers have been strong supporters of needsbased bankruptcy and other reforms designed to shift the costs of personal bankruptcy from creditors to debtors7 opponents of such proposals however see the causal relationship flowing in the opposite direction they argue that the marketing tactics of credit card lenders the ubiquitous mass mailings offers of preapproved lines of credit low initial interest rates etc amount to forcefeeding very expensive form of credit to households with little financial sophistication many such households take on debt burdens that they cannot repay or which at least put them closer to the edge so that any setback to their financial situation drops them into bankruptcy court if lenders experience high loss rates in this view they are only reaping what they have sown and in any case they are compensated for risk by the high interest rates they charge does bankruptcy cause excessive losses to lenders or do lending practices cause bankruptcies this report considers the evidence that may shed light on these questions the following sections examine 1 the significance of credit card debt in terms of the total picture of consumer finance 2 the growth of and competitive conditions in the credit card industry in particular the issues of why credit card interest rates are so high and whether the credit card market has expanded principally through marketing to lowincome highrisk households and 3 changes in the debt burdens of american households debt burden or debt service payments as share of total income is an indicator of the ability to pay 7 for examples of these arguments and rebuttals see us congress senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on

show that revolving credit has been the fastest growing type of household debt since 1980 revolving credit in turn is dominated by bank credit card lending as is shown in figure 2 below which sets out revolving credit by holder commercial banks and pools of securitized assets loans which have been packaged as bonds and sold to investors and which are longer carried on the originating banks books account for about 80 of the total loan volume however revolving credit remains relatively small fraction of total household borrowing which continues to be dominated by home mortgage debt since 1980 households have taken on about 465 billion in additional revolving card debt but 8 revolving credit includes not only bankcards such as visa and mastercard but also cards issued by oil companies and retailers crs5 figure 2 revolving credit outstanding by holder 19801997 over the same period mortgage and home equity loans outstanding have grown by nearly 3 trillion source federal reserve release g19 why then does the bankruptcy debate focus on credit card borrowing rather than on mortgage debt one answer is that mortgages are little affected by the bankruptcy process the lenders right to foreclose if the loan is not repaid survives bankruptcy another answer more germane to this report is that credit card interest rates are among the highest if not the highest charged by mainstream lenders dollar of credit card debt will require greater share of the borrowers income than dollar of other debt credit card debt became even more expensive relative to mortgage debt when the tax reform act of 1986 took away the deductibility of credit card interest payments it may be therefore that credit card debt raises debt burdens disproportionately to its share in total household borrowing why are credit card interest rates so high there are two parts to the question of credit card interest rates the first is why have rates been so high the second is what impact do these rates have on household finances that is are they so high that they cause financial distress and lead to bankruptcies the first question has been the subject of much research independent of the bankruptcy issue that research is summarized here the price of loan the interest rate charged to borrowers is determined by several factors the interest rate must yield enough revenue to cover the lenders costs cost of funds administrative costs etc and it must include risk premium to cover the possibility of borrower defaults the size of the premium varies according to the lenders perception of the credit risk involved in particular loan or class of loans credit card loans are at the riskier end of the scale they are unsecured as crs6 noted above and they are relatively unsupervised once the initial decision to issue card is made borrower can indeed is likely to increase the size of his debt as his creditworthiness declines figure 3 selected interest rates 19801997 source federal reserve high risk premium means that credit card interest rates will be high relative to other rates9 however one would still expect the absolute level of credit card rates to fluctuate as lenders costs go up and down this has not happened as figure 3 above shows credit card rates have been not merely high but sticky they have not followed the general trends in interest rates which raise and lower lenders cost of funds if lenders interest costs go down and their interest revenues do not their profits will increase other things being equal the table below presents data on the profitability of credit card operations of depository institutions10 over the period 1974 through 1996 credit card lending was the least profitable of the four types of loans however the standard deviation of credit card profits was much greater than for other types of lending profits tend to be quite high or very low even running into negative returns this is what one would expect from any high riskhigh reward business operation volatile rate of return 9 administrative costs are also higher for credit card lending than for other types of loans because of the large numbers of accounts and transactions see canner

profitability of credit card operations of depository institutions annual report to congress august 1997 table 2 in competitive market the longterm returns for different types of lending ought to be about equal the fact that credit card returns are the lowest over 1974 1996 may simply indicate that the time period selected includes two downturns in the credit card lending cycle 198081 when returns were low and 199596 when they were actually negative 293 in 1995 and 375 in 1996 the 19731996 performance of credit card profits contrasts strikingly to the period beginning in 1983 at the end of the recession of the early 1980s and ending in 1993 before the onset of the record chargeoff rates of the last few years over that 11year period credit cards average profitability was the highest of the four lending operations while the variability of returns was half that of the longer period during the shorter period the average interest rate paid by credit card borrowers was stable despite downward trend in the general level of interest rates the combination of aboveaverage profits and rigid prices is unusual if above average returns are available new competitors should enter the market and by competing for market share drive prices down until profit levels fall into the normal range new competitors did enter the market but they did not compete on price there was considerable suspicion of pricefixing in the credit card industry in 1991 the senate passed measure that would have set ceiling on credit card rates11 to most economists it seemed unlikely that anticompetitive collusion or price fixing could explain the stickiness in interest rates the credit card industry consists of thousands of lenders 6800 in 1997 each of whom decides individually what rate to charge consumers12 there are significant barriers to 11 senate amendments 1333 and 1334 to s 543 102nd congress 12 in fact there is considerable variation in the rates charged by individual lenders it is continued crs8 entry it is relatively simple and inexpensive for any bank to become member of the visa or mastercard associations nonbank corporations like general motors and att also issue bankcards competition is also present from other cards like sears discover and american expresss ultima from bank atm cards and from cards issued by merchants several explanations for why credit card rates did not fall have been put forward these focus on 1 particular historical circumstances in the development of credit card markets and with more direct relevance to the credit cardbankruptcy question 2 consumer behavior and 3 nonprice competition historical accidents number of unique historical circumstances have been suggested as reasons why credit card rates remained high and inflexible between 1983 and 199313 until the early 1980s interest rates were capped by state usury ceilings because of inflation credit card rates during the 1970s were generally set at the legal maximum thus there was experience of price competition based on interest rates when the limits were removed capital expenditures related to computerization in the industry may have been high in the 1980s resulting in above normal administrative costs the heavy demand for credit as the recession of 198082 ended may have allowed lenders to increase their loan volume as much as they wished without having to compete for market share banks may have overestimated the risk premium by failing to anticipate that the expansion of the 1980s would last as long as it did the risk premium for credit card loans may have increased in tandem with the rise in bankruptcy rates shown in figure 1 above with the result that rates held steady as the cost of funds declined taken together these factors suggest that in normal times credit card interest rates will rise and fall as other rates do and that recent rate rigidity does not signal failure of competition in other words the behavior of rates and profits during the 19831993 period was an anomaly that will not be repeated the evidence to date on this claim however is mixed the average rate declined from the 1718 range to 1516 between 1992 and 1994 but has fluctuated very little since however other interest rates have been relatively stable since then as well other analyses of rate rigidity focus on permanent features of the credit card market 12 continued the average rate that has been inflexible some lenders adjust their rates as the general level of interest rates changes while others offer lower rates to selected customers the mystery is why such lenders do not dominate the market and why competition does not force others to emulate them 13 this analysis draws heavily on canner and luckett op cit and ladermann elizabeth whats special about recent credit card problems journal of lending and credit risk management v 80 september 1997 p 2124 crs9 consumer indifference to interest rate levels lawrence ausubel in 1991 article that has become touchstone for much subsequent research on the topic sees in the persistence of high rates and high profits failure of competition14 credit card issuers he concludes have exercised market power behaving like monopolists despite market structure easy entry many sellers in which competitive conditions ought to prevail his explanation is based upon consumer behavior users of credit cards have not acted in accordance with the assumptions that underlie economic models of competition in other words consumers have not responded to lower interest rates removing the incentive for lenders to compete on price this seems paradoxical why would borrowers not flock to the lender with the lowest interest rates in his answer ausubel divides credit card applicants into two groups one group expects to borrow and pay interest the second expects to use the card only for convenience and to pay the bill in full each month the first group is sensitive to the interest rate charged the second is not because its members do not expect to pay any interest at all why do banks not compete by lowering interest rates to attract as many of the first group as possible there are two reasons first people who dont mind borrowing at high interest rates are likely to be poor credit risks they may be in financial distress they may be consumers who are unwilling to pace their level of consumption to their incomes or they may be financing some risky entrepreneurial project for which they cannot secure credit elsewhere lenders face an adverse selection problem if they lower interest rates they will find themselves with riskier pool of loans second and most important to ausubels analysis many of the second group do end up borrowing contrary to their expectations in consumer surveys about half of households claim that they always or nearly always pay their credit card bills in full each month banks however report that about 75 of credit card accounts incur interest charges15 this disparity suggests that large number of credit card borrowers do not act in their selfinterest by demanding low interest rates because 1 they do not expect ex to borrow and 2 they are unwilling to admit to themselves ex post that they are borrowing or perhaps expect their indebtedness to be shortlived these unexpecting borrowers are the credit card companies preferred customers but since they do not think of themselves as borrowers lenders cannot attract them by lowering interest rates these consumers will focus instead on such features as the annual fee charged the length of the grace period before interest is assessed the credit limit and various enhancements rebates frequent flier miles and the like in sum from the lenders perspective cutting rates is counterproductive for two reasons16 14 ausubel lawrence the failure of competition in the credit card market american economic review v 81 march 1991 p 5081 15 ibid p 7172 16 actually three reasons firm likes to cut prices and for credit card lenders it is particularly painful because lowering rates across the board reduces income from all continued crs10 low rates attract less reliable borrowers with the undesirable result of increasing the lending institutions credit risk exposure and the best credit risks ignore offers of lower rates this analysis runs counter to fundamental assumption about how markets work that consumers can make rational decisions in their own economic self interest it requires not only that many credit card users make an initial mistake i wont use the card to borrow but that they keep making essentially the same error i will pay off the whole debt this month and wont have to pay interest next month the notion of persistent economic irrationality on the part of large numbers of consumers which ought not to exist in conventional microeconomics may have implications for the high rate of personal bankruptcy consumer groups who attribute bankruptcies to over aggressive marketing of credit cards often portray consumers as victims of forces and urges they cannot control credit counseling which both lenders and consumer groups favor does not involve just the techniques of balancing household budget but at times mimics alcoholics anonymous and other selfhelp groups that operate through catharsis and spiritual transformation for example overspending with credit cards says the consumer federation of america is an obsession that can get out of controlif you want to see grown person cry sit in on one of my counseling sessions and watch cut up the credit cards says betty matthews consumer credit counselor yes we do we cut them in half17 ausubels analysis does account for the stickiness of credit card interest rates but there is another explanation for the failure of consumers to demand lower rates an explanation that is consistent with the assumption of consumer rationality switching costs consumers paying interest on an unpaid credit card balance have an incentive to seek out lower rates the bigger the balance the stronger is the incentive however consumers who owe large amount on their current card and who would benefit most from lower interest rate may face switching costs as follows if they try to open an account with credit card issuer offering lower rate that issuer will not know whether their intention is to refinance their existing debt or to take on additional debt as result their applications are more likely to be turned down in addition switching cards may involve giving up favorable treatment from the present lender such as higher credit limits granted to those with good longterm repayment records from the lenders point of view the adverse selection problem again emerges the applicants responding to offers of lower rates are likely to be those whose debt levels are already high18 16 continued outstanding loans unlike say home mortgages where lower rate applies only to credit extended after the rate cut 17 koch kathleen credit card debt crushing millions group says cnn interactive december 16 1997 18 for full development of the switching costs argument see calem paul s and continued crs11 the switching costs argument posits that consumers are not irrationally indifferent to high interest rates but that they face obstacles when they try to obtain lower rates the preapproved credit may not be approved after all however the explanatory power of this argument is challenged by anecdotal evidence of widespread card surfing the practice of switching accounts rapidly from one card to another to take advantage of low rates offered for some introductory period19 to summarize each of the explanations for rate stickiness has problems but all imply that high rates need not signify illegal collusion among lenders however even though lenders have sound and plausible reasons for maintaining high rates the question remains what impact those rates have on consumer finances the next section considers the part credit card debt plays in the aggregate household debt burden household debt and access to credit cards trends in the aggregate household debt burden to family in financial trouble the amount of debt is generally more important than its composition and the amount of debt service payments required month by month is more important than the amount outstanding what has happened to the total debt burden during the ongoing surge in personal bankruptcy filings the federal reserves latest survey of consumer finances includes information on debt ratios that is the relationship of debt service payments to total income table 3 presents these data for 1989 1992 and 1995 broken down by family income level the table also includes as measure of families in financial distress the percentage of families whose debt payments exceed 40 of their incomes the aggregate debt burden for all families as measured by the ratio of debt payments to total income has been essentially constant since 1989 within the income distribution however there has been shift families with incomes below 50000 devoted more of their incomes to debt payments in 1995 than in 1989 while those with incomes above 50000 devoted less this need not mean that upper income households are reducing their aggregate debt levels in the case of credit card debt as will be seen below they clearly are not it may mean instead that their incomes are growing faster than their debts conversely those in the lower part of the income distribution may have experienced either falling incomes or rising debts or both there is question in other words whether these trends in the burden of debt follow from changes in the pattern of borrowing or from increasing income inequality table 3 measures of the family debt burden 18

distress corroborating pattern is observed the percentage of families who spend more than 40 of their incomes on debt service has risen in the lower income brackets and fallen in the upper the dividing line however is now at the 25000 income level rather than 50000 the figure for all families is again roughly constant the observation that debt burdens and financial distress have both been rising for lowerincome families suggests source of the rising numbers of bankruptcy filings to what extent has credit card debt contributed to these trends table 4 below shows the debt burden arising specifically from credit card debt again the measure is debt service payments divided by total family income the data in table 4 like those in table 1 above showing the dollar value of different forms of household debt suggest that credit card debt is minor factor in the overall household finance picture for all households debt service on credit cards consumes only onehalf of 1 of family income in the latest survey that figure has grown since 1989 and it is inversely related to family income just as the overall debt burden is but even for the poorest families it is small fraction of income

have significant impact on households with low incomes which lack savings and other financial resources to weather economic adversity is there straw that has broken the camels back while the median debt burden has grown for lowincome families have they gained greater access to credit cards the next section takes up this question by returning to the issues of growth and competition in the credit card industry competition and access to credit cards to the casual observer that is to anyone with mailbox or television set it appears that credit card issuers compete rather vigorously if competition is not based on price what form does it take in 1995 and 1996 returns on the credit card operations of banks were negative in 1997 the bad news continued there is now talk of general retrenchment in the industry20 this development is not out of accord with economic theory which predicts that in free market excess profits will be competed away lending markets in the united states have in any case been prone to boomandbust cycles how did this happen during period when the rates charged to borrowers held steady and when an important component of lenders costs the cost of funds to banks reflected by the general level of interest rates had fallen and remained low possible explanation is that competition among credit card lenders took the path of lowering credit standards 20 anderson tom et who will survive the bank card shakeout aba banking journal v 89 novemberdecember 1997 p 5564 crs14 the question of credit standards is directly related to the bankruptcy reform issue if banks in search of profits have voluntarily assumed higher credit risk by lending to those whom they would previously have deemed unacceptable risks their contention that lenient bankruptcy laws are to blame for rising loan losses invites skepticism that credit card borrowing is now more widely available would seem self evident to the casual observer introduced above deluged everyday by unsolicited offers of credit in addition the shift of commercial banks lending business from big corporations to small households has been one of the clearest trends in 20th century finance21 but an expansion of credit card lending which has certainly occurred22 does not necessarily indicate decline in credit standards available data however do shed some light on the recent evolution of the credit card market data from the federal reserves survey of consumer finances on the percentage of families reporting credit card debt and the median dollar value of such debt are presented in table 5 ausubels research discussed above suggests that credit card debt may be significantly underreported by survey respondents but there is reason to think that the degree of such wishful thinking by consumers should have changed markedly between 1989 and 1995 in other words the figures ought to give roughly accurate picture of the change in the incidence of credit card debt even if they understate the true percentage of households that carry such debt the first set of figures in table 5 shows steady increase in the percentage of families with credit card debt not the same as families with credit cards looking at the breakdown by family income the rate of increase is inversely related to the level of income the proportion of lowincome families with credit card debt has increased substantially that of highincome families has grown less or in the case of families at the top of the income scale has shown consistent pattern of growth this may be attributed to several factors highincome families were probably more likely to have had credit card debt before 1989 so there was less room for growth in addition some families in the upper income brackets may have substituted home equity loans where rates are lower and interest is tax deductible for credit card borrowing nonetheless the more rapid growth in the incidence of credit card debt among lowerincome families does suggest policy of extending credit to households who previously were denied access it is interesting that for families with incomes below 10000 the incidence of debt grew rapidly between 1989 and 1992 but much more slowly between 1992 and 1995 this pattern suggests typical lending cycle in which the volume of loans expands until credit quality deteriorates whereupon credit 21 see eg ogden nash on

source federal reserve survey of consumer finances various years standards are tightened banks recent losses from credit card operations suggest that such loan cycle may have peaked in the credit card market in the early 1990s23 the second set of figures in table 5 shows the median value of family credit card debt these figures tell different story median credit card debt has increased among all families but the increase has not been dramatic which is what would be expected from the figures on the debt burden arising from credit cards see table 4 on page 13 this pattern of moderate growth in aggregate credit card balances without striking variation by family income suggests that the growth in total credit card debt outstanding is not primarily result of expanded access to credit among 23 on credit tightening see zandi mark the lender of first and last resort journal of lending and credit risk management v 80 september 1997 p 1420 crs16 lowerincome families this is also the conclusion reached by 1997 study by peter yoo of the federal reserve bank of st louis increases in credit card debt are largely attributable to increased average credit card debt per household not from more households with access to credit cards moreover households in the top half of the income distribution account for most of the growth of credit card debt even though lowerincome households increased their access to credit cards and their average debt at faster rate than the total population so most of the increase in credit card debt between 1983 and 1992 is attributable to households with previous credit card experience and with aboveaverage incomes not to inexperienced lowincome households24 returning to the issue of bankruptcy reform the data in table 5 do not show that lowering credit standards to accommodate lowincome and other things being equal highrisk borrowers is mainly responsible for the growth in credit card loan volume there may have been general loosening of credit standards consistent with the cyclical nature of most lending operations but there is obvious evidence that lowincome financially unsophisticated households were the special beneficiaries or victims these observations provide little support for the contention of antireform groups that irresponsible greedy and reckless lending policies have led to record bankruptcies summary of data and conclusion the data considered thus far the available data do not provide any direct way to assess the impact of credit card lending on the rise in personal bankruptcy that began in the early 1980s we have seen that the incidence of credit card debt has increased significantly among lowerincome families and that the aggregate debt burden of such families has risen simultaneously however credit card debt does not appear to have played leading role in the growing debt burden of these families the data do not show that the median family credit card debt either as dollar figure or as the percentage of family income that debt service requires has reached level that justifies alarm credit card debt despite an impressive rate of growth over the past decade remains small percentage of household debt and the families with the greatest amount of debt outstanding are those with the highest incomes and consequently the greatest ability to repay still personal bankruptcies continue to soar the conclusion must be that analyses based on aggregate average or median statistics are of limited value in identifying the causes of personal bankruptcy as group bankruptcy petitioners must be unrepresentative in their levels of debt or in their debtincome ratios this is surprise despite claims that the stigma of filing bankruptcy has declined only scattered and fragmentary information about the financial condition of bankruptcy petitioners is available for example 1996 visa study reported that bankcard 24 yoo peter s charging up mountain of debt accounting for the growth of credit

to 47 billion or an average of 5400 per nonbusiness bankruptcy25 this figure is considerably higher than the median figures reported in the survey of consumer finances but it is not so large as to suggest that it dominates the petitioners balance sheets without information on petitioners other liabilities together with their assets and incomes the credit card figure lacks context and meaning the bulk of the visa study is survey asking the reasons why people filed for bankruptcy the most common response was overextended which only begs the question that most interests policymakers and economists why are so many consumers overextended when the economy appears to be doing so well is credit card borrowing trap for the unwary bringing disorder into the financial houses of an unspecifiable number of atypical families and individuals perhaps but so are medical expenses divorce job loss casino gambling narcotics investment scams and so on anecdotal evidence abounds statistical evidence is scarce the difficulty in considering bankruptcy reform proposals lies in the need to make decisions about general trends without knowing the particulars 25 consumer bankruptcy
