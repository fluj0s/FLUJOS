proposals summary on march 6 2006 the presiden t announced that he was sending to congress proposed legislation that would provide fasttrack procedure to require the congress to vote upordown on rescissi ons proposed by the president the presidents proposal denominated the legis lative line item ve to act of 2006 was introduced the next day in the senate and house as s 2381 and hr 4890 in comments accompanying the proposal it is asse rted that the presidents proposal is fully consistent with the constitution in its 1998 ruling in clinton v city of new york striking down the line item veto act of 1996 the suprem court concluded that the act gave the president unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes the legislative line item ve to act does not raise those constitutional issues because the presidents rescission proposals must be enacted by both houses and signed into law standing alone the proposed expedited rescission procedure would likely pass constitutional scrutiny congress would simply establish process whereby the president may propose rescission of sp ecific types of ppropriation and tax provisions including earmark s the fact the congress must act within limited time period to either approve or reject the proposal and that certain procedural and deliberative processes are curtailed or eliminated does not raise constitutional questions the socalled fasttrack process is an exercise of the constitutionallybased authority of each house to establish its own rules of internal procedure the expedited rescission process of these bills however does not stand alone under the proposal the president would be given discretionary power to suspend covered spending and tax pr ovisions for up to 180 days and perhaps more even if congress rejected proposed rescission with in that period this is unlike the current rescission process under the impoundment control act which requires the obligation of funds if congress fails to approve th presidents rescission proposal within 45 days of continuous session af ter submission of rescissi on proposal or the provision in the rejected line veto act of 1996 which required expenditure of canceled authorities immediately upon the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval in addition while congress must act speedily when it receives the presidents proposal nothing in the bills specifies when the president must send up his proposal nor do the bills appear to require that targeted spending and tax provisions in one law be sent up together and nothing in the bills limits the suspension period to the stated 180day suspension period or prohibits the additional utilization of the 45day wait period for proposed rescissions under the current impoundment control act

determinations required by the law to be made and the reasons for the cancellations within five calendar da ys of the enactment of the law containing such provisions7 all covered provisions of law sought to be canceled had to be submitted together in that message8 cancellation of the specified provisions took effect on receipt of the special message by both houses9 if disapproval bill was enacted the cancellation was deemed to be null and void and the provisions became effective as of the original date of the law10 the president was prohibited from attempting to recancel items that were the subject of previous special message for which congress had enacted disapproval legislation11 the veto act also provided for expedited congressional consideration of bills introduced to disapprove cancellations c ongress provided for itself review period of 30 calendar days of session beginning on the first calendar day of session after receipt of the presidents special message if congress adjourned prior to the expiration of the 30day period pending disapproval bill could be brought up again in the next congress if filed within five calendar days after the commencement of the

the existence of the veto act the president sent 11 special messages canceling total of 82 provisions including the two that were the subject of the clinton ruling congress passed one bill

the final text of what may become law such change must come not by legislation but through amendment procedures set forth in article v of the constitution 22 id at 449the supreme courts invalidation of the line item veto act in clinton v city of new york16 the supreme court dealt with two presidential cancellations under the veto act an item of direct spending in the balanced budget act of 1997 and limited tax benefit in th taxpayer relief act of 1997 after finding that the plaintiffs had suffered the requisite injury for article iii standing the court addressed the merits of the case hol ding by 63 vote that allowing the president to cancel provisions of enacted law violated the constitutions presentment clause17 in both legal and practical effect the president has amended two acts of congress by repealing portion of eac h repeal of statutes less then enactment must conform with art i ins v chadha 462 us 919 954 198318 such statutory repeals the court empha sized must conform to the presentment clauses single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure for enacting law ie passage of bill by both houses presentment of the measure for the presidents signature or veto and veto override if necessary again citing chadha19 the court then determined that th cancellation procedures of the veto act did not so conform because nothing in the constitution authorized the president to amend or repeal statute or parts of statute unilaterally and because historical writings and practice provided powerful reas ons for construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important issue as quivalent to an express prohibition20 the courts majority opinion pointedly rej ected the notion that congress and the president could agree by law to authorize the president himself to effect the repeal of laws for his own policy reasons wit hout observing the procedures set out in article i sec7 the fact that congress intended such result is of moment although congress presumably anticipated that the president might cancel some of the items in the balanced budget act and in the taxpayer relief act congress cannot alter the procedures set out in article i sec7 without amending the constitution21 implications of the breadth of the clinton ruling the broad unequivocal nature of the majo rity opinion is underlined by justice kennedys concurring opinion responding to justice breyers suggestion in dissent that the courts role in case such as th is is lessened here because the two political branches are adjusting their own powers between themselves22 justice kennedys rebuttal emphasizes that this case raises important structural separation of powershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs5 23 id at 450 24 id at 44950 25 mistretta v united states 488 us

the framers fear that the concentration of power in the hands of single branch is threat to liberty23 he stated to say the political branches have so mewhat free hand to reallocate their own authority would seem to require acceptan ce of two premises first that the public good demands it and second that liberty is not at risk the former premise is inadmissible the constitutions structur requires stability which transcends the convenience of the moment see metropolitan washington airports authority v citizens for abatement of aircraft noise inc 501 us 252 276277 1991 bowsher v synar 478 us 714

more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers24 the supreme court has developed two lines of separation of powers jurisprudence the first reflects the courts concerns over encroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our separationof powers jurisprudence and aroused our vigilance against the hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate branches to exceed the outer limits of its power25 in such structural cases the court has articulated interpretations of constitutional directions that are rigid and which may not be altered and are not subject to balancing justice blackmun speaking for the court in mistretta delineated the cases that have been subject to such formalist analysis accordingly we have not hesitated to strike down provisions of law that either accrete to single branch powers more appropriately diffused among separate branches or that undermine the authority and independence of one or another coordinate branch for example just as the framers recognized the particular danger of the legislative bran chs accreting to itself judicial or executive power so too have we invalidated attempts by congress to exercise the responsibilities of other branches or to reassign powers vested by the constitution in either the judicial branch or the executive branch bowsher v synar 478 us 714 1986 congress may not exercise

encroachment were not apparent and what was involved was the establishment by congress of the arrangements within and between the agencies the president congress and the judiciary unde r its broad article i authority to create agencies and vest them with the necessary tools to carry out their assigned tasks the key question in disputes over agency arra ngements is whether so much has been taken from the functioning of one constitutional actor as to impair that actors core constitutional functions the court sees its task in these cases as assuring that the essential lines of authority from the constitutional actors remain intact by utilizing balancing test functionalist appro ach as justice blackman explained in mistretta by the same token we have upheld stat utory provisions that to some degree commingle the functions of the branches but that pose danger of either aggrandizement or encroachment morrison v olson 487 us 654 1988 upholding judicial appointment of inde pendent

commn v schor 478 us at 85128 justice kennedy viewed the courts item veto decision as falling within the first or formalist line of cases just described or as he characterizes them the vertical separation of powers line of authority separation of powers helps to ensure the ability of each branch to be vigorous in asserting its proper authority in this respect the device operates on horizontal axis to secure proper balance of legislative executive and judicial authority separation of powers operates on vertical axis as well between each branch and the citizens in whose interest powers must be exercised the citizen has vital interest in the regularity of the exercise of governmental power if this point was not clear before chadha it should have been so afterwards though chadha involved the deportation of person while the case before us involves the expenditure of money or the grant of tax exemption this circumstance does not mean that the vertical operation of the paration of powers is irrelevant here by increasing the power of the president beyond what the framers envisioned thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs7 29 clinton v city of new york 524 us at 452 30

kennedy succinctly encapsulated in his conclusion that congressional cession of power is voluntary does not ma ke it innocuous the constitution is compact enduring for more than our time and one congress cannot yield up its own powers much less those of othe r congresses to follow abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design30 constitutional analysis of s 2381 and hr 4890 as introduced constitutional issues that may be raised by the administration proposals the bills line item veto provision presents apparent constitutional problem with respect to the expedited rescission process it establishes the president is not vested with direct authority to cancel c overed spending or ta x benefit provisions he must send up to congress proposals to resc ind such provisions which must be acted upon either by passage of law approving the cancellations or by vote not to approve the proposal constitutional i ssue appears raised by congress imposing on itself requirement that it must take legislative actions within limited period of time or that certain procedural and deliber ative processes are curtailed or eliminated the socalled fasttrack process is an exercise of the constitutionallybased authority of each house to establish its own rules of internal procedure which has been broadly construed by the courts31 but this proposal also vests the presiden t with discretionary authority that may raise constitutional question under clinton the bills set time frame within which the president must send up resci ssion proposal after law is enacted when he does send up proposal he may suspend the covered pr ovisions designated for up to 180 calendar days the suspension may be terminated at any earlier time if he determines that continuation of the susp ension would not further serve the purposes of this act the bills do not require that targeted spending and tax provisions contained in one law must be sent up at the same time further nothing in the bills expressly limits the suspension period to the stated 180 day deferral period nor is there prohibition against using the resc ission authority of the impoundment control act32 in conjunction with the proposed item veto act either before or after message is sent to congress triggering the process of the latter act finally the 180 day deferral of discretionary budget au thority

idautomatically end with early congressional rejection of rescission proposal unless the president so ordered the termination critics have suggested that use of the 180day deferral period could effectively kill various items by withholding funding until the end of the fiscal year on september 30 even if congress had act ed swiftly to reject his proposed cancellations33 it has also been suggested that the fasttrack rescission process could be paired with the old rescission process to grant the white house 45 extra days of budget impoundment authority by seeking second vote under the old rescission process for cuts that had been initially rejected under the new proposal34 spokesperson for the office of mana gement and budget omb reportedly has responded that such concerns are exa ggerated the 180 days provision allows items for the which the president will seek rescission to be set aside while rescission is considered by congress if c ongress rejects rescission request then the president has the authority to terminate the deferral and let the f unds be spent or the tax benefits be pr ovided the administrations in tention would be to do so immediately the spokesperson explaine d that the 180day deferral period was designed for those periods when congress takes long recesses nd as way to prod action for example for 2006 congress has t an early october target date for adjournment while many observers belie ve that means postelection session is likely it is possible the congress could stay out of session until february period of about five months35 considerations that may be taken into account by reviewing court departures from past norms of protections of legislative prerogatives it is likely that reviewing court acting on legal challenge to the line item veto act in attempting to assess whether the proposed suspension authority is effectively proscribed cancellation power would look to past congressional actions to discern the degree of departure from pa st norms of protections of legislative prerogatives for example under the current impoundment control act the rescission and deferral proce sses are tightly controlled rescissions may be proposed by the president at any time congress s 45 days of conti nuous session to approve rescission bill but it is not required to take any action during that period ie neither house has to vote on the proposal during the 45day period budget authority is suspended when the 45 day period ends without congressi onal rescission actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs9 36 2 usc 683 in the past omb has been f ound to have expanded the 45day period during which funds are frozen by starting the deferra l before the submission of the presidents rescission message on the ground that there needs to be time to decide whether to ask for rescission and then time for preparation of th message arguing that it would be wasteful to obligate funds for program that might be canceled by congress all of this often took 30 or more days extending the statutory 45 days suspension period in one instance in 1986 five and half months elapsed between the effective date of particular appropriation and the submission of the required report under the act the comptroller general issued several opinions critical of the practice see eg 54 comp gen 453 462 1974 gao will construe deferral as facto rescission if the timing of the proposed deferral is such that funds could be expected with reasonabl certainty to lapse before they could be obligated or would have to be obligated impr udently to avoid that consequence see crs archived report 87173 presidential impoundment authority after city of new haven v united states by richard ehlke and morton rosenberg recounting the practice and congressional and gao reactions available from authors 37 2 usc 684 38 809 f 2d 900 dccir 1987the budget authority must be made ava ilable for obligation immediately and the rescission procedure under the act cannot be used again for those funds36 the current impoundment control act also has provision that allows for deferrals up to the end of the fiscal year in which special message is transmitted to congress such deferrals are limited to programmatic deferrals and exclude policy deferrals37 it has been very rarely used in recent times but the 180day suspension period proposal now under consid eration could significantly alter that deferral limitation and even revive the practice of presidential policy deferrals it therefore may be instructive to briefly re view the history of that provision and its significance in congress past efforts to control executive impoundments the original impoundment control act of 1974 llowed deferrals of budget authority not to extend beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the message reporting the deferral was transmitted the act also provided that deferral could be terminated by the passage of resolution of disapprova l by either house of congress the 1983 chadha decision declaring all one nd twohouse legislative vetoes unconstitutional effectively nullified the deferral legislative veto provision the question that remained was whether the invalid veto provision was severable from the statute leaving the president with an unfettered deferral power or whether it was inseverable leaving deferral power at all at the time the president acted on the presumption he had unf ettered deferral author ity in the wake of chadha the issue was resolved by the dc circuits ruling in city of new haven v united states 38 which held that congress would have preferred statute to one without the onehouse veto provision becau it was so essen tial in controlling presidential deferrals section 1013 was designed specifically to provide congress with means for controlling presidential deferrals as consequence of the supreme courts decision in chadha however that section has been transformed into license to impound funds for policy reasons this

786colorable statutory basis for unchecked policy deferrals we cannot imagine that congress would have acted in complete contravention of its intended purposes by enacting section 1013 without legisla tive veto provision accordingly we hold that the unc onstitutional legislative veto provision contained in section 1013 is inseverable from the remainder of the section and we affirm the judgement of the district court invalidating section 1013 in its entirety39 the court emphasized the important substantive difference it saw between policy and programmatic deferrals the critical distinction between programmatic and policy deferrals is that the former are ordinarily intended to advance congressional budgetary policies by ensuri ng that congressional programs are administered efficiently while the latter are ordinarily intended to negate the will of congress by substituting the fiscal policies of the executive branch for those established by enactment of budget legislation40 throughout the opinion the appeals court further noted its view of the limited scope of the executives remaining authority to implement programmatic impoundments by characterizing it as dealing with routine41 and trivial matters 42 and referring to them as these trivial impoundments relating to the normal and orderl operation of the government that congress expected to present little controversy43 nine months later congress codified the appeals courts distincti on between policy and programmatic deferrals which now appears at 2 usc 68444 in that same legisl ation congress prohibited the then prevalent practice of presiden ts of submitting new rescission proposal concerning identical or very similar matter when congress failed to act on rescission proposal within the allotted 45 days by using such submissions the president sought to continue to tie up f unds even though congress by its inaction had already rejected the same propos the enacted prohibition against such seriatim rescission proposals pplies for the duration of the appropriation so it may remain in effect for two or more fiscal years45 even under the 1996 veto act that wa s declared

reported to the floor by the seventh day after introduction without amendment could be amended in the hous if supported by 50 members and new cancellation items could be added in the senate if the

provisions of the current impoundment contro l act and the judicially nullified item veto act of 1996 and past executive challenges to legislative spending controls and congressional responses provide background to the analysis of how court might view the current item veto proposal the i ssue is whether the proposed legislative line item veto act in its present form would have the potential of allowing the president through the utilization of the 180 day rescission authority together with piecemeal submissions of rescission requests to effectively cancel spending items the question that remains is whether the clinton ruling and prior separation of powers cases would be applied to reach such potential constitutional consequences the clinton case is properly categorized as one of line of structural separation of powers decisions that has included chadha and bowsher in which the supreme court has invalidated provisions that either accrete to single branch powers more appropriately diffused among separate branches or that undermine the authority and independence of one or nother coordinate branch51 the salient characteristic of those rulings is that they admit of exception and allow balancing of interests of need necessity or convenience they expr essly reject the validity of an agreement on such reassignments by the political branches that is embodied in law in at least one instance federal appeals court has enforced such structural ruling finding that congress had attempted to evade high courts ruling by indirection those cases are illuminating on the subject

airports case52 the supreme court confronted an attempt by congress to vest managing authority over washington national and dulles international airports in regional authority while at the same time seeking to maintain control over key policy nd management decisions of the airports authoritys board of directors directors it did this by requiring the directors to establish board of review board c onsisting of nine mbers of congress to which the directors had to submit for th boards consideration and possible veto operative decisions such as the adoption of the annual budget the authorization for the issuance of bonds nd the adoption amendment or repeal of regulations congress also retained substa ntial authority over the appoi ntment and removal of the members of the board the court found th at as result of those provisions the board was an agent of the congress and th at the scheme of congressional control violated separation of powers principles if the power is executive the constitution does not permit an agent of congress to exercise it if the power is legislative congress must exercise it in conformity with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of art i sec 7 in short when congress takes action that has the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights duties and relations of persons outside the legislative branch it must take that action by the procedures authorized in the constitution see chadha 462 us at 95295553 the court rejected the argument that the board was kind of practical accommodation between the legislative and the executive that ght prove innocuous stating that the statutory scheme challenged today provides the blueprin t for extensive expansion of the legislative power beyond its constituti onally confined role and could not be countenanced it then quoted madisons warning that the legislature can with greater facility mask under complicated nd indirect measures the encroachments which it makes on the coo rdinate departments54 within six months after the suprem courts ruling congress passed new legislation the new statute did not requi re that members of congress be members of the new review board but their selection had to be from lists submitted by the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore at the senate the boards veto power was taken away but its power was expanded in other ways the catalogue of actions the board could review was expa nded and members of the board could participate but not vote at meetings of the directors also though its veto power was removed the board had authority to make recommendations regarding actions submitted for its review by the directors if those recommendations were not accepted by the directors the directors d to submit the matter to congress for reviewing period of 60 legislative days during which time the directors could take action on the matter if congress did not pass joint resolu tion of disapproval within that period the directors proposed action could take effect on review the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that the provisions of the revise d act taken together indicate that the board of

terms of the revised stat ute to ascertain its p ractical effect and design56 thus with respect to whether the ch ange in the nature of the appointment process for review board members made difference the court held that because the directors may never go outside the lists furnished by the speaker and the president pro tempore we conclude that congre ss retains control over the appointments this control together with the provisions that in practice ensure that the board will be dominated by members of congress persuades us that congress intended the board to serve and we hol d that it does serve as its agent57 turning to the separation of powers issu the court declared it would look to the practical consequences of the boards ability to delay actions by the directors58 it rejected the claim that when the board had been stripped of its direct veto and nowcould only recommend it had only advisory du ties noting that the boards loss of its veto power does not necessarily mean that it has lost effective control over the authority that the supreme court found to be an unconstitutional ex ercise of federal power we must therefore examine the pot ential impact of the boards remaining authority on the directors decisionmakin g to this end we examine the various ways in which the board is able to affect the substance of the authoritys actions 59 the court focused on the powers of the review board to influence through its abilityto delay action by the directors the board of review has been ve sted with range of powers whose cumulative effect is to enable it to in terfere impermissibly with the directors performance of their independent responsibilities in the place of the veto provision the amended transfer act empowers the board to choose in its sole discretion which of the authoritys deci sions may be implemented immediately and which will be subjected to the risks and delays of congressional review in the place of mandatory congressional membership on the board it sets forth requirements that both in principle and in practice continue to ensure congressional domination of the board in redefining the powers of the board it actually expands the scope of its review moreover the amended statute retains provisions permitting the board to compel the authority to consider particular issues and conditioning the authoritys ability to take vital actions on the boards own continuing ability to exercise its powers under the act what tips the balance in our judgement is the boards power to delay and perhaps overturn critical decisions by re quiring their referral to congress the delays it can impose are hardly trivial the 60legislativeday congressionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs14 60 id at 10405 61 id at 105 62 mcmurtry supra note 1 at

enormous incentive to avoid confrontations by tailoring their decisi ons to suit the boards pleasure it also gives the board the power to hold an important decision hostage in order to secure the directors agreement to an unrelated matter60 quoting the supreme courts words in metropolitan airports that the original statutory scheme was blueprint for ex tensive expansion of the legislative power beyond its constitutionallyconf irmed role the appeals court stated the we do not suggest that the board has or would abuse its authority in such manner but the potential for abuse is there61 observations the metropolitan airports and hechinger decisions seem to confirm the teachings of clinton and its structural separation of powers predecessors that the courts will take rigid approach when aggrandizement or encroachment of core constitutional prerogatives are involved the airports cases are particularly pertinent to the proposed item veto revival the clinton court spoke to the constitutional delicacy of attempting to reassign the power of cancellation to the president just as the metropolitan airports court rejected congress origin scheme to retain control of the washington airports congress atte mpt to address the courts concerns in metropolitan washington by enacting structural variant was struck down in hechinger on the basis of facial review of what might be the potential of the revised scheme to achieve the result found to be ille gitimate in the earlier case challengers to the administr ations proposed legislativ item veto act of 2006 or variant thereof

such deferrals and suspensions maybe extended for an additional 45 days upon prope r notification to the congress68 the period may also be extended if sine die adjournment occurs before the end of the 45 day calendar period69 finally it would appear that the practice established under the current impoundment control act which llows deferral of di scretionary funding obligations for the period prior to the 45 day period of congre ssional consideration of presidential rescission proposal70 would be statutorily recognized under revised hr 4890 current parts b dealing with proposed resci ssions and

report concedes that while the deferral and suspension authority of the president is independent of gislative actions taken by congress it is the intent of the committee that if vote is taken on an approval bill by either house and an approval bill is not agreed to by that house then the suspension of any provision of law must be revoked and that provision put into ffect as if it had always been effective under the terms of the public law in which it was originally included house rules committee report at 20 74 house rules committee report at 20 75 462 us 919 1983under secti on1012 2 u sc 683 of this title new section 1020c would be amended to read the provisions of this section do not apply to budget authority proposed to be canceled as set forth in special message require d to be transmitted under section 1011 thus in the absen ce of any express prohibition on deferral before submission of presid ential message it is possible that deferral of obligations under the amended bill could be at least 135 days moreover amended hr 4890 does not cont ain an express statutory direction that the obligation of funding is to re sume upon congressional action rejecting the cancellation proposal as is the case under current law71 rather the house report accompanying the bill states that once congress acts on an approval bill this deferral authority must be di scontinued by the president even though it is not legally or constitutionally required and must not extend it for the renewal period72 nor is there any express statutory relation between the deferral and suspension periods and the 15 session day expedited c ongressional consideration period73 t h accompanying house rules committee report explains that out of constitutional concerns the committee has not directly tied the suspension or deferral period to failed vote or on approval it does though indicate its intent that such vote should have that effect the president must immediately suspend the deferral of ll budgetary provisions included in an approval bill of proposed cancellation that after floor consideration of the bill has not received the requisite votes to pass in house of congress74 the house report does not explain the nature of its constitutional concerns but it appears to reflect objec tions voiced at hearings on the presidents proposals and by the office of management and budget omb that it would be constitutionally questionable under the supr eme courts ruling in ins v chadha75 for congress to give the president deferral or suspensi on power and then withdraw it based on congresss nonlegislative ac tion in failing to approve rescission proposal it is suggested that to accomplish that result congress must either pass new law directing such action or that such decisions might be left to the discretion of the president to determine if nd when to release funds or to implement direct spending or limited tax bene fits this idea reflects an appa rent misunderstanding of

to determine the rules of its proceedings this power has been construed broadly by the courts the supreme court has held that where neither express constitutional restraints nor fundamental ri ghts are ignored all matters of method are open to the determination of the house the power to make rules is not one which once exercised is exhausted it is continuous power always subject to be exercised by the house and within the limitations suggest ed absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal76 the supreme courts landmark ruling in ins v chadha is not to the contrary and indeed appears supportive of the type of action objected to by omb the constitutional defect of the legislative veto disclosed by the chadha court was that congress sought to exercise its legislative power without complying with the constitutionally mandated requirements for lawmaking bicameral passage and presentation to the president for his signatur or veto there and in two subsequent cases77 the court found unlawful legislative ac tions which sought to accomplish the reversal of exercises of executive actions taken pursuant to lawfully delegated authority without presentation to the presid ent but the court also noted several provisions of the constitution allowing legislative actions which do not have to comply with the presentation clause78 and in addition identified another exception to the rule that congressional action having the force of law be subject to the bicameral requirement and the presentment clause each house has the power to act alone in determining specified internal matters art 1 sec 7 cls 2 3 and sec 5 cl 2 79 the noted section 5 of course pr ovides in pertinent part that each house may determine the rules of its proceedings the court therefore recognized that the exercise of the rulemaking power may have an incidental impact outside the legislative branch however as long as its predominant focus is internal it is constitutional exercise of that authority moreover the chadha court carefully noted that it was not casting doubt on so called report and wait provisions which it previously approved in sibbach vhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs18 80 312 us 1 1941 81 see discussion supra at 89wilson 80 under such provisions proposed executive action does not become effective unless specified contingency occurs ie set period of time passes without congressional action preventing it fro m going into effect or congress takes affirmative legislative ac tion approving or disappr oving its effectiveness all the expedited consider ation provisions in pending line item veto proposals are variant examples of the legislative em ployment of this method of contingent legislation none of the presidents re scission recommendations become effective unless approved by bill that must be first considered by the house of representatives and the senate within sp ecified number of legislative days of its introduction in each house if it passes one house it goes to the other house for vote but if both houses do not pass the rescission bill within the statutorily prescribed consideration period the exerci ends and the suspension or obligation is lifted it is arguable that proper view of this mechanism is that it is contingency scheme in which the president has not been delegated any legislative authority at all rather he simply has been authorized to recommend rescissions and the proposal submitted has legal effect unless and until congress gives it such effect through further legislation in th exercise of its constitutional rulema king power it has established as matter of internal procedur that if passage by both houses fails within the prescribed period the process is over language in bill authorizing the president to suspend or to defer certain budget items can be read as incidental to the internal expedited consideration process deferral of obligation authority is incidental albeit necessary to this process since any agency use of obligation authority during the consideration process is subject to nullification and thus may raise the potential of unnecessary disr uption of the obligation process indeed as the example of the current rescission process under the impoundment control act demonstrates even the statutory silence there with respect to deferral of obligation authority during the 45 day wait period under section 683 has been consistently construed by both omb nd the government accountability office to implicitly allow the executive to defer spe nding during that period and indeed for period of 30 or more days prior to the presidents transmission of his rescission message to congress81 the implication of an allowable deferral is result of the language of section 683 b which requires obligation of budget authority reserved by the presidents message at the end of th 45 day period that inference is further supported by 2 usc 684 b which permits programmatic as opposed to policy deferrals to pr ovide for contingencies we are aware of instance in the past in which the executive has raised chadha objection to the section 683 direction to obligate as an exercise of caution however congress might consider either eliminating any suspension or deferral language in line item veto bill and leave only the direction for obligation after the congress defeats the rescission request or separately stating that the president may defer obligating or putting into effect targeted items only until congress fails to approve the presidents proposal under the acts expedited procedures arguably either method would accomplish the result without raising constitutional questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs19 82 see discussion supra at 711 83 see discussion supra at 35 1112 84 house rules committee report at 20 85 the dissent did not take into account that the president appears not to be precluded from ordering deferrals during the 45 day period after date of enactment of the funding legislation when he is considering whether to send up cancellation proposal 86 house rules committee report at 58finally the suggestion that separate bill would be required to end deferral or suspension appears to find supportable basis in the chadha ruling or its rationale indeed such requi rement could arguably by seen as running afoul of the supreme courts ruling in clinton v new york city the item veto case in that in giving the president second bite at th apple the period of deferral could be indefinitely extended while congress debates r eaffirming by law through normal legislative processes and subject to presidential veto that which it had already determined not to do82 the alternative suggestion that the lifting of deferral or suspension be discretionary in the president similarly raises clinton issues in that it would vest in president the power to termine whether provision of law would become operative or not an effective line item veto83 constitutional concerns with respect ot her aspects of hr 4890 as amended raise more difficult questions the poten tial period of deferra l or suspension of targetable items is at least 135 calendar days and it is conceded in the house rules committee report that there is relation between the deferral or suspension periods and the period of expedite d congressional considerati on which appears to be 15 legislative days moreover the hous rules committee report acknowledges that there is express requirement in the legi slation that funds be obligated immediately upon the defeat of cancellation proposal bu t states that it is its expectation that the president must immediately suspe nd the deferral of all budgetary provisions included in an approval bill of proposed can cellations that after floor consideration of the bill has not r eceived the requisite vote to pass in house of congress84 thus presidential deferral or suspensi on could potentially extend well beyond the date of definitive congre ssional rejection of cancella tion proposal the possible consequence of such delays as pointed out by the dissent to the house rules committee report is that if the president can withhold funds regardless of congressional action for up to three months85 then he can effectively starve programs to death denying them the funds needed to hire and pay staff as well as conduct routine business major appropriation such as amtrak could be forced to slash routes and fire staff long sta nding administration goal as long as the president retains this effective power of the pur it is also not clearly stated in the legislation that the president must re lease funds immediately if rescission is defeated86 we are aware that the plain meaning rule which purports to bar courts from relying on legislative history when statutor language is plain is often more honoredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs20 87 see statutory interpretation general prin

not likely that the committees statement of intent would be held persuasive the committee admits that it purposely omitted an express direction to the president because it believed it did not have the constitutiona l or legal authority to do so the report language is effectively hortatory request that the president do the right thing it is unlikely that reviewing court would fill the statutory void and find an enforceable right against presid ential inaction rather it is more likely that court will apply the pr inciples enunciated by the clinton ruling and find the scheme proposed by hr 4890 as amended is more than structural variant of the unsuccessful attempt to reassign the pow er of cancellation to the president in that case the potential of the scheme pr oposed by hr 4890 as revised to achieve the result found illegitimate in clinton may appear to review ing court in substance and effect different from the administra tions original propos discussed above title of the sos act the senate budget committee identifie d six concerns with s 2381 the administration proposal the short period given for cong ressional consideration of presidential rescission proposals the aut hority of the president to withhold funds from obligation for up to 180 days even if congress had defeated rescission proposal the ability of the president to repropose rescissions an unlimited number of times and to defer funds 180 days each time the ability of the president to send up an unlimited number of rescission proposals allowing the president to modify new direct spending programs and the lack of sunset provision for the legislation88 those concerns are addressed in title i of s 3521 comprehensive budget reform proposal under title i which displaces part c of the impoundment control containing the 1996 line item veto act the presiden t is permitted to send up more than four special messages per calendar year pr oposing to rescind discretionary budget authority items of direct spending and targeted tax benefits such messages containing targeted items must be sent within one calendar year of the date of enactment of the law in which they appear there can be resubmittals of items that have been rejected by the failure of congress to pass appr oval legislation except if congress adjourns sine die before completing action on message in that event the president may resubmit one or more of the targeted items either under new part c or under part b which is retained resubmission counts as one of the four allowable messages within one calender year the president may not defer obligation of dollar amounts of discretionary budget au thority or suspend the execution of any item of direct spending or targeted tax benefit until he sends up cancellation message such deferrals or suspensions can only be for 45 calendar days and may be lifted before the end of the period at th presidents discretion with regard to deferrals of discretionary budget authority withholding may not exceed 45 calendar days from the date of receipt by congress special rules apply to suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits if the presidents message is sent up onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs21 or before the effective date of the pr ovision the suspension may be for the full 45 days but if the president submits his message after the effective date of the targeted provision the allowable suspension period decreases day by day for each day beyond the effective date of the provision expedited consideration procedures are provided in both houses and an up or down vote must be taken on or before the 10th day of session after the introduction of the bill in each house the line item veto scheme of title i of the sos act appears to avoid most of the potential constitutional difficulties that have been identified in the administrations proposal and with hr 4890 as amended although the president has calendar year to send up cancellation message there are incentives to act more quickly there can be deferrals or suspensions of targeted provisions until the message is sent and received by cong ress deferrals ar limited to 45 calendar days and the language of the deferral provision together with the senate committees report explanation appears to make it certain that obligation must occur after the 45th day even if congress has not taken final di sapproval action the proposal however does not require obligation should disapproval occur before the end of the 45 day period in ot her words the periods of withholding and congressional consideration do not coincide by itself this disparity arguably may not be constitutionally fatal question could arise however from the failure to repeal part b of the impoundment control act u nder part b proposal for rescission of discretionary funding may be submitted by the president at any time and as we have described above deferra ls of obligational authority may occur not only for the 45 day consideration period but also for 30 or more days before the presidents rescission message is sent to congress the procedur established by part c is not exclusive or preemptive of part b proposed s ection 1021 states that the president may send special message at that time and in the manner provided in subsection b that proposes to rescind dollar amounts of discre tionary budget authority items of direct spending and targeted tax be nefits emphasis supplied the referenced subsection b makes it clear that the rescission provisi on of 2 usc 683 is viable option it can be utilized as an alternative if the consideration period is cut short by sine die adjournment but it can not be used if there is rejection of an approval bill nothing in the sos bill limits using section 683 befo re presidential use of proposed section 1021 such use of section 683 which coul d more than double the length of the possible deferral period to perhaps more than 100 days may raise the same clinton issues of potential illegitimate manipulation that appear in the administrations proposal and in hr 4890 as amended this problem does not appear to affect the suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits since the part b mechanism cannot be utilized to rescind such provisi ons and the automatic reduction of the 45 day suspension periods for delaying submi ssions to congress seems to insulate them from constitutional question the foregoing problem could be voided by repealing part b or by limiting the presid ent to utilization of either part b or part c for any particular targeted itemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33365crs22 89 one prominent scholar argues that the clinton ruling should be viewed as nondelegation decision my view of clinton v city of new york is that it is

formidable but not insurmountable legal obstacles to ve sting the president with form of line item veto authority89 while the courts opinion does not appear to limit providing the president with some form of line item veto influence by any means other than constitutional amendment its rationale seems to require that the statutory vesting of such effective influence must be carefully circumscribed to prevent even the potential vesting in the executive cancellation pow er structural separation of powers jurisprudence indicates that the courts will exercise heightened scrutiny of line item veto schemes as matter of caution nd prudence scheme th at provides authority for the president to submit proposals for can cellation of targetable items within very short time after enactment of the law that contains them and that provides for automatic deferrals or suspensions that co incide and end with the conclusion of the period of expedited congressi onal consideration is most likely to pass constitutional muster the validity of vestment in the executive of any further indicia of authority or control is uncertain
