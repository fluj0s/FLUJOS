davidparkermetofficegovuk brian soden bsodenrsmasmiamiedu susan solomon susansolomonnoaagov martin manning martinmanningnoaagov david r easterling davideasterlingnoaagov kevin i plan to look through your 341 draft tomorrow or later this week at the same time i also plan to have go at section 32 david has sent some new figures and there are two new papers to add in i am having difficulty finding some quality time at the moment but hope this will come later this week i did read all the ccsp report the review group are having conf call tomorrow on this but they have chosen your afternoon so i cant take part there were 6 reviewers of the review and one other almost wrote as much as you most were positive on the review saying that the report authors have lot to do particularly for chapters 1 and 6 how all this pans out is impossible to tell the next meeting of the authors is being scheduled for the week after beijing i agree some of their figures are useful but i too doubt whether we will have much useful for the fod we have to write we will likely be doing them in parallel which is hardly ideal i wouldnt send our 341 to tom at this time at least wait till brian david and i have been through yours also i wouldnt want tom passing it on to the ccsp vtt authors i think they will have lot of hard thinking when they get the nrc review to worry too much about what were doing we do need to have our chapter and their report meshing at some time but this might have to wait till the sod by which time their report might be finished cheers phil at 1735 18042005 parker david met office wrote kevin thanks you have saved some work because on my journey back from geneva i also studied the comments on 341 on paper and was considering making an electronic revised section i came to the conclusion that 341 should say that there are 2 schools of thought about fu et and other aspects of the temperaturesaloft issue the jury is still out that would be assessment as opposed to review of the current state of the science fu may not be correct as he seems to imply upper tropospheric warming rates well outside the errorbars implied by the radiosondes though i am aware of their problems too i have not yet read your attachment but will consider it in the next few days i looked at the surface temperature comments too and feel it may be best to wait until in beijing as most comments are about what diagrams to choose i could try to reorder the urban warming section as reviewers suggest but we may still wish to contact tsutsumi who didnt reply to my email couple of months ago to write something regards david on mon 20050418 at 1713 kevin trenberth wrote hi phil and david and brian i believe you three are probably closest to the satellite temperature record issue and so i am sending this to you i have thoroughly gone over all the comments we received and i have prepared revised 341 which is attached this is the cleaned up version the actual version has tracking turned on but the changes are so extensive that they are very hard to follow as you know i have read the entire ccsp report and commented extensively on it i know phil was on the review team and david was there as lead author however david and phil may not be as familiar with the whole report obviously this remains controversial topic many of the comments we received were diametrically opposed to one another the rhetoric was disappointing especially from peter thorne in fact peters comments are mostly not useful and reveal very strong biases against fu and reanalyses previously youll recall that david provided most of the text and i edited it and updated it with the fu material in somewhat ad hoc fashion that got almost everyone mad probably good thing to do in retrospect as this next version will look so much better note that i have done nothing with the appendices at this point so that needs to be addressed i have taken out all the tables you will see even in the current text that i have 2 sections i would like to delete while individual comparisons of radiosonde station data with collocated satellite data christy and norris 2004 suggest that the median trends of radiosonde temperatures in the troposphere are generally very close to uah trends and little less than rss trends trends at individual radiosonde sites vary and root mean square differences of uah satellite data with radiosondes are substantial hurrell et 2000 moreover as noted in 3411 comparisons with radiosonde data are compromised by the multiple problems with the latter and there are diurnal cycle influences on them over land in the stratosphere radiosonde trends are more negative than both msu retrievals especially rss delete this the problem here is the rhetoric of christy et in his contribution christy justifies the uah record by saying that median trends agree with those of sondes but he actually sent to us his fig 2 showing the lack of agreement in general it is only the median that agrees the agreement with sondes individually is not good and this is just for trends hence the median depends on the selection of stations it is even worse if rms differences are examined as in hurrell et 2000 the only reason to include this is to rebut christys claim for most other readers it has business being there your suggestions appreciated maybe this should go in the appendix you will see that i have stolen 2 figures from the ccsp report i made up the 3rd figure from data provided from the ccsp report plus extra material only the global is in the current draft it would also be nice to include spatial map of trends at the surface and for the troposphere t2 corrected as from fu but such figure exists anywhere yet we can get trends from rss and uah for t2 it would be good to have access to the originals so we can modify them and clean up the terminology on that score i dont think the ccsp terminology is tenable given the new retrievals of fu et 2005 and ours using t2 t3 and t4 is much easier at present the ccsp report is not very useful to us some figures are useful it may become so but i actually have my doubts given the vested interests of the authors i am tempted to send this to tom karl in his role as editor of our chapter and of course he is head of the ccsp effort but i would not want him to use it for ccsp except that it might highlight the differences in assessments what do you think via tom we might get better access to the figures and updates also il l cc david easterling this would be the main basis for fod ideally also it is desirable to get the figures updated thru 2004 but can we please read this version and let know what you think please be kind i have put in lot of work on this best regards kevin kevin trenberth email trenbertucaredu climate analysis
