background beginning in 2003 the international atomic energy agency iaea intensified nuclear inspections after iran confirmed the existence of several undeclared nuclear sites in 2004 the iaea reported extensively on these s ites this report scribes the key sites identified by the iaea iaea and nuclear sites in focus the iaea created in 1957 is vienna based unaffiliated or ganization with 137 member countries the two main missions and principles of the iaea are1 to facilitate the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to implement system of audits and onsite inspections collectively known as safeguards to verify that nuclear facilities nd materials are not being diverted for nuclear explosions according to published reports iran has long list of known and suspected nuclear facilities many analysts raised serious questions regarding the character of irans nuclear research development and pr oduction facilities tehran s large and
