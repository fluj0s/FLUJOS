shea specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695balancing scientific pub lication and national security concerns issues for congress summary the federal government has histori cally supported the open publication of federally funded research results in cases where such results presented challenge to national security concer ns several mechanisms have been employed for fundamental research results the federal policy has been to use classification to limit dissemination for advanced technolog and technological information combination of classification and export and arms trafficking regulation has been used to inhibit its spread the terro rist attacks of 2001 increased scrutiny of nonconventional weapons incl uding weapons of mass struction and publication of some research results have increas ed concerns over whether publication of federally funded extramural research results could thr eaten national security the current federal policy as described in national s ecurity decision directive 189 is that fundamental research should rema in unrestricted and that in the rare case where it is necessary to restrict such in formation classificati on is the appropriate mechanism other mechanisms restrict international information flow such as export administration regulations ear and international traffic in arms regulations itar that control export of items and technical information on specific lists both ear and itar do not apply to sharing fundamental research results so long as they are not subject to an governmental prepublication review historically the areas where export regulation and classification have predominantly occurred have been in ma thematical engineering and physical sciences other contentious research areas such as genetic engineering and manipulation have been overseen through scientists selfregula tion and monitoring the 1975 asilomar conference produced consensus statement on recombinant dna research that formed the basis for the national institutes of health recombinant dna advisory committee rece nt research publications that have raised national security concerns have fallen outside of the areas traditionally regulated through classification and export control and it is unc lear how effective these mechanisms will be the national science advisory board for biosecurity was established to aid in determining whether proposed federally funded research presents biosecurity threat stakeholders do not agree on the best thod of balancing sc ientific publishing and national security so believe that the curre nt method of selective classification of research results is the most appropriate they assert that imposing new restrictions will only hurt scientific progress and that the usefulness of research results to terrorist groups is limited others believe that selfregu lation by scientists using an asilomarlike process to develop consensus statement is better approach they believe th at through inclusion of scientists policymakers and security personnel in the development phase process acceptable to all will be found relying on publishers to scrutiniz articles for information which might potentially have security ramif ications is third option finally mandatory review by federal funding agencies either before f unding or publication is seen as potential federally based altern ative this repor t will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695contents introduction 1 h i s t r i c l v r v i w n d c n t x t1e x m p l s

question whet her the method used to control scientific research results namely cl assification should be revi sited the administration legislators and scientific professional societies are reexamining policies relating to scientific information that might threaten national1 or homeland2 security policymakers may wish to determine what ch anges if any should be made to current government policy regarding publication of federally funded research results and whether the options currently under consid eration adequately balance the concerns and needs of the security and scientific communities this report presents examples of scientific research results whose publication raised concern regarding the threat they potentially pose to national security past and current information

research is not classified the government generally did not place other information controls on it this policy remained esse ntially unchanged until the 1970s when controls were developed on the export of domestically veloped advanced dua luse technologies and technological information3 under export control regulations even if technology is barred from export the f undamental basic science underlying the technology is generally exempt from cont rols and can be published in the open literature in the early 1980s foreign student and scientist access to technological information that might fall under export co ntrol regulations became the focus of department of defense effort to restrict such information presented in classrooms and conferences in 1985 following repor t from the national academy of sciences asserting that openness in science leads to stronger longterm security4 president reagan issued national security decision directive 189 nsdd189 reiterating that fundamental research results were to be controlled only through classification nsdd189 continues to define federal po licy on restricting the dissemination of fundamental research results5 since then the conduct of science and the composition of the scientific community have become increasingly in ternational and c oncerns about the effectiveness of export control regulations have grown the international spread and independent development of dualuse technologies has ma the united states the sole technology source less often cern that export control regulation is negatively impacting domestic business prosperity has led to attempts to lower the trade barriers erected by export control additionally the presence of foreign students and scientists in the united states has increased the availability of education and training in basic skills that may be transferred to other countries upon the return of those individuals to their home countries since the terrorist events of 2001 concern that open publication of scientific and technological results may provide unwitting assistance to other nations or terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction has resu rged scientific research is conducted in many disparate areas hi storically the areas where the balance between scientific openness nd national security require d consideration have been centered in the mathematical and physical sciences and their applications such as aerospace engineering advan ced computer technology and cryptography research in biology such as the origins of virulence development of vaccines and the genetic manipulation of biological agents has emerged as an area of concern because of its potential relevance to bi ological weapons of mass destructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695crs3 6 basic

effective thod of maintaining national security is an open question it is unclear whether classification will be effective when applied to research areas that have not historically been classified and whether system of classified research will be embraced by scientists working in these areas in march 2002 executive branch agencies were instructed by thenassistant to the president and chief of staff andrew card to determine if governmentowned information especially that regarding weapons of mass destruction was being inappropriately disc losed also in march 2002 the department of defense dod promulgated draft regulati on expanding information cont rols to basic and applied science research and development6 scientific professional societies are engaged in developing selfregulatory mechanisms to address the concerns of the national security community in 2003 at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science 32 editors of l eading scientific journals issued policy statement regarding publication of research results that could be misused additionally that year the national academy of sciences held meeting discussing whether current publication po licies and practices in the life sciences could lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information to those who might misuse it in 2004 the national research council issued report biotechnology research in an age of terrorism which recommended an overs ight structure based on institutional biosafety committees for research in select areas of concern following some of the recommendations presented in th is report the department of health and human services established the national science advisory board for biosecurity to among other duties provide advice guidan ce and leadership regarding biosecurity oversight of dualuse research competing proposals regarding how to c ontrol federally funde d research results have been proposed ranging from strict in formation control on all federally funded research to maintaining the status quo so scientific profe ssional societies have suggested that selfregulation either by sc ientists themselves or through the editors of scientific journa ls would be an appropriate mechanism for limiting the publication of research results that might aid terro rist groups others have advocated more formal government oversight of

allow them to harm us interests the technological advances arising from scien tific breakthroughs contribute to economic prosperity but the openness re quired to continue this process creates risks

publication in the united states there has long been support for policy of not restricting publication of federally suppor ted extramural and intramur research results except where classified for national security r easons this position was restated in 1985 by president ronald reagan in national s ecurity decision directive 189 which said it is the policy of this administration th at to the maximum extent possible the products of fundamental research remain unr estricted it is also the policy of this administration that where the national curity requires control the mechanism for control of information generated during federallyfunded fundamental research in science technology and gineering at colleges universities and laboratories is classification each federal government agency is responsible for determining whether classification is appropriate prior to the award of research grant contract or cooperative agreement and if so controlling the research results through standard cl assification procedures b periodically reviewing all research grants contracts or cooperative agreements for potential classification restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federallyfunded fundamental research that has not received national security classification except as provided in applicable us statutes29 fundamental research is so defined within nsdd189 fundamental research means basic and applied research in science and engineering the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community as dis tinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development design producti on and pr oduct utilization the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons30 nsdd189 has not been

the export control policies that affect basic research in the united states in the interim the policy on the transfer of scientific technical and engineering information set forth in nsdd189 shall

the research commun ity and to the public at large and to effect their timely transfer to industry for commercialization33 the department of defense also encourag the publication of research it funds for example office of naval research policy states publication of results of the research pr oject in appropriate professional journals is encouraged as an important method of recording and reporting scientific information34 in general federal agencies appear to agree that there should be open publication of research results when the research s been funded by taxpayer dollars the exception is when research is classified classified research projects even those performed by scientists outside of govern ment laboratories ar not published in the open literature with information being transferred

federally funded extramural research results include classification export and arms trafficking regulations and specifications in federal contracts such as prepublication review classification generally classification is to be used when it is necessary to control scientific information37 the advent of classified extramural research led most universities to clarify their positions on acceptance of funding for classified res earch significant debate exists over the propr iety of conducting classified research in an academic setting38 some universities elect not to perform classified research on campus espousing that this is contrary to the founding beliefs of the university or their university charters for example duke university maintains research can be undertaken at the university that involves information research or results of research that are or would be classifi ed by the sponsor or any third party for example resear ch for the federal government under subcontract which is classified as secret is not permitted39 universities that perform classified research typically establish research facilities specifically to handle classified materials and research these research facilities are often located offcampus exam ples of such universities include the massachusetts institute of technology and the johns hopkins university40 some universities

have coincided in the 1980s research papers were removed by the department of defense from scientif ic convention because foreign nationals ineligible for export licenses would be ttending and other c

mechanisms to ensure informed compliance with applicable regulations regarding dissemination of scientific information79 the national academies continue to explore the issue of performing and publishing research that has potential homeland security impact committees have been empaneled to consider these impacts and possible mitigating approaches the national academies have released severa

mechanisms should be developed to address the difficultie s of assessing and responding to contentious research80 the report identified seven research areas where results might pose security concer n and advocated that proposed research in these areas be reviewed and potentially rejected by committee specifically the institutional biosafety committee within each research institution before the research is performed thus research of concer n could be identifie d and weighed before results were generated ed itors and publishers would c ontinue to exercise their professional judgement in the

food drug and cosmetic act for certain human experimentation the boards at extramural research in stitutions are not federal entities112 these institutional review boards have the ability and authority to approve require modifications within or disapprove research projects similar review boards established within research facilities could be given the role of screening manuscripts in formal or informal manner prior to their publication another possibility would be to conve ne new asilomarlike conference where members of the scientific and national intelligence communities along

october 2003whether scientific researchers would be able to properly weigh the security concerns of research results is uncertain as well for example dr stephen morse in endorsing the idea of an asilo marlike conference pointed out scientists are not in the age of innocen ce anymore and they should be aware of the moral implications of what theyre doing116 some have maintained that the natural inclination of scientists is to err on the side of openness and publication117 while others posit that since the science and security communities are separated trus t in the actions of the opposing community is difficult to develop118 other complications to selfregula tion exist as well as scientific research has become more international in scope it would be necessary for such selfregulatory framework to be adhered to on an inte rnational basis for optimal effectiveness without the agreement of in ternational scientists to maintain similar codes of conduct contentious research results generated by international scientists would continue to enter the open literature also scientists within the us might preferentially publish in intern ational journals should the barrier to publication in domestic journal be raised significantly hi gher than found in international publishing the nih guidelines developed out of the asilomar conference are generally followed on an international level but the scientific community is much larger now than in the 1970s and developing agreem ent among such community may be more difficult to achieve119 genetically modified foods and stem cell research are examples of biological re search areas around which communitywide international consensus has not evolved the national research council report biotechnology research in an age of terrorism provides recommendations for potentia l selfregulatory mechanism it identifies seven areas where experiments of concern might exist and recommends that experiments within these areas be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee to determine whether the experiments present some degree of concern the institutional biosafety committees would thus provide an initial review of proposed experiments if further review or consultation was needed to determine whether an experiment was of concern then the experiment could be referred to an expanded recombinant dna advisory committee or to higher authority for adjudication120 the establishment of the national science advisory board for biosecurity may be interpreted as fulf illing this role and function but issues regarding the authority and scope of the nsabb have yet to be fully resolvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695crs28 121 shaoni bhattacharya bioterrorist f ears prompt journal paper censorship

select jour nal editors for handling the results of potentially sensitive research ma be models for publishing houses to adhere to in the face of potential legislation or federal regulation by empowering journal editors to screen review and reject research pape rs on the basis of their weapons potential advocates hope to avoid new laws or regu lations that might constrain the research process and scientific productivity the revelation that some journal papers have been modified because of et hical concerns raised thr ough the editorial process has been seen as success for this style of oversight121 still some cite the opinions of the editor of science and chief executive of the american association for the advancement of science initially expressed regarding the need for open publication122 as indicative that the publishing community is not unified in perspective and that an edito rbased effort might yield unsatisfactory results even if domestic publishers velop consensus protocol for handling research results which might threaten national security it is unclear if this would stop such information from entering the open literature the competitive international nature of scientific publishing may lead fore ign journals that lack such protocol to legally acquire and publish material that is prohibited from publication in domestic journals finally with the growing ability to disseminate scientific information to wide audience without resorting to fo rmal publication it has been questioned whether publisherbased policy will be effective in restricting the dissemination of contentious research123 the national research council report biotechnology research in an age of terrorism recommends that journal editors continue to assess whether potentially contentious manuscripts should be published it asserts that voluntary approach where scientists and editors can continue to refine and respond to criticism or other input is essential to the credibility of such system within the research community124 without such credibility it is believe d that scientists may not take part in potentially contentious biodefense research

controls than classified information it has b een suggested that access to sensitive but unclassified research results could be c ontrolled by the publisher through secure passwordcontro lled websites125 other options might include dissemination of such material via professional societies or directly from the federal government opponents of such an appro ach cite the logistical difficulties in determining those scientists with bona fide reason for access to this information determining how and in what manner application of such label would be implemented and determining how such sensitive but unclassified material would be disseminated to those scientists eligible to receive it further complication is that the categorization of what information might be sensitive but unclassified is still not clear or uniformly codified across all federal sc ientific funding agencies126 additionally some scientists or univers ities might choose not to particip ate in process which would determine access eligibility massachusetts institute of technology report rejects such security reviews as potentially becoming arbitrary127 another concern is the effectiveness of such federally based review the federal government funds bout 30 of the total resear ch and development efforts in the united states in terms of basic and applied research the federal government funds 62 and 38 respectively128 if prepublication revi ew resides within the federal government in st to voluntary submissi on to professi onal societies or an ethical or moral statement devel oped and overseen by journal publishers then all basic and applied resear ch would not be reviewed strong sentiment held by many members of the scientific community is that all unclassified scien tific results should be shared widely results are sometimes construed to include actual samples of research materials and all information necessary to reproduce an experiment for example the national academy of sciences board on life sciences has reco mmended that authors of scientific papers allow unrestricted access to data and supporting materi als related to publishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695crs30

community for any credential system barring access to research results lastly universities fear th at federal prepublication review to determine the sensitive but unclassified status of mate rial in publication might invalidate the fundamental research exemption that ch research results normally enjoy under ear and itar as consequence univers ity research done in an exportcontrolled area would longer be exclude d from export control regulations130 security review at the funding stage another suggestion to addressing research with security implications is to cat egorize such research at the funding stage rather than at the publication stage131 including voluntary or mandatory prepublication review for federally funde d research or the development of new funding opportunities containing prepublica tion review as condition of acceptance are potential remedies individual funding ve hicles have been offered to universities which would provide the funding agency with access to research results prior to publication132 opponents of this approach cite the general unwillingness th at universities have towards restricted research funding133 some universities have explicit policies barring acceptance of federal funding re quiring prepublication review also scientists may not be as willing to work in research areas where publication is not allowed as in areas where publication is encouraged134 as consequence the pool of eligible scientists competing for federal funding might decrease potentially lowering the quality of research and development performed in these areas

that has potential terrorism concerns also may play role in biodefense it has b een suggested that such research should continue but only performed by select researchers at specific facilities for example dr john steinbruner has suggested as part of biological research security system that national federal authority be established to license qualified researchers and research facilities and oversee research by licensed researchers in licensed facilities136 some scientists have asserted that licensing researchers facilities or experiments would have st rong negative impact on scien tific productivity in those areas137 the registration of life scientists wishing to work with select agents has shown though that some scientists are willin g to engage in such licensed research138 oversight of homeland s ecurityrelated research congress may continue to oversee velopment of policies relating to publication of extramural research results funded by the depa rtment of homeland securitys science and technology dir ectorate whether the department of homeland security should adopt currently existing policy on extramural research or create new policy how this policy might be implemented and the degree to which extramural research funded by th department of homeland security might present security concerns may be areas wh ere further congressional direction occurs additional oversight may focus on the activities underway in the department of health and human services where the national science advisory board for biosecurity has been established th charter of the nsabb is broad and recommendations brought forth from the body may impact much federally funded homeland securityrelated research the degree of impact the comprehensiveness of such recommendations and their ramifi cations may be areas of congressional interest alternately should the nsabb be unable to provide practical recommendations the difficulties and barrier s encountered by the board may draw attentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31695crs32 concluding observations developing policy in this area balances many concerns some of which may be more difficult to address than others how would federal policy that encouraged selfregulation of manuscript s ubmissions either by journa l publishers or scientists be enforced how would the concerns of security officials regarding national security be met if scientists are relie d upon to review articles conversely how would the concerns of scientists regard ing scientific openness and academic freedom be met if security officials review article s policy involving review of research may require the cooperation of members of both the scientific and security community two communities that generally have limited inter action finally how would the success of program controlling scientific research results be measured some aspects of such program like the economic costs involved in processing the articles might be directly measurable wh ile others such as the success in blocking terrorist group access to this informati on might not be so easily measured
