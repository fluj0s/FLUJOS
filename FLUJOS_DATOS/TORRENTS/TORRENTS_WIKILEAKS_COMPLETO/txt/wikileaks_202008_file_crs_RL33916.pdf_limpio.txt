and pose questions related to the policy program andor budgetary impact of the recommendations the organization of this report parallels that of the usda report the usda report presumes new fivey ear farm bill covering the 20082012 time frame however consistent with us government annual ba seline budgeting the spending authority and spending outlay estimates of the administrations farm bill are projected for 10 years title i commodity programs the 2002 farm bill mandated support fo r group of commodities grains oilseeds cotton sugar and milk that long have received suppor t and it added six more commodities dry peas lentils sma ll chick peas wool mohair and honey to the list the commodity credit corporation ccc pays the costs of commodity support under 30 billion line of credit from the us treasury congress annually appropriates funds to the ccc that are used to pay down its loans from the treasury commodity support expenditures are estimate d to have averaged about 126 billion per year over the sixyear life of th current farm bill fy2002fy2007 the congressional budget office cbo forecasts that future spending for commodity support under current law would amount to about 7 billion per year over the next five years fy2008fy2012 the decline from past spending levels is due to current and anticipated high market prices fo r supported crops well into the future usdas proposed 2007 farm bill outlines modifications to the commodity programs that are claimed to save 4494 b illion from the office of management and budget omb 10year current services baseline of 74566 billion for commodity support in addition to the financial savings the modifications to current law according to the secretary of agriculture are designed to make the programs more marketoriented more predictable less market distorting and better able to withstand challenge in the world trade organizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs2 marketing assistance loans current law specifies support prices for 25 commodities including corn and other feed grains wheat cott on rice soybeans and other ilseeds peanuts dry peas lentils small chickpeas w ool mohair honey and milk the secretary asserts that crop loan rate s one of the support price mechanisms are set at such high levels that they encourage overproduction and cause lower market prices in contrast according to the secretary the usda proposal would minimize market distortions and enc ourage farmers to plant cr ops based on market prices instead of subsidy prices loan rates for each commodity would be set at the lesser of 85 of the fiveyear olympic average of market prices ie the average of the last five years excluding the high and low year or b the loan rates specified in the housepassed version of the 2002 farm bill which are lower than current law for feed grains wheat cotton oilseeds and peanuts this proposal is claimed by the administration to save 45 billion over 10 years 450 million per year compared to baseline spending of 8807 billi on 8807 million per year on marketing assistance loan program operations 1 how much higher or lower would federa l outlays have been if the proposal had been in place over the past five crop years 2 over the past five years which commodities have experienced season average market prices below the levels propos ed for the new loan rate formula 3 how much of decrease in savings would result if the loan rates specified in current law were used in the new form ula instead of loan rates in the 2002 housepassed farm bill 4 has the idea of replacing nonrecourse loan s with recourse loans been considered as mechanism to eliminate commodity certificate gains or the forfeiture of commodities to the government how much has been paid to farmers in the form of commodity certificate gains over the past five years are certificates used in order to circumvent payment limits posted county prices under current law farmers are allowed to sign up for loan deficiency payments ldps to secure the benefits of the marketing assistance loan program instead of taking out nonrecourse loans farmers can capture ldp gains when posted county prices pcps which serve as proxies for county market prices are lower than loan rates this opportunity is available daily the secretary asserts that there are substantial difficulties and inequities in calculating daily pcps additionally shortterm market price declines create windfall opportunities for farmers that ar costly and inconsistent with the fundamental income support objectives of the marketing loan program the proposed change would replace daily pcps with monthly pcps additionally farmers would receive ldps based on the monthly pcps in effect on the dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs3 producers lose beneficial interest in the commodities currently farmers can collect ldps and hold onto commodities and market them at later time when market prices are higher than the loan rates the usda proposal is claimed to save 250 million over 10 years 25 million per year compared to an unspecified omb baseline spending level 1 over the sixyear life of the current farm bill ldps are estimated by usda to cost an annual average of about 2547 billion how much would the new proposal have saved had it been in place in the current farm bill direct payments direct payments were enacted in the 2002 farm bill as replacement for production flexibility contract payments wh ich were first enacted in the 1996 farm bill direct payments are made on land with history of production called base acres of feed grains largely corn wheat upland cotton rice oilseeds largely soybeans and peanuts the payment rate for each commodity is specified in the law the annual payment to farm is its commodity base acres times program yield times the payment rate the direct paymen t program is designed to cost about 5 billion per year the payment is made for each eligible farm based on historic production and yield and not on actual production or market prices hence it was envisioned as not tradedistorting and not subject to wto spending limits on subsidies the secretary has proposed to conti nue the direct payments and except for upland cotton to keep the current payment rates in place from 2008 through 2009 and then increase them by about 7 in 2010 for the threeyear period through 2012 uniquely the upland cotton direct payment rate would immediately increase about 7 and remain at the higher level 1 is the increase in direct payments for program commodities mechanism to maintain payments to farmers that ot herwise would decline under conditions of high market prices and reduced marke ting loan program payments if market prices do remain high what would be the economic justification for higher direct payments would these higher payments be capitalized into higher land prices and rents 2 high proportion of the increase in direct payments would be for one commodity upland cotton usdas recomme ndations report states that the combination of increases in upland cotton yields per acre and declining us upland cotton textile production is exp ected to limit price gains and result in substantial cotton program expenditures compared to other commodities why would declining domestic textile industry have depressing impact on prices given that in the past increased exports have offset any decline in domestic use are the loan rate and target price for cotton substantially out of line with markets and the cost of produc tion are marketing loan and counter cyclical program costs likely to be high in the future compared to other commoditieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs4 3 over the past five years crop disast er payments amounted to about 13 billion per year and payments yet have b een made on disaster losses for 2005 and 2006 would farmers be better served if the 55 billion proposed increase in direct payments were instead used for crop disaster assistance or possibly through crop insurance over the coming 10 years direct payments for beginning farmers when it comes to eligibility and payment rates for direct payments current law makes distinction among farm ers with regard to age longevity as farm operators or ownership status the eligibility requirement is that person must be actively engaged in farming on an operation that has program commodity base acres the sharing of direct payments between tenant s and landlords is matter agreed to among the parties in manner consis tent with local custom the secretarys farm bill proposal would give beginning fa rmers direct payments at rate that is 20 higher than for other farmers for the first five years the expected cost is 250 million over 10 years 1 how does the usda intend to define beginning farmer 2 how many beginning farmers are exp ected to benefit from this program 3 is it likely that sellers of farmland will raise the asking price or the beginning farmers will raise the offer price to acquire cropland by the amount of the increased direct payment in other wo rds could the higher direct payment be bid into higher cropland prices and higher rental rates as has been the case with regular direct payments revenuebased countercyclical payments countercyclical payments were adopted in the 2002 farm bill as way of providing certainty and stability to ad hoc emergency market loss payments enacted in years following low market prices the fiveyear fy2003fy2007 average annual cost of countercyclical payments is estimated at about 25 billion the payments are made when the season average farm market price of program crop are below the effective target price the count ercyclical payments like direct payments are paid on base acres without regard to what or how much of any crop is grown on the base acres the secretary has proposed that countercyclical payme nts be triggered by shortfall in national crop revenue rather than shortfall in the national average price this change would bring crop yields and production into the equation there have been years when prices were high but yields were low so farmers were in need of support but the program made payments in contrast there have been years when the price was low but yields were hi gh so payments were made even though farmers did not need the support this ch ange is estimated to generate savings of 37 billion under the omb 10year current services baseline of 11245 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs5 1 historically commodity support programs have been designed to absorb risks on the price side of the farm income equation while crop in surance and disaster assistance have addressed yield risks does the idea of revenuebased counter cyclical payments integrate the two sides of risk management in way that could serve as model to integrate co mmodity support with disaster assistance and crop insurance what are the risks and benefits of integration 2 what are the fundamental economic bus iness trade agreement or political barriers to creating national counte rcyclical revenue program to replace commodity support programs crop insurance and disaster assi stance for at least the subsidized crops 3 with few exceptions over the past 20 years congress has provided disaster assistance to the nations farmers and ra nchers whenever weatherrelated losses have been substantial some would argue that the administrations farm bill proposal does not appear to offer what the secretary of agriculture might call an equitable predictabl alternative for any farm ers not producing program crops could the revenuebased counterc yclical program contained in the farm bill proposal for program crops serve as starting point for similar program for unsupported crops value and eligibility limits in 1970 congress first enacted annua l limits on commodity support program payments currently there is pe r person limit of 40000 on direct payments 65000 on countercyclical payments and 75000 on marketing loan gainsloan deficiency payments the combined limit of 180000 can be doubled to 360000 under the spouse allowance or the three entity allowance person can receive payments on three farms but at half the value on the second two there is limit on commodity certificate gains or marketing loan gains from the forfeiture of collateral under the nonrecourse loan program also there is an adjusted gross income agi eligibity cap of 25 million in practice according to the 2002 farm billauthorized commission on the application of payment limitations for agriculture most farmers pushing up against the limits have devised ways to avoid the limits in general cotton and rice farmers because of the higher per acre value of their crops and their large size feel threatened by payment limits in contrast to corn soybean and wheat farms introducing regional factor north vs south into the debate for some proponents of lower and more effective payment limits it is an issue of equity and concern that large payments accelerate the consolidation of farms into ever larger units opponents argue that the payments are funda mental to the safety net for agriculture and that large efficient farms are equally subject to risks as smaller farms the secretary has proposed eight change s that would make it difficult to evade 360000 per individual payment limit and w ould exclude anyone with more than 200000 in adjusted gross income from eligib ility for commodity program payments the proposal is expected to save 15 b illion under the omb current services 10year baseline of about 75 billion for commodity supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs6 1 the projected savings of 15 billion fro m tightening the eligibility and payment limits appears small compared to the r oughly 75 billion 10year baseline how many farms and how many individuals are expected to be affected 2 how much of the savings would come from reduced cotton and sugar payments the commodities likely to be most impacted 3 large proportion of commercial farm s are managed by operators who own some land but not even majority of the acres they farm in crop share arrangements absentee landlords are receiving commodity program payments to what extent would absentee landl ords be impacted by the new 200000 agi limit could this lead to changes in tenantlandlord lease contracts toward cash rent would further shift to cash rent be good for us agriculture section 1031 exchanges section 1031 is feature of the federal ta x code that allows seller of income producing property to acquire likekind property and treat the transaction as tax deferred exchange the capital gains on the disposed property are transferred to the basis of the acquired property and taxes on the gains are deferred until the acquired property is sold at later date this f eature of the tax code is well known and used by owners of rental housing but the rule applies to all inco producing property including farmland the secretarys proposal would prohibit commodity subsidy benefits to any farm acquired through 1031 exchange justification is based on the argument that taxdeferred farmland exchanges are contributing to the escalation of farmland prices making it difficult for new entrants to purchase land and small farms to expand 1 do farmers ever use the 1031 exchange to geographically consolidate their holdings for efficiency purposes if so has the administration considered exempting these farmers from the proposed new policy 2 might there be cases where beginning farmers would use the 1031 exchange to acquire farmland should an exempti on be made to the proposed prohibition in cases of beginning farmers 3 can the argument that section 1031 cr eates economic distortions contributing to increased farmland prices be app lied to other parts of the economy that utilize that feature of the tax code 4 several studies including work done in the usda conclude that commodity subsidies are substantially capitalized into land prices and higher rental rates what has greater impact on farmland price escalation commodity subsidies or 1031 exchanges is redesigning commodity programs to eliminate their effect on land prices something th at should be considered or not 5 have the secretary of the treasury and the ways and means committee been consulted about changing the tax code to eliminate 1031 exchanges in general or for farmland in particularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs7 dairy countercyclical payments and price support the federal government long has mandated that the farm price of milk be supported the 2002 farm bill continued th dairy price support program at the thencurrent support price of 990 per hundred weight cwt of farm milk support is achieved through standing offer to purchase cheese butter and nonfat dry milk at prices equivalent to the milk support price the administration proposal recommends continuation of the program at the current support level of 990 per cwt the 2002 farm bill authorized new c ountercyclical dairy payment program called the milk income loss contract mil c program under the milc program dairy farmers nationwide are paid whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption in boston falls below 1694cwt as amended by the fy2006 budget reconciliation act farmers receive 34 of the difference between the 1694 target price and the wer market price on up to 24 million lbs of annual production the program expire s august 31 2007 so there is funding in the budget baseline the administration recommends renewing the milc program at the current 34 payment rate for fy2008 and then gradually reducing the rate to 20 over the coming six years 1 july 2004 usda st udy on the economic effects of us dairy policy and alternative approaches to milk pricing concludes that current dairy programs are limited in their ability to change th longterm economic viability of dairy farms and that the milc program cont ributes to dairy surpluses and reduces the farm milk price some observers would argue that the price support program which removes milk from the market and the milc program which encourages more production appear to be working at crosspurposes why does usda recommend continuati on of current dairy policy 2 since the milc programs inception larg dairy farms have contended that the 24 million lb payment limit herd size of about 125 cows is biased against them given that 24 million lbs represen ts small portion of their production what is the federal government s response to their concerns 3 under our current wto trade obligations the aggregate measure of support for dairy is based on how much higher th domestic support price is set above fixed world reference price and this im puted subsidy is applied to all domestic milk production using this formula th wto views the aggregate measure of support for the dairy price support program to be more than 45 billion annually even though federa l outlays are well below 1 billion and classifies it as amber box the most tradedistorting category the current us proposal in the doha round is to reduce its total amber box support from the current 191 billion to 76 billion with dairy support contributing so much toward the proposed new maximum did the usda consider proposing an alternative to current policy that is decoupled from price and production 4 since the milc programs incepti on in 2002 it has provi ded total counter cyclical payments of 24 billion over five marketing years 20022006 usda estimates that the 10year total cost of extending and revising the milchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs8 program under its proposal is 793 million fy2008fy2017 why is the cost estimate so far below historical expenditures on the program is it due to projections for improved dairy market conditions or do proposed revisions to the program significantly reduce expenditures why are changes to the other commodity support programs being proposed that would save money but the status quo would be maintained for dair policy that will cost additional money over baseline 5 the current milc program calculate s payments based on current monthly production levels the administrati ons farm bill proposal would base payments on 85 of the threeyear average of milk marketed during fy2004 fy2006 instead of on current production the proposal states that such change would make the milc program c onsistent with other farm bill counter cyclical programs what is the rationale for making this change to the milc program what are the trade implications of making this change ie will it be enough to consider the program dec oupled and the payment categorized as green box sugar support for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar are mandatory under the 2002 farm bill at 018 and 0229 per pound respectivel the prices are guaranteed by nonrecourse loans available to cane processo rs and beet refiners however because the united states is net importer of sugar market prices usually can be maintained above the mandatory suppor t levels by limiting supplie s through import barriers the united states is authorized gl obal tariff rate quota of 1256 million short tons under wto rules that is allocated among sugar exporting countries around the world mexico separately is limited to shipping 276000 short tons through calendar year 2007 and then has open access to the us market under the north american free trade agreement nafta an add itional supply control feature of the law allows for imposition of domestic marketing allotments on us sugar but only when imports are less than 1532 million short tons the suspension of allotments when imports increase was adopted in the 2002 farm b ill at the urging of the domestic sugar industry with limit on mexican sugar imports after 2007 and severa l bilateral free trade agreements adopted or in process th at would allow in more sugar the united states is faced with the likelihood of imports exceeding 1532 million short tons the imports in excess of 1532 million short tons likely will go under price support loan and eventual forfeiture to the ccc at an estimated cost of 1107 billion over the next 10 years according to usda the farm bill proposal would conti nue the sugar support progr am and the current nonrecourse loan rates but would eliminate the provision in current law requiring the secretary to suspend marke ting allotments when sugar imports are projected to exceed 1532 million short tons this change in the law is projected to save 1107 billion over 10 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs9 1 if current law is extended how much sugar would the ccc likely acquire under the loan program and what would be the disposal outlets 2 if the government savings of 1107 billion from the impos ition of sugar allotments were translated into reduced revenues for sugar farmers what would that amount to 3 has usda examined direct payments program on sugar base acres as an alternative to current policy what would direct payment program likely cost if it were designed to leave sugar pr oducers in an equivalent net cash income situation assuming they have flexib ility to earn revenue from other crops special cotton compet itiveness provisions the 2002 farm bill included three pr ovisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness but protect domestic textile mills from high prices step 1 allowed for downward adjustment unde r specific circumst ances in the adjusted world price awp which is analogous to the posted county price for grai ns for upland cotton which increases the loan deficiency payment ldp to producers step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton when us prices were higher than world prices so that the buy ers were not disadvantaged by buying us cotton the step 2 provision for upland co tton was repealed by congress following ruling that it violated the wto agreement on agriculture step 3 allowed for special additional import quota for upland co tton when high world prices for us cotton and step 2 export subsidies created tight supplies for domestic mills the usdas farm bill pr oposes to eliminate step 1 because it has been used infrequently when it has been used the result has been increased costs for cotton ldps step 3 would be eliminated bec ause its purpose has disappeared with the elimination of step 2 additionally step 2 for extra long staple els cotton would be eliminated because it is analogous to step 2 for upland cotton which was eliminated after being found in violation of wto rules 1 how much has been spent in total and per pound on step 2 for els cotton under the current farm bill 2 would elimination of step 1 and step 3 have any adverse consequences for upland cotton producers or domestic textile mills planting flexibility limitations current law first adopted in the 1996 fa rm bill and continued by the 2002 farm bill prohibits except in certain limited circumstances the planting of fruits vegetables and wild rice on program crop base acres violation of this restriction results in the loss of direct and counte rcyclical payments with the exception of these commodities farmers do have planting flexibility on base acres practically this means that corn base acres can be planted to any other subsidized crop and vice versa but not to fruits or vegetabl the limitation was put in place becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs10 producers of unsubsidized but high valu specialty crops objected to likely competition from subsidized land for purposes of meeting its wto obliga tions the united states has considered direct payments on base acres to be minimally production nd tradedistorting because they are dec oupled from production decisions and market prices consequently direct payments have been reported to the wto as green box and not counted against the 191 billion limit on amber box tradedistorting subsidies wto ruling on the us cotton program reasoned that the planting flexibility restriction does not meet criteria for decoupled income support the usda farm bill proposal would eliminate the restriction on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on base acres in order to make direct pay ments fully compliant with the wto green box rules 1 what impact would elimination of the base acre planting restriction have on fruit vegetable or wild rice producers if there are impacts where would they be most severe 2 does this situation demonstrate that us agriculture is an integrated sector that cannot be divided up easily into indepe ndent components for special treatment or not 3 does this interaction between farm s and commodities lend support to policy of whole farm revenue insurance instead of patchwork of subsidies and rules that generate inefficiencies and inequities crop base retirement under current law cropland that is c onverted to nonagricultural uses does not retain eligibility for commodity program subsidies however it is possible to convert cropland to nonagricultu ral uses without losing ba acre benefits that were tied to the converted cropland usda point s out that an owner of two farms can transfer the base acreage benefits from farm being sold to another farm being retained so long as the farm receiving the transferred base is sufficiently large in size to accommodate the increased base another example is the retention of all of the base even though part of the farm is sold the usdas farm bill proposal would proportionally reduce base acreage whenever all or part of farm is sold for nonagricultural uses 1 was the base acreage retirement provision made to achieve equity among farmers or as disincentive to conve rt cropland to nonagricultural uses 2 could it be argued that the proposal encourage farmers to sell entire farms to developers instead of small parts of the farm and thereby accelerate the conversion of cropland to nonagricultural useshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs11 conservation enhanced payment option the currently operating conservation security program csp provides technical and financial assistance to participants who address at minimum water and soil resources concerns through conservation protecti on and improvement larger payments are made to participan ts who address additi onal resource concerns on their entire operation all farmers are elig ible to apply for the program however limited funding of 502 million between fy 2004 and fy2006 has constrained the program to 14 of the na tions 2119 watersheds and ma ny farmers have found the administrative burden to be excessive to date 19291 contr acts have enrolled 15411134 acres into csp in 298 watersheds the secretary proposes that farms with program crop base acres be offered conservation enhanced payment equal to 10 of the commodity program direct payment for adopting conservation and envir onmental practices equivalent to the progressive tier requirement of the conservation security program csp farmers electing this option would forgo their c ountercyclical payments and marketing loan benefits for the duration of the 2007 farm bill 1 is this conservation enhanced payment option effectively pilot effort to convert amber box commodity programs into green box payments 2 some farms with commodity base acres now have csp contracts plus they receive direct and counterc yclical payments as well as marketing loan benefits would the conservation enhanced pa yment option create two categories of csp participants with substantially different benefits 3 some observers may ask why would farmer give up the commodity program safety net of potentially large countercyclical paym ents and marketing loan benefits for the certainty of only 10 increase in the direct payment what is the federal governments response 4 are any farmer costs associated with achieving the progressive tier requirement and if so would those co sts be more than covered by the 10 enhancement or would there be other federal assistance for those expenses continuing wto compliance the 2002 farm bill includes circuit break er authority for the secretary of agriculture to make adjustments in dom estic commodity support expenditures when needed to comply with uruguay round ag reements the us annual limit on trade distorting amber box subsidies is 191 billion the secretary has proposed that the circuit breaker authority be modifie d to accommodate any new agreements from the doha round of negotiations or othe r agreements concluded under the auspices of the world trade organization wto 1 has the circuit breaker authority ever been invoked by the secretary in order to avoid exceeding the 191 billion us amber box limithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs12 2 has the united states ever exceeded its amber box limit what has been the size of us amber box subsidie s each year since the uruguay round agreements were adopted title ii conservation before the 1985 farm bill few conserva tion programs existed and only two the agricultural conservation program and watershed and flood prevention operations would be considered large by todays standa rds in total cons ervation programs were funded at less than 1 billion annually th current conservation portfolio includes more than 20 distinct programs with annua l spending of about 52 billion most are enacted through recent farm bills with mandatory funding supplied by usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the 2002 farm bill authorized large increases in mandatory funding for severa l agricultural conservation programs the two largest the conservation reserve prog ram crp and the environmental quality incentives program eqip make up almost 55 of the 52 billion in current annual spending the administrations proposed 2007 farm bill has outlined an overall increase in funding for agricultural conservation programs which the administration estimates is 7825 billion over the 10yea r current services baseline of 48698 billion much of this additional funding is attributed to an increase in the proposed consolidated environmental quality incentives program eqip and an increase in the acreage limit for the wetlands reserve program wrp many of the administrations proposed changes would consolidate existing programs with the goal of increasing administrative efficiencies and reducing participant confusion 1 several program consolida tion changes are proposed what level of savings can be expected by these consolidations nd are there any specific plans for using those savings 2 given the continued growth of the conservation effort what additional evaluation measures if any are planned to keep congress informed about accomplishments and spending efficiencies 3 based on the administrations budget plan and the farm bill proposal there may appear to some to be inconsistencies within working lands conservation programs the administration proposed increasing funding for csp and eqip by combined 475 million annually in the farm bill pr oposal the fy2008 budget proposal meanwhile proposes to reduce both csp and eqip eqip is authorized at 127 billion and the pr esidents budget requests 10 billion 270 million reduction csp is estimate d by the cbo at 451 million and the presidents budget requests 316 million 135 million difference would the proposed increases in mandatory cons ervation programs authorized by the farm bill supersede the cuts in those same programs if the administrations budget were adopted how should the diffe rences between the farm bill and the budget proposal be interpretedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs13 environmental quality in centives program eqip eqip offers agricultural producers costshare payments technical assistance and incentive payments to implement conservation practices on private working lands three subprograms are impleme nted through eqip the ground and surface water conservation program gswc the klamath basin program and conservation innovation grants cig the gswc program targets areas with extensive agricultural water needs to achieve net savings in water consumption while the klamath basin program is similar in nature it is limited to single basin that straddles the californiaoregon border cig grant program is intended to foster the development and adaptation of innovative conservation approaches other conservation programs utilize costsharing mechanisms similar to eqip including the wildlife habitat incentives program whip which focuses on developing and restoring wildlife habitat on all land the agricultural management assistance ama program which seeks to mitigate risks through diversification and resource conservation pr actices and the forest land enhancement program which addresses resource concer ns on private forest lands citing duplication in eligibility requirements regulations policies applications and administrative actions the secretary recommends consolidating existing cost share programs eqip gswc whip ama forest land enhancement program and the klamath basin program into newly designed eqip program the proposal also would create regional water enhancement program rwep to address water quality and quantity issues on regional scale the cig program would receive additional funding this ne wly constructed program would receive an increase of 425 billion over the om b 10year current services baseline 1 interest in participating in many cons ervation programs has been high leading to large backlog of unfunded app lications eqip alone reported 32633 unfunded applications worth more than 636 million in fy2006 with such large application backlog in eqip along with the other proposed programs for consolidation would the additional aut horized funding be used primarily in addressing the application backlog would usda have the workforce capacity to handle the workload added by this increase in funding 2 usdas farm bill spending estimates show that eqip grows modestly until it reaches its full spending authority in 2014 this would occur after new five year farm bill has expired is there an explanation as to why eqip program with standing backlog of applications would require seven years to ramp up to its fully authorized spending level 3 some of the programs proposed for consolidation have very specific programmatic purposes and eligibility requirements targeted at specific resource concerns on different components of the landscape whip focuses on wildlife habitat on all lands while gswc focuses on water quantity on only agricultural lands how would specific resource problems be targeted in the absence of specialized programs if the consolida tion of these programs requires single definition of eligible lands what finition would the department prefer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs14 conservation security program csp the conservation security program c sp provides techni cal and financial assistance to participants who address at minimum water and soil resources concerns through conservati on protection and improvement it was widely touted as the first conservation entitlement and the first green payments program when enacted in 2002 the program operates with three conservation and funding tiers tier iii being the highest larger payments are made to participants who address additional resource concerns on their entire operation tier iii there are currently four components to csp fi nancial assistance payments 1 stewardship or base payments for the number of acres enrolled 2 maintenance payments for existing conservation practices 3 costshare payments for new practices and 4 enhancement payments for conservation effort and additiona l activities beyond prescribed level all farmers in eligible watersheds may apply for the program limited funding of 502 million between fy2004 and fy2006 has constrained the program to 298 of the nati ons 2119 watersheds and many farmers state that they have found the administrativ burden to be excessive to date more than 19000 contracts averaging 800 acres have enrolled 154 million acres into csp the secretary proposes the following adjus tments elimination of stewardship maintenance and costshare financial assist ance payments consolidation of three tiers into two tiers creation of ranking system in place of the current watershed approach and expansion of funding to 85 billion during fy2008fy2017 1 how would the proposed changes alter th pattern and scale of participation 2 will the proposed conservation nhancement option in the commodity provisions of title i overlap or repl ace csp for producers of program crops 3 current law limits technical assistance spending in conjunction with csp to 15 of the program cost some observers claim this level is inadequate recommendation was made to repeal the 15 limitation on technical assistance in current law how can csp be successfully implemented with what some would argue is such small level of technical assistance private lands protection program the proposed private lands protecti on program would consolidate three existing programs the farmland protecti on program fpp purchases conservation easements to limit nonagricu ltural uses of land the grasslands reserve program grp seeks to restore and protect rangel and pastureland and other grassland while continuing grazing sustainability the healthy forest reserve program hfrp addresses forest land that provides habitat for threaten ed and endangered species citing common goals and unique eligibility requirements regulations policies applications and administrative actions the secretary recommends consolidating these three existing easement programs frpp grp and hfrp into new private lands protection program this proposal also would increase funding by an additional 900 million over the 10year baseline for this new programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs15 1 this proposal is repeated in the energy title of the usda recommendations and the questions posed here are repeated under the crp biomass reserve heading in the energy section1 some consider fpp working lands program that keeps farming viable while grp is more closely related to land restoration program how would these fundamental differences be resolv ed in consolidated program conservation reserve program crp1 the conservation reserve program crp and conservation reserve enhancement program crep remove ac tive cropland into conservation uses typically for 10 years and pr ovide annual rental payments based on the agricultural rental value of the land and costshare ssistance conversion of the land must yield adequate levels of envir onmental improvement to qua lify environmental benefits index crp is the largest land retiremen t program with spending of 1828 billion in fy2005 the total program acreage is limited to 392 million the secretary recommends reauthorizati on of crp with an enhanced focus on lands that provide the most benefit for environmentally sensitive lands priority would be given to wholefield enrollmen t for lands utilized for energyrelated biomass production biomass would be harvested after nesting season and rental payments would be limited to income forgone or costs incurred by the participant to meet conservation requirements in those years biomass was harvested for energy production 1 with cellulose conversion technology in its infancy what is the rationale behind subsidizing cellulose production at this time 2 the proposal may appear to some obser vers to have two conflicting components with regard to crp if it is desirable to focus crp on multiyear idling of more environmentally sensitive lands some may inquire why the harvesting of biomass on those lands is being impose d could this harvesting conflict with the conservation purpose of the program 3 if it is decided that high demand for commodities dictates that less land should be in the crp how would priorities be set for land to be released wetlands reserve program wrp the wetlands reserve program wrp and wetlands reserve enhancement program wrep provide technical and fi nancial assistance to private landowners to restore and protect we tlands wrp has current enrollment of 189 million acres with an annual authorized new enrollme nt cap of 250000 acres the 2002 farm bill authorized total enrollment cap of 2275 million acres the secretary recommends the conso lidation of wrp with the floodplain easement program of the emergency watershed program and an increase in the enrollment cap to 35 million acres this increase in acreage would equal anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs16 estimated 2125 billion increase over the curre nt services 10year baseline of 455 million 1 by increasing the acreage cap for wrp and proposing continuation of the crp acreage cap what consideration is given to the 25 county cropland enrollment cap on crp and wrp 2 similar to crp what effect would increased enrollment of wetlands have on local economies would it be possible to achieve the objectives of wetlands conservation under workinglands progra m rather than cropland retirement program 3 how would these changes affect the presidents nonetloss goal sod saver the 1985 farm bill included the first c onservation compliance requirement for farmers to participate in certain usda programs the conservation compliance provision for highly erodible land also know n as sodbuster created disincentives to farmers who produced annually tilled agri cultural commodities on highly erodible cropland without adequate erosion protection conservation compliance for wetlands also known as swampbuster created disi ncentives to farmers who produced annually tilled agricultural commodities or made possible the production of agricultural commodities on land classified as wetlands the administration recommends broade ning the conservation compliance provisions to include new sod saver ru that would create disincentive to converting grassland rangel and and native grasslands not previously in crop production into crop production sod saver would make all newly converted grasslands permanently ineligible for commodity suppor t and other usda programs including other conservation programs the suggested date for this provision to go into effect is not stated in the ad ministrations proposal the administration scores this proposal at zero budgetary impact 1 what is the basis for the sod saver recommendation is sodbuster not working as well as anticipated is the concern of some conservati onists that sodbuster has not been aggressively enfo rced valid concern or not 2 was an alternative considered in the sod saver provision to allow for approved conservation systems that could provide for reduction in soil erosion similar to the conservation compliance for hi ghly erodible land sodbuster and wetland conservation compliance swampbuster 3 sod saver may not prevent the conversi on of grasslands to cropland when crop prices are high once cultivated there could be some offsite damages yet sod saver will preclude any federal assistance to address these problems what is the rationale behind permanently prohibiting conservation assistance on this converted landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs17 4 presumably there will be monitoring and enforcement costs associated with sod saver what agency would have th administrative responsibility and what would be the estimated costs conservation ccess for beginning and limitedresource farmers first recognized as requiri ng special attention in the 2002 farm bill beginning and limitedresource farmers are provided with additional incentives in conservation programs through various funding mechanis ms and targeted initiatives the largest incentive directed toward beginning and limitedresource farmers is the increase in costshare payments up to 90 of the cost to implement the practice can be paid by nrcs in eqip other programs such as the conservation innovation grants and farm protection program also have initiativ directed toward beginning and limited resource farmers the administration is recommending that 10 of farm bill conservation financial assistance be reserved for be ginning farmers and ranchers as well as socially disadvantaged producers flexibility is also recommended to allow the secretary to reallocate th reserve funds if the money goes unused the administration states that this proposal w ould have effect on the current services baseline 1 what portion of current conservation prog ram participants meet the description of beginning and limitedresource farmers 2 how much is currently spent on beginning and limitedresource farmers and how does that relate to the 10 of financial assistance being proposed 3 would implementation of this provisi on mean that some commercial farmers would then be unable to participate in conservation programs if so to what extent would this occur marketbased funding the secretary recommends that 50 milli on over 10year period be available

districts the ecp administered by th farm service agency fsa focuses on emergency water conservation measures in periods of severe drought on farmland and also provides assistance to rehabilitate farmland damaged by all natural disasters citing confusion and frustration by citiz ens responding to natural disasters the secretary is recommending that the ewp and ecp be consolidated into new emergency landscape restoration program funding for this new program would be discretionary as is the current funding stream for ewp and ecp 1 since the emergency watershed protec tion ewp program and the emergency conservation program ecp are administe red by two different agencies which agency would administer the new consolidated emergency landscape restoration program 2 currently land eligibility is very diffe rent between the two programs should the consolidation of these programs include single definition of eligible lands if so what should be the definition if different

million 2 how much of maps funding already assists specialty product producers and firms and how much of differen ce would 25 million annual increase make 3 how does usda gauge the impact of map what evidence is there that discrete map promotion ac tivities in particul ar country markets have resulted in an increase in us agricultural exports sanitary and phytosanitar sps issues grant program reportedly developing and developed countries are increasingly using unscientific sps standards as nontariff barriers to us agricultural products these take the form of plant and animal health restrictions to protect their domestic agricultural sectors against outside co mpetition examples often cited include biotechnology restrictions maximum residue standards and restrictions on us beef such as those imposed by south korea and japan due to bse mad cow disease the administrations farm bill proposes to establish new grant program to address sps issues for all commod ities m andatorily

wood packagin g material irradia tion biotechnology sciencebased maximum residue level standa rds and testing pro cedures and controls for mycotoxins grants would fund projects that address sps barriers that threaten us agricultural exports by reducing the need to hire technical staff on permanent basis involving the private sector in ssisting usda in solving technical problems commissioning scientific reports on targeted issues and making more use of outside technical experts to addre ss these types of barriers 1 what are the most significant sps barriers that currently affect us agricultural exports what is the status of us efforts to address these specific barriers 2 how much of foreign agricultural serv ice fas resources already are tapped to address sps issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs21 3 how would an sps grant program reinforce us efforts to eliminate sps barriers in international standard setting forums or in wto dispute settlement 4 why does usda request that this new initiative be funded on mandatory basis using cccs borrowing authority is the appropriations mechanism more suitable approach for funding this international trade standard setting activities reportedly countries have increasingly re sorted to technical trade barriers that have scientific basis in order to restrict imports of us agricultural products one us effort to counter this trend is to become more involved in international bodies that establish and harmonize multilateral food plant and animal safety standards frequently referred to as sanitary and phytosanitary sps rules such organizations include the food and agriculture organization fao the codex alimentarius the international plant protection conve ntion and the world animal health organization known by its french acronym of oie acknowledging that the us government lacks sufficient resources to ensure that its views on sps issues are fully heard usda is requesting authority and mandatory funding of 15 million over 10 years 15 million annually to enhance usda staff support at international standard setting organizations funding would be used to close the compensation gap for senior level us staff placed in these organizations to influence decision making eg ensure that standards are properly designed and implemented to avoid unwarranted trade barri ers and to cover the cost of up to four professiona l officers who would specifically focus on supporting us sps priorities 1 how many usda staff already serve to represent us interests and perspective at the fao and these three internationa l bodies how long has this function been carried out 2 the administrations proposal notes that the lack of us funding for staff support has led the fao to take mor eurocentric approach in its work which may be in conflict with us objectives can the administration elaborate on what this approach means and comment on how that perspective affects us efforts to reduce or eliminate technical trade barriers technical assistance for trade disputes the number of us agricultural trade di sputes has increased in recent years this has prompted commodity groups and ag ribusiness firms to seek recourse under us trade remedy laws to address potential unfair competition in the domestic us market and to work with usda and the u s trade representative ustr to try to resolve cases considered under the world trade organizations trade dispute process the process of pursuing disput case is usually complex lengthy and costly particularly for smaller groups and agricultural industries with limited resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs22 the administrations farm bill requests broad discretionary authority to provide enhanced monitoring technical assistan ce and analytical support to agriculture groups with limited resources if the secretar of agriculture determines this would benefit us agriculture this would enable usda to direct available resources to assist smaller agricultural groups and indus tries affected by unfair foreign trade practices and to pursue trade dispute cases on their behalf 1 why is this authority needed in light of usdas statement that it already helps out in trade dispute cases by providing legal and analytical support often working with ustr 2 in what instances would program of technical assistance for trade disputes have enabled small groups or agricultu ral industries to pursue case in wto dispute settlement or have affected the outcome of cases that have been pursued 3 what criteria would usda use in exercisi ng such broad authority to determine which groups should be deemed eligib for this type of assistance trade capacity building and agricultural extension programs in strategically important countries in recent years usda has worked with the departments of state and defense and the national security council in af ghanistan and iraq to provide technical assistance in support of efforts to revitaliz the agriculture sect ors of both countries such assistance was provided through exis ting agricultural extension programs but usda did not receive direct funding for such activities the administration proposes providi ng 20 million in mandatory funding over 10 years 2 million annually through cccs borrowing authority to expand agricultural extension and food safety programs in fragile countries this would be part of the us governments efforts to meet future development assistance needs in unstable areas such as sudan or somalia usdas role would be to engage in agricultural

to three years separately the intermediateterm export credit guarantee program gsm103 guaran tees intermediateterm financing up to 10 years the supplier credit guarantee program scgp guarantees deferred payment sales usually up to 180 days the facilities guarantee program fgp is to improve or establish the handling marke ting storage or distribution facilities for us commodities in emerging markets the 2002 farm bill authorized up to 65 billion annually for the fy2002 fy2007 period for these guarantee programs of this amount 10 billion is targeted to emerging markets countries in th process of becoming commercial markets for us agricultural products the st atute gives usdas foreign agricultural service fas the flexibility to determine the allocation between short and intermediate term programs the actual level of guarantees approved each year depends on market conditions and on the demand for financin g by eligible countries program activity has declined over the last three years because of less demand for guarantees and administrative steps taken in july 2005 to bring the programs into conformity with world trade organizati on wto ruling that found them to be prohibited export subsidies in fy2006 usda approved almost 14 billion in guarantees down from 26 billion in fy2005 and 37 b illion in fy 2004 the budget outlay impact of guarantees 142 million in fy2006 is small because it reflects only administrative costs and the subsidy associated with the loans approved each year the administration proposes statutor changes to reform these guarantee programs in light of the wto ruling and to ensure they remain wtocompliant these include 1 removing the current 1 cap on fees collected under the gsm102 program 2 eliminating the specific authority for the gsm103 program 3 terminating the scgp because of the rge number of loan defaults totaling 227 million and evidence of fraud and 4 revi sing the fgp to attract additional users who commit to purchase us agricultural products the first three proposed changes are not expected to have any budgetary impact according to usda the cost of changes to the fgp would be minor almost 2 million each year 1 to what degree would higher loan guarantee fees diminish user participation in the shortterm gsm102 program 2 what impact on program activity is antic ipated with the proposed lifting of the current 1 fee 3 what is the prospect for usda collecting on the more than 200 million in scgp loan defaults 4 what explains declining interest among countries in using usda loan guarantees to finance their agricultural importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs24 5 what fundamental changes are occurri ng in worldwide commodity financing that may warrant revisiting the role that credit guarantees can play in facilitating us agricultural exports eep and trade strategy report usda established the export enhancemen t program eep in 1985 to help us commodities compete with other countries primarily the european union that subsidized their exports used extensivel through the late 1990s to challenge unfair trade practices and maintain market sh are in targeted c ountries eep has been inactive in recent years the 2002 farm b ill established an nnual program level of 478 million the maximum allowed under the uruguay round export subsidy reduction commitments the 2002 farm bill requires the secretar of agriculture to consult with congress every two years and to prepare global market strategy report that identifies growth opportunities overseas for us agricultural exports the administrative costs of preparing one report are about 250000 usda further notes that this requirement duplicates its ex isting united export strategy and country strategy programs which use realtime market analysis and global intelligence and are more timely usda proposes to repeal eep and the gl obal market strategy report mandate pointing to program inactiv ity and the reports redundancy it argues that because both longer serve valuable purposes the proposed changes would allow usda to focus staff and financia l resources to priority issues usda notes that eeps repeal would also be consistent with the us objective to eliminate the use of export subsidies worldwide 1 how does the administration estimate budgetary impact from this proposal while it justifies the change in terms of financial savings 2 if there is not successful conclusion this year to the doha round of wto trade negotiations is the united states placed at disadvantage ie would it lose tool to assist agricultural exports in the future if it unilaterally repeals the law authorizing an export subsidy program 3 what are examples of how usdas existing united export strategy and country strategy programs are more useful to us exporters and policymakers cash authority for emergency food aid usda provides food aid abroad through the pl 480 program also known as food for peace the food for progress prog ram the mcgoverndole international food for education and child nutrition program and secti on 416b of the agricultural act of 1949 the 2002 farm b ill authorized all of these programs through fy2007 except for section 416b whic h is permanently authorized by the agricultural act of 1949 the 2002 farm bill also reauthorized commodity reserve of wheat and other commodities typically used as food aid renamed the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs25 emerson humanitarian trust which can be used under certain circumstances to provide pl 480 food aid and created th mcgoverndole program as new food aid program funding for the pl 480 programs title i direct credits and title ii grants is provided through the annual ppropriations process title i provides for longterm low interest loans to developing and transition countries and private entities to purchase us agricultural commodities the use of title i credits has declined over time and totaled 123 million in fy2006 title ii provides for the donation of us agricultural commodities to meet emerge ncy and nonemergency food needs the law mandates an annua l minimum tonnage level of 25 milli on metric tons in recent years appropriators have set the fundi ng level between 16 and 17 billion the food for progress program funded directly by the ccc 131 million in fy2006 provides commodities to support countries that have made commitments to expand free enterprise in their agricultural economies the mcgoverndole program uses commodities and financ ial and technical assistance to carry out preschool and school food for education programs and maternal infant and child nutrition programs in foreign countries the 2002 farm bill mandated ccc funding of 100 million in fy2003 and authorizes appropr iations of such sums as necessary from fy2004 to fy2007 the fy2006 program level wa s 97 million donations through the section 416b program are entirely depe ndent on the availability of commodities acquired by the ccc in its price support operations the emerson trust provides emergency food relief when us supplies ar short or to meet unanticipated need under current law title ii of pl 480 may only be used to purchase and ship us agricultural commodities to meet food needs overseas the administration points out that this stipulation has precluded the use of title ii to procure food quickly enough or resulted in the united st ates not being able to provide food or provide it late it argues that authority is needed to quickly meet emergency needs in the most effective way possible such as using cash to provide

tax provisions the administration proposes to establis h threeyear threestate 3 million pilot project under which states would be allowed to pay with 50 federal matching for workrelated expenses other than dependent care costs of households with earnings from employment the stated purpose is to test an idea that might further strengthen the food stamp progra ms role in supporting work and moving individuals and families to selfsufficiency usda would define what expenses would be covered child care costs woul d not be allowed and could place limit on the time recipients could be aided in the project critics question whether the dollar and coveredexpense restrictions placed on the project effectively limit the usefulness of any results 1 how can pilot program that pays limited range of work expenses for employed food stamp recipients nd is restricted to 3 million produce meaningful results does the 3 million include evaluation costs will there be control groups is there experien ce from comparable tanf initiatives to indicate whether this type of support is potentially productive 2 is it the administrations intention to propose that this type of workexpense support for the employed be made regu lar feature of the food stamp program if the pilot proves success dependentcare expenses food stamp law takes dependent care costs related to work or educati on into account when determin ing eligibility and benefits it does this by allowing households to deduct these costs from countable income up to certain limits as result households with these costs are more likely to be eligible and more im portant are given larger food stamp benefit be nefits generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs29 increase by 30 cents for each dollar of disregarded income dependent care cost deductions are capped at 200 month for each child under age two and 175 month for all other dependents thereby limiting the extent to which these costs affect food stamp eligibility and benefits the administration proposes to elim inate the current caps on expense deductions for dependent care costs used when calculating food stamp eligibility and benefits the stated purpose is to help working families critics argue for the need to go further in recognizing the effect high nonfood living expenses like shelter costs have in eroding the value of food stamp benefits the administration estimates co sts for this proposal at 20 million over five years and 42 million over 10 years 1 how many households does the administr ation expect to be affected by its proposal to lift the dollar caps on dependentcare expense deductions 2 dollar cap albeit an indexed one also exists for shelterexpense deductions has the administration considered lifting it to increase benefits for those with very high shelter expenses college savings plans current food stamp policy allows disregard of college postsecondary education savings plans as assets to the extent that they are determined to be inaccessible it also permits states to exclude college savings plans when conforming their food stamp ru to their tanf or medicaid policies as result state agencies must make i ndividual

the administration proposes to disregar d in permanent law combatrelated military pay as income when determ ining food stamp ligibility and benefits the stated purpose is to permanently remove potential penalty on military families critics might contend that use of the defense departments special allowance program would be better way to deal with this issue the administration estimates

treatment for civilian employees deployed in combat areas food stamp program streamlining and modernizing proposals rename the food stamp program the food stamp program got its name when it was originally established in 1939 at th time actual stamps were used blue and orange stamps were issued to recipients one color representing the recipients dollar contribution and the othe r the federal governments subsidy which was usable only for surplus commodities when used the stamps were actually pasted into booklets by the participatin g grocer and the booklets when full were then redeemed by the retailer for cash the original program was closed down in 1943 after world war ii had effectivel eliminated surplus food production when the program was revived in the 1960s the old name also was revived even though stamps were not used in stead participants received paper coupons of various denominations that were used like cash to purchase food this lasted until the recent switch to the use of debitcardlike electronic benefit transfer ebt cards to deliver benefits the administration recommends changing the programs name to the food and nutrition program in recognition of the changes in how food stamp benefits are delivered and the programs role in improving nutrition 1 usda opened up renaming of the progra m for public comment few years ago and received many ideas could compendium of those ideas be provided 2 what is the estimated cost of switching to new name for the program3 how many states now use name othe r than food stamp program to identify their ebtbased program 4 stamps have not been used since th early 1940s yet the program has kept the name is it an option to keep the existing name and let states call the program what they wish deobligate food stamp coupons as legal tender food stamp benefits are now delivered using debitcar dlike electronic benefit transfer ebt cards not paper food stamp coupons the eb t system has been in place nationwide for two years however some coupons issu ed before the transition to ebt systems have still not been redeemed and the administration would like to get them off the books saving redemption costs both the value of the coupons themselves and the cost of handling them the administration proposes to deobligate food stamp coupons still in circulation making them longer usable redeemable it estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs32 net savings from this proposal at 2 million over five years and 7 million over 10 years 1 what is the dollar value of unredeemed coupons still outstanding2 what time deadline for redeeming outst anding coupons does the administration envision prohibit certain state claims against recipients collect over issuances from states current law requires states to pursue collection of over issued food stamp benefits from recipients and former recipients however they are caused any collections generally are turn ed over to the federal government which pays the cost of program benefits but states may keep portion of collections in cases where the overissuance was not caused by the state agencys actions to an extent states themselves also are liable to the federal government for overissued benefits and losses caused by cases of state agency negligence or fraud the administration proposes to 1 prohib it states from pursuing claims against recipients for overissued food stamp bene fits in the case of widespread systemic errors eg computer system failuresflaws and 2 require states to pay the usda for overissuances in such cases the stated purposes for advancing its proposals are to promote program integrity and fair tr eatment of recipients and to encourage caution and careful planning when implementing new computerrelated administrative systems however number of states are pursuing initiatives that encompass the expanded use of computers and online interaction between applicantsrecipients and state agencies and some critics are concerned over how extensively any new authority to require state payments might be used and its potential chilling effect on state efforts to improve administration 1 how will the administration define widespread systemic errors and calculate overissued benefits for the purpose of holding recipients harmless and mandating that states pay the cost of the overissuances they might cause what about underissuances and improper nials caused by these widespread systemic errors 2 what type of new authority to collect from states is the administration asking for does usda not have enough author ity already to collect from states in cases of overissued benefits is this authority not being used in the colorado case that the administration cites in the rationale for its proposal 3 will the threat of new requirement that states pay overissuance costs in cases of computer system flaws and other syst emic problems dampen the current trend toward state innovation in administering food stamps by increasing the use of computers and online interactions between applicantsrecipients and state agencies or nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs33 2 the administration also proposes applying food stamp cashonly categorical eligibility rule to recipients of supplemental security in come ssi benefits however it is unlikely that cashonly food stamp rule would have any effect on ssi recipients because virtually all if not all ssi recipients get cash ssi payments or are authorized to receive themfood stamp program improve program integrity limit categorical eligibility under current food stamp law states may grant categorical automatic food stamp eligib ility to households receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf cash aid services or both effectively accepting tanf eligibility decisi ons as to financial eligibility for food stamps in some cases particularly where only services are provided the household may have financial resources incomea ssets significantly above those normally allowed for food stamps the administration is concerned that states can in effect game the categorical eligibility option and make house holds eligible for food stamps by simply providing minimal services financed with tanf funds its proposal would restrict categorical automatic elig ibility for food stamps to those who receive cash benefits under state temporary assistance fo r needy families tanf programs on the premise that they are subject to stricter eligibility tests than those getting tanf funded services2 on the other hand critics point out that among those categorically eligible it is most often working househol ds with relatively high nonfood expenses for shelter dependent care who actually qualify for si gnificant food stamp benefit and that many of the households that woul d be penalized are those who have worked their way off cash welfare and are only receiving child care services to help them keep their job they also note that there would be added administrative costs and significant side effect some househol ds losing their categorical food stamp eligibility would as result lose their foodstampparticipa tionbased categorical eligibility for free school meals for their children the administration estimates savings from this proposal at 611 million over five years and 1360 billion over 10 years it also is included in the administrations fy2008 budget package and was advanced as part of the fy2007 budget presentation 1 is it the administrations intent to exclude any household receiving only tanf funded services from categorical elig ibility for food stamps would the proposal exclude working households gettin g child care aid those getting job training what tanffunded serv ices do those excluded by the administrations recommendation receive 2 how many households would be affected by the categorical eligib ility limitation proposal is this proposal the primary source of budget savings in the administrations package of farm bill proposals for nutrition assistance programs without this costsaving change would the administration continue to support the recommendations it has ma that have significant projected costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs34 3 in how many states is overly expansive categorical eligibility problem what types of services are provided in these states to confer cat egorical food stamp eligibility 4 could state get ar ound the administrations proposal by providing minimal cash payment instead of service 5 has the administration estimated the added administrative costs that states with 50 federal matc h would bear for conducting regular food stamp eligibility determinations for those losi ng categorical eligibility who choose to apply through regular program rules pa rticularly checking on assets held by applicants imposing fines on retailers under current policy the use of fines as penalties on retailers violating food stamp rules eg selling nonfood items for food stamp benefits is restricted to certain instances where the retailer can show extensive efforts to educate employees and the owner was unaware of the vi olation or where disqualification would cause hardship to f ood stamp recipients in most cases it is usda policy to impose disqualification for varying periods whether the violation is minor or major the administration argues that it needs more flexibility to respond to the seriousness of retailers violation and would like more authority to impose fines in lieu of disqualification for minor violations and new authority to impose fines in addition to disqualification for major violations critics are concerned that the extent of the problem beyond anecdotal cases is not clear that usda has not aggressively used its existing authority to substitute fines in minor cases and that authority to impose fines in addition to disqualification in major cases might clash with separate provisions of law that impose courtordered monetary penalties on retailers convicted of feloniesmisdemeanors the administration estimates savings from these proposals at 5 million over five years and 10 million over 10 years 1 how many and what types of cases point to the need for new authority to impose fines instead of disqualification in cases of relatively minor retailer violations of food stamp rules 2 why specifically are current authorities for the use of fines on retailers in cases of minor violations not sufficient seizure of retailers food stamp receipts under current law retailers accused of trafficking violations can conti nue to operate and potentially continue any fraudulent activities while forcement actions are taki ng place even if those violations are particularly egregious the administration proposes to allow the usda in certain egregious trafficking cases to seize re tailers food stamp receipts prior to settlement in case s where expedited action is warranted the stated purpose is to increase the effectiveness of usda enforcement actions as stated by the administration trafficking retailers would be hurt more quickly where it matters in their pocketbooks this proposal increases effectiveness by immediately stopping the flow of funds that allow retailers to c ontinue to finance their fraudulent activities critics are worri ed about how this new authority wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs35 3 states also are eligible for total of 18 million in bonus payments for high performance in providing program access and processing applications in timely manner in fy2005 13 states received these bonuses be framed and used and whether it goes too far and possibly prejudges accused retailers 1 how would the proposed authority to seize retailers food stamp receipts be framed what protections for accused retailers is envisioned 2 what type of egregious cases would the new seizure authority be designed and used for in what types of cases and how many would it have been used in recent years recipient disqualification for selling food food stamp law requires disqualification for those who traffic in food stamp benef its ie those who exchange the value of benefits on their food stamp ebt card for cash or ineligible items however sellingtrading the actual food purch ased with food stamp benefits for cash or other consideration is not cause for disqualification the administration proposes to disqualify those who exchange food purchas ed with food stamp benefits for cash 1 how will the administration enforce rule disqualifying those who exchange food purchased w ith food stamp benefits for cas h is this proposal only intended to deal with egregious cases what about cases where food obtained with food stamp benefits is exchanged for something other than cash 2 does the administration envision its propos also making the exchange of food purchased with food stamp benefits fel ony or misdemeanor subject to fines or imprisonment like trafficking under current law or only cause for disqualification penalties on states for high ne gative action error rates the food stamp program has quality control qc system under which state administration of the program is measured for the extent of erroneous determinations that is annual error rates are computed for ove rpayments to eligible and ineligible recipients and underpayments to eligible recipients for fy2005 the most recent year for which qc figures are availabl the national overp ayment rate was 453 of food stamp benefit dolla rs and underpayments were valued at 131 of food stamp benefits paid out states with cons istently over three consecutive years high error rates may be assessed fiscal sanctions these sanctions are calculated as portion of the cost of improper

million states also may receive payment accur acy bonus payments for overpayment and underpayment error rates that are very w or greatly improved for fy2005 10 states received bonus payments totaling 24 million3 in addition to overpayments and underpayments the food stamp qc system measures the extent to which states imp roperly deny suspend or terminate foodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs36 stamp applicantsrecipients ie annual ne gative action error rates are calculated for each state in fy2005 the most recent year for which these figures are available the national average negative action error ra was 691 and nine states had rates 50 or more above the national average six of them were in their second consecutive year states with high negative action error rates are not subject to fiscal sanctions however they may recei ve bonus payments for very low or greatly improved negative action rates for fy2005 six states received bonuses totaling 6 million overpayment and underpayment error rate s have been dropping in recent years in fy2005 they were at historic low on the other hand negative action error rates have been rising the administration proposes to assess states financial penalty if the state has negative action error rate above the national average for two consecutive years it appears that the pena lty would be dollar amount equal to 5 of the federal share normally 50 of states food stamp administrative costs the administrations stated purposes in adva ncing its proposal to impose penalties for high negative action error rates are to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations for applicants critics are concerned that it reopens the extensively negotiated 2002 farm bill agr eement with states and advocates that reformed the qc system and imposes an ove rly large penalty for high negative action error rates without adequate grounds fo r doing so the administration estimates savings from this proposal at 57 milli on over five years and 166 million over 10 years 1 when compared to fiscal sanctions assessed for food stamp overpayments and underpayments the proposed sanction fo r high rates of improper negative actions like mistaken eligibility denials is very large administration estimates indicate they will average over 15 million year is there reason for this substantial difference 2 in the 2002 farm bill the previous prac tice of assessing sanc tions as reduction in the federal share of state adminis trative costs was abandoned in favor of sanctions as proportion of the dolla r value of improperly paid or unpaid benefits why has the administration c hosen to use this sanction method for high rates of negative actions is it possible that cut based on administrative spending could exacerbate the problem does the administration intend to include cuts in federal matching paymen ts for state costs like nutrition education and work and training progra ms in the proposed sanction state financial liabilit for high error rates states at risk of fiscal sanction for consistently high error rates as measured by the food stamp qc system see the discussion above of the adminis trations proposal for pe nalties for high negative action error rates may meet tion of the sanction by investing using unmatched state funds in federally appr oved improvements to the administration of the food stamp program citing need to boost program integrity and strengthen the qc system the administration proposes to liminate the option permitting states to invest in administrative improvements as an alternative to paying part of their qc fiscal sanction as with the proposal for pena lties for high negative action error rates critics contend that this recommendation unnece ssarily reopens the 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs37 agreement that revamped the qc system without sufficient rationale the administration estimates minimal co st savings from this proposal 1 has the usda had any problems with stat use of the current option to invest in administrative improvements in lieu of paying fiscal sanctions have states not fulfilled their administrative improve ment promises has administration been significantly enhanced by these efforts 2 how many states have taken advantage of the option to pay for administrative improvements instead of paying the usda how much money was involved and what types of enha ncements were made food stamps improving health through nutrition education recognize nutrition education as component of the program current policy authorizes federal 50 matching payments for state nutrition education efforts for food stamp recipients and the potentially eligible lowincome population as an allowable administrativ cost usda also funds the cost of providing nutrition education materials and technical assistance related to nutrition education the administration proposes to add specific language to the food stamp act referring to nutrition ducation as an approved ac tivity under the food stamp program 1 does the administrations proposal nvision funding any nutrition education activities not now supported pilot obesity initiative the administration is concerned over substantial indications that obesity among americans is rising at present the usda nutrition programs support nutrition edu cation activities and have few features directed at combating obesity for example the food st amp program pays half the cost of state nutrition education efforts among food st amp recipients and other lowincome households the usda provides nutrition edu cation materials and makes grants for nutrition education initiatives directed at schoolchildren school meal program meal patterns are being revised nd schools are required to desi gn wellness policies that address obesity concerns and the wic program includes major mandatory nutrition education component in addition to these efforts the administrations proposal calls for competitive grants to develop and test ways of addressi ng obesity in the lowincome population with evaluations of the results this would be accomplished with fiveyear 20 million per year usda initiative to address obesity among lowincome americans according to the usda ideas that might be tested include pointofsale incentives for the purchase of fruit and vege tables by food stamp recipients grants to connect food stamp shoppers with farmers markets and integrated communication and education programs to promote healthy diets and physical activity 1 how would the pilot obesity initiative be coordinated with existing child nutrition and wic program fforts and projects supporte d by the department of health and human serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs38 2 what are the reasons given for usda to embark on separate new grant initiative the emergency food assistance program tefap permanent state tefap plans under current law states must submit plans of operation and administration for usda approval every four years plans may be amended at any time with usda approval state plans designate the state agency responsible for distributing tefap commodities set out the states plans for distributing commodities and set forth eligibility standards for participating agencies and individual recipients the administration proposes to make all tefap state plans effectively permanent and require that states only submit revisions that are warranted by changes in state tefap operations or rules this is very close to the pattern for state plans in other usda nutrition programs and the administration argues that the current onceeveryfouryears rule is burdensome on state tefap agencies critics on the other hand ques tion whether requirement to resubmit state plan once every four years is rea lly that burdensome on states as opposed to usda officials and note that tefap state plans are more important than those in other usda nutrition programs because st ates have almost total control over program rules and operations they also poi nt out that complete plan review and resubmission every four years if done c onscientiously by the state and the usda can result in important program improveme nts and that other programs state plan requirements were changed to revisions aswarranted from previous onceayear requirements not once every four years 1 have states called for change in the rules governing submission of state tefap plans is the current requirement for new state plans every four years more of burden on the usda or state agencies 2 if the problem is burden on usda plan reviewers would staggering submission of state plans be an appropriate solution selecting tefap local organizations under current policies states have complete control over the selection of local organizations that receive and distribute the tefap foods llocated to each state incl uding those groups that act as conduits to end providers like food pant ries and soup kitche ns and end providers themselves the administration is concerned that this situation can lead to many of the same organizations participating year after year with little concern over how efficiently or effectively they are deliverin g services unless significant administrative problems occur in order to encourage the entry of new distributing organizations that might operate more efficiently and c ould charge lower fees to end providers the administration proposes to require that states recompete contracts with tefap distributing organizations at least once every three years it contends that failure to have periodic competitive so licitation process results in barrier to certain local organizations including faithbased orga nizations that wish to participate in tefap critics are concerned over how requirement for competitive selection would work given the widely varying natu re of state tefap programs they also question why all contracts need to be renewed re competed so often whether there are potentially enough serious competitors to make the threeyear competition process worthwhile and the cost of r unning competitive solicitations and changinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs39 distributing organizations and they poi nt to the potential for confusion among recipients when distribution systems change 1 does the administrations proposal for recompeting contracts for tefap distributing agencies mean that all contracts will potentially be subject to termination and reassignment at the same time every three years will there be some staggering of contract renewals 2 what federal rules for competitive solicitations are envisioned3 have local organizations that are not now part of the tefap distribution network asked for competitive solicitations food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir increased administrative funding the administration in consultation with participating indian tribal organiza tions is in the process of substantially revising the method for allocating federa l payments for administrative costs for fdpir the new method would be more cl osely tied to participants served the dollar amount to be spent on administrativ costs and the allocation of federal payments for them are not specified in the underlying law governing the fdpir to speed and support implementation of revised allocation ie ease the negative effects for tribal organizations that would lose money under new allocation the administration is asking for increased fdpir administrative funding of 2627 million over 10 years critics question whether this initiative belongs in the farm bill and how it would be crafted given that it deals with matters not now covered in fdpir law 1 has decision on new method for llocating fdpir administrative payments been made if not does the adminis tration know the amount of new funding needed and the years in which it will be needed 2 the new funding the administration is as king for is described as ensuring that there would be sufficient money so that any change in the current allocation method would allow all tribal organizations to continue to receive their current allotments or modest increase dependi ng on their level of participation what would it cost to ensure that under the new allocations all tribal organizations are held harmless including inflation increases will the administrations proposal include the details of the ne w allocation method should this be placed into law 3 could the administrations goal be ach ieved through the re gular appropriations process food stampfdpir disqualification policies the fdpir is program distributing federally donated foods that is operated in lieu of food stamps on indian reservations where the tribal organization opts for it individuals cannot participate in both food stamps and the fdpir at the same time under cu rrent policy those disqualified eg for fraud from the food stamp program are automaticallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs40 disqualified from pa rticipation in the fdpir following the food stamp disqualification rules on the other nd those disqualified from the fdpir are not similarly disqualified from food stamps the administration proposes to change food stamp law to specifically dis qualify from food stamps those disqualified from the fdpir in order to promote program integrity and consistent ligibilitydisqualification rules critics question whether new provisions of law are needed to accomplish this 1 why cant food stamp disqualification of those disqualified from the fdpir be accomplished by change in food stamp regulations using the disqualification authorities provided in sec tion 6b and section 6h of the food stamp act senior farmers market nutrition program sfmnp disregarding sfmnp benefits in other assistance programs the sfmnp provides onceayear vouchers t ypically worth 2030 to lowincome seniors these vouchers are used at particip ating farmers market s and roadside stands to buy fresh produce the administration proposes to require that the value of sfmnp vouchers be disregarde d in federal and state means tested public assistance programs this change is intended to make treatment of sfmnp vouchers consistent with the treatment of other nutrition ssistance benefits eg the wic farmers market nutrition program child nutr ition program benefits food stamps 1 do any public assistance programs now count the value of sfmnp vouchers as income or financial resources sp ecifically other nutrition assistance programs like food stamps prohibiting sales taxes on sfmnp purchases the administration proposes to prohibit states from participating in the sfmnp if state or local sales taxes are charged on food purc hased with sfmnp vouchers this recommendation is intended to make treatme nt of sfmnp vouchers cons istent with the treatment accorded other nutrition assistance benefits eg the wic farmers market nutrition program food stamps 1 do any states or localities now charge sales taxes on sfmnp voucher purchases does the administration expect any state to pull out of or not apply for the program if sales taxes on

ask whether this belongs in the farm bill 1 could the administrations goal be ach ieved through the re gular appropriations process new funds for fruit and vege table purchases for schools in recent years usda has acquired an average of over 300 million year in fruit and vegetables for schools about 50 million is purchased and distributed through the department of defense fresh program which supplies fresh fruit and vegetables to schools under contract with the usda in response to calls for an increase in the quality of usdaprovided commodities the administration proposes to provide an additional 50 million year for the purchase of fruit and vegetables specifically for the school lunch program above ac quisitions under any other authority some of this new spending could be through added dollars for the defense department fresh program critics are concerned that the administration may not be asking for large enough increase in fruit and vegeta ble purchases and that its farm bill proposals are silent on potential expansi on of small 15 million existing fresh fruit and vegetable program operating in some 400 schools located in 14 states and on 3 indian reservations 1 what is the administrations position on expansion of the fresh fruit and vegetable program initia ted in the 2002 farm b ill and later expanded 2 how would the 50 million year in new fruit and vegetable purchases requested by the administrati on be distributed among schools 3 will the proposed 50 million for fruit nd vegetable purchases be mandatory funding could the administrations go be reached through the regular appropriations process section 32 fruit and vegetable purchases4 section 32 is permanent appropriation that since 1935 has earmarked th equivalent of 30 of annual customs receipts to support the farm sector through variety of activities today most of this appropriation now approximately 7 billion yearly is transferred to the us department of agriculture usda account that funds child nutrition programs however smaller but still signifi cant amount of section 32 money is set aside each year to purchase nonprices upported commodities di rectly and provide them to schools and other feeding sites some of these purchases are entitlement commodities that are required to be made under school lunch law others are bonus commodities acquired by usda through emergency surplus removal activities the total value of both types of commodities now exceeds 900 million per year the purchases are made by usdas agricultural marketing service ams included within these combin ed mandated and bonus section 32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs42 totals fruit and vegetable purchases over the last five years have averaged 308 million per year according to usda in order to promote healthy diets usda proposes to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables using section 32 authority by at least 200 million per year and 275 billion over 10 years however critics are concerned over actual extent of any new fruit and vegetable purchases and their effect on section 32 support for other commodities 1 documents detailing the budget effect of the administrations farm bill proposals indicate score ne w spending for its section 32 recommendation how does the administr ation propose to cover the cost of these increased fruit and vegetable purchases 2 if new spending would not be create d which activities or food purchases would be reduced to pay for these increases for example section 32 is now also used to purchase animal products including m eats poultry and seafood would the administrations proposal re sult in fewer purchases of these products if not why 3 usda routinely has funds remaining in the section 32 account at the end of each fiscal year which are carried over in to the next fiscal year to be used in section 32 what is this level of unoblig ated funds on average and is there any intent to reduce the size of this ca rryover to pay for new fruit and vegetable purchases if so could that l eave less carryover in future years 4 does this proposal call for any new gislative authority and if not how can congress be assured that the initiative would be carried out by future administrations 5 how does usda currently determine what proportions of its section 32 commodity acquisitions go to various domestic nutrition programs and how would it do so for the proposed increases 6 how does this proposal differ from th separate administration initiative providing for 50 million yearly in other new fruit and vegetable purchases for domestic nutrition programs how would it be funded 7 does the department need broad legislative authority to administer section 32 programs particularly bonus surplus removalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs43 title v credit the administration proposes three revisions to the permanently authorized farm loan programs of the usdas farm service agency fsa fsa is lender of last resort providing direct and guaranteed loans to farmers unable to secure credit elsewhere the general intention of th farm bill proposal is to enhance loan availability for beginning and socially disadvantaged classes of farmers and ranchers and to increase the maximum size of individual direct loans which effectively have been reduced by inflation the cost of these changes against the budget baseline is zero because the programs are funded by annual discretionary appropriations the statutory changes in eligibility and loan size may affect the distribution of program benefits and how far dollar of appropria tion goes but appropriators will continue to control the actual level of spending first the administration proposes to target more of the fsa direct loan portfolio to beginning and socially disa dvantaged farmers currently the law requires certain percentage of the loan authority to be reserved for beginning farmers and ranchers for specific length of the fiscal year and funds are disbursed across states by expected need after th targeting period ends any remaining funds are pooled across states and allocat ed to other qualified farmers the administration proposes to double the targeting percentage for direct operating loans from 35 to 70 and increase the targeting of direct farm ownership loans from 70 to 100 new repooling procedures at the end of the targeting period would redistribute funds first to targeted groups of farme rs in other states be fore other farmers second the administration proposes to enhance the beginning farmer down payment program to make it easier for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers to buy property it would lower the interest rate charged from 4 to 2 b eliminate the 250000 cap on the value of property that may be acquired c decrease the producer contribution from 10 to 5 d defer payments for the first year and add socially disadvantaged fa rmers to the list of eligible applicants third the administration proposes to raise the current 200000 borrower limit on direct farm ownership loans and 200000 limit on direct farm operating loans to combined 500000 limit on both types of loans the current limits were established in 1984 and 1978 respectively and have been eroded in terms of purchasing power by inflation in the pri ce of land and inputs limits on guaranteed loans were increased in 1998 indexed for inflation and combined across ownership and operating loans 1 the proposed 500000 combined limit on direct farm operating and farm ownership loans is not indexed for in flation however the limit on guaranteed loans dating from 1998 is indexed for inflation what is the rationale for indexing guaranteed loans and not direct loans 2 farmers may have more flexibility with the combined 500000 cap but the total is nonetheless only slightly high er than the current 400000 total across the two types of loans given the incr ease in land prices and input costs since the mid 1980s is 25 increase in the combined loan cap sufficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs44 3 the 2002 farm b ill required study of the effectiveness of the delivery of usdas direct and guaranteed loan program the issue was whether the direct loan program was still needed given shifts in many different government loan programs toward guaranteed loans including at fsa the administrations fy2008 budget for rural development calls for cutting direct loans in the rural housing program why does the usda believe direct farm loans are still necessary but not direct rural housing loans 4 what has been usdas experience with the pilot program to guarantee contract land sales as established under the 2002 farm bill 7 usc 1936 the program was authorized as pilot th rough fy2007 and was to guarantee loans made by private seller of farm to

might be offered in this regard 4 if the cellulosic ethanol industry takes ff will there still be room for the corn based ethanol industry would cellu losebased ethanol industry shift its geographic location towards the cheaper lands and feedstocks of the prairies and forests of america leaving behind cornbased plants of the corn belt if some version of this were to develop wh at would be the outlook for cornbased ethanol plants what would happen to those individuals many from small towns across america that have poured their savings into ethanol plants american ethanol blenders receive at least partial protection from foreign competition by 054 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol although the caribbean basin initiative allows for modest entry of ethanol from several caribbean countries the tariff clearly works agains t ethanol from brazil this tariff was recently extended through 2008 by pl 109 432 some ethanol supporters argue that this tariff prevents the development of national distribution network by limiting access to adequate ethanol supplies by etha nol blenders in the major coastal regions of the united states such as ne w york florida and california 1 does the tariff on ethanol imports create supply problem for major metropolitan areas distant from the corn belt if the import tariff can be justified as providing esse ntial protection for the ethanol industry why is there similar tariff on either biodiesel or palm oil to protect the more nascent us biodiesel industry in addition to import protection the us ethanol sector receives substantial support from 1 tax credit of 051 to fuel blenders for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline and 2 renewabl fuels standard rfs that mandates renewable fuels blending re quirement for fuel suppliers that grows annually from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 75 billion gallons in 2012 recent survey of both federal and state subsidies in support of ethanol production reported that total annual federal support is somewhere in the range of 51 to 68 billion10 usdas energy proposal continues the trend of strong support to the biofuels sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs59 11 this proposal and the questions are repeated from the rural development title1 is there concern that these subsidies for single technology in this case the combustion engine and biofuels may deter or limit the development of new or asyet unknown future technologies th at might otherwise provide more sustainable longrun solutions to th united states energy situation expand of biobased products markets the administration recommends that the law authorizing the federal procurement of biobased products program section 9002 of the 2002 farm bill be changed to improve the effectiveness and administration of the program also additional mandatory funding of 2 million per year is recommended 1 federal law mandates the use of siz eable amount of renewable fuel and it appears future growth will not need the help of federal agency procurement if renewable fuel is not the focus of the federal procurement program what will be the focus consolidate energy business loan authorities under the biomass research and development act11 the administration proposes to consoli date into existing business and industry loan program authority several other l oan program authorities prioritize funding for biorefinery construction and raise the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to 100 million the renewable ergy systems and ergy efficiency improvements loan guarantee program would be consolidated under this platform proposed increased funding to 210 million would support 217 billion of guaranteed loans over 10 years for cellulo sic ethanol projects the administration would raise the loan cap to 100 milli on and eliminate the cap on loan guarantee fees finally the administration proposes prioritizing funding for the construction of biorefinery projects 1 this platform would emphasize energy development in rura l areas particularly cellulosic ethanol production although this may be promising technology it has yet to be developed commercially and there remain significant technical obstacles based on current technology and the governments besteducated projections corn based ethanol will have to account for 34 billion of the administrations proposed 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels target for 2017 what is the rationale fo r the proposed level of funding for such primitive technology 2 what support will be given to other re newable energy technologies eg wind power solar power is there any cern about crowding out the development of other potentially viable longrun ener gy solutions by intensifying federal funds so narrowly on cellulosic ethanolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs60 12 this proposal and the questions are repeated from the rural development title 13 department of energy office of public affairs doe selects six cellulosic ethanol plants for up to 385 million in federal funding press release dated february 28 2007 14 this biomass reserve recommendation also is listed in the conservation title as part of the conservation reserve program recommendation and this entry is duplicate of the questions posed in that section3 while building cellulosic ethanol facilities over the next five years will create some local construction employment how likely are cellulosic facilities to create new rural competitive advantage for the long term create multidepartment energy grants program12 the administration proposes to conso lidate usda energy grant and research program authorities under the biomass rese arch and development act of 2000 the key renewable energy systems and energy fficiency improvements grant programs would be consolidated under this ac t with proposed mandatory funding of 500 million over 10 years in addition competitive grants under the consolidated authority would be increased to 150 million over 10 years 1 in the past renewable energy system f unds have assisted range of renewable energy activities including anaerobic digesters and wind energy systems from across diverse of geographic areas w ill the expanded funding continue to be broadly targeted across different re newable energy types and geographic locations or will it focus more directly on establishing viable selfsustaining cellulosic ethanol industry 2 the doe recently announced it would be investing 385 million in six biorefinery projects usin g cellulosic feedstocks13 is there need for additional usda energy grants funding how will the requested funding in the administrations energy grants proposal be coordinated with the doe effort 3 what kinds of quality employment and ec onomic development

acreage is limited to 392 million the secretary is recommending reauthor ization of this program with an enhanced focus on lands that provide the most benefit for envi ronmentally sensitive lands priority would be given to wholefield enrollment for lands utilized forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs61 15 this proposal and the questions are repeated from the rural development title 16 this biomass reserve recommendation also is listed in the research title as the agriculture bioenergy and biobased products research initiative and this entry is duplicate of the questions posed in that sectionenergyrelated biomass production biomass would be rvested after nesting season and rental payments would be limited to income foregone or costs incurred by the participant to meet conservation requirements in those years biomass was harvested for energy production 1 the proposal may appear to some to have two conflic ting components with regard to crp if it is desirable to focus crp on multiyear idling of more environmentally sensitive lands what is the rationale for proposing the harvesting of biomass on those lands c ould this harvesting conflict with the purpose of the program 2 if it is decided that high demand for commodities dictates that less land should be in the crp how would priorities be set for land to be released mandatory funding for competitive grants under the biomass research and development act15 the administration proposes to conso lidate usda energy grant and research program authorities under the biomass research and development act of 2000 the key renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements grant programs would be consolidated under this act with proposed mandatory funding of 500 million over 10 years in addition competitive grants under the consolidated authority would be increased to 150 million over 10 years see the questions unde r the previous heading in this chapter titled create multidepartment energy grants program mandatory funding for usdauniversity collaborative research16 the administration proposes to create an agricultural bioenergy and biobased products research initiative with mandatory annual funding of 50 million for 10 years the initiative would use existing agriculture research service facilities and scientists and provide competitive gran ts to universities these usdafunded activities would be coordinated with department of energy activities the objectives would be to make agricultural biomass viable alternative to petroleum and to develop industrial products from the byproducts of bi oenergy production 1 will current and pending ars work be displaced when fac ilities and scientists shift to the high priority bioenergy topics 2 will the department of energy have management control over any of this research fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs62 17 this forest wood recommendation also is listed in the forestry title and this entry is duplicate of the questions posed in that section3 does the proposal envision any collaboration between public and private research in this area forest wood for energy17 the administration is proposing new 10year 150 million woodtoenergy program to accelerate devel opment and use of new tec hnologies to use the substantial amounts of lowgrade woody bi omass that degrade forest health and exacerbate wildfire risks and are of little commercial value 1 what are the program goals for this proposal2 what is the potential to convert woody biomass to cellulosic ethanol and how does this compare with the potentia l to burn woody biomass to produce electricity what are the costs and th biomass conversion factors for ethanol conversion and for electricity production what other factors capital costs infrastructure collection and hauling oppor tunities etc might be critical for improved utilization of wvalue woody biomass for energy might any of these factors be more limiting than t echnology developmen t and deployment what programs exist to ddress these other factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs63 title x miscellaneous federal crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized so it does not require renewal in the 2007 farm bill major enhancements to the program have been authorized in legislation on several occasi ons since 1980 usually outside of the farm bill process most recently the agricu lture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 put 82 billion in new federal spe nding measures over fiveyear period into the program primarily through more generous premium subsidies to help make the program more affordable to farmers and increase farmer participation since 2000 the federal subsidy to the crop insu rance program has averaged about 33 billion per year although the scope of crop insurance has widened significantly over the past 25 years and premium subsidies have increased the stated goal of eliminating disaster payments has not been achieved until the 2005 crop congress provided ad hoc disaster payments to farmers in virtua lly every year since 1988 that witnessed substantial weatherrelated crop losses the disaster assistance has been made available regardless of whether produ cer had an active crop insurance policy the administrations farm bill proposal contains several crop insurance recommendations intended to nhance participation addre ss issues of waste fraud and abuse reduce costs and reduce the need for emergency supplemental disaster payments one of the more significant proposed changes to the program would be to allow participating farmers to purchase insurance for the portion of their production that is part of their deductible and not currently covered by crop insurance under this supplemental deductible coverage producer could purchase an additional policy and payment woul d be made when losses in the producers county exceed certain threshold the administration also recommends several costsaving measures to the program in cluding reducing premium subsidies by 2 to 5 percentage points charging premiums for the catastrophic level of coverage which currently is premiumfree and requiring the private insurance companies which now sell and service the policies to absorb more of the cost of the program finally farmers would be re quired to purchase crop insurance as prerequisite for participating in the farm commodity support programs 1 the estimated annual average cost of th supplemental deductib coverage that the administration proposes is 35 milli on over the last twenty years congress has provided an average of bout 2 billion per year in supplemental disaster payments how would this propos ed program preclude the pressure for congress to enact multibillion dollar di saster payment programs each year 2 what effect would the administration pr oposals to reduce the federal cost of the crop insurance program by increasing farmerpaid premiums have on farmer participation in the program 3 1994 crop insurance act required the purchase of crop insurance policy as prerequisite for partic ipating in the farm commodity programs farm groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs64 were strongly opposed to this provision and fought ccessfully to have it eliminated in the 1996 farm bill what reaction might be expected from farm groups to the current proposal for mandatory linkage section 32 fruit and vegetable purchases for nutrition programs section 32 is permanent appropria tion that since 1935 has earmarked the equivalent of 30 of annua l customs receipts to support the farm sector through variety of activities today most of th is appropriation now approximately 7 billion yearly is transferred to the us depa rtment of agriculture usda account that funds child nutrition programs however smaller but still significant amount of section 32 money is set aside each year to purchase nonpricesupported commodities directly and provi them to schools and othe r feeding sites some of these purchases are entitlement commodities that are required to be made under the school lunch act others are bonus co mmodities acquired through emergency surplus removal activities the total value of both types of commodities now exceeds 900 million per year the purchases are made by usdas agricultural marketing service ams included within these combined mandated and bonus section 32 totals fru it and vegetable purchases ove r the last five years have averaged 308 million per year according to usda 1 usda proposes to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables using section 32 authority by at least 200 million per yea r but the farm bill budget indicates score above the omb baseline why is this proposal not reflected in the administrations fy2008 budget in other words how does the administration propose to cover the cost of these in creased fruit and vegetable purchases 2 if new spending would not be create d which activities or food purchases would be reduced to pay for these increases for example section 32 is now also used to purchase animal products including m eats poultry and seafood would the administration proposal result in fewer purchases of these products if not why 3 the department routinely has funds re maining in the section 32 account at the end of each fiscal year which are carried over into the next fiscal year to be used in section 32 what is this level of unobligated funds on average and does usda intend to reduce the size of this carryover to pay for new fruit and vegetable purchases if so wont that leave even less carryover in future years 4 does this proposal call for any new gislative authority and if not how can congress be assured that the initiative would be carried out by future administrations 5 how does the department currently determine what proportions of its section 32 commodity acquisitions go to vari ous domestic nutrition programs and how would it do so for the proposed increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs65 6 how does this proposal differ fro m the separate administration in itiative providing for 50 million yearly in other new fruit and vegetable purchases for domestic nutrition programs how would it be funded 7 why does the department need and use such broad legislative authority to administer section 32 programs par ticularly bonus surplus removals organic agriculture the administrations 2007 farm bill proposal recommends considerably more funding for research and marketing programs to support the continuing growth of the organic farming sector 1 how is the department proposing to provide this new mandatory funding 2 usdas farm bill initiative states that gaps in the organic regulations may need to be addressed in orde r to better support enforcement activity but more enforcement would also require more personnel and resources how would the department provide fundi ng for the increased program oversight and enforcement that could be necessary as the number of certified operations increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33916crs66 appendix administrations cost estimate table a1 administrations
