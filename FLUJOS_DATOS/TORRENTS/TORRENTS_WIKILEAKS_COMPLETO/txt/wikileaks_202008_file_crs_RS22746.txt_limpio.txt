s 1893hr 976 and agreement by evelyne p baumrucker et crs2 overview of the vetoed hr 3963 and hr 976 although this report focuses on differences between the bills hr 976 and hr 3963 share many common elements including national allotment appropriations totaling 614 billion over five years an increase of 362 billion over the current law baseline of 252 billion distributed to states and territories using new formula that builds on provisions in the house and senate reauthorization bills new contingency fund for making payments to states for certain shortfalls of federal schip funds which would receive deposits through separate appropriation each year through fy2012 and make payments of up to 20 of the available national allotment for schip new performance bonus payments for states exceeding certain enrollment levels which are funded with an fy2008 appropriation of 3 billion and deposits of certain unspent schip funds through fy2012 additional grants for outreach and enrollment totaling 100 million each httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22746 year through fy2012 provisions to remove barriers to enrollment provisions related to benefits eg dental mental health and early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt provisions to eliminate barriers to providing premium assistance provisions to strengthen quality of care and health outcomes of children program integrity and miscellaneous provisions including some that affect the medicaid program and tobacco tax changes cost estimate from the congressional budget office cbo indicates that hr 976 would increase outlays by 349 billion over 5 years and by 715 billion over 10 years3 cost estimate for hr 3963 indicates that it would increase outlays by 354 billion over 5 years and by 715 billion over 10 years4 costs in both bills would be offset by an increase in the federal tobacco tax and other changes which the joint committee on taxation jct estimates would increase net revenue by 363 billion over 5 years and by 728 billion over 10 years 3 cbo letter to the honorable john dingell september 25 2007 available at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs86xxdoc8655hr976pdf 4 cbo cbos estimate of the effects on direct spending and revenues of the childrens health insurance program october 24 2007 available at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs87xxdoc8741 hr976dingellltr10242007pdf crs3 differences between the bills fundingfinancing allotments hr 976 appropriated total of 614 billion for schip allotments between fy2008 and fy2012 hr 3963 does not alter these amounts or the formulas for calculating states schip allotments5 bonus payments hr 976 called for bonus payments to states that 1 increase their enrollment of children in medicaid or schip above certain levels and 2 implement four out of seven specific activities to encourage enrollment and retention among medicaid and schipeligible children qualifying states would receive cash payments as percentage of the state share of their medicaidschip expenditures though setting higher bar and paying lower percentage in schip as compared to medicaid unlike hr 976 hr 3963 would not make bonus payments available for increases in schip enrollment only for increases in enrollment among children in medicaid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22746 to be eligible for bonus payments under hr 3963 state would have to implement five rather than four of eight rather than seven specific activities to encourage enrollment and retention6 in addition the second tier percentage for bonus payments would be slightly higher 625 of the state share rather than the 60 in hr 976 for increases in child enrollment in medicaid unlike hr 976 hr 3963 also specifies that bonus payments may only be used to reduce the number of lowincome children who do not have health insurance coverage in the state redistribution of unspent fy2005 allotments hr 3963 would allow the redistribution of unspent fy2005 allotments to occur as specified in the continuing resolution hjres 52 pl 11092 which would go to states in the order in which they face shortfalls with unused fy2005 funds not available for redistribution after fy2008 limitations on schip matching rate and availability of federal funds under current law states can set their upper income eligibility threshold for schip at the higher of 200 of the federal poverty line fpl or 50 percentage points above their income eligibility level for medicaid children prior to schips enactment however by using existing flexibility to define what counts as income any state can raise its effective income eligibility threshold for schip through the use of income disregards which must be approved by the federal government there are two types of income disregards that 5 the only change in the legislation in these sections would reduce the amount of the fy2012 semiannual appropriations for schip allotments to 115 billion from 175 billion with the onetime appropriation for schip allotments in fy2012 section 108 of the bill increased to 137 billion from 125 billion although the total appropriation for fy2012 allotments is 16 billion in both versions the substantive impact is that the baseline of funding for schip allotments from fy2013 onward will reflect the 135 billion in semiannual installments rather than 175 billion this change affects the baseline between fy2013 and fy2017 for the purposes of the score by the cbo even though the legislation itself provides appropriations directly for schip allotments only through fy2012 6 the new eighth activity is implementing the option of providing premium assistance subsidies crs4 have been used by states the first type excludes particular dollar amount based on type of income eg earnings or expense eg child care the second type of income disregard excludes an entire block of income although hr 976 would not affect states ability to use income disregards it would reduce the federal reimbursement rate for costs associated with schip enrollees whose income would exceed 300 fpl without the use of block of income disregard an exception would be provided for states that on the date of enactment have federal approval or have enacted state law to cover schip enrollees above 300 fpl in contrast hr 3963 would deny federal funding for costs associated with schip enrollees whose income would exceed 300 fpl without the use of block of income disregard an exception would only be provided for states that have federal approval to cover schip enrollees above 300 fpl on the date of enactment new jersey is the only state that currently meets this requirement illegal aliens and unauthorized expenditures hr 976 would specify that nothing in the bill allows federal payment for individuals who are not legal residents hr 3963 would add an additional statement that titles xi xix and xxi provide for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22746 the disallowance of federal financial participation for erroneous expenditures under medicaid and schip eligibility hr 976 allowed broader coverage of pregnant women under schip in terms of eligibility and benefits when certain conditions were met it largely followed the senate passed schip bill with modifications based on the house bill pregnancyrelated assistance included all services covered under schip for children in state as well as prenatal delivery and postpartum care and also included medicaid benefits provided to pregnant women in the state hr 3963 would delete coverage of medicaid services for the new group of pregnant women under schip with respect to schip coverage of adult populations eg nonpregnant childless adults and parents of medicaid and schipeligible children hr 976 would phase out schip coverage of nonpregnant childless adults after two years and in fy2009 federal reimbursement for such coverage would be reduced to the medicaid federal medical assistance percentage fmap rate under hr 3963 schip coverage of nonpregnant childless adults would end on december 31 2008 and federal reimbursement for such coverage would be maintained at the schip enhanced federal medical assistance percentage rate under both bills such states would be permitted to apply for medicaid waivers to continue coverage for such populations but such waivers would be subject to specified budget neutrality standard ie tied to the 2008 state spending on this population increased by specified growth factor the treatment of parents is identical under hr 976 and hr 3963 coverage of parents would still be allowed but beginning in fy2010 allowable spending under the waivers would be subject to set aside amount from separate allotment and would be matched at the states regular medicaid fmap rate unless the state is able to prove that it met certain coverage benchmarks related to performance in providing coverage to children finally in fy2011 and fy2012 the federal matching rate for costs associated with such parent coverage would be reduced to rate between the medicaid and schip crs5 rates for states that meet certain coverage benchmarks and to the states regular medicaid fmap for all other states enrollment and access hr 976 and hr 3963 include identical provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in medicaid and schip among the major provisions the bills would create state option to rely on finding from specified agencies to determine whether child under age 19 or an age specified by the state not to exceed 21 years of age has met one or more of the eligibility requirements eg income assets or resources citizenship or other criteria necessary to determine an individuals initial eligibility eligibility redetermination or renewal of eligibility for medical assistance under medicaid or schip the bills would not relieve states of their obligation to determine eligibility for medicaid and would require the state to inform families that they may qualify for lower premium payments or more comprehensive health coverage under medicaid if the familys income were directly evaluated by the state medicaid agency both bills would drop the requirement for signatures on medicaid application form under penalty of perjury httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22746 current law and regulations require that schip plans include procedures to ensure that schip coverage does not substitute for coverage provided in group health plans also known as crowdout on august 17 2007 the administration issued guidance letter explaining how cms would apply existing requirements in reviewing state requests to extend schip eligibility to children with income levels exceeding 250 fpl including specified crowdout strategies states would be required to implement within one year hr 976 included crowdout provision it would have required states already covering children with income exceeding 300 fpl and beginning in 2010 new states that propose to do so to describe how they will address crowdout and implement best practices to avoid crowdout to be developed by the secretary in consultation with the states hr 3963 would amend this provision to require all states to submit state plan amendment describing how they will address crowdout and incorporate such best practices in their schip programs under hr 976 beginning in 2010 higher income states those covering children with income exceeding 300 fpl cannot have combined rate of public and private coverage for lowincome children that is less than the target rate of coverage for low income children this target rate would be calculated by the secretary to represent the average rate of private and public coverage combined among the 10 states and dc with the highest percentage of such coverage states failing to meet this requirement in given fiscal year would not receive any federal schip payments for higher income children until they come into compliance with this rule states would develop corrective action plans and the secretary would not be permitted to deny payments if there is reasonable likelihood that such plans would bring affected states into compliance hr 3963 would also add language to require that in the case of state plan amendments denied on or after august 16 2007 on the basis of policy or interpretation in effect prior to the date of enactment of this act if such state submits modification of such state plan amendment that complies with the crowdout provisions in this bill the original date of submission for the state plan amendment must be applied to the crs6 modified state plan amendment however such modified state plan amendment must not be effective before the date of enactment of this act also payments for services to children with income exceeding 300 fpl if applicable would not be permitted for such modified state plan amendment the crowdout provisions in both hr 976 and hr 3963 would supersede the august guidance letter citizenship documentation under current law us citizens and nationals must present documentation that proves citizenship and documents personal identity in order for states to receive federal medicaid reimbursement for services provided to them hr 976 would modify existing medicaid citizenship documentation rules eg by requiring additional documentation options for federally recognized indian tribes and specifying the reasonable opportunity period for individuals who are required to present documentation it would also provide new option for states to meet medicaid citizenship documentation requirements through name and social security number ssn validation make citizenship documentation requirement for schip and provide an enhanced match for certain administrative costs hr 3963 would include the same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22746 changes except that 1 the name and ssn option for citizenship documentation would determine whether an individuals name or ssn or declaration of citizenship or nationality is inconsistent with information in the records maintained by the commissioner of social security and 2 5 million would be appropriated to carry out the commissioners citizenship documentation responsibilities hr 976 would require name and ssn validation only ssns by themselves do not denote citizenship because certain noncitizens are eligible for them premium assistance both bills would allow states to offer premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer sponsored coverage to all targeted lowincome children who are eligible for child health assistance and have access to such coverage or to parents of targeted low income children the bills would also allow states to offer premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer sponsored coverage esi to medicaideligible children andor parents of medicaideligible children where the family has access to esi coverage hr 3963 includes language to ensure that medicaid premium assistance programs coordinate with premium assistance programs offered under this provision in addition both bills specify that family participation in premium assistance programs would be optional payments in midaugust and early september the administration issued proposed rules to restrict medicaid coverage or payments for rehabilitation services and certain school based services hr 976 would prohibit the secretary of hhs from taking any actions including through regulation to restrict medicaid coverage or payment for rehabilitation and schoolbased services if such actions are more restrictive in any aspect than those applied to such coverage or payments as of july 1 2007 under hr 976 this prohibition would have been in effect until may 28 2008 hr 3963 would change this moratorium date from may 28 2008 to january 1 2010
