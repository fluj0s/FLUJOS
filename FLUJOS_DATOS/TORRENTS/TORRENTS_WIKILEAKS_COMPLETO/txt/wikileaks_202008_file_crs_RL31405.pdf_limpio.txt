and stated that there is an urgent need to find the resources to fund the global communications revolution to ensure th at it is truly global one proposal is bit tax very small tax on the amount of data sent through the internet the costs for users would be negligible sending 100 emails day each containing 10kilobyte document very long one would raise tax of just 1 cent yet with email boomin g worldwide the total would be substantial in belgium in 1998 such tax would have yielded 10 billion globally in 1996 it would have yielded 70 billion more than total official development assistance that year22 elsewhere in the report references to other forms of global taxation as source of development funding can be found late r in chapter 2 the authors discuss other technological innovations that would impr ove human development they suggest levy on patents registered under the wo rld intellectual property organization as one possible source of funding for such effo rts they continue levy of just 100 on each patent would have raised 350 million in 1998 alone alternatively funding could be reallocated from the res earch subsidies grants and tax breaks now given to industry23 chapter 5 on reinventing global gove rnance for humanity and equity argues that private investment flows ar important but experience shows two major problems first is their volatility second is the tendency for

context and background some observers directed their attenti on to the unsponsored international conference on financing for development held in monterrey mexico march 1822 2002 as the source and

developing countri in that regard we agree to study in the appropriate forums the results of the analysis requested from the secretarygeneral on possible innovative sources of finance 29 the phrase innovative sources of finan ce is believed to be shorthand for discussion of various globa l taxation proposals or vehicles as early as 1996 initial discussions for this meeting within the economic

president of mexico issued 72page document consisting of an executive summa ry recommendations of the highlevel panel and technical report of the highlevel panel30 under the heading innovative sources of financing the report noted that the panel has considered many suggestions for innovative sources of finance we believe the international conference on financing for development and the globalization summit recommended by the panel should first discuss whether or not the world should have global nd not only sovereign imposition of taxes next if global taxation is considered sirable they should proceed to discuss seriously the pros and cons of two such sources currency transactions tax tobin tax and carbon tax we advise that before any political discussion these possible new sources of internati onal finance be examined purely on their economic and development merits and shortcomings31 the panel also recommended that the conference consider the potential benefits of an internationa l tax organization ito to among other tasks compile statistics identify trends maintain surveillance of tax developments take lead role in restraining tax competition designed to attract multinationals with excessive and unwise incentives and perhaps in due course seek to velop international agreement on formula for the unitary taxation of multinationals32 they suggested that an ito would also be of great im portance in developi ng and implementing innovative sources of finance if they were agreed upon by the international community finally in september 2001 the secret ariat issued series of ten technical notes in response to request by th conference preparatory committee which instructed that these notes be related to issues fallin g under the substantive agenda for the

more farreaching goals including some proposals that didnt make the radar screen this time for example global taxes such as the one proposed on carbon emissi ons could be used to finance global public goods this is based on simple premise fairness the industrialized countries that generate disproportiona share of carbon emissions into the atmosphere should pay accordingly providing money for development and also more efficient use of scarce resources36 the same day state department spoke sman richard boucher during the noon briefing in response to question as to whether the united states government approves of such plan and endorses it the fox re ferenced global tax on carbon emissions or any global ta x plan responded the us g overnment has seen these kinds of proposals from time to
