employment also will likely increase but at much lower rates among jobs with lesser skill requirements despite these diï¬€erences in rates of job growth the skill distribution of employment is

graduationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs weborder code 97764 the skill education distribution of jobs how is it changing updated june 5 2000 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764the skill education distribution of jobs how is it changing summary about 3 out of 5 jobs projected to be created through 2008 could have relatively high skill requirements ie typically requiring some postsecondary education this leaves 81 million new jobs for workers with relatively low skill levels ie typically high school graduates thus firms are expected to continue to need workers from variety of educational backgrounds to fill those jobs that will be added to the labor market by economic growth during the first decade of the 21st century through 2008 the most skilled jobs ie typically requiring bachelors degree could experience the largest percent increase in employer demand employment also will likely expand but at much slower rates among jobs with lesser skill requirements despite the differences in rates of new job creation the skill distribution of employment is expected to look much the same about onehalf of all jobs typically requiring at least some postsecondary education and about onehalf typically requiring more than high school completion this stability reflects the fact that the projected addition of 203 million jobs to the labor market through 2008 represents small increment to 1998s sizable employment base of 141 million employers need workers not only to fill new jobs but also to fill existing jobs that become vacant as workers move into other occupations retire or otherwise leave the labor force replacement needs are an important source of job openings particularly in slowly expanding or contracting fields for example 33 million of the least skilled jobs might be added to the labor market between 1998 and 2008 but 141 million new and existing lowskilled jobs might become available over the projection period the difference reflects the jobs of departing employees that firms will need to fill while the lowest skilled workers would be qualified to compete for just 16 of the 203 million new jobs projected to be created through 2008 they have the educational level to compete for 26 of the 550 million new and existing jobs expected to open up over the 10year period thus focus on job growth alone provides an incomplete picture of employers skill requirements and misleading impression of the job market faced by lowskilled workers oftentimes members of the education and training community have focused on those occupations expected to grow the most rapidly to urge students to obtain bachelors degree or at the least get postsecondary education that leads to an associates degree or vocational certificate this analysis demonstrates that jobs will continue to be there in abundant numbers for workers with more than high school education that is the report addresses the employment prospects of relatively lowskilled workers in terms of wage prospects however firms have been paying much larger premium than in the past to employees with bachelors degrees the current size of the wage gap between more and less educated workers suggests that there is something in addition to the barely perceptible shift toward heightened job skill requirements as measured by educational attainment that has prompted employers to increasingly favor workers with 4year college degree over other workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764contents skill hierarchy 2 caveat 3 the hierarchys structure 3 projected job growth by skill level 5 highest skilled category 5 moderately highskilled category

labor shortage legislation in the 106th cong ress and crs report rl30395 farm labor shortages and immigration policy both by linda levinethe skill education distribution of jobs how is it changing one of the prominent questions in the late 1980s was whether workers would be available in sufficient numbers to meet the seemingly heightened job skill requirements of employers with the unemployment rate in the 19881990 period averaging below 6 annually the specter was raised of labor shortage generally simultaneously concern was expressed about the buildup of an excess supply of low skilled workers relative to their reportedly dwindling job opportunities over the years1 after an initially slow rebound from the 19901991 recession the unemployment rate fell below 5 in 1997 and has remained at that level for the past few years as consequence the federal reserve board has been concerned that an overall shortage of workers could brake the longrunning economic expansion by preventing firms from continuing to fulfill the demand for goods and services in lowinflation environment2 at the same time the focus of congress has been on whether there are enough workers at the high and the low end of the skill spectrum to meet employers demand for labor eg information technology and farm workers respectively3 nonetheless the perception of limited job options for lowskilled workers has continued to command attention albeit muted the cautionary remarks of several policy analysts that welfare recipients would be unable to meet the work requirements in reform legislation enacted in 1996 have given way today to fear that once the economy sputters these individuals will be the first to be laid off and will then facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764crs2 4 for more information see crs

in the labor market include an individual experiencing relatively little unemployment or relatively high wages generally workers with more schooling are less likely to become unemployed and are more likely to have higher earnings see for example crs report 951081 education matters earnings by highest year of schooling completed by linda levine hereafter cited as crs report 951081 education

linda levinefew choices for reemploymen t due to their typically brief work experience and low skill levels others in the public policy community have continued to debate whether the influx of immigrants with little schooling has exacerbated lowskilled nativeborn workers already poor employment and wage options4 those who believe there is an ongoing mismatch between the skill composition of the workforce and the skill requirements of jobs have urged individuals to obtain additional education or training to improve their chance of succeeding in the labor market5 for example some members of congress have endorsed assisting students and workers in this endeavor through education tax credits and deductions or through increased funding of pell grants and the workforce investment act federal appropriations and income tax credits also have focused on providing training or work experience to welfare recipients among others with poor job prospects due to presumably low skill levels6 in addition some have advocated the adoption of more labormarketoriented approach to immigration that would curtail the admission of persons having limited formal educatio n to reduce competition with less skilled nativeborn workers this report examines whether employers have been increasing their demand for highskilled workers and at the same time decreasing their demand for lowskilled workers it does this by analyzing projected rates of occupational employment growth by education level between 1998 and 2008 the report determines whether the emerging pattern of job growth is likely to have much of an effect on the overall skill distribution of employment and on the number of jobs available to less skilled workers it also distinguishes between jobs that are added to the labor market through economic growth ie new jobs and positions that become available to jobseekers due to occupational turnover ie filling vacancies in existing jobs skill hierarchy statistics are regularly collected on the educational distribution of workers employed in different occupations educational attainment by occupational group can serve as rough approximation of jobs skill level the

training by linda levineeducational attainment by occupational group of employed persons aged 16 or older according to the march 1999 current population survey cps caveat major caveat that readers should keep in mind while they proceed through this report is that educational attainment was the sole criterion for slotting occupational groups in the hierarchy however employees often develop skills through formal on thejob training programs eg attending onsite classes or through informal instruction eg learning by watching others rather than through additional years of formal education for example workers in some bluecollar occupations in the construction trades eg heavy equipment operators and electricians may participate in apprenticeships and workers whose jobs now commonly require computer skills eg professional and administrat ive support employees may participate in employer provided training to use wordprocessing or spreadsheet software the allocation of occupations to the hierarchy does not reflect job skills acquired outside of school settings because of scanty data on employerprovided training7 the hierarchys structure the four skill levels of the hierarchy are based on the following educational distributions by occupational group near majority at least 46 of workers in the occupations that make up the highest skilled group had earned bachelors or higher degree majority of workers in the occupations that comprise the moderately highskilled cluster had some postsecondary education majority of workers in the two lower skilled groups had at most completed high school in the moderately lowskilled cluster substantial portion about 40 of workers had not gone beyond high school b in contrast many workers in the lowest skilled cluster had not attended high school eg 25 of farmworke rs 19 of private household workers and 13 of cleaning service workers did not go beyond elementary school see table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764crs4 table 1

highskilled category job creation in the moderately highskilled cluster could be slightly below the average rate ie 12 versus 14 in large part because of its inclusion of the administrative support group the continuing dissemination of technological innovations appears to be primarily responsible for the slow job growth 9 in numerous administrative support occupations nonetheless administrative support is expected to remain the largest occupational category although in 2008 its lead over the professional group could narrow considerably to 15 million jobs see table 2 columns 3 and 5 office automation resulting in productivity improvements as well as managers and professionals now common use of computer software is expected to mean fewer jobs for typists and word processors in 2008 down by 93000 or 20 the spreading application of office automation also is expected to reduce the demand for labor in financial records processing occupations such as bookkeeping accounting and auditing clerks 81000 or 4 as well as for bank tellers 31000 or 5 in addition bls projects that the need for computer operators will decline by 64000 or 26 as automation reaches the computer room itself eg programs and robots that allow computers to perform routine tasks once handled by people and as firms move away from the large mainframes that these employees operate continuing technological change and organizational restructuring eg mergers in the telecommunications industry could cut employment of telephone operators by 41000 or 16 as well11 the inclusion in the moderately highskilled cluster of health technicians and technologists eg medical records technicians and surgical technologists and of protective service workers eg correctional offices and police offsets the relatively slow pace of job growth in administrative support occupations between 1998 and 2008 however the aboveaverage increases in employment projected for health technicianstechnologists 25 and for protective service workers 26 could account for just 3 and 4 respectively of all new jobs created over the period because of the occupational groups small employment bases in contrast despite the slow employment growth projected for administrativ support jobs they could expand by 22 million and account for 11 of all jobs added to the labor market due to the occupational groups large employment base see table 2 columns 4 and 5 the two lowerskilled categories the heterogenous composition of the two lowest skilled clusters also has an impact on their anticipated growth rates of 13 for the moderately lowskilled group and of 10 for the lowest skilled group the inclusion of farming occupations and of bluecollar occupations ie precision production craft and repair workers and operators fabricators and laborers is expected to dampen the two skill categories rates of expansion conversely the inclusion of service and retail occupations shores up the projected pace of employment gains in the two lower skilled groups see table 2 column 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97764crs9 12 employment in the agricultural industry is projected to fall by 377000 jobs between 1998 and 2008 following decline of 186000 between

the economy12 farmers classified in the moderately low skilled group and farmworkers classified in the lowest skilled group are projected to be among the occupations experiencing the largest absolute decreases down 173000 jobs or 13 and 57000 jobs or 7 respectively13 similarly cutbacks at sewing and textile manufacturers14 are expected to largely account for the dwindling prospects of workers in some bluecollar occupations within the lowest skilled category for example sewing machine operators in the garment trade could experience 112000 job loss or 30 reduction and operatorstenders of certain textile machines 50000 job loss or 26 reduction15 growing reliance on computercontrolled technology appears to explain more of the projected employment declines among other bluecollar occupations in the moderately lowskilled group the number of positions for precision inspectors testers and graders could fall by 22000 or 3 for example bluecollar jobs in the printingpublishing industry also could suffer employment contractions associated with computer technologi in the lowest skilled group offset lithographic press operators could lose 9000 jobs 15 cutback and

for operators fabricators and laborers in the lowest skilled group given the substantial numbers of bluecollar jobs currently in existence these relatively low growth rates could add 30 million jobs and account for 15 of all new jobs created between 1998 and 2008 see table 2 columns 4 5 and 6 in contrast the experience of private household workers is expected to be more like that of farmers and farmworkers and less like that of other service workers see below in other words employment in the private household occupational group is expected to continue its downward trajecto ry both child care

gains projected for health and personal service occupations in the moderately lowskilled cluster the number of medical assistants could increase by 58 or 146000 physical therapy assistantsaides by 44 or 36000 dental assistants by 42 or 97000 and nursing aidesorderliesattendants by 24 or 325000 during the projection period similarly employment of personal care and home health aides spurred in part by the shift toward outpatient and home care is projected to rise by 58 or 433000 in addition the continuing presence in the labor force of mothers with young children probably underlies the anticipated 26 or 236000 increase in child care jobs18 one set of occupations in the moderately lowskilled group that has only slightly aboveaverage projected growth rate could add more jobs than some of the fastgrowing occupations because of its large employment base specifically 135 million individuals worked as retail sales persons cashiers and other sales workers in 1998 if their employment increases by 18 million as projected 9 of the total job gains between 1998 and 2008 would occur in these sales occupations see table 2 columns 4 5 and 6 expansion in the retail trade industry eg department or discount merchandise stores will likely account for much of the employment uptick in retail sales occupations during the projection period19 growth in the eatingdrinking places component of the retail trade industry also could spur large employment gains in food preparation and service occupations eg waiterswaitresses with 303000 jobs as well as food counter fountain and related workers with 247000 jobs another service occupation janitors and cleaners could expand greatly as well 365000 jobs20 changes in the share and number of jobs by skill level despite their different rates of projected job growth the skill clusters shares of total employment are likely to remain about the same as shown in table 3 the highest skilled category of occupations accounted for 26 of all

positions in both growing and shrinking occupations because many existing jobs must be filled when workers move from one occupation to another retire or otherwise leave the labor force indeed bls expects that in most occupations more openings will develop because of hiring to fill jobs vacated between 1998 and 2008 than because of new jobs created by economic growth over the period21 the need to replace workers is an especially important source of labor demand in slowgrowing occupations and the only source of job openings in declining occupations for example the lowest skilled cluster could add 33 million new jobs between 1998 and 2008 but the number of positions available to the least skilled workers could be considerably larger total of 141 million jobs see table 4 the 108 million difference between the two employment figures is replacement needs that is employers hiring workers into existing jobs that become vacant due to employee mobility while workers with the fewest years of education seemingly would be qualified to compete for just 16 of the 203 million new jobs added to the economy through 2008 they could have the skill requirements to fill 26 of the 550 million new and existing jobs expected to open up during the projection period see the appendix table for comparison of job growth and total job openings for each of the skill hierarchys occupational groups thus the job opportunities available to newcomers to and current participants in the labor force are not limited to the change in employment generated by economic growth too great focus on rates of job growth creates misperception about how rapidly the skill structure of employment is changing and about the job market faced by lowskilled workers the skill composition of new and existing

permanently leaving the labor force for other reasons ie net replacement needs conclusion the skill structure of employment is likely to remain quite stable through 2008 employers are demanding more highly educated labor force but they also continue to need workers across the entire skill spectrum too great focus on the rate of new job creation due to economic growth without regard to the current size and composition of employment as well as to the number and nature of jobs generated by occupational turnover results in misperception about the speed and extent of change in the skill structure as defined in this report lowskilled jobs are not disappearing many occupations with limited educational requirements are experiencing aboveaverage rates of job growth or substantial increases in

because employers will need to fill vacancies created by departed employees oftentimes members of the education and training community have focused on those occupations expected to grow the most rapidly to urge students to obtain bachelors degree or at the least get postsecondary education that leads to an associates degree or vocational certificate this analysis demonstrates that jobs will continue to be there in abundant numbers for workers with more than high school education that is the report addresses the employment prospects of relatively lowskilled workers in terms of wage prospects however firms have been paying much larger premium than in the past to employees with bachelors degrees22 the substantial widening of the wage gap between more and less educated workers suggests that there is something in addition to the barely perceptible shift toward heightened job skill requirements as measured by educational attainment that has prompted employers to increasingly favor workers with 4year college degree over other workers perhaps firms are more generously rewarding employees who have attained bachelors degrees because they believe this indicates that these workers have the ability to more easily learn competencies that may be added to jobs over time eg using everevolving technologies or to more readily adjust to organizational restructuring eg having attributes that enable them to function well in team environment with so little understanding of why the demand for education is behaving as it is and with discernible shift toward occupations that require higher literacy or education we need to be cautious about predicting the future about all we can say is that in the recent past earnings of college graduates have exceeded earnings of those
