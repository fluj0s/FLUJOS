current jurisdictional split between the us court of federal cla ims and the federal district courts allowing landowners to seek compensation for the impacts of government action and seek invalidation of such action as unlawful in the same court in the senate the judiciary committee reported s 1256 which combined the jurisdictio nenhancing approach of hr 992 with that of hr 1534 passed by the ho
