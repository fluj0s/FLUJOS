how these changes may affect participation this report will not be updated introduction the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 added voluntary prescription drug benefit to medicare and made many changes to the medicarechoice mc program now called medicare advantage ma changes to ma include 1 increased payment rates 2 competition program in 2006 3 the addition of regional plans beginning in 2006 and 4 sixyear comparative cost adjustment program in 2010 that enhances competition between ma plans and requires traditional medicare to compete with ma plans although plan participation is likely to increase due to the increased payments longterm plan participation is unknown prescription drugs mma added voluntary prescription drug benefit to medicare starting in 2006 beneficiaries will have access to drug plan whether they are in traditional feeforservice ffs medicare or enrolled in managed care the prescription drug coverage will be provided through either newly created prescription drug plans or for those beneficiaries in ma medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans managed care congressional research service the library of congress crs2 organizations will be required to offer at least one plan that includes the standard prescription drug benefit or an actuarially equivalent drug benefit but may offer additional plans without drug benefit or with more generous benefit generally organizations offering mapd plans will be required to comply with the rules and procedures required of companies offering prescription drug plan to beneficiaries in the ffs medicare program under the new part d similar rules and procedures will be established for the prescription drug plans and mapd plans with respect to enrollment disenrollment termination coverage periods appeals information dissemination and the procedure of submitting bid for the cost of providing the drug benefit historically medicare managed care plans were able to attract enrollees by offering additional benefits one of the most popular being prescription drugs beneficiaries who enrolled in these plans were willing to accept some of the restrictions of managed care such as limitations on provider choice in order to have the additional benefits beginning in 2006 beneficiaries will be able to get prescription drugs whether they are in traditional ffs medicare or an mapd plan to compete with traditional medicare some plans may redesign their benefit packages to remain attractive to their enrollees for example they may consider adding vision or dental services if they do not already include them httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21761 reducing cost sharing or enhancing the prescription drug benefit in 2004 36 of medicare advantage enrollees are enrolled in plan that includes prescription drugs with additional premium1 these plans are providing prescription drug coverage to enrollees because their cost of providing all benefits covered by medicare under hospital insurance part and supplementary medical insurance part b is less than the current payment rate starting in 2006 mapd plans will receive additional money from medicare to pay for the prescription drug benefit if plan can continue to provide the standard part and b benefits at lower cost ie if its bid for covering part and b benefits is less than the benchmark explained in more detail below then it can provide other additional benefits with some of the savings that might in previous years have gone towards providing prescription drugs what can plans do to compete with traditional ffs medicare managed care organizations will be allowed to make their plans more attractive to beneficiaries by reducing outofpocket expenses copayments for part and part b benefits the premium for part b coverage or the premium for the prescription drug coverage or by adding benefits such as eyeglasses and earing aids plans may also add additional drug coverage beyond the basic medicare benefit but there is disincentive for them to do this once an enrollee reaches the annual outofpocket threshold for catastrophic drug coverage 3600 in 2006 which would be reached with 5100 in total drug spending under standard plan medicare provides reinsurance paying the plan portion of the enrollees additional drug costs third party payments including ma payments do not count toward the beneficiarys outofpocket threshold additional drug coverage would reduce the enrollees outofpocket expenses so that fewer enrollees would reach the out ofpocket threshold and those who did would reach it later in the year the additional coverage would thus reduce the money plan would receive from medicare 1 centers for medicare and medicaid services personal communication jan 2004 crs3 alternatively plans may decide to add or enhance drug benefit in 2004 to increase enrollment and gain competitive advantage in the managed care market prior to the beginning of the medicare drug benefit in 2006 some plans have enhanced their drug benefits for 2004 as discussed below plans may also offer medicareendorsed drug discount cards to their own enrollees through the newly established drug discount card program under mma the cards could provide discounts on drug prices even if the plan does not have drug benefit or if the plan benefit cap is reached2 beneficiaries who enroll in plan in 2004 may be more likely to remain with the plan when the medicare drug benefit is added to the program in 2006 payment rate changes for 2004 mma changed the payment rate calculation for medicare managed care plans resulting in increased payment rates for all counties3 previously plans received the highest of three possible rates floor rate minimum increase above the previous years rate or blend of local and national rates subject to budget neutrality provision4 mma made three major changes to the payment formula for 2004 all designed to increase payment rates first fourth payment type was added 100 of per httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21761 capita feeforservice medicare costs5 second the budget neutrality adjustment was eliminated allowing blend payment to be paid when it is the highest of the four rates even when that would increase total expenditures the blend payment uses combination of local and national rates and is designed to reduce variance in payments across counties third the minimum increase was changed from 2 increase above the previous years rate to the greater of 2 or the percentage by which per capita medicare expenditures grew nationally in the previous year in 2005 and beyond payments will be annually updated by the new minimum increase or at the secretarys discretion but at least once every three years the higher of either the new minimum increase or 100 of the updated rebased ffs per capita payment payment rate increases beginning in march 2004 vary from county to county the average increase weighted by the number of enrollees relative to the 2003 rate is 108 the smallest increase for the same period is approximately 63 approximately 94 of enrollees live in counties where the increase is 20 or less small number of plans will receive increases of more than 45 the higher payment rates may encourage organizations to stay in medicare and may attract other organizations increasing 2 see httpwwwcmshhsgovdiscountdrugsoverviewasp 3 for 2004 the centers for medicare and medicaid services updated the national growth percentage to reflect adjustments for prior years overunder estimates and the impact of mma the update increased the floor payments even though they were not explicitly changed by mma 4 for more detailed discussion of payments under the mc program see crs report rl30587 medicarechoice payments by hinda ripps chaikind and paulette morgan 5 per capita ffs payment would be adjusted to 1 include risk adjustment 2 remove payments for direct medical education costs and 3 include the additional payments that would have been made if medicare beneficiaries entitled to benefits from the department of veterans affairs va and the department of defense dod had not used those services risk adjustment is method of controlling for the variation in the cost of providing health care among beneficiaries cms is currently unable to obtain the data it needs to properly adjust for va and dod benefits crs4 competitive pressures on existing plans it may also encourage plans to expand their service areas approximately 21 of counties not currently served by managed care plan qualify for an average payment increase of 15 or greater for six consecutive years private plans have withdrawn from medicare or reduced their service areas citing low payment rates as the primary cause cms indicates that plans are using the increases to 2004 payments to 1 strengthen provider networks with 43 of the funds 2 reduce premiums with 31 of the funds 3 enhance benefits including prescription drug cards with 17 of the funds and 4 reduce cost sharing with 5 of the funds five percent of the additional funds are being held in the stabilization fund for use before the end of 2005 competition program starting in 2006 until 2006 organizations participating in medicare managed care must submit to cms an estimate of the cost of providing part and b benefits to the average beneficiary this estimate is called an adjusted community rate acr proposal and it is submitted each year for each plan the organization offers the acr is compared to the payment the plan would receive for serving beneficiaries if the payment is larger than the cost of serving beneficiaries the plan is required to return the full amount of the difference to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21761 beneficiary in the form of additional benefits reduced costsharing or reduction in the part b premium the organization may also save the difference in stabilization fund to defray future costs starting in 2006 plans will longer file acrs instead their estimate of the cost of providing benefits to beneficiaries will be called bid the bid will be compared to per capita benchmark for the area that is similar to payment rate prior to 2006 if the benchmark is higher than the bid the plans must return 75 of the difference to the beneficiaries in the form of reduced costsharing for part and b benefits additional ma benefits or credit towards any monthly ma premium prescription drug premium or part b premium if the bid is above the benchmark medicare will pay the plan the benchmark and the beneficiary will pay the difference between the bid and the benchmark the bid portion of the competition program starting in 2006 differs from the acr process in two ways first mma grants the secretary the authority to negotiate plan bids second prior to 2006 plans return 100 of the difference to beneficiaries if the payment exceeds the acr after 2006 plans will return only 75 of the difference if the benchmark exceeds the bid and the remaining 25 will be returned to the government as savings it is unclear whether the secretarys ability to negotiate will have an impact on plans currently in medicare it is also unclear whether returning 25 of plan savings to the government instead of providing that amount to the beneficiary will have an effect on plans some observers expect plan bids to be close to the benchmark with little savings returned to either the beneficiary or the government others including the congressional budget office estimate plan bids will be below the benchmarks resulting in savings for both beneficiaries and the government sharing savings with the government could result in plans providing less generous supplemental benefits than they otherwise would have which could make it more difficult to compete with traditional medicare crs5 it is possible that the bid process may be less burdensome than the acr process though that will depend on details of how the implementing regulations are written the acr process in effect until 2006 requires comparison that is not required in the bid under the medicarechoice program plans are not allowed to earn higher return from their medicare business than their commercial market one section in the acr requires calculation of the plans expected returns from providing medicarecovered benefits to medicare beneficiaries versus providing the same benefits to their nonmedicare business such calculation is required under the bid process beginning in 2006 regional plans starting in 2006 private plans participating in medicare specify the areas they want to serve they define their service areas as sets of counties and county parts starting in 2006 plans will be encouraged but not required to serve entire regions designated by the secretary as part of new regional program the regional program is designed to encourage plans specifically preferred provider organizations ppos to serve areas they had not previously served particularly rural areas in an effort to make medicare managed care more closely resemble the federal employees health benefits program fehbp plan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21761 participating in the new regional program will 1 have network of providers who agree to contractually specified reimbursement for covered benefits 2 provide for reimbursement for all covered benefits regardless of whether the benefits are provided within the network and 3 serve one or more regions the secretary will establish between 10 and 50 regions throughout the country based on analyses of current insurance markets plans offered in the regional program will be called ma regional plans while nonregional plans will be called ma local plans an ma regional plan may choose to serve more than one region or may serve the entire nation but it can not segment its service area to offer different benefits or cost sharing requirements to beneficiaries within the same region in addition to the difference in service areas ma regional plans will differ from ma local plans in 1 benefit package 2 access to risksharing arrangements and incentive payments and 3 potential additional payments to hospitals that join managed care networks first the benefit package for ma regional plans must include single deductible for part and b services and it must include catastrophic limit on expenditures the conference report for mma hrept 108391 indicates these requirements will make the regional plans more closely resemble the private plans for the under65 population the amount of the catastrophic limit is not specified in the law second to encourage plans to participate in the regional program and serve areas they have not previously chosen to serve medicare will initially share risk with ma regional plans in 2006 and 2007 if plans costs fall outside of specified range or risk corridor plans will assume only portion of the risk for unexpected high costs and plans will be required to return portion of the savings to medicare for unexpected low costs another incentive to participate in the regional program is stabilization fund that can be used to encourage plans to serve one or all regions or to encourage plans to stay in regions they might otherwise leave initially 10 billion will be available to the fund but additional funds will be available from any savings from regional plans with bids below the regional benchmark third since establishing networks can be difficult in lesspopulated areas mma includes provision whereby hospitals can receive payment from cms to join an ma regional plans network if the hospital can prove that the costs of serving the crs6 plans enrollees exceed the medicare part payment in such cases the plan must also pay the hospital at least the medicare part payment for services provided to enrollees what does this mean for plans currently in medicare all areas of the country will be part of region in the regional program including areas currently served by local ma plans it is unclear whether the incentives to participate in the regional program will be 1 enough to encourage plans to participate or 2 so great that regional plans can offer more generous benefits than local ma plans and attract beneficiaries away from the local plans within the region moreover some plans may choose to participate in the regional program in addition to or instead of participating as local ma plans how local ma plans react to the regional program will be based on business decisions about risk profit and competition comparative cost adjustment starting in 2010 the secretary is to establish sixyear comparative cost adjustment cca program beginning on january 1 2010 and ending on december 31 2015 the cca program is designed to enhance competition between local private plans in the medicare program and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21761 to compare the overall efficiency of these plans with respect to traditional medicare ma plans in cca area can only be local plans as regional plans can not participate in the program an area can qualify for the program if it is metropolitan statistical area msa with at least two ma organizations and has at least 25 of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in ma local plans of those msas that qualify more than 6 areas or 25 of the areas that meet the requirements will participate there are two major differences between comparative cost adjustment areas and non cca areas first in cca area payments to local ma plans will be based on competitive bids similar to payments for the regional ma plans the benchmark that is compared to each plans bid is not strictly an increase over the previous years benchmark as in noncca areas but rather weighted average of plan bids and the cost of traditional ffs medicare in an area there is fiveyear phasein of cca benchmarks second in cca area traditional medicare will compete with local ma plans while ffs beneficiaries in noncca areas will continue to pay the standard medicare part b premium beneficiaries in cca areas could have their part b premium either increased or decreased ffs beneficiaries in cca areas would pay higher part b premiums if the cost of providing the standard medicare benefit package was more expensive in ffs than the cost in the local ma plans conversely ffs beneficiaries in cca area would paid lower part b premiums if the ffs costs are less expensive the ma costs the premium is phasedin over five years and additionally cannot exceed 105 of what it would have been for beneficiaries in the cca area proponents of the cca program anticipate that competition in cca areas would decrease costs to the medicare program perhaps through such strategies as steeper negotiations with providers or more attention to disease management opponents of the cca program argue that beneficiaries who want to remain in traditional medicare may be financially penalized with increased part b premiums
