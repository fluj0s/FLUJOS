6201c16 shspec100 nature of withholds we are not trying to teach you not to have withholds it is ok not to do everything that occurs to you good or bad we are trying to get you out of the tangle you got yourself into what do you mean having such terrible impulses why does the pc have these impulses that he now has to withhold the withhold is that area of motionlessness following that area of doingness which you shouldnt have done this classifies actions into things you should have done and things you shouldnt have done of course there are laudable withholds eg not to have gotten angry or done some overt laudable withhold is something society expects of you providing you have these other impulses to do things you shouldnt according to society so all actions divide into laudable and undesirable laudable withhold goes with an undesirable action withholding self from doing it and the laudable action goes along with an undesirable withhold so society can always enforce mores by making some actions and some withholds laudable but since there are so many groups whose mores conflict one can get rather confused the same action in different times or places can be good or bad there is action that is good in all times and places and there is withhold that should be withheld at all times and places it all depends on viewpoint when sec checking we must then be dealing with another factor people compute that good people withhold more than bad people so the gooder you are the less you communicate so the goodest people are in cemeteries we must be doing something other than pulling withholds we are we are remedying the compulsion or obsession to commit actions that have to be withheld sec checking is to remedy unreasonable action thats all what you want to rehabilitate is his ability to determine his own actions this also rehabilitates his communication as well as covering whatever mores he will wind up with control of communication downgrades into mest as control of reach communication is the ability to control an outflow or inflow or stop it this downgrades into control of reach where you have person who is unable to leave his house the trouble is not the house but picadilly circus the pc is afraid that someday he will be in picadilly circus and take off all his clothes but he has forgotten this all he knows is that he mustnt leave home he has occluded the overt and the withhold the mechanism is that the pc can be so worried about taking his clothes off in picadilly circus that he will think of nothing but withholding this this circumscribes his life considerably this is the mechanism of phobias having to remember to do some desirable action is similar attention trap eg the superstitions that kids get into if we educated the same man never to outflow and never to withhold either both equally balanced we would have an insane ridge he would get stuck in an inaction because he would forget what he wasnt supposed to do and what he was withholding he would have covered overt and covered withhold and be motionless in some sphere he would not be free to communicate because he couldnt find out what the desirable action was the average person is in this condition he doesnt know what he must reach and what he must withhold but the habit pattern of caution stays with him all psychoanalysis trained people to be was cautious someone with an enforced outflow has similar problem he must go or do or whatever without knowing why in order to restore control over ones reach not reach be reached not be reached one must get these unknowingnesses out of the road or the person will sometimes be nervous to the point of collapse when you ask them to do something or other in order to aberrate somebody establish compulsion to reach or to withdraw withhold as an absolute necessity then shift them in time and place to produce necessity for this so they forget it make an unknowingness out of it all do this several hundred thousand times and the person will start to feel he didnt know what he should be doing when person gets very bad off any decision to act causes him to withhold and vice versa government programs are good examples of this some people are totally susceptible to any inflowing action of any kind anything that happens to them in society causes them to have an instant reaction to have that with them in assessing such pcs if the auditor suggests some item they will take it even if they are assessed by an auditor with degree of altitude they will hold like briars to whatever is found right or wrong you can test such an item by getting in suppress inval and eval on the item and see if it is still in the average person is on gradient scale of this sort of thing he sees few things which restimulate him and put him on total effect basis the only thing wrong with that total effect basis is that person has command over his reach and withdraw so he is not master of his actions and cant be sensible about what he does iq is ones ability to govern ones environment scientology is almost alone in considering that man should have any selfdeterminism because others falling short of this have looked on the fact that criminal has compulsion to commit crimes being unable to do anything for criminal they think the only answer is to make the criminal withhold his crimes harder that philosophy doesnt work you can compel someone not to do something to the point where he can do nothing else he withholds so far that the withhold fails and it becomes compulsion that is the danger of the philosophy that the more good withholds we have the better off we are the basis of action in human beings is 1 he doesnt know what his compulsive actions are so he doesnt know what he is withholding notknowingness is the common denominator of all ows that are operative on the individual 2 the halfknowns that arise in sec checking where the pc knows and you dont are also source of trouble withholds are half know if the pc knows something that is not enough the auditor has to know it too the pc will get upset if you go on notknowing about it when he knows the halfknow is very uncomfortable it wont duplicate so it wont blow so it is an upsetting thing to have the withholds dont have to be serious in session they can be very trivial bits of noncommunication which multiply they are relatively unknown to the pc as they drift by an invalidation often betokens withhold so check for inval and withhold to keep the ruds in and the needle clean during sec checks and assessments withhold is the common denominator of every out rudiment the only exception is where you are running the session for forms sake and not for the pc where you are not auditing the pc who is in front of you where you have disobeyed the auditors code through not being in communication with the pc and have set up an unintentional withhold for the pc throughout the whole session the pc who cannot talk to the auditor because the auditor is not really there is on an unintentional withhold which still causes an arc break you must run the session for the pc the pc owns the session almost all breakage amongst children is due to their being put on an unintentional withhold all withholds must contain an intention to communicate the intention to reach must exist before withhold can occur there must have been an intention to communicate before there is an arc break therefore pc being audited by someone who is out of comm with him will arc break remember that every session you run is for that pc and by the auditor and for one else in training you could get auditors to make long list of all the reasons why they were running session you are liable to get fabulous things not including that it is for the pc it is the pc who owns the session not the auditor if you master that point you will overcome most of your difficulties with auditing and any distaste you might have for it if pc feels that he cant comm to the auditor this equates to the fact that he must be withholding this restimulates other withholds of undesirable action the restimulated withhold may be failed withhold which brings about obsessive action at once and the pc finds himself in the godawful position of engaging in actions he knows are reprehensible and incapable of stopping himself from acting he wonders how he got in this position as he berates the auditor he feels bad about the fact that he is doing these actions while he is doing them so you by letting him have session withhold are likely to get him into this weird action which amazes him most of all tr0 and tr4 are the most important trs from the standpoint of getting and keeping the pc in session tr0 is important from the auditors viewpoint tr4 from the pcs the way to handle tr4 is to be sure that it is the pcs session just give him the session in sec checking you are trying to discover the actions that are considered undesirable by the pc and the withholds that restrain them you get off the withhold by blowing the prior confusion when you are sec checking you are on the business of the prior confusion and the motionless point the prior confusion is the overt the stable datum is the withhold the anatomy of withhold is 1 done undesirable action 2 stop undesirable action 3 natter the guy cant reach and he cant withhold but he can natter when you have the withhold you have the motionless point but you must get the prior confusion you must get what the flowed since this pc is the one who is there being audited this is why you must get the done in pulling withhold use the critical statement to find the overt but dont pull the unkind thought pull the overt underlying it this overt is what gives you sort of motor action natter is not necessarily motivatorish to get the charge off step 2 above you can ask the pc have you ever done that since the pc will think you are asking for more overts but in fact you are getting him to spot whether he has been withholding himself from doing it ever since he will be relieved when that withhold is off because the stress of maintaining the withhold is relieved he can feel uncomfortable just getting off the fact of having done some undesirable action because you have unstrapped some of the restraint against doing it again he wont feel relief from the session because the full extent of the withhold isnt off yet so ask the above question the pc may not be entirely happy about giving up the withhold doing this may trigger off ways he was restraining himself without getting the overt he may be afraid to get all the withhold off because he might do the action so make it rule always to find the overt also ask for other times he did it and didnt do it get all
