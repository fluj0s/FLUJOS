introduction new regulations on livestock grazing on lands managed by the bureau of land management in the department of the interior1 became effective august 21 19952 the regulations were controversial in several respects supporters contended that the new rules were step forward toward sound res ource and rangeland management but that they should have provided more pr otection many others opposed the new rules believing they reduced the scope and security of grazing rights and would result in increased operating costs and ultimately reduce private livestock activity on federal lands the new regulations and litigation raised fundamental issues as to th proper interpretation of the relevant statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20453crs2 3 929 f supp 1436 d wyo 1996 4 public lands

of the new regulations were challenged in public lands council v babbitt case known as the brimmer decision for judge br immer who decided it3 the case was challenge to the regulations on their face as opposed to as applied in particular instance procedural posture that imposed the burden on plaintiffs to show that there were circumstances in which the re gulations would be valid on june 12 1996 the federal district court upheld the new regulations re lating to permittee and lessee affiliates 3year temporar nonuse and nonexclusive use of waterrelated range improvements but struck down several others the district court upheld the constitutionality of the regulations in two respects finding that 1 the regulation on suspension or cancellation of grazing permit or lease if permittee or lessee is convicted of violating certain environm ental laws does not violate th double jeopardy clause of the constitution and 2 the regulation imposing surcharge on permittee if the permittee allows livestock not owned by him or hi s children to graze on public lands does not violate due process the di strict court also upheld the governments processing of comments on and its adoption of the rangeland management standards called fundamentals of rangeland h ealth and determined that the final environmental impact statement that accompanied the final regulations was adequate the district court struck down the new bl m regulations that 1 separated grazing preference priority to receive pe rmit from permitted useanimal unit months aums allowed on an allotment 2 required the titling of permanent structural range improvements in the name of the united states 3 eliminated the requirement that permittee be engaged in the livestock business and 4 allowed conservation use that excludes livestock grazing for the full term of grazing permit the district court affirmed in part th secretarys decision to implement the 1995 regulations and reversed in part enjoining the secretary from enforcing the regulations the court set aside the 10th circuit court of appeals review ed the district courts decision novo4 because the case was facial challenge to the regulations the court could not set aside any agency action unless it was arbitrary capri cious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law or was in excess of statutory jurisdiction authority or limitations or short of statutory right5 using this standard th tenth circuit upheld all of the regulations except the one allowing conservation use the united states did not appeal that part of the ruling the public lands council again appeal ed the other aspectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20453crs3 6 public lands council v babbitt 529 us 728 2000 7 act of june 28 1934 ch 865 48 st at 1269 codified

is land or water owned or controlled by an applicant that can serve as base for livestock operation that uses public lands 10 43 cfr 410005 1994 11 see 43 cfr 411021 through 23 1994 43 cfr 411022 stated that grazing preference shall be specified in all grazing perm its or grazing leases and include both active use and suspended use active use was to be based on the amount of forage available as established in the land use plan the grazing preference was attached to the base property supporting the grazing permitsupreme cour t decision6 grazing preference the most fundamental issues related to the redefinition in the new regulations of grazing preference the regulations separated the concepts of 1 priority of preference and 2 amount of pe rmitted grazing use the district court had found that the secretarys action in changi ng the regulations failed to adequately safeguard adjudicated grazing preferences and that the 1995 regulations lacked reasoned basis in this regar d the appellate court reve rsed and the supreme court affirmed the appellate court the supreme court reviewed th history of the use of the federal rangelands and the purposes intent and language of the taylor grazing act tga7 and subsequent enactments the enactment of the tga in 1934 was turning point for the federal rangelands which went from being grazed as commons areas to system of allotments grazed by particular permittees the cour t noted that the tga was enacted in response to the deterioration of the rangelands and the goals of the act were to stop injury to the lands to provide for their use improvement and development and to stabilize the livestock industry dependent on the public range8 after enactment of the tga the department prioritized the many applications for grazing authorizations based on statutory and other factors related to base property9 giving highest priority to applicants who both had base property and had grazed the public range during the five years before the enactment of the tga the carrying capac ity for areas of the federal rangelands was established and allocated among the top priority applicants the two concepts of priority of preference and amount of allocated permitted use became known as the grazing preference afforded individual ranchers the pre1995 regulations defined the term grazing preference to mean the total number of animal unit months aums of livestock grazing on the federal lands allo cated to qualifying ba property owned or controlled by the permittee or lessee10 this number of aums could include active use the total number of animals authorized to graze and suspended use which were potential aums not currently being grazed11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20453crs4 12 43 cfr 410005 1996 13 id 14 43 cf r 41302e3 15 43 usc 315b requires that so far as consis tent with the purposes and provisions of this subchapter grazing privileges recognized and acknowledged shall be adequately safeguarded but the creation of grazing distri ct or the issuance of permit pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall not create any right title intere st or estate in or to the lands although not quoted by the court the 1938 regulations discu ss the elements of preference in the sense of priority among applicants the rating and classifi cation of base property and also address the rating and classification of the availabl federal range 43 cfr 5015a 1939 states carrying capacity seasons and maximum annual period of use for the purpose of determining what use of the federal range will be most consistent with conservation purposes the carrying capacity of each administrative unit or area in grazing district will be rated and each will be classified for the proper season or seasons if necessary of its use and for the maximum period of time for which any licensee or permittee will be allowed to use the federal range lying therein during any 1 year emphasis added this ca rrying capacity then was allocated among the top priority applicants as far as was available 16 slip opinion at 67the new regulations define grazing pref erence as the priority position vis vis others for the purpose of receivi ng grazing permit or lease12 the authorized number of aums is now provided by the term permitted use which is defined as the forage expressed in aums allocated by or under th guidance of an applicable land use plan for livestock grazing in an llotment under permit or lease13 as before permitted use could encompass active and suspended use is specified in permits is attached to base property and is basically transferable with the base property as before an existing permittee is given first priority for ne w permit upon acceptance of any new terms and conditions14 plaintiffs saw the changes as significant claiming that the security of their historical adjudicated preferences in rms of numbers of aums was lost although the granting of grazing privileges was discretionary the tga directed that privileges be adequately safeguarded the district court found that the new regulations on permitted use eliminated right of permittees to graze predictable numbers of stock from permit to permit and that by eliminating this right the secretary n ecessarily failed to adequately safeguard grazing rights15 the dissent at the appellate level agreed emphasizing that in practice the original adjudicated amounts we re essentially re newed from permit to permit and gave more stability to the ranchers than is true under the new regulations and that this change would destabilize the livesto ck industry result contrary to purpose of the tga however the majority at the appellate level and the supreme court held to the contrary the supreme court noted that under the tga grazing was to be allowed only to the extent consistent with the purposes of the tga and that grazing regulations had consistently provided since 1937 that pe rmits could be modified or cancelled16 i n addition the court noted that congress had enacted several stat utes since the tgahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20453crs5 17 pub l 94579 90 stat 2744 18 43 usc 1701a2 1712 19 43 cfr 41101 1994notably the federal land policy nd management act of 1976 flpma17 which left the tga in effect but also expanded the other r ecognized uses of the public lands provided for land use planning and provided new management authorities and duties to further protect the lands more specifically the new regulation refers to forage allocated under the guidance of an applicable land use pla n ranchers were c oncerned that this language reduced the security of their privileges because such pl ans were easily changed the court found the ranchers position unpersuasive fo r three reasons first the tga qualifies the duty of the secretary to safeguard grazing privileges by re quiring that duty to be exercised consistent with the goals of the act therefore the ranchers interest in permit stability cannot be absolute and the secretary may reasonably determine how and the extent to which grazing privileges shall be safeguarded furthermore congress itself directed the development of land use plans and their use in the allocation process in order to preserve improve and develop th public rangelands18 second the pre1995 system did not offer ra nchers anything like absolute security because the secretary had long had the disc retion to cancel or modify permits or to remove lands from grazing in accordance with nd use plans and to direct the use of the lands for purposes other than grazing stly the new regulations do not automatically bring about selfexecuting change that would significantly diminish the security of granted grazing privileges although the new definitions seem to tie grazing more explicitly to landuse plans the secretary s had that authority since 1976 yet the court noted not single example was provided in which interaction of plan and grazing permit jeopardized security also the court noted affected permit holders remain free to challenge effects on particular grazing privileges as the regulations are applied justice oconnor in concurring opinion joined in by j thomas reiterated this point requiring permittees to be engaged in the livestock business the district court had found that new regulation19 eliminating the requirement that permittee be engaged in the livestock business lacked reasoned basis violated the taylor grazing act and frustrated its purposes the appella court disagreed concluding that even nonlivestock owners could qualify for permits however the language of 43 usc 315b mentions ttlers residents and other stock owners in authorizing the secretary to issue or cause to be issued permits to graz livestock on such grazing districts to such bona fide settlers residents and other stoc k owners as under his rules and regulations are entitled to participate in the use of the range preference shall be given in the issuance of grazing permits to those with in or near district who are landowners engaged in the livestock business bona fide occupants or settlers or owners of water or water rights as may be necessary to permit the proper use of lands water or water rights owned occupied or leased by them httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20453crs6 20 the court emphasized this phrase at 745 21 43 cfr 41101 1994 22 529 us at 747748 23 529 us at 750the supreme court upheld the new regula tion since in the courts view the regulation merely failed to repeat statutory language that nonetheless pertains the court noted that the statutory language limits the s ecretarys authority to issue permits to bona fide settlers residents and other stock owners 20 with persons in the livestock business continuing to enjoy preference in the issu ance of grazing permits therefore even if some stock owners who might own only few head of stock might apply for permit applicants who are in the livestock business would have preferred status the court also noted that the regulations prohibit failure to make substantial grazing use as authorized for 2 consecutive fee years w ith cancellation of the permit as possible remedy21 under other regulations even if temporary nonuse is approved for one permittee the secretary may allocate the forage to the use of another permittee therefore the court concluded that the new regulations do not undermine the tgas requirement that permits be to graze livestock22 titling of permanent range improvements the last challenge was to the new regulations that require that title to all new permanent range improvements developed under cooperative agreement be in the na of the united states change from previous regulations the ranchers argued th at this change violated tga language in 43 usc 315c that provides for compensati on of permittee for improvements owned by the permittee when new occupant grazes an allotment the secretary argued that because the tga gives him the power to authorize improvement he so has the lesser power to set the terms of ow nership and the statutory language refers to payment of compensation if ownership is allowed the court held that nothing in the statute prevented the secretary from setting the terms of title to range improvements and that nothing in the statute or regulations prevents permittee from negotiating compensation for work done on improvements either from the government or from subsequent permittees23
