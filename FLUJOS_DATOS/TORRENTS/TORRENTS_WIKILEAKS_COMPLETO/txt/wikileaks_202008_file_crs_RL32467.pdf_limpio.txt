reimbursements eligible individuals can establish and fund these accounts when they have qualifying hi gh deductible health plan at least 1000 for single and 2000 fo r family coverage and other health insurance with some exceptions the accounts have tax advantages that can be significant contributions are deductible w ithdrawals used for medical expenses are not taxed and account earnings are taxex empt unused balances may accumulate without limit hsas were authorized in november 2003 by the medicare prescription drug improve ment and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 three other taxadvantaged accounts to pay for unreimbursed health care have existed for some time archer medi cal savings accounts msas and two employeroffered arrangements health re imbursement accounts hras and health care flexible spending accounts fsas when coupled with highdeductible health insurance these accounts are pa rt of what some call cons umerdriven health plans these plans have been spurred largely by employers anxious to moderate premium increases they also have emerged in res ponse to utilization cont rols of managed care and as way to encourage effective care the effectiveness of consumerdriven health plans depends on the way high deductible insurance and the savings accounts are structured and interact how high deductible insurance affects the cost and quality of care depends on the availability of information competition among health care providers and c onsumers sensitivity to prices how savings accounts affect th outcomes depends on contributions and accumulations and whether accounts are cons idered to be savings or insurance burgeoning market has developed to offer hsas and qualifying high deductible health plans the first providers were niche insurance companies that had offered msa plans but now prominent insu rance companies are also offering hsa products some which may be available nationwide hsas have elicited widespread interest among large employers already ffering hras or other high deductible insurance and small employers whose owne rs would like readily available product that pays unreimbursed medical bills with significant tax advantages employers can also save employment ta xes on account contributions there is some evidence though rigor ous studies that hras reduce health care spending and hsas may have similar effects even so the majority of health care expenditures are for catastrophic costs and it is not obvious how either hras or hsas will affect those hsas might result in adverse selection among insurance plans which could increase insurance costs for people with the highest health care needs however employers have stra tegies for dealing with this problem this report will be updated as more information b ecomes available and for legislative activity the presidents fy2006 budget included several proposals to increase the attractiveness and availability of hsashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467 contents p r i n c i p l r u l s

i s l t i n3 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467health savings accounts health savings accounts hsas are new way that people can pay for unreimbursed medical expenses such as deductibles copaymen ts and services not covered by insurance eligible indivi duals can establish and fund these accounts when they have qualifying high deductible health plan insurance with deductible of at least 1000 for selfonly coverage and 2000 for family coverage plus other criteria and other health plan with some exceptions hsas carry tax advantages that can be significant for some people contributions are deductible or excluded from income that is taxable if made by employers withdrawals are not taxed if used for medical expenses and account earnings are taxexempt unused balances may accumulate without limit hsas were first authorized in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma p l 108173 however taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses have ex isted for some time flexible spending accounts fsas which many employees can use began spreading in the 1980s once the internal revenue service irs established clear guidelines archer medical savings accounts msas precursor of hsas became available for limited number of people starting in 1997 health reimbursement ccounts hras made available by some employers were appr oved for taxexempt status in 2002 when coupled with highdeductible health insura nce these accounts are part of what some call consumerdriven health plans like these other accounts hsas have veral objectives one is to encourage individuals and families to set money aside for their health care expenses another is to give them financial incentive for spending health care dollars prudently still another goal is to give them the means to pay for health care services of their own choosing without constraint by insurers or employers since hsas are new the extent to which they will further these objectives is not yet known among other things it remain s to be seen how many people will establish accounts how much they will cont ribute to them and how much they will carry over to subsequent years their eff ect on health care use is largely speculative as is their effect on insurance and health care costs however many individuals and employers are interested in hsas and in formation about them is likely to emerge quickly the federal government began ffering hsa products to its employees in 2005 this report has five parts it begins with summary of the principal rules governing hsas covering such matters as eligibility qualifying health insurance contributions and withdrawals the report then compares hsas to the other types of taxadvantaged accounts ntioned above third it pr esents data on availability and use of hsa plans products that comb ine both the hsa and the associated healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs2 1 irs notice 20042 dec 22 2003 irs notice 200423 notice 200425 rev proc 2004 22 rev rul 200438

might spread fourth it discusses hsa plans in the context of what are called consumerdriven health plans finally there is discussion of several issues including the effect of hsa plans on adverse selection the number of uninsur ed and health care spending and an overview of legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses this report will be upda ted and expanded to re flect substantial new developments and analyses principal rules regarding hsas rules governing hsas are laid out pr imarily in section 1201 of the medicare prescription drug improve ment and modernization act of 2003 and guidance issued by the irs the latter include s guidance issued on december 22 2003 march 30 2004 may 11 2004 june 18 2004 august 9 2004 and january 12 20051 other guidance may be released in the future hsas are affected by other rules as we ll for example section 213d of the internal revenue code governs whethe r an expenditure is qualified medical expense aside from exceptions pertaining to the purchase of health insurance the hsa statute and guidance do not change these rules similarly whether hsa arrangements are covered by privacy rules is governed by the health insurance portability and accountability act and prev iously existing definitions regarding group health plans this part of the report summarizes the principal rules regarding hsas it does not provide all deta ils or cite supporting documenta tion further information about hsa requirements might be obtained by referri ng to the original source material cited above to irs and other gove rnment publications or to growing body of secondary analyses what is an hsa an hsa is taxexempt trust or cu stodial account established for paying qualified medical expenses of the account be neficiary accounts may be established with banks and insurance companies or with other entities approved by the irs to hold individual retirement accounts iras or msas in addition other entities may request approval to be an hsa trustee or custodianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs3 2 individuals should be able to find out from their insurer whether their hdhp is qualifying coverage they need not apply to the irs or other government agency for determination 3 individuals remain eligible to establish and contribute to hsas after becoming entitled to medicare provided they do not enro ll in either part or part binsurance companies that offer qualifie d high deductible health plans hdhps often also establish hsas for the policy holders however there is federal requirement that hsas be established by the entity that provides the health plan individuals interested in establishing an hsa must locate an entity that accepts the accounts they cannot simply deem an ordinary savings account to be an hsa who may have an hsa individuals are eligible to establish and contribute to an hsa if they have qualifying hdhp and disqualifying cove rage as discussed under the next two headings whether someone has qualifying hdhp is determined as of the first of each month thus person might be eligible to contribute to an hsa in some months but not others2 for example if someone firs t enrolled in an hdhp on september 15 their hsa eligibility period would be gin on october 1 of that year individuals cannot be enrolled in medicar form of disqualifying coverage which generally occurs at age 653 they cannot have received veterans administration medical benefits another form of disqualifying coverage within the past three months individuals are not eligible if they ma be claimed as dependent on another persons tax return tax depe ndency is determined on early basis this might not be known until the end of the year individuals may keep their hsas once they become ineligible thus individuals do not lose their hsa or the right to access it by turning age 65 or by obtaining insurance with low deductib however they could not make contributions until they become eligible once again individual members of family may ve their own hsas provided they each meet the eligibility rules just described they can also be covered through the hsa of someone else in the family for example husband may use his hsa to pay expenses of his spouse even though she has her own hsa individuals may have mo re than one hsa account what is qualif ying health plan health plan must meet several tests to be qualified it must have deductible above certain minimum vel and it must limit outo fpocket expenditures for covered benefits to more than certain maximum level these two tests are described immediately belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs4 in addition qualifying health plan must provide general coverage substantially all of its coverage cannot be through what the statute calls permitted insurance eg coverage for only particular disease or certain other coverage eg vision care this rule prevents individuals from making hsa contributions when the only insurance they have is high deductible coverage for narrow class of benefits more details on permitted insurance and these other forms of coverage are provided under the heading what is disqualifying coverage minimum deductible for selfonly coverage the annual deductible in 2005 must be at least 1000 for family cove rage it must be at least 2000 these amounts will be adjusted for inflation rounde d to the nearest 50 in future years only usual customary and reasonable charges for covered benefits are taken into account in determining whether deductibles are met premiums are not included in meeting the deductible though copaymen ts may be at the option of the hdhp the minimum deductible requirement does not apply to preventive care the exception is established in the statutory language which does not define the term however irs regulations provide that preventive care includes but is not limited to periodic health evaluations including sts and diagnostic pr ocedures ordered in connection with routine examinations routine prenatal and wellchild care immunizations tobacco cessation programs obesity weightloss programs and various screening services drugs and dications can be included when taken by person who has developed risk factors for disease or to prevent its recurrence in general preventive care does not include services or benefits intended to treat existing illnesses injuries or conditions an exception is allowed when the treatment is incidental to the preventive care service and it would be unreasonable or impracticable to preform another service the irs has ruled that prescription drugs are not exempt from the minimum deductible whether they are included in the high deductible insurance plan or provided separately however in order to allow health plans time to adjust to this requirement the irs delayed its effective date until january 1 2006 similarly the irs has ruled that until january 1 2006 plan may qualify as hdhp even if state law re quires that certain benefi ts be provided without deductible or below the minimum annual deductible prescription or other discount cards do not disqualify individuals from meeting the minimum deductible requirement similarly individuals are not disqualified by coverage under an employee assistance prog ram disease management program or wellness program provided th program does not provide si gnificant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment outofpocket limit for selfonly covera ge the annual limit on outof pocket expenditures for c overed benefits must not exceed 5100 for family policies the limit must not exceed 10200 these am ounts will be adjusted for inflation rounded to the nearest 50 in future yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs5 these limits should not be interprete d as ceilings on all outofpocket expenditures for health care premiums for the hdhp and other insurance would be extra as would payments for benefits not covered by insurance even for covered benefits the limits would apply only to payments for usual customary and reasonable charges on the other hand both deductibles and c opayments must be taken into account in determining whether the limits are exceeded the outofpocket limit rule does not preclude hdhps from imposing reasonable lifetime limits for example 1 million on plan benefits what is disqualifying coverage while covered by qualifying hdhp indivi duals generally must not have other coverage that is not high deductible and that provides c overage for any benefit under their high deductible plan for example individuals with qualifying hdhp are not eligible to establish or contribute to an hsa if they are also covered under spouses low deductible policy for th same benefits if th spouses policy were high deductible the individua l could contribute to his or her own hsa however eligible individuals may have permitted insurance which is insurance under which substantially all c overage relates to liabilities incurred under workers compensation laws tort liabilities or liabilities related to ownership or use of property such as automobile insuran ce insurance for specified disease or illness or insurance that pays fi xed amount per day or other period of hospitalization in addition ligible individuals may have what the legislation calls other coverage through insurance or ot herwise for accidents disability vision care dental care or long term care as mentioned above the per mitted insurance and other coverage described here do not provide the genera l form of coverage to be considered qualifying health plan for purposes of hsa eligibility eligible individuals may also have flexible spending accounts and health reimbursement accounts provided these accounts are for limited purposes for example dental services or preventive care provide reimbursement for services covered by the hdhp only after the qualify ing deductible is met or are used in retirement who may contribute to an hsa contributions to hsas may be made by ligible individuals as well as by other individuals or entities on thei r behalf thus individuals may contribute to accounts of eligible family members and employers may c ontribute to accounts of eligible employees contributions could also be made by state governments contributions by one individual or entity do preclude contributions by others provided they do not exceed annual contribution limits contributors cannot restrict how hsa f unds are to be used for example employers may not limit hsas just to dical expenses even for funds they contribute account owners always can make withdrawals for other purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs6 4 health care flexible spending accounts gene rally are also funded through salary reduction agreements however they have number of restrictions that do not apply to hsas 5 family coverage may have both an overall deductible applying to expenses for all covered members and an embedded deductible applying to expenses for just one covered member continuedthough nonqualified withdrawals are subject to taxation as discussed below in contrast employers can restrict the type s of medical expenses for which flexible spending account may be used when and how may contributions be made to an hsa contributions to hsas may be made at any time during calendar year and until the filing date without extensions for fede ral income tax return s normally april 15 of the following year thus contribu tions could occur over 15½ month time span eg from january 1 2005 through april 15 2006 provided they do not exceed the allowable annual limit described below as with iras contributions to hsas mu st be made in cash contributions of property are not allowed hsa contributions may be made thr ough cafeteria plan salary reduction agreements that is benefit arrangemen ts established by employers under which employees accept lower takehome pay in exchange for the difference being deposited in their account4 the irs has determined that salary reduction agreements must allow employees to stop or increase or decrease their hsa contributions throughout the year as long as the chan ges are effective prospectively however employers may place restrictions on these elections if they apply to all employees the irs has also determined that these agreements allow employers to contribute amounts to cover medical expenses that exceed employees current hsa balances subject to maximum amounts the employees had elected to contribute provided the employees repay the accelerated contributions before the end of the year how much may be contributed to an hsa two types of contributions may be made to hsas regular and catchup both have annual limits that are cal culated on monthly basis for each month during the year when individuals are eligible they may contribute or have others contribute on their behalf up to onetwelfth of the applicable annual limit for example an individual who was eligible fo r seven months could contri bute seventwelfths of the annual limit for that year contributions need not actually occur monthly one contribution can be made for the entire year provided it does not exceed the sum of the allowable monthly limits regular contributions the annual contribution limit for selfonly coverage is 2650 in 2005 or 100 of the insurance deductible whichever is lower the annual limit for family covera ge is 5250 in 2005 100 of the overall deductible or the embedded deductible the deductible applying to one individual multiplied by the number of covered family members whichever of the three is lowest5 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs7 5 continued the health plan would begin to pay benefits once either amount is exceeded to be qualified hdhp the embedded deductible cannot be less than the minimum annual deductible 2000 in 20052650 and 5250 limits will be adjusted for inflation rounded to the nearest 50 in future years in the case of married couple if one spouse has family insurance coverage both will be treated as if they have only that coverage the monthly contribution limit will be divided equally between them unle ss they agree on different division if both spouses have family coverage the jo int contribution limit will be the least of 5250 the lower of the two overall deductib limits or the lower of the two embedded deductibles multiplied by the number of covered family members catchup contributions these contributions ma be made by individuals who are at least 55 years of age but not ye t eligible for medicare in 2005 they may contribute an additional 600 the annua l catchup amount will increase by 100 each year through 2009 when it will be 1000 these amounts are not indexed for inflation rollovers account owners may rollover ba lances from one hsa to another without being restricted by the annual contribution l imits or affecting new contributions if the owner withdraws f unds and deposits them in another account only one rollover is allowed each year deposits must be made within 60 days in order for the transfer to be considered ro llover if instead an hsa trustee transfers funds to another there is limit on the number of rollovers allowed each year hsa trustees are not obligated to accept either owner or trustee rollovers interaction with msas the annual limitations just described are reduced by the amount of any contribution individuals make to their msas in the same year individuals are permitted to rollover msa balances to their health savings accounts rollovers are not taken into account for purposes of the annual limits on hsa contributions rollovers are not permitted from health reimbursement accounts or health care fl exible spending accounts excess contributions contributions exceeding annual limits might occur for number of reasons including failure of employees to take account of employer contributions early deposits that incorrectly anticipated continuing eligibility and mathematical errors if an excess contribution and any earnings on it are withdrawn by the filing date without extensions for the federal income tax return for the year the individual will not be subject to penalty otherwise the excess contribution will be subject to 6 excise tax each year until it is withdrawnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs8 6 the comparability requirement is in section 4980g of the internal revenue code which references rules for msas in section 4980e 7 if an individual is selfemployed contribu tions are not taken into account in determining net income from selfemployment as consequence they are not exempt from social security and medicare taxes 8 qualified medical expenses are described generally in section 213d of the internal revenue code they include expenditures for spouse and dependents even if they are not continuedcomparability requirement employers are not required to contribute to employees hsas but if they do the contributions must be comparable6 generally contributions must be the same dollar am ount or the same percentage of the hdhp annual deductible adjusted to reflect the proportion of the year the employees have worked employer matching contribu tions which might vary satisfy the comparability requirement only if employee contributions are made through cafeteria plan salary reduction agreement employers may limit contributions just to employees who participate in the employers hdhps however if they ma ke contributions to employees who participate in other hdhps they must ma ke comparable contributions to all employees with hdhps different treatment is allowed for fulltime and parttime employees and for selfonly and family coverage what is the tax treatment of hsa contributions individuals who contribute to their hsas may claim deduction on their federal income tax the deduction is abovetheline that is it is made in determining adjusted gross income it may be taken by all taxpayers even those who claim the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions contributions made by employers are excluded from gross income of employees in determining their income tax liability in addition employer contributions are exempt from social security and medicare taxes for both employers and employees7 social security taxes are 62 of wa ges up to 90000 in 2005 medicare taxes are 145 of total wages in addition empl oyer hsa contributions are exempt from federal unemployment insurance taxes if employees contribute to their hsas through salary reduction cafeter ia plans the contributions are considered to be made by the employer and are exempt from these three employment taxes state income taxes generally follow federal rules with respect to deductions and exclusions however some stat may elect different treatment what is the tax treatme nt of hsa withdrawals withdrawals from hsas are exempt from federal income taxes if used for qualified medical expenses with one exception8 the exception is that whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs9 8 continued eligible to have an hsa themselves irs publication 502 medical and dental expenses provides good overview it is available online at http wwwirsgov pubirspdfp502 pdf the principal purpose of section 213d is to describe which expenses may be taken into account in determining the itemized deduction for medical expenses 9 the irs considers payments for longterm care insurance to be qualified expenses even if the hsa is funded through salary reduction agreement under cafeteria plan notwithstanding the explicit provision in section 125f of the internal revenue code prohibiting cafeteria plans from in cluding longterm care insurance the rationale is that it is the hsa that is paying for the insurance not the cafeteria planpayments for health insurance are qualifie d under section 213d they generally are not qualified for purposes of hsas thus accounts cannot be used to pay some or all of the premiums of the associated hdhp however payments for four types of insurance are considered to be qualifie d expenses 1 longterm care insurance9 2 health insurance premiums during periods of continuation coverage required by federal law eg cobra 3 health in surance premiums during periods the individual is receiving unemployment comp ensation and 4 for individuals age 65 years and older any health insurance premiums including medicare part b premiums other than medicare supplemental policy withdrawals not used for qualified medi cal expenses are included in gross income in determining federal income taxes they also are subject to 10 penalty tax the penalty is waived in cases of disability or death and for individuals age 65 and older there is time limit on when hsa withdrawals are made to pay or reimburse payments for qualified expenses provided adequate records are kept however hsas may not be used to pay expenses incurred before the hsa was established hsa withdrawals are not subject to nondiscrimination provisions applying to selfinsured medical reimbursement plans what happens to hsas at death if surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary of an hsa it becomes an hsa for that widow or widower if someone other than surviving spouse is the designated be neficiary the hsa is terminated as of the date of death and the fair market value becomes taxable income to that person if there is signated beneficiary the remaining assets become part of the estate and the fair market value becomes taxable income to the deceased individual on the final return in these instances amounts included in gross income are reduced by qualified expenses incurred by the deceased before death and paid within one yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs10 10 however trustees and custodians may not ac cept contributions that exceed the annually adjusted dollar amounts eg 2650 and 5250 and allowable catchup contributions 11 department of labor field assistance bulletin 20041 apr 7 2004what administrative provisions apply to hsas the irs has proposed model forms that banks insurance companies and other approved entities can use as trust or custodial agreements with eligible individuals the proposed agreements which are not manda tory provide safe harbor definition of these institutions responsibilities among other things the proposed forms clarify that trustees and custodians may rely on account owners representations about their age that they are covered by hdhp and that their contributions do not exceed the maximum allowed10 in addition the proposed fo rms state that trustees and custodians are not responsible for determin ing whether distribu tions are used for medical expenses hsa funds may be invested in investments approved for iras such as bank accounts annuities certificates of posit stocks mutual funds and bonds however trustees and custodians need not make available all of these options hsa funds may not be invested in life insura nce contracts or most collectibles ie tangible property administration and account maintenance fees may be withdrawn from the hsa in which case they will not be considered taxable income or paid separately in which case they will not be taken into account with respect to contribution limits trustees and custodians may place reasonable restrictions on the frequency and minimum amount of hsa distributions are hsas covered by erisa the employee retirement income security act erisa establishes requirements for employee benefit plans among other things it establishes reporting disclosure and fi duciary standards for employ ers superceding state laws on these matters benefit plans with min imal employer involve ment are exempted the us department of labor dol has determined that hsas generally will not be considered erisa plans even if employers make contributions to the accounts provided employer i nvolvement is otherwise limited11 for the exemption to apply employers must not limit employees ability to move funds to another hsa impose additional conditions on using hsa funds make or in fluence investment decisions regarding hsas represent that hsas are employee welfare benefit plans established by the employer or receive any payment or compensation in connection with hsashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs11 12 department of labor adviso ry opinion 200409a dec 22 2004 13 for additional information see health savings accounts issues and implementation decisions for

general information see irs publication 969 health savings accounts and other taxfavored health plansthe dol has also determined that certa in cash contributions offered by hsa trustees or custodians as an incentive to establish an hsa are not prohibited transaction under erisa12 what state requirements apply to hsas states do not have to approve hsas for them to become available within their jurisdictions however individuals cannot establish or make contributions to hsas unless they have qualifying hdhp curren tly some states do not allow the sale of insurance that meets the requirements for these plans since they require all insurance to include certain benefits with or low deductibles some of these benefits may not fall within the irs definition of preventive benefits which would allow the insurance to be considered qualified the irs has granted waiver until january 1 2006 that allows insurance in these states to be considered hdhps giving the states time to change their laws however some states might not act by that date or at all13 this regulatory barrier does not apply to employers that selfinsure since erisa generally exempts their plans from state insurance mandates14 it does apply to employers that purchase insurance from insu rance companies as well as to insurance that is sold in the individual market and small group market hsas and other health care accounts hsas are new but the concept of taxadvantaged account to pay for unreimbursed health care expenses is not three other types of taxadvantaged health care accounts have existed for sometime ar cher medical savings accounts msas health reimbursement ccounts hras and health care flexible spending accounts fsas this s ection provides brief overv iew of these other accounts15 it is possible for individuals to have more than one of these accounts the most likely combinations would be hras nd fsas or hsas and fsas however employers must coordinate how multiple accounts are used so that eligibility requirements are not violated for example they might limit their fsas to benefits that are not covered by their hras visi on care perhaps or require that hras be exhausted before the fsas can be usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs12 16 even so 100 of the hsa insurance deductible might be lower dollar figure than 65 or 75 of the msa insurance deductible if deductibles do not exceed 2650 however hsa contributions could cover the deductib while msas contributions could not 17 the latest extension was in the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311medical savings accounts msas are precursors to hsas both cons ist of taxadvantaged account that must be accompanied by highdeductible h ealth plan at the time that contributions are made msas were first authorized as demonstration under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 they were renamed archer msas by pl 106554 msas were not as widely available as hsas to enroll in an msa individuals had to either be selfemplo yed or employees covered by high deductible insurance plan established by their small employer 50 or fewer employees on average in contrast there is workre lated

contributions to msas are limited to more than 65 of the insurance deductible for selfonly coverage and 75 of the deductible for family coverage in contrast contributions to hsas of up to 100 of the

hsas 10 one obstacle to the popularity of msas was that the initial authorizing legislation established cutoff date afte r which new msas c ould be established it also established numerical limits on th number of accounts but these were far above the number of accounts act ually created as that date approached congress passed legislation to extend it mo st recently thr ough december 31 200517 the

omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 pl 99 272 which among other things requires employers with 20 or more employees to allow separated employees and their surviving spouse and dependents to continue health insurance coverage for certain length of time 20 for additional information on the legal basis of fsas see crs report rl32656 health care flexible spending accounts by chris l peterson and bob lykeexpenses this was ultimately affirmed by the treasury department in 2002 with certain stipulations18 hras can be funded only by employer contributions unlike the other accounts discussed here employees may not cont ribute on their own however hras need not actually be funded employers may tr eat them simply as notional accounts and pay reimbursements from other sources as need ed hras also need not be associated with high deductible health plans thoug h in practice employers generally couple them with insurance having deductible gr eater than the annual contribution to the hra because the hra is owned by the employer rather than the enrollee the employer is free to set limits on it for example employers generally limit the total amount that can be built up in the account the employer also determines what happens to the account when an employee leaves the company generally the account balance is forfeited back to the employer although as form of employerprovided health coverage hras are subject to cobra provisions19 nonmedical withdrawals from hras are not permitted flexible spending accounts fsas are employerestablished benefit plans that reimburse employees for specified expenses as they are incurred they can be used for health care or for dependent care though there must be sepa rate accounts for these purposes fsas are not explicitly authorized by the internal revenue code instead rules governing them were spelled out in proposed regulations that the irs issued for cafeteria plans in 1984 and 1989 and in final rules issued in 2000 and 2001 regarding midyear plan changes20 while fsas can be used to pay for unr eimbursed health care expenses unlike the other accounts discussed here they usually are not coupled with particular health insurance plan they are standalone acc ounts the principal purpose of which is to enable employees to pay outofpocket h ealth care costs with pretax dollars most fsas are funded through salary reduction arrangements under which employees receive less takehome pay for example 100 month in exchange for equivalent contributions to their acc ounts in this case 1200 for the

balances cannot be used in the following ear any balance at the end of the year is forfeited to the employer this is commonly called the use it or lose it rule in recent years legislation has been introduced to allow limited fsas sums to be carried over to the following year or rolled ove r into qualified retirement account but none of these bills has been enacted hras and fsas are similar in that non medical withdrawals are not permitted and there is required health plan to accompany the account in addition the annual amount to be deposited in the account is available at the beginning of the year even before all the deposits have been ma in contrast with hsas and msas one may not withdraw an amount greater than the current account balance availability and use of hsas available products the initial entrants in the market for hsa products were specialty companies such as golden rule insurance company definity health lumenos and assurant health that had earlier sold msa and hra plans these companies were able to readily adapt systems used to administer msa and hra plans for administration of hsa plans in recent months several large insurers have made decisions to either introduce or expand upon the availability of hsa products the bluecross blueshield association announced in november 2004 th at its member plans would offer variety of products tied to hsas in virt ually every state by 2006 as of february 2005 blue cross and blue shield compan ies offered hsacomp atible products in 38 states the growth in the hsa market may also receive an impetus from the acquisition of definity health by united health care21 definity health is generally credited with the creation of the hra concept while united health care is one of the largest health insurers in the unite d states the combined company should be able to offer an hsa product that bene fits from the knowledge base of definity health and the deep provider network di scounts of united hea lth care the hsa product is likely to be of par ticular interest to employer s who wish to offer employees choice of plans hmos ppos fee for service and hsa for example while using the same vendor to administer all plans based on their core expertise one would expect insurance companies to sell hdhps and banks and trusts to sell hsa administration services however many insurance companies have part nered

likely or somewhat likely to offer highdeduc tible plan with personal account or hsa option in the next two years the percentage of firms indicating they are very or somewhat likely to offer such an

covering more than 6 million employees and family members hewitt reported that 57 of its survey respondents were cons idering hsas for future use25 large and small employers face different issues regarding health insurance coverage for their employees and their consideration of hsa plans may differ these categories are considered separately below large employers large employers are generally defined as those with over 500 employees two segments of these em ployers are likely to be particularly interested in hsa plans those that curren tly offer hras and others that also offer some form of high deductible insurance employers that currently offer hra plans are likely to give serious consideration to adopting hsas which generally are more advantageous for employees these employers have already bought into the concept of consumer driven health plans as strategy for improving cost awareness and accountability they have programs in place for educa ting employees about provider costs and choices other employers offer high deductible insurance without hras according to the 2004 kaiser survey 20 of jumbo firms 5000 or more workers offered healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs17 26

modified to do so some large employers may find it difficu lt or inadvisable to offer hsa plans because prescription drugs will not be ex empt from the deductib requirements of the hdhp currently large employers ofte n offer prescription drug plans through specialty vendors such as medc or express scripts th prevalent design provides prescriptions without deductible with sepa rate copayments for generic versus brand name drugs and for mail or der versus retail drugs revenue ruling 200438 issued in march 2004 clarified that in order to meet statutory require ments prescription drug

would take time to change plan design and administrative systems to comply with this ruling revenue procedure 200422 released concurrently with re venue ruling 200438 provides transition relief until january 1 2006 by allowing indivi duals to be eligible for hsas even if covered by prescription plan that provides benefits be fore the annual hdhp deductible is satisfied despite this transition relief some large employers may consider the eventual application of reve nue ruling 200438 barrier for hs as large employers would be likely to offer an hsa plan as one option among many and might not wish to modify their prescription drug plan desi gn and administration for only that option moreover some employers be lieve that subjecting prescriptions to high deductible may be perverse incentive that induces some enrollees to skip required medications ultimately leading to greater health care costs in the future small employers employers with fewer than 50 workers constitute the vast majority of the nations employers27 among small firms that offer health insurance few have plans with taxadvantaged acc ounts the uncertainty surrounding msas made them an unattractive option as did th eir other limitations fsas and hras are also unpopular since often the owners of small firms cannot participate in them many small businesses are organized as partnerships s corporations

numbers it is also expected that their high income employees would be most likely to participate in these plans small employers that do not offer health insurance generally attribute this to its cost they might have been able to afford sparse insurance coverage with high deductibles and limited benefits but may not have had much choice of plans with the advent of hsas however hdhps will b ecome more widely available perhaps at more competitive rates small empl oyers may also find hsa accounts attractive since they would obtain employment tax sa vings on employee contributions that are made through sala ry reduction plans individual insurance market individual market health insurance is for self employed individuals and individuals w ho do not have access to employerprovided insurance or choose not to participate in it if individuals are selfemployed they generally can deduct 100 of the cost of the hdhp as well as any hsa contribution they make if individuals are not sel femployed the tax advantages are not as marked while they can also deduct hsa contributions hdhp premiums are deductible only to the extent they exceed 75 of adjusted gross income when combined with other unre imbursed health expenses in his fy2005 budget president bush proposed allowing premiums for hdhps purchased in the individual market to be claimed as an abovet heline tax deduction when individuals made hsa contributi ons an abovetheline deduction can be claimed by taxpayers whether or not they itemize their deductions if this proposal were adopted it would spur the growth of hsas particularly among high income individuals for whom the tax savings would be more significant the effect of the presidents proposal on the number of unins ured is discussed below on pages 2224 one possible consequence of the introduc tion of hsas in the individual market might be reduced availability of comprehensive health care plans if healthierthan average individuals enroll in hdhps less healthy

plans hsas are examples of what some call consumerdriven health plans while definitions vary in general consumerd riven health plans involve two central components highdeductible health insu rance and taxadvantaged savings account from which unreimbursed health care costs including the insurance deductible can be paid30 by this definition consumerdrive n health plans cdhps include hsas hras and msas each of which was discussed earlier some might also include fsas though currently most of these acc ounts are not coupled with highdeductible insurance it is possible for individuals to have more than one of these accounts the development of cdhps has been spu rred by employers anxious to moderate annual premium increases which have exceeded 10 the past few years31 simply moving toward high deductibles enables em ployers to reduce the cost of insurance since it covers less risk even if growth rates continue the additional cost is smaller insurance costs might also be constrained if employees have greater financial stake in their health care which the ta xadvantaged accounts might encourage cdhps also emerged in response to the backlash against managed care that had tight utilization controls managed care obtained reputation in some circles of refusing to pay for care people thought wa s needed in response health plans now offer greater choice of providers and are less active in trying to deter health care utilization as part of this trend cdhp s which have fewer limitations on enrollees health care choices attempt to put in place financial incentives that encourage the appropriate use of costeffective care the effectiveness of cdhps in slowing health care spending and encouraging enrollees to use costeff ective care depends on how the two cdhp components are structured and interact the discussion below outlines some factors that appear to be important in these regards high deductible health insurance economic theory academic research and insurance companies experience all indicate that substantial increases in patie nt costsharing insurance deductibles and copayments generally result in significant reductions in health use probably the most frequently cited research is the rand health insurance experiment carefully designed study of 5800 people at six sites between 1974 and 1982 among otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs20 32 the former group had to pay 95 of their expenses outofpocket up to an annual limit of 15 of family income or 1000 whichever was lower the latter group had outof pocket expenses for services 33 willard g

rmation that enrollees need but do not have in order to make good health care choices arnold milsteins testimony before the joint economic committee feb 25 2004 httpj ecsenategov_f ilesmils tein02252004pdf some employers have formed coalitions to provide more information about provider quality continuedthings this study showed that per capita expenses for patients with 95 coinsurance requirement for outpatient rvices were 31 lower than those for patients without costsharing32 reductions in expenses were somewhat smaller for patients who had 25 or 50 coinsurance re quirements as they were for those with deductible policies reducti ons occurred for broad range of conditions especially for ambulatory care but also for hospitaliza tions reductions were primarily in the number of contacts rather than the intensity of services33 the rand experiment occurred over three decades ago and the magnitude of reductions might be different today am erican households have changed as have their economic prospects likewise the health care sector is different particularly with the spread of managed care in one form or another nonetheless compared to traditional health plans with low deductibles and nominal copayments high deductible health plans are likely to have lower health care utilization one reason for this is that enrollees in traditional health plans usually are unaware of the total cost of their care they generally are not in formed of the part covered by thirdparty payers such as insurance companies anot her reason is that enrollees in traditional plans have little incentive to hold down costs once the low deductible is met the insurer will pay most of the cost of additional covered g oods and services financially enrollees have little need to see if other providers might recommend different treatments or charge lower prices by themselves higher deductibles may not be sufficient for enrollees to seek costeffective higher quality care add itional features that increase the likelihood that improvements will result include the following availability of information enrollees need comparative information on the cost and quality of providers procedures pharmaceuticals and medical devices many cdhps provide enrollees with decision support tools and information relate d to their individual health for example how to manage their chronic conditions and the availability of more costeffective prescripti on drugs however consumers rarely have access to both the price and quality of services from individual physicians hospitals and other providers proponents of cdhps believe that demand for such information will increase as cdhps become more commonplace and will spur the accessibility of such information34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs21 34 continued laura landro doctor scorecards are proposed in healthcare quality drive wall street journal online mar 25 2004 available online at

children nonetheless for dults and children as whole reductions in service associated with coinsurance and deductib appeared to have only negligible effects on general measures of health it is not k nown whether effects on health would have been greater had the service reductions conti nued beyond the end of the experiment 36 for msas the high deductible insurance may exempt preventive care only if this is required by state lawcompetition if there is only one practical option for needed health care exposure to the full cost up to the deductible will not affect choice of providers providers have little incentive to offer competitive prices when competition exists in the presence of competition however enrollees are able to choose among providers based on price and other factors price sensitivity at the point of service exposure to the full cost up to the deductible will have impact on utilization when demand for good or service is inelastic that is when person is willing to pay practically any price for it such as with lifethreatening emergency however utilization is affected when willingness to obtain health care depends heavily on prices that enrollees must pay one complication here is that consumers may not know in advance what they will be charged for service nor will they know what proportion of the charge will be covered by their insurance one concern regarding hdhps is that enrollees may forgo care they need as well as care that is optional or of little value if they go to doctors less often some serious medical conditions might not be di agnosed or treated notwithstanding the availability of effective interventions examples include diabetes high blood pressure and breast cancer the rand health insurance experiment found that cost sharing deterred patients equally from seeking care that is highly effective and care that is rarely effective patients became more frugal but not necessarily better consumers of medical care35 supporters argue that cdhps will not ex hibit these effects many cdhps exempt preventive care from high deductible restrictions in fact statutory language for both msas and hsas permit high deductible insurance to have exceptions for preventive care36 at the same time the statutory language does not require an exemption for preventive care and some insurance plans could allow it only in limited ways many cdhps also provide enrollees with information to help them make informed decisions about when to s ee doctors arguably atrisk enrollees willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs22 37 kathleen n lohr et use of medical care 38 in theory the use it or lose it rule fo r fsas should encourage spending while the high deductible insurance requirement for hsas should discourage spending however for individuals and families with steady stream of health care expenditures actual use may be the samebe more likely to seek health care than if they had traditional insurance which did not provide information nonetheless statutor language does not require that enrollees be given information and some would ar gue that information by itself may not prompt appropr iate action enrollees also might not obtain the care th ey need if they do not have the money to pay for it the rand health insurance experiment found that costsharing led to greater reductions in care for poor than nonpoor people with poor children among the most affected37 this indicates that wherewithal to pay has an independent effect on the likelihood of seeking medical advi ce and treatment hardly surprise however cdhp supporters argue that tax advantaged health savings accounts the second of the two cdhp components will reduce the likelihood that enrollees will not have money to pay for medical care when needed health savings accounts by itself moving from lowdeductible to highdeductible health insurance will likely reduce health care utilization and could impede enrollees from obtaining care they need how taxadvantaged health savings accounts hsas msas and hras affect these outcomes will depend on several factors contributions to accounts health savings accounts will play significant role only if employer s and enrollees make contributions to them probably regularly how much is contributed is also relevant while there are limits on maximum contributions there are minimum contribution requirements accumulation within accounts health savings accounts will be significant only if account ba lances build up over time if contributions are withdrawn th same year the accounts will function like fsas simply allowing health care expenses to be paid with pretax dollars38 savings or insurance if enrollees think of their accounts as personal savings they are likely to be frugal with them just as if they were paying expenses out of their own poc ket alternatively if enrollees think of their accounts as personal in surance they are likely to see them as resources to be used for current expenses in effect their accounts would provide deductible insurance thus offsetting the utilization reductions of the high deductible insurance some enrollees might initially consider their accounts as savings but then after balances grow be more willing to spend part of the accumulation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs23 39 henry j aaron the sleeper in the drug bill tax notes vol 102 8

early withdrawals and required distributions by patrick j purcellusing hsas to build retirement savings one incentive for enrollees to consider hsa accounts as savings rather than insurance is that they have tax advantages not shared by taxadvantaged retirement arrangements such as qualified pensions 401k plans and individual retirement accounts iras in fact it has been argued that the most significant impact of hsas will not be on how consumers use health care but on how employers rea rrange contributions to workers tax advantaged retirement savings39 hsas have several advantages over ot her forms of retirement savings if employee contributions are made thr ough salary reduction agreements the contributions are not subject to employment taxes if made to hsas they are subject to them if made to 401k accounts th employment tax exemption saves money for both the employer and the employee in both cases employee contributions through salary reduction agreements are exempt from income taxes and employer contributions are exempt from both employment and income taxes the income used for ira contributions either deduc tible or nondeductible is also subject to employment taxes hsas also have clear advantage with respect to the income tax treatment of withdrawals provided they are used for qualified medical expenses hsa withdrawals are always exempt from income taxation in contrast withdrawals from qualified retirement plans are generally taxable except to the extent they represent aftertax contributions considering how significant health care expenditures can be for retirees this difference may lead some people to put more money into hsas and less into their retirement accounts40 in one respect hsas have some disadvantages compared with the retirement accounts if hsa funds are withdrawn be fore age 65 and not used for qualified medical expenses they are subject to 10 penalty for retirement accounts the 10 penalty applies only to withdrawals made before age 59½ in addition the penalty is waived if the withdrawal is used for certain expenses or is taken in series of roughly equal payments41 the tax advantages of hsas become more marked for high income

provide tax shelter for highly compensated employees42 issues and legislation effect on health plan selection if hsa plans mostly attract people who are healthy adverse selection may become problem adverse selection occurs when empl oyers or health plans do not anticipate the claims experience of lessh ealthy people and underprice health plan43 adverse selection can have serious conse quences when some health plans mostly enroll healthy people who have lower than average medical costs while other plans enroll lesshealthy people with higher than average costs initially premiums for the former plans would go down compared to plans that enroll people with average claims experience while premiums for the other plans would rise over time the healthiest people in the higher cost plans would switch to lower cost plans since they could pay lower premiums resulting in premium increases for those plans but even greater increases for people remaining in higher cost plans since their plans would increasingly have the most expensive pe ople if premiums reflect only the expenditures of plan enrollees higher cost plans could face death spiral in which annual premium increases cause additional healthier indivi duals to disenroll until the plans become unaffordable for some who need insurance the most adverse selection is not caused by hsas themselves rather it results from different responses to the requirement th at hsa contributions can occur only when individuals have hdhp young and health people are likely to find this insurance attractive since they generally do not anticipate large health care expenses they would prefer to pay lower premiums and make contributions to or have contributions made on their behalf to an hsa older and less healthy people are likely to find high deductible insurance unattractive they generally would anticipate large expenses not covered by the deduc tible and would worry that their hsa balances would not be suffici ent to make up the difference44 other choices may partially offset this selection pattern some less healthy people may find hsa plans attractive because they enable them to circumvent the restrictions of managed care plans c onversely some healthy people may find them unattractive because they are very riskaverse they would prefer to pay more for comprehensive insurance with low deductib older people may find hsa plans attractive because of the tax advantages being in higher tax brackets since average earnings increase with age until people are in their 50s their tax savings

combining the risk pool for all options specifically they could provide subsidies for the comprehensive health plan options and pr ice the employee contributions for these options at lower level than justified by their claims experience alone another strategy some employers use to limit adverse selection is to limit free movement across plan options for exampl an employer that offers four plan options with different employee premiums might allow an individual enrolled in low cost health plan to move up only to the plan with the next higher cost in the following year thus an employee enrolle d in an hsa plan who has just found out that he needs coronary bypass surgery woul d not be able to switch in the upcoming enrollment period to the most comprehensive health plan option effect on number of uninsured hsa plans might help some people without health insurance acquire coverage high deductible health insurance costs less than traditional comprehensive insurance other things being equal and competition to establish market share for hdhps may help moderate annual incr eases at least temporarily in addition some small employers might offer coverage for the first time while hsas themselves may not make much difference gains in coverage would come from lower cost insurance they can be used to purchase cobr continuation coverage and to pay for medical expenses in effect the account s provide limited insurance themselves however hsa plans are not likely to make big difference in the number of uninsured generally people do not have health insurance because their

know the extent to which hsa plans will reduce health care spending particularly by employers the market for hsa plans is just developing and it may be several ears before representative data ar available in addition there are complex issues involving the relations hip between health care utilization health care prices and employer subsid ies that merit careful study experience with hras some indications about the effect of hsa plans on spending might be derived from th early experience of hra plans mercer human resource consulting released an employer study on november 22 2004 that showed

physician office visits and prescriptions increased more employees waived coverage and some coverage was cut back humana added hospital copays to all benefit options aetna studied 14000 employees and dependents of 19 different employer clients who were enrolled in its hra plans preliminary results showed that hra plan enrollees had 15 increase in medical claims compared to double digit increases for the matched cohort there was reduction in pharmacy costs for hra plan enrollees driven by decline in overall prescriptions and an increase in generic utilization54 definity health the first company to start marketing hra plans focused on the large selffunded employer market and had 30 employer clients as of january 1 2002 definity health reported that most of its 2002 employer client s saw very low or negative cost increases when they renewed for 2003 this was true both where the hra plan was the only option offe red to employees or one among several options55 while these studies are interesting they cannot be taken as hard evidence that hra plans reduce costs in most studies to date adjustments are not made for any benefit cutbacks or for shifts of employees between options from one year to another in addition the savings reporte d are determined by the health plans themselves rather than by independent researchers even when early studies show that hra plans are associated with reduced costs it is difficult to predict whether the savings can be sustained over time there is anecdotal evidence that cost trends in subsequent years are higher than the initial year although not quite as high as for trad itional health plans in addition it is not known whether part of the savings achieve d by an hra plan might be on account ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32467crs29 individuals skimping on required prescripti ons or tests which may lead to more severe conditions and higher costs in the long run whether hsa plans will differ from hra plans despite their similarities the effect of hsa plans on spending may differ in several respects from the hra plans discussed above hsas are more likely to be viewed as savings as discussed above the extent to which hsas will be considered savings or insurance is unclear compared to hras hsas are more likely to be viewed as savings which should further reduce spending there is limit to how much may be rolled over to following years hsa balances are portable nd not owned by employers hsa balances may be used for expenditures other than health care albeit subject to income taxes and if under the age of 65 an additional 10 penalty hsas are likely to have higher participation rates while it is premature to estimate how popular hsas will be they are likely to have more participation than hr as which can only be established by employers and are not portable consultants seem to agree that an enrollment of 10 or more constitutes successful cdhp enrollment and hras might meet that standard however while 10 enrollment may meet employers expectations it is not large enough to make significant impact on overall employer health care costs hsas are likely to have larger network discounts one factor in cdhp cost savings is the extent to which the plan administrator can negotiate managed care network di scount in the past cdhps had specialty administrators such as definity health or lumenos whose discounts were not as great as thos obtained by large insurers able to steer large numbers of enrollees into managed care network since practically all large health insurers are entering the hsa market this situation will change while hsa plans may reduce health car spending it would be unreasonable to expect them to produce significant reduction in the nations health care costs it is well established paradigm that 5 of individuals acc ount for approximately 50 of health care costs and 20 account for approximately 80 of costs hsa plans with their relatively low outof pocket maximums will have little impact in reducing the health care spending for these groups effect on the federal budget hsas reduce federal budget receipts in several ways contributions

distributions used to pay health care expenses in addition employer contributions are ex empt from employment taxes when the medicare prescription drug improvement and m odernization act of 2003 was

expenditure estimates fo r the same period are considerably higher 130 billion largely because it predicts that more accounts will be established58 considering current and pr ojected federal budget defi cits it might be asked how these losses can be justified supporters of hsas can make tw general arguments first to the extent hsas reduce health care spending they might serve as model for ways of generally reducing the nations health care costs along with the tax subsidies associated with them second the losses might be justified on grounds of equity to the extent account owners assume risk that otherwise would be borne by health plans they would be giving up th larger tax subsidies for comprehensive insurance for smaller subsidies for their high deductible insurance on the other hand the revenue loss attributable to hs as might be criticized in several respects some might question whether it is fair that the largest tax savings per person will likely flow to healthy higher income taxpayers some might also question whether the revenue loss is an appropriate use of federal health care resources given the many people in the country who have health insurance whatsoever 108th
