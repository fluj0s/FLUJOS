might be solved and created if the term were changed to four years and some types of four year proposals that have been introduced the report will be updated s events warrant background the current twoyear house term was the result of compromise reached at the constitutional convention in 1787 by advocates of oneyear term and advocates of threeyear or longer term delegates favoring the oneyear term eg elbridge gerry roger sherman oliver ellsworth argued that annual elections would help to ensure that members would be more responsive to their c onstituents views concerns and needs furthermore members of congress under the articles of confederation were elected annually and the term of office for members of the state assembly in all but three states was one year1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21574crs2 2gaillard hunt and james brown scott eds debates in the federal convention of 1787 committee of the whole in remarks of mr madison tuesday june 12 1787 westport

had introduced that would have provided for three year house term 4precise comparison of figures cannot be made due to the differences in definitions of measures and how they were recorded and categorized for early congresses for example the distinction between public bills and private bills or among bills joint resolutions simple resolutions and concurrent resolutions is not always made in various sources 5for further discussion on scheduling see crs report rl30825 house schedule recent practices and proposed options by richard s beth summaryother delegates eg james madison an d alexander hamilton advocated term of at least three years they argued that shorter term would not allow new members sufficient time to acquaint themselves with th eir duties or to gain sufficient knowledge about national issues and interests which ar inherently complex in addition term of one year would be almost consumed in preparing for and traveling to and from the seat of national business2furthermore elections held too frequently might promote indifference among the electorate re flecting compromise the proposed new constitution which provided that house members shall be chosen every second year was referred to the states and was ratified thus any change in the twoyear term requires amendment of the constitution the first proposed constitutional amendmen t to change the length of the house term to four years was introduced by rep lewis selye of new york on february 8 1869 since then more than 200 proposals have been introduced to lengthen the house term to four years only one of them was voted on in either house during the 59thcongress the resolution hjres 120 was rejected in the house by vote of 89 to 86 on june 20 1906 constitutional amendments require two thirds rather than simple majority for passage before being referre d to the states for ratification number of factors have contributed to dvocates perception that longer house term is needed some contend that given the growth in the number of constituents each member represents and the volume and complexityof modern legislation members need longer term to address policy issues and carry out their legislative duties reportedly the house of representatives in the very f irst congress in both of its sessions proposed only 142 bills of which 118 b ecame law3during the 107thcongress 9130 bills and joint resolutions were introduced of which 377 became public law4furthermore with the short twoyear term they suggest that members are always running for reelection some saya longer term could increase members opportunityto discharg their legislative duties without being overly concerned w ith campaigning in addition some say protracted daily sessions combined with conflicts between floor and committee work5 and increased demands on members time within the short twoyear time frame can be so disruptive to members family life that some may retire from the house before they or their constituents wanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21574crs3 major challenge lies in devising simple comprehensive and fair system that leaves the 10year censustaking and reapportionment cycle unchanged because 10 is not evenly divisible by four fouryear terms t end to be somewhat problematic though not unworkable of course there is the option f amending article i s c t i n2 s u c ht h tt h censustaking and reapportionment cycle is changed to some frequency that is evenly divisible by four eg every 12 years altern atively supporters have offered variety of proposals aimed at addressing rea pportionment and other issues issues in debate procon arguments modern debate on whether the twoyear term should be lengthened usually to four years includes the following arguments arguments in favor longer term would give members more time to acquire experience and expertise on issues elections held less fre quently eg every four years would give members more time to attend to th eir legislative responsibilities and enable them to concentrate on programs which reflect their constituents needs and interests the high incumbency rate suggests general satisfaction with the jobincumbents are doing therefore it would save time and energy to conduct campaigns less frequently elections held less frequently coul d increase voter interest and hence turnout longer term would result in fewer ections which would presumably lead to reduction in campaign costs arguments in opposition biennial elections keep the congress in close check and in closer touch with the people thus making the members more responsive to constituents decreasing the frequencyof electi ons might diminish public influence on policy members use of advanced technology makes todays voluminous andcomplex legislation manageable in the present twoyear time frame members can rely upon institutional r esources including the committee system interest groups and nonpar tisan support agencies to augment their own personal expertise or to increase their competence on issues reducing the need for longer term while holding elections less frequen tly would reduce administrative costs it would not necessarily reduc the total expense of elections candidates campaign expenses are determined by factors eg radio television advertisements and other media costs travel campaign staff salaries campaign events other t han frequency of elections less frequent elections could even raise the stakes by extending the time frame for both fundraising and campaigninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21574crs4 6seetable 1 also note that the proposals described in this report and variations of them while typical are not the only types of fouryear proposals that have been introduced 7the majority of the proposals for staggered ections provide for dividing the house into two classes but there have also been proposals for threeclass systemsfouryear term proposals most of the proposals offered by proponent s of fouryear term may be divided into categories based upon the timing of elections6some proponents favor dividing the house into classes and electing the classe s alternately so that depending upon the number of classes some portion of the hous would be up for election every two years ie staggered elections some advocate electing all the members at the same time in presidential election years ie concu rrent elections others support electing all members at the same time but to one term of two years and two terms of four years within each tenyear census cycle twoyear fouryear fouryear combination staggered elections proponents of staggered elections have suggested dividing the house into two classes7elected alternately to four year terms they believe staggered elections would maintain the fundamental c oncept of house kept close to the people since half of the house members would be elected every two years twoyear election interval would be retained while simultane ously providing the advantages of fouryear term in addition staggered elections would help to guard against upsetting the separation of powers doctrine and checks and balances tradition because house elections would occur in presidential election years nd in nonpresidential election years opponents of staggering house elections argue that it would upset fundamental difference in the natures of the house and senate the former being noncontinuing body which is reconstituted at the beginning of each congress ie every two years the latter being body that continues from one cong ress to another it would also disrupt the basic concept of house kept close to the people because the entire house would not be up for election each congress further every eligible voter in state would not have the opportunity to vote for representative every two years because only half of the congressional districts in each state would be up for election every two years this would be even more problematic for states with single representative one member elected at large and states with an odd number of congressional districts in addition some have argued that within the context of reapportionment and resulting changes in the number of seats states may have house multipleclass and alternating term system could be burdensome and complicated for example an objective would be to develop an unbiased system for categorizing the various congressional districts depending upon the number of cla sses and the decennial reapportionment the frequency of elections would thus vary not only from state to state but also within states but arguably more so than in the current senate class system elections concurrent with the presidential election proponents of electing all house members in presidential election years argue that it would maximize the likelihood of effective control of congress an d the presidency by the same political party thereby increasing executivelegislative harmony and giving more assurance that the presidents programs would be considered if not enacted furthermore it would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21574crs5 8discussion is based upon members being elected to the twoyear term in year ending in 0 eg 2010 four year term in year ending in 2 eg 2012 and fouryear term in year ending in 6 2016 within each ten year cycle the 24 4 combination would begin again with the decennial census of 2020upset the delicate balance wh erein total membership of one of the houses is elected at one time moreover it would not create the problems in staggering seats evenly within individual states that stagge red elections could pose opponents contend that electing all memb ers in the same year of presidential elections would upset the checks and balan ces in our three levels of government it could make the legislative branch too depe ndent upon the executive branch since allmembers would be elected in presidential years further it might have negative effect on the two party system because it would discontinue midterm elections which provide an opportunity for the party that lost the previous presidential election to gain seats in both houses also in this context the midterm c ongressional elections are often viewed as referendum on both the incumbent president and his party twoyears fouryears fouryears combination8some other proponents of fouryear house term would rather elect the entire house at the same time but to one term of two years and two terms of four years within each tenyear census cycle twoyear fouryear fouryear combination for example if such legislation were passed by the congress and approved by the states within the next seven years the term extension would begin with the election of 2010 the entire house would be up for election three times during the tenyear cycle beginning w ith the 2010 election house members elected in 2010 would have term of two years 2011 and 2012 serving from january 3 2011 to january 3 2013 house members elected in 2012 would have term of four years 2013 2014 2015 2016 serving from january 3 2013 to january 3 2017 and house members elected in 2016 would have term of four years 2017 2018 2019 2020 serving from january 3 2017 to january 3 2021 the cycle would begin again with the house elections of the year 2020 representa tive charles stenholm of texas introduced proposal of this type on july 24 2003 the measure hjres 66 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary proponents of providing for term of two ears and two terms of four years in ten year cycle contend that it would accommodate the census and changes in reapportionment of the house that can occur after the decennial census it would also maintain the basic tenet that the entire house membership is u p for election simultaneously in addition it combines advantages of some of the other types of fouryear term proposals for example within decade if elections for the twoyear term were held in non presidential year eg 2010 elections for both fouryear terms would be held in presidential election years eg 2012 and 2016 in the succeeding decade the reverse would occur that is the election for the twoyear term would be held in presidential year ie 2020 and elections for both foury ear terms would be held in nonpresidential years ie 2022 and 2026 as result rot ation of sort relative to presidential election years would occur within and across decades see table 1 opponents of the 244 plan argue that within each tenyear cycle there would be only one interval of two years when voters w ould have the opportunity to effectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21574crs6 register their assessment of the job their repr esentative is doing as compared to five such opportun ities w ithin the same tenyear time frame under the current system the 244 plan could also upset the delicate system of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches depending upon whether the elections for fouryear terms occurred in presidential or nonpresidentia l years in addition ca ndidates might be less inclined to seek election to the shorter twoyear terms resignation from the hous to run for the senate in an effort to increase senate support for longer house term some of the proposals for longer house term also provide that member of the house may run for the senate unless he or she resigns from the house
