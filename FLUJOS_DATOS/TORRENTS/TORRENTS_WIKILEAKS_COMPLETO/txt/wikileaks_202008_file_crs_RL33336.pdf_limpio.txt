international agreements on persistent organic pollutants pops proposed amendments to the toxic substances control act summary between 1998 and 2001 the united states si gned two interna tional treaties and one executive agreement to reduce production and use and regulate trade and disposal of certain persistent organic po llutants pops and other chemicals that for the most part are strictly regulated in us commerce pops are chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and th pesticide ddt that do not break down easily in the environment tend to accumulate as they move up the food chain and may be harmful to people and wildlife the president signed and has submitted the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants and the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent to the senate for advice and consent if the senate consents by twothirds majority and the congress passes legislation that is needed to implement the two treaties as well as the executive agreement the pops protocol to the aarhus convention on l ongrange tran sboundary ai r pollution then the treaties can be ratified and the agreements would take effect domestically current us laws do not provide for th us environmental protection agency epa to fully comply with the provisions of these international agreements for example epa has authority to ban or restrict production of chemical intended for export even if its sale and use in the united states are prohibited if the united states is going to abide by the agreements congress would have to enact amendments to two federal laws the toxic substances control act tsca governing industrial uses of chemicals nd the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra which regulates pesticide sale and use legislation has been introduced in the 109th congress that would allow implementation of the agreements hr 4591 and hr 4800 would amend tsca while hr 3849 and s 2042 would amend fifra this report focuses on the bills that offer proposed amendments to tsca tsca requires epa to begin rule making for chemical if there is reasonable basis to conclude that the manufact ure processing distribution in commerce use or disposal will presen t an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment the act directs epa to regulate to the extent necessary to protect adequately against such risk us ing the least burdensome requirements hr 4591 was ordered to be reporte d amended by the house committee on energy and commerce on july 12 2006 the two bills propose many similar amendments to tsca but bill provisions differ significantly with respect to regulating chemicals that might be added to the agreements by amendments in the future hr 4591 would provide epa circum scribed authority to regulate to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment require extensive analysis of options and prescribe regula tory outcomes that achieve reasonable balance of social environm ental and economic costs and benefits hr

pollutants pops are chemicals that can harm human health and wildlife do not break down easily in the environment and tend to accumulate as they move up the food chain many po ps are transported in the air and water across international boundaries most pops are synthe tic industrial chemicals or pesticides but few are unintentional bypr oducts of processes such as combustion between 1998 and 2001 the united states participated in the negotiation of three unsponsored international agreemen ts to address global problems associated with pops two agreements the 2001 st ockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants stockholm pops convention and the 1998 rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for ce rtain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade

deal with air pollution problems through air quality monitoring cooperative research and exchanges of information and development of na tional policies and strategies aimed at reducing emissions of pollutants the united states signed the lrtap convention on november 13 1979 and deposited its instrument of accepta nce on november 30 1981 the agreement was consistent with existing us law so there was need to enact enabling legislation because the c onvention was signed as an executive agreement it was not submitted to the senate for advice and consent the lr tap convention entered into force in 1983 it has been ratified accep ted approved or acceded to by 49 parties including the united states in 1998 pops protocol to lrtap was concluded in aarhus denmark the objective of the amending protocol is to control reduce or eliminate discharges emissions and losses of pers istent organic pollutants it requires parties to take effective measures to eliminate the pr oduction and use of substances listed in annex i aldrin chlordane chordec one ddt dieldrin endrin heptachlor hexabromobiphenyl hexachlorobenzene h cb mirex pcb and toxaphene and to ensure that when such substances are destroyed disposed of or moved across international boundaries it is done in an environmentally sound manner most of these pops are heavily restricted in the united states the lrtap pops protocol also requires countries to restrict uses of substances listed in annex ii ddt hexachlorocyclohexane hch9 and pcb if possible to reduce total annual emissions of each substance in annex iii polyaromatic hydrocar bons pahs dioxinsfurans and hcb and to ensu re environmentally sound disposal of substances listed in annex i ii or iii the pops protocol to lrtap contains specific exemptions to the prohibitions on production use and disposal for in stance quantities of chemicals used in laboratory research are exempted from the prohibitions another exemption allowed under the pops protocol is the use of ddt for controlling vectors of disease particularly mosquitos that may carry malaria the protocol was concluded in 1998 wa s signed by 36 states and has been ratified by 28 of the 55 states

amendment adding chemi cal which may be adopted by consensus of the parties represented at session of the executive body in the same manner as amendments to the lrtap convention ho wever before che micals may be added to the annexes the pops pr otocol requires the following risk profile on the substance nd information demonstrating that the substance meets selection criteria specified in

technical reviews in light of th objective of the pops protocol in article 2 to control reduce or eliminate discharges emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants current law the toxic substances control act 15 usc 26012692 tsca authorizes epa to identify potentially dangerous products or uses of chemicals in manufacturing and interstate commerce that should be subject to federa l control tsca mandates the screening of new and existing chemicals in commerce to determine whether their production importation processi ng distribution use or disposal might pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment to that end epa is authorized to require companies manufacturing chemicals to provide data on each chemicals characteristics and use under tsca epa is required to initiate rulemaking for chemical if the administrator finds that there is reasonable basis to conclude that the manufacture processing distribution in commerce use or disposal presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment the act directs epa to regulate chemical to the extent necessary to protect adequately against such risk using the least burdensome requirements tsca authorizes wide range of regulatory options to reduce chemical risks from requirement for labeling to total ban on production and distri bution in commerce section 12 exempts from tsca requireme nts except for testing requirements chemicals that are manufactured exclusively for export if the chemicals or containers bear stamp or label indi cating that they are intended for export however epa may require testing to determine whether or not such chemicalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs7 11 tsca section 4 requires testing if the manuf acture distribution in commerce processing use or disposal of chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment there are insufficient data nd experience upon which to predict effects on health or the environment and testing is necessary to develop such data epa also must require testing of chemical that will be pr oduced in substantial quantities if significant human exposure might occurpresent unreasonable risks and the sec tion 12 exemption does not apply to chemical found to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health within the united states or to the environment of the ited states secti on 12b requires any exporter of chemical for which epa requires testing to notify epa that it intends to export the chemical and epa must notify the government of the importing nation that such test data are available11 tsca section 6 specifies in detail the rulemaking procedure for chemicals found to present an unreasonable risk th procedure combines requirements for providing public notice and an opportunity for comment as is required for most environmental rules under 5 usc 553 w ith an opportunity fo r hearing the hearing format which is unique among nvironmental statutes in the context of rulemaking is prescribed in tsca 6c 3 and provides for crossexamination of such persons and issues as the administrat or deems appropriate and required for full and true disclosure with respect to disputed issues of material fact in addition tsca 6c1 requires that ep consider and publish statement with respect to the health and environmental effects of the chemical the magnitude of human and environmental exposure to the chemical the benefits of the chemical for various uses and availability of substitu tes and reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule after consider ation of the effect on the national economy small business technological innovation the environment and public health because rulemaking under tsca 6 requi res considerable amount of data collection and analysis promulgation of regulation often ta kes many years the final chemical rule must be based on the matter in the rulemaking record as defined in section 19a which incl udes the rule the administrators finding that the chemical presents an unreasonab risk the costbenefit statement the hearing transcript any written submissions of interested parties and other relevant material tsca section 19 authorizes any person to file petition for judicial review of final rule within 60 days of its prom ulgation tsca directs court to set aside rules promulgated under tsca section 6 i f the court finds that the rule is not supported by substantial evidence in the rule making record taken as whole tsca section 18a preempt s state and local law if epa promulgates rule or order under section 6 that is in tended to protect against risk of injury to health or the environment associated with chemical state or local law is permitted if it is identical to the federal re quirement adopted under anothe r federal law or prohibits the use of such substance or mixture within the relevant jurisdiction except use in manufacture or processing of other substances tsca section 18b

although existing us laws authorize most epa activities that are necessary to fulfill commitments under the three intern ational agreements new legislation would be needed to authorize implementa tion of few treaty provisions as well as to resolve several inconsistencies between current us laws and international law the legislation that is the subject of this report would accomplish these tasks by amending the toxic substan ces control act tsca which governs most chemicals in us commerce12 hr 4591 representative gillmor introduced hr 4591 on december 16 2005 the bill is very similar to draft

international bodies reach one of three decision points in the process of considering whether to add chemical by amending an annex to th stockholm pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol under th stockholm pops convention the three decision points occur when 1 the pops review co mmittee known as poprc usually pronounced as pop rock15 decides under article 8 paragra ph 4a that proposal for listing chemical fulfills the screening criteri or the conference of parties cop16 decides under article 8 paragraph 5 th at the proposal shall proceed 2 the poprc decides on the basis of risk prof

and risk management plan under artic 8 paragraph 9 that th cop consider making listing decision under the lrtap pops pr otocol the three decision points occur when 1 party submits risk profile in support of proposal to list new chemical 2 the executive body established unde r article 10 decides that additional consideration is warranted and require s technical reviews under executive body decision 19982 and 3 the technical revi ew of proposed chemical is completed information gathering hr 4591 would authorize epa to issue general order requiring submission of specified in formation by any manufacturer processor distributor in commerce for export or dis poser of chemical being considered for listing by amendment of an annex rulemaking for new chemicals if chemical were added to annex or b to the stockholm pops convention or anne x i or ii to the lrtap pops protocol and the united states consented to be bound by that amendment that is opted in hr 4591 would authorize epa to

manner that achieves reasonable balance of social environmental and economic costs and benefits in promulgating rules under tsca title v epa would be required to consider risks to health and the environment as well as direct and indirect socioeconomic effects of regulation for the various uses of the chemical and other chemicals that might serve as substitutes for the chemical proposed for listing hr 4591 would require an assessment of the degree to which the manufacture processing distribution in commerce for export use or disposal of the chemical is necessary to prevent significant harm to an importa nt sector of the economy the bill wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs10 require assessments to use sound and objec tive scientific practices and determine the weight of the scientific evidence cerning such risks or effects based on the best available scientific information including pee rreviewed studies in the rulemaking record judicial review tsca 19 would be amended by hr 4591 to authorize any person to file petition for judicial review within 60 days of the promulgation of final rule under title v the bill woul d direct the court to set aside rule that is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking r ecord taken as whole the bill would make all public comments received in response to rulemaking part of the rulemaking record pic convention hr 4591 also would amend tsca 12 by adding new subsection c to implement the pic c onvention the amended version of tsca would require epa to determine with the concurrence of the secretary of state whether chemicals are banned or severely restricted within the united states and to notify the pic secretariat and the public of each such determination epa also would be required to inform the pub

concentrations without prior notification to importing countries if the agency found that such concentrations di d not pose significant threat to human health or the environment and were not inconsistent with any of the three international agreements state preemption hr 4591 as ordered to be reported would amend tsca 18 to preempt state nd local requirements that ar applicable to any pops

chemicals currently listed in annex or b to the stockholm pops c onvention or annex i or ii to the lrtap pops protocol other than pcbs in addition hr 4800 would provide epa with authority to issue

pops convention and the lrtap pops protocol including chemicals that might be added by amendment of these agreements exemptions hr 4800 would authorize epa to promulgate rules providing exemptions from the prohibitions to the exte nt such exemptions are consistent with the stockholm pops convention or the lr tap pops protocol exemptions would apply to pops chemicals that became waste only if they were managed in manner consistent with the relevant provision of the applicable international agreement notice and comment hr 4800 has public tice requirements similar to those of hr 4591 at the same three deci sion points in the international process of considering whether to add new chemical to an annex to the stockholm pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol however hr 4800 would require epa to publish notice within 45 days of each decision point whereas hr 4591 would allow epa 60 days to act information gathering within 60 days of the publication of the first and second such public notices by epa h r 4800 would require all manufacturers processors distributors in commerce for expor t and disposers of the chemical being considered to provide to epa specified information to assist the agency in evaluating the case for adding the chemical rulemaking for new chemicals if new chemical were added by amendment of annex or b to the stoc kholm pops convention or annex i or ii to the lrtap pops protocol epa would be re quired within one year to publish in the federal register either of the following proposed rule to prohibit or rest rict us manufacture processing distribution in commerce for expor t use or disposal for such chemical under title v statement that such proposed rule has been issued under other federal law and final rule will be issued within two years statement that additional regulation is not necessary because thechemical already is regulated or proposed decision not to prohib it or restrict us manufacture processing distribution in commerce for export use or disposal of the chemical because those activ ities are not likely to lead to significant adverse human hea lth or environmental effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs12 within two years of the date of publicati on of proposed rule or proposed decision hr 4800 would require epa to publish in the federal register final rule or final decision but such rules could take effect only if the united states had consented to be bound by the listing of the chemical hr 4800 would require epa to develop and promulgate rules using the notice and comment procedure of 5 usc 553 minimum standard of stringency would be established for all title v rules propos ed and final rules to regulate chemical that is newly listed in an annex to an international agreement and any existing regulations that epa has identified in published statement as being adequate to regulate such chemical must at minimum implement control measures specified for that chemical in the relevant international agreement and must protect against significant adverse human health and environmental effects these rulemaking criteria would be substituted for the rulema king criteria in tsca 6 in addition hr 4800 would prohibit manufacture pro cessing distribution in commerce for export use and disposal that is inconsistent with regulations promulgated under t itle v for any newly listed chemical the bill would provide exemptions consistent with the international agreements pic convention most provisions of hr 4800 that implement the pic convention are similar to provisions of hr 4591 with few exceptions for example hr 4800 explicitly authorizes epa to promulgate rules to facilitate implementation of and ensu re compliance with the pic convention in add ition export of trace concentrations of pic ch emicals is not explicitly authorized state preemption state and local requirement s would not be preempted by hr 4800 unless they were less stringent than requirements adopted by the united states under tsca title v judicial review finally hr 4800 would authorize any person to file petition for judicial review of final rule or final decision the court would be directed to apply the review standard at 5 usc 706 which would set aside an agency rule or decision found to be arbitr ary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law comparison of hr 4591 and hr 4800 hr 4591 and hr 4800 both aim to authorize epa to implement the stockholm pops convention the lrtap po ps protocol and the pic convention by proposing amendments to tsca the b ills would add new title v to the end of the act and would prohibit subject to certain exceptions the manufacture processing distribution in commerce for ex port use and disposal of 12 specified chemical substances on the other hand these are competing bills in which many small provisions and veral key provisions differ of particular note are provisions pertaining to the regulation of chemicals that might be added to the stockholm pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol by amendment generally it appears that hr 4591 would provide circumscribed author ity to epa to regulate such chemicals to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment requirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs13 extensive analysis of options and prescribe regulatory outcomes that achieve reasonable balance of social environmental and economic costs and benefits hr 4800 would provide clear authority to regulate in accord with amendments to the international agreements and prescribe chemical regulations that protect against significant adverse human health and environmental effects some specific differences in policy appro aches are discussed below rulemaking for new chemicals the bills differ significantly in the scope and direction of regulatory authority provided to epa with respect to chemical that might be added by an amendment to annex or b to the stockholm pops convention or annex i or ii to the lr tap pops protocol hr 4591 would authorize but not mandate re gulations to prohibit or restrict us manufacture processing distribution in commerce for expor t use or disposal for newly listed chemical authority would be provided to the extent necessary to meet obligations of the united states under the relevant in ternational agreement and rules could become effective only if the united states consented to be bound by the amendment in contrast hr 4800 requires epa to regu late newly listed ch emicals unless similar regulations have been or are being prom ulgated under another fe deral law or epa decides that us manufacture processing distribution in commerce for export use or disposal of the chemical is not likely to lead to significant adverse human health or environmental effects hr 4800 imposes twoyear deadline to ensure timely promulgation or decision hr 4591 as amended also would require timely decision by the administration with respect to addition of chemical through an amendment to annex or b to the stockholm pops conve ntion or annex i or ii to the lrtap pops protocol if the administration did not deposit an instrument of ratification acceptance accession or approval of the ame ndment within one year of the listing decision by the international body epa would be required to publish in the federal register notice 1 of decision to initiate rulemaking 2 that rulemaking process would not be initiated or 3 indi cating the status of deliberations about whether to publish notice and an estimate of the timeframe expected for decision the regulatory criteria and processes proposed by the bills also differ hr 4591 would authorize epa rulemaking that was necessary to protect human health and the environment in manner that achieves reasonable balance of social environmental and economic co sts and benefits to provi basis for rule epa would be required to consider the following the effects of such chemical on health and the environment and the magnitude and impacts of exposure the benefits of the chemical for various uses and the availability risks and economic consequences of substitutes the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the proposed regulations after c onsidering the effect on the national economy small busine ss technological innovation the environment and public health including the degree to which the manufacture processi ng distribution in commerce for export use or disposal of the chemical is necessary tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs14 17 some of these requirements could be satisfi ed at least in part by analyses already conducted in connection with rulemaking epa r outinely analyzes costs benefits and risks of chemicals it is regulating sometimes including the costs benefits and risks of substitutes for important uses of those chemicals analysis of the risks benefits and costs of rules is required for significant rules under executive order 12866 regulatory planning and review the unfunded mandates reform act 2 usc 15011571 and the regulatory flexibility act as amended by the small bu siness regulatory enforcement fairness act 5 usc 601 et seq 18 this same language appears in the stock holm pops convention artic 8 paragraph 7a in which it is provided as part of the basis fo r evaluating risk profile of chemical being considered for listing in annex b or c if the poprc decides based on its evaluation of the risk profile that chemical is likely to lead to significant adverse human health andor environmental effects the proposal to add the chemical proceeds to the third stage in which possible control measures are evaluatedprevent significant harm to an important sector of the economy and national and international consequences likely to ariseincluding possible conseque nces of using alternative products or processes due to us regulatory action 17 hr 4591 would require assessments of risk or effects to use sound and objective scientific practices and determine the weight of the scientific evidence concerning such risks or effects based on the best available scientific information including peerreviewed studies all of th is scientific informa tion would be part of the rulemaking record and subject to j udicial review rulemaking under hr 4591 would follow the procedure established by the administrative procedure act 5 usc 553 hr 4800 would replace the rulemaking pr ovisions of tsca section 6 with new standard for us regulations under tsca title v to protect against significant adverse human health and environmental effects18 and at minimum to implement the control measures specified for that chemical in the relevant annex to an international agreement rules woul d be proposed and made final through the notice and comment procedure of the admin istrative procedure act 5 usc 553 specific analyses would be required but epa routinely analyzes costs benefits and risks of chemicals it is regulating sometimes

any person to petition the court for judicial review of final rule or decision within 60 days of its issuance the bills provide different standards of review however while hr 4800 would direct the court to reject rules that are arbitrary and capricious hr 4591 would require thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs15 19 mcgrath matthew j 1986 convergence of the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards of review during informal rulemaking 54 geo wash l rev 541 20 generally at that point the chemical woul d already be regulated domestically because it is the general policy of the united states to defer final approval ie ratification of an agreement or amendment until domestic law is in place rules be supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record taken as whole both standards are containe d in title v section 706 of the united states code section 706 applies the arbitrary and capricious standard to federal regulations developed using the notice and comment procedure of 5 usc 553 which includes rules implementing most environmental statutes the substantial evidence standard of 5 usc 706 applie s to rules promulgated under tsca 6c which employs rulemaking process and h earing format that is unique to tsca relative to the arbitrary and capricious standard the substantial evidence standard arguably places greater burden on the federal agency to prove its compliance with statutory directives howe ver reviewing courts have often melded the two standards together when assessi ng the propriety of agency actions19 information gathering the bills also take different approaches to gathering information about chemical when it is being considered as possible addition to an international agreement by amendment of an annex hr 4591 would authorize epa to issue administrative orders to ma nufacturers and others requiring them to submit specified information hr 4800 w ould direct manufacturers and others to provide such information to epa within 60 days of publication of the first and second notices that chemical is being considered for listing in an annex to an international agreement sense of the congress another significant difference between the bills is the statement in hr 4591 but not in hr 4800 that it is the sense of the congress that the united states should declare its intention to ratify each amendment to an annex before that amendment may enter into force for the united states that is that the president should choose the opt in treaty provision moreover hr 4591 would require the president as appropr iate to consult with congress before consenting to bind the united states to an amendment to annex b or c of the stockholm pops convention state preemption the bills differ too in th eir approaches to preemption of state and local laws hr 4591 would preempt all state and local laws that pertain to any chemical listed in an annex to the stockholm pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol if the united states has consented to be bound by an amendment to the international agreement that listed that chemical20 state and local laws would be permitted only if they were identical to the federal requirement dopted under another federal law or pr ohibited the use of the chemical within the relevant jurisdiction this approach to preemption is identical to the existing provision of tsca for chemicals regulated under section 5 or 6 hr 4591 also retains the tsca 18b process in which st ates may petition for relief from the preemption provision in contrast hr 4800 would not preempt st ate and local laws unless more stringent federal regulations had been promulgated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33336crs16 21 stockholm pops convention means th 2001 stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants lrtap pops protocol refers
