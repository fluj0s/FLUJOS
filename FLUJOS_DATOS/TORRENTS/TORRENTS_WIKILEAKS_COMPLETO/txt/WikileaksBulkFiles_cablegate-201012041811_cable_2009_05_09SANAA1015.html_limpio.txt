behind yemens internal woes classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary during 40minute meeting at his residence in taiz president saleh confirmed to dd cia kappes his intention to permit yemenis to enter the saudi rehab program upon their release from guantanamo an issue that he said he will discuss king abdullah during visit to riyadh on may 31 saleh also ranked the threats to yemens security in the following order aqap the houthi rebellion and the southern movement all of which he suggested were being driven by external forces end summary 2 s dd kappes and his traveling party accompanied by the ambassador and polmil chief flew on may 28 to taiz some 200 km south of sanaa in yemeni air force m171 helicopter to meet with president saleh at his quarters there saleh appeared relaxed greeting his visitors in an opencollar white shirt and dark trousers note over salehs left eye were visible the traces of cut he suffered midmay in fall on the deck of the swimming pool at the presidential palace in sanaa end note after opening pleasantries saleh referred to the ongoing debate in the us regarding the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility especially criticism of the plan to transfer some detainees into us prisons noting that we have agreed to send yemenis to saudi arabia kappes said he understood potus was very grateful for salehs support in this matter and added that details of the prisoner transfer to saudi arabia were being worked out saleh said that he would discuss the issue with king abdullah when he travelled to riyadh on may 31 note we understand that gcc foreign ministers also will meet in riyadh next week and that on the margins of that meeting they will convene separate session on yemen to which foreign minister qirbi has been invited end note 3 s saleh then noted what he characterized as an agreement by the bush administration to finance construction of an extremist rehabilitation facility in yemen the estimated cost of which is 11m saleh expressed his understanding that the yemeni detainees would be placed first in the saudi rehab program and then transferred home once the facility here was built and ready to receive them saleh also mentioned his appointment with president obama which he said the two had discussed during their recent phone call as to the timing of this visit kappes suggested it was most likely that the invitation would be extended once the transfer of yemeni detainees to ksa was underway saleh replied send them all to saudi arabia now they already have facility 4 s turning to alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap kappes praised cooperation between us and yemeni intelligence agencies he noted that the usg remains as determined as ever to destroy aq worldwide to which saleh replied i hope this campaign continues and succeeds were doing the same here our position is unshakable kappes expressed concern that aqap was targeting saleh himself point saleh agreed with asserting that royg security services had recently arrested an individual they believe was going to fire surfacetoair missile at the presidential plane during recent trip to aden comment we hadnt heard of this incident previously although there were reports of plans to attack salehs plane in similar manner earlier this year as he prepared to depart sanaa for kuwait end comment 5 s on current unrest in the south saleh asserted that we are not that worried this is not new these are the same people who tried to break away in 1994 then even with an army and an air force they failed they will fail again without external assistance he noted that one difference now is that the secessionists are exploiting international media such as arabiclanguage satellite channels jazeera and hurra note saleh was referring to an interview with haidar alattas former southern leader that alhurra aired earlier this month end note kappes noted that us policy in support of yemens unity remains unchanged and saleh said that such support was most important he asked that the us pressure other countries to do the same referring to the uk which he said is housing the movements leaders and providing them media access leave the internal situation to us saleh said well handle it asserting that the military option was last resort he said that the royg strategy will rally the voices of southerners in support of unity which he described as the majority of the population as counterweight to the minority in favor of independence he also sought usg support for royg efforts to persuade gcc countries to permit yemenis to enter their labor markets our young people need jobs he said especially if they are to be immunized against the lure of extremist ideology comment at dinner for kappes on wednesday night the saudi ambassador said that his embassy has issued 36000 visas to yemenis seeking work in ksa in the last two and onehalf months end comment 6 s kappes said that the latest economic figures from yemen must be cause for concern point saleh didnt dispute characterizing the current economic situation as very bad kappes then asked saleh to rankorder the threats to yemens security noting conversation last fall when discussion focused on alqaeda the houthi rebellion and southern unrest saleh initially said that all three were on the same level then corrected himself to prioritize aqap as the most severe threat followed by the houthis and then the situation in the south even if we told the south tomorrow you are free to separate they would turn around the next day and start to fight with each other he said adding that such lack of internal cohesion greatly diminished the risk to yemens security on the other hand he said aqap terrorists prepared to detonate explosive vests pose much greater risk to internal security as does the houthi rebellion given the external support the royg insists it receives from iran and hizballah 7 s comment salehs decision to reverse himself and characterize aqap as the most serious threat facing yemen was almost certainly taken with his usg interlocutors in mind as was one suspects his dismissal of the risk posed to his regime by the increasingly militant southernindependence movement nor was it coincidental that saleh was quick to blame foreign powers for the nations woes from the uk qatar and libya aiding the southerners to iran and hizballah engineering the houthi rebellion in the north to an international terrorist conspiracy fueling aqaps growth the implication is that yemen is beset by forces that it will be hardpressed to repel without substantial external support this argument is of course also tailored to salehs usg audience and meant to elicit the necessary level of political economic and military assistance to forestall yemens collapse and the negative effects it would have on regional stability and security end comment seche
