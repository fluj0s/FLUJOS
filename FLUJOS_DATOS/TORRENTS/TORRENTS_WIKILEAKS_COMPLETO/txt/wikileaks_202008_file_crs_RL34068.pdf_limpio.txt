that allows the federal government to civilly commit sexually dangerous persons civil commitment as it relates to sex offenders is when state retains custody of an individual found by judge or jury to be sexually dangerous person by involuntarily committing the person to secure mental health facility after the offenders prison sentence is done in 1990 the state of washington passed the first civil commitment law for sexually dangerous persons currently 18 other states and the federal government have similar laws moreover the supreme court in kansas v hendricks and kansas v crane ruled that current civil commitment laws are constitutional the civil commitment of sex offenders centers on the belief that sex offenders are more likely than other offenders to reoffend however data on sex offender recidivism is varied data show that the recidivism risk for sex offenders may be lower than it is typically thought to be in fact some studies show that sex offenders recidivate at lower rate than many other criminals other studies show that given time almost all sex offenders will commit new sex crime most discussions about recidivism examine ways to decrease recidivism for example by providing sex offenders with treatment research on the efficacy of sex offender treatment is promising but it cannot prove that treatment reduces recidivism cognitivebehavioral techniques appear to be the most promising type of treatment for sex offenders although some research indicates that offenders who receive diagnosis of psychopathy may be less amenable to treatment for civil commitment to be effective practitioners must be able to identify sex offenders who pose high risk of reoffending although the ability of practitioners to identify offenders has improved there is still the possibility that an offender who would not reoffend might be committed moreover determining when it is safe to release sex offender from custody is still difficult for practitioners such concerns have raised questions about alternatives to civil commitment one potential alternative is the use of less restrictive measures such as intensive community supervision another alternative is the use of indeterminate sentences for sex offenders the cost of civil commitment programs has fueled debate about other viable means for managing dangerous sex offenders data show that civil commitment programs are expensive when compared with traditional incarceration or community supervision the cost of civil commitment programs is expected to grow as more offenders are committed an issue for congress is whether civil commitment is sustainable policy for dealing with sexually dangerous persons or whether there is different way to manage this population effectively the issue of civil commitment raises series of concomitant questions how much do civil commitment programs cost how dangerous are sex offenders is sex offender treatment effective can sexually dangerous persons be defined and identified

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g343g561 in 1990 the state of washington passed law that allows for the civil commitment of sex offenders civil commitment as it relates to sex offenders is when state retains custody of an individual found by judge or jury to be sexually dangerous person by involuntarily committing the person to secure mental health facility after the offenders prison sentence is done the state of washington law requires the state to prove that such offenders suffer from mental abnormality or personality disorder that would make them likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence unless they are confined 2 the law allows for civil commitment after an offender completes prison sentence for his or her crimes since 1990 19 states have passed similar legislation3 and in 2006 congress passed legislation pl 109248 that allows the attorney general to civilly commit federal inmates who are found to be sexually dangerous persons every state has civil commitment laws that allow for the involuntarily hospitalization of people with serious mental illness 4 generally speaking people can be civilly committed when they are danger to others when persons symptoms begin to remit the individual is discharged and typically referred to aftercare services hospital stays for individuals under civil commitment order for mental illness rarely exceed 30 days however in this report civil commitment refers to civil commitment laws targeted at the hospitalization or commitment to secure institution of sexually violent persons after they are released from prison with respect to sex offenders civil commitment laws allow states and now the federal government to civilly commit sexually dangerous persons for the most part discussions about sexually dangerous persons treat sex offenders as homogenous group sometimes making distinction between rapists and child molesters however sex offenders are heterogeneous group of offenders under many state statutes sex offenses range from rape to child molestation to exhibitionism an issue for congress is whether civil commitment is sustainable policy for dealing with sexually dangerous persons or whether there is different way to manage this population effectively the issue of civil commitment raises series of concomitant questions how much do civil commitment programs cost how dangerous are sex offenders is sex offender treatment effective can sexually dangerous persons be defined and identified are there less restrictive alternatives for managing sex offenders this report begins with an outline of the history of civil commitment laws followed by review of two cases kansas v hendricks and kansas v crane in which the supreme court addressed constitutional issues

are reincarnation of what are generally referred to as sexual psychopath 5 laws beginning in the 1930s states started to enact sexual psychopath laws which grew out of the rehabilitative ideal that characterized the american criminal justice system at the time6 by the mid1960s more than half of the states in the country had enacted some form of sexual psychopath laws7 sexual psychopath laws reflected the growing belief that sexual psychopaths could be identified and treated8 the influence of psychiatry on sexual psychopath laws can be seen in the four presumptions on which the laws were based 1 sexual psychopaths are distinguishable from generic sex offenders 2 individuals commit sex offenses because of mental disease 3 mental diseases are treatable and curable and 4 mental health professional can successfully predict who will commit sex crimes in the future 9 sexual psychopath laws were designed to offer alternatives to prison for sex offenders and to prevent further harm to other members of society by incapacitating the offender10 after court found an offender to be sexual psychopath the offender was sent to mental health facility for control and treatment in lieu of imprisonment and punishment11 sexual psychopath laws targeted offenders who were not seriously mentally ill thus not making them candidates for traditional civil commitment but who were believed to have psychopathic personality that caused their criminal behavior 12 starting in the 1970s many of the sexual psychopath laws were repealed modified or abandoned13 many states eventually abolished sexual psychopath laws because of criticism from 5 sexual psychopaths were offenders who did not suffer from serious mental illness but who were believed to have psychopathic personality that caused

g345g561the group for the advancement of psychiatry gap and the american bar associations abas criminal justice mental health standards14 such criticism contended that labeling offenders as sexual psychopaths lacked scientific merit the treatment of sex offenders was ineffective and the prediction of future offending was suspect15 in 1977 gap stated that first and foremost sexual psychopath and sexual offender statutes can best be described as approaches that have failed the discrepancy between the promises in sex statutes and performances have rarely been resolved the notion is naive and confusing that hybrid amalgam of law and psychiatry can validly label person sex psychopath or sex offender and then treat him in manner consistent with guarantee of community safety the mere assumption that such heterogeneous legal classification could define treatability and make people amenable to treatment is not fallacious it is startling 16 there was growing intolerance for the idea of treating sex offenders after series of treated and released sex offenders committed additional sex crimes17 beginning in the 1970s states started to adopt more traditional criminal justice model for managing dangerous sex offenders such as incarcerating sex offenders instead of placing them under the supervision of mental health institutions18 starting in the 1990s some states passed legislation reminiscent of the old sexual psychopath laws in 1990 washington became the first state to pass new sexual predator civil commitment law19 other states passed similar legislation since that time as of june 2007 19 states have sexual predator civil commitment laws each state had its own impetus for passing its civil commitment law but generally speaking the reasons for enacting such laws are similar in many states the laws were passed in response to particularly heinous sex crime 20 the change in the 1970s and 1980s in most states from an indeterm inate to determinate sentencing structure21 allowed some sex offenders to be released from prison after relatively short period of incarceration22 there was also growing change in societal attitudes and behavior towards violence against women23 in addition general civil commitment laws were considered inadequate to confine sex offenders who were considered dangerous24 general civil commitment laws required proof of serious mental disorder such as schizophrenia and recent behavior 14 rudolph alexander jr the united states supreme court and the civil commitment of sex offenders the prison journal vol 83 3 september 2004 p

g346g561indicating that the individual was dangerous many states could not commit sex offenders under general civil commitment laws because the state could not demonstrate that such offenders 1 had medically recognized mental disorder and 2 had engaged in recent behavior that proved that they were dangerous the population in question was usually incarcerated which limited offenders from engaging in sexually dangerous behavior generally civil commitment laws that target sexually dangerous persons have similar structure they require 1 proof of past course of sexually harmful conduct 2 current mental disorder or abnormality 3 finding of risk of future sexually harmful conduct and 4 some connection between the mental abnormality and the danger25 although similarities exist between the old sexual psychopath laws and civil commitment laws they vary in some key aspects rather than providing an alternative to imprisonment civil commitment laws require sex offenders to be committed after they complete their terms of incarceration 26 also civil commitment laws do not require an allegation or proof of recent crim inal dangerous or inappropriate behavior or deteriorating mental state before the state can seek commitment27 civil commitment laws have been both politically and legally contentious because they allow sex offenders to be confined after their criminal sentence is completed moreover some members of the psychiatric community have challenged the validity of the legislatively created definition of mental abnormality for example the washington state psychiatric association wspa testified before the washington state legislature when it was considering civil commitment legislation one psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the wspa noted that psychiatrists definition of mental disorder includes the loss of contact with reality confusion loss of reason and hallucinations 28 some sex offenders however do not demonstrate any of these behaviors according to the wspa the issue is not mental disorders but rather abnormal behavior29 persons who have committed more than one sex offense are assumed to be depraved or sick or to have some type of mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes them likely to re offend30 several offenders have attempted to challenge their civil commitment in court civilly committed offenders argue that civil commitment laws are unconstitutional because they allow offenders to be committed after they have completed their sentences even if they do not suffer from medically recognized mental disorder two legal challenges to civil commitment laws have made it to the united states supreme court kansas v hendricks and kansas v crane 25 janus p 9 26 wl fitch p 491 27 ibid 28 james d reardon sexual

predator act33 which was enacted to address the issue of repeat sexual offenders although kansas law already contained provision for the confinement of the mentally ill the kansas legislature found that this statute was inadequate in its application to sex offenders according to the acts preamble small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for involuntary treatment pursuant to the general involuntary civil commitment statute in contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment under the general involuntary civil commitment statute sexually violent predators generally have antisocial personality features which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those features render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior the legislature further finds that sexually violent predators likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high the existing involuntary commitment procedure is inadequate to address the risk these sexually violent predators pose to society the legislature further finds that the prognosis for rehabilitating sexually violent predators in prison setting is poor the treatment needs of this population are very long term and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the general involuntary civil commitment statute as traditional methods of civil confinement were found to be inappropriate kansas created civil commitment procedure specifically for sexual predators under this act sexually violent predators were defined as any person who has been convicted of or charged with sexually violent offense and who suffers from mental bnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence34 this definition was intended to be applied regardless of whether person had been previously convicted of sexual offense in hendricks the state sought to commit defendant who had been convicted of taking indecent liberties with two 13yearold boys and who had rved nearly 10 years in prison for that crime shortly before his scheduled release kansas filed petition seeking to confine the defendant as sexually violent predator after trial that considered the defendants long history of pedophilia the defendant was civilly committed the court first considered whether the act violated the defendants substantive due process

g348g561to control their behavior and who thereby pose danger to the publics health and safety35 thus the question in the hendricks case was whether the act met that standard the court noted that the statute required more than proof of predisposition to violence in that it also required evidence of past sexually violent behavior and present mental condition that created likelihood of such conduct in the future because the act specifically required finding of dangerousness either to oneself or to others before person is civilly committed it was found to be consistent with the requirements of due process 36 the court also considered two other arguments first it considered whether the application of the act was intended to punish hendricks for behavior that he had engaged in before passage of the law as this would run afoul of the prohibition on the passage of ex post facto laws second the court considered whether the act was being used to punish hendricks for behavior that he had previously been convicted and punished for in violation of the prohibitions on double jeopardy 37 the court noted that the resolution of both ex post facto and double jeopardy challenges turns on whether the challenged statute is found to be punitive or regulatory in nature the supreme court has long held that the ex post facto clause limits congress from passing criminal or penal laws that have retrospective effect38 however when the statute in question is not clearly criminal in nature question may arise as to whether the challenged law is actually imposing penalty for past conduct39 for instance when convicted sex offenders were subject to the retroactive application of an alaskan statute requiring convicted sex offenders to register with much of the resulting information being made public the statute was upheld as nonpunitive regulatory scheme40 determining what is punitive is multistep process sometimes referred to as the intenteffects test first court must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish civil or criminal proceedings to do so court will examine statutes text and structure to determine the legislative objective 41 if the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment that ends the inquiry42 if however the intention was to enact regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive court must then determine whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the governments intention to deem it civil43 only the clearest proof will allow court to override legislative intent and find that civil remedy is in fact punitive44 35 foucha v louisiana 504 us 71 1992 in order to continue confinement after finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness the government must show that the

civil in nature describing it as civil commitment procedure and placing it within the kansas probate code instead of the criminal code second the court held the act did not implicate either of the two primary objectives of criminal punishment retribution or deterrence the court found that prior criminal conduct was considered under the act not as means to punish for prior conduct but as evidence for the regulatory purpose of determining dangerousness further the court noted that offenders could be committed even if they had been acquitted for prior criminal conduct finally the court noted that unlike traditional punishment the confinement is indefinite in scope and is reviewed on an annual basis similarly the court found that for purposes of double jeopardy the application of the act had none of the attributes of punishment because the act is civil in nature instituting commitment proceedings after criminal case for the same crime has been concluded does not constitute second prosecution 45 consequently the court concluded that neither the ex post facto clause or double jeopardy was implicated by the application of the act46

defendant in question was previously convicted sexual offender who apparently suffered from both exhibitionism and antisocial personality disorder in crane the court considered the issue of whether civil commitment statute beyond showing the likelihood of dangerousness must also show that defendant cannot control his or her dangerous behavior while rejecting the argument that the individual be completely unable to control their behavior the court did reaffirm language from the hendricks case noting that the kansas act required that it be difficult if not impossible for the dangerous person to control his dangerous behavior while recognizing the difficulty of setting precise standard for the degree of volition required the court did indicate that state woul d have to show that defendant had serious difficulty in controlling his or her impulses49

some it is not matter of if sex offenders will reoffend but when they will reoffend51 the civil commitment of sex offenders hinges on the belief that sex offenders are more likely to recidivate52 this section evaluates the threat that sex offenders pose to the public by reviewing four studies of sex offender recidivism g14g146g150g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g21g157g158g141g146g142g156g561g152g151g561g21g142g161g561g17g143g143g142g151g141g142g155g561g20g142g140g146g141g146g159g146g156g150g561 although an increasing number of studies have at tempted to capture the recidivism rate of sex offenders each study suffers from inherent limitations first sexual offenses are usually underreported which means that many of the traditional measures of recidivism such as rearrest or reconviction underestimate the true amount of recidivism amongst sex offenders53 moreover debate exists about what type of outcome measure should be used to measure recidivism the broader the outcome measure eg rearrest compared with reconviction the greater the reported recidivism rate second many studies tend to report recidivism rates for sex offenders as whole rather than for more homogenous groups of sex offenders eg rapists intrafamiliar child molesters extrafamiliar child molesters and exhibitionists which can affect the rate because evidence shows that different groups of sex offenders have different recidivism rates 54 for example if study measured the recidivism rate for group of released sex offenders composed primarily of convicted rapists it might have higher recidivism rate than group of released sex offenders composed primarily of intrafamiliar child molesters third many studies include only incarcerated sex offenders not sex offenders who are placed on probation which means the sample might not reflect the true population of sex offenders55 finally the length of the follow up period can affect the reported recidivism rate the longer the followup period the greater the recidivism rate although five year follow up period is common for many studies of sex offender recidivism research has shown that some sex offenders may commit new crimes 10 15 or 20 years after being released from incarceration or community supervision 56

that may account for why the three studies discussed above found different recidivism rates for sex offenders first the studies had different followup periods76 second the samples in the studies were composed of different types of sex offenders ie rapists child molesters sexual assaulters and statutory rapists which could have affected the recidivism rate77 third the sex offender samples in the two nonbjs studies were from multiple countries and the studies were conducted in different years the data on sex offender recidivism are varied and as discussed above studies have inherent limitations however the data indicate that sex offenders when compared with other violent offenders may not be the highrisk offenders that they are perceived to be some argue that any risk of recidivism given the impact sex crimes have on their victims is too great for the community others argue however that given the fact that sex offenders pose similar risk to the community as other violent offenders the need for special measures to monitor and control sex offenders such as civil commitment are unwarranted any discussion about recidivism almost inevitably includes discussion about ways to decrease recidivism sex offender treatment is viewed as one way to decrease sex offender recidivism as discussed above civil commitment is meant to provide treatment to sexually dangerous persons civilly committed offenders are confined until treatment renders them longer dangerous to others the literature on sex offender treatment is reviewed in the next section

it is likely that there will be burgeoning population of civilly committed sex offenders that will never be released however questions linger about the efficacy of sex offender treatment recent research provides evidence that sex offender treatments might reduce recidivism but the degree to which the treatments are effective is uncertain

that there was compelling evidence that sex offender treatment reduced recidivism however they also could not conclude that sex offender treatment was failure80 they noted that variety of methodological shortcomings were present in mo st every study they reviewed which made the results from any single study hard to interpret81 the methodological shortcomings in most studies prevented the researchers from using metaanalytic techniques which would have allowed them to draw more definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of sex offender treatment82 the researchers also noted that sex offender treatment has continued to evolve and many of the treatment programs evaluated in the studies would now be considered obsolete83 1996 government accountability office gao report on the effectiveness of sex offender treatment found that the research was inconclusive84 the research included in the gaos analysis was generally more recent than the research included in the analysis discussed above the gao included 22 studies in its analysis which were published between 1977 and 199685 ten studies were published after 1990 and one was unpublished at the time of the analysis the gao reported that some of the research indicated that cognitivebehavioral86 treatment was promising but methodological limitations in the studies prevented it from drawing any firm conclusions about effectiveness87 the gao reported that conclusions about the effectiveness of sex offender treatment were limited by three general weaknesses in the research 1 limitations in the methodological designs

and cognitivebehavioral treatment antiandrogens reduce the level of sex offenders circulating testosterone91 studies have shown that decreased testosterone levels have resulted in reductions in selfreported deviant sexual fantasies and paraphilic symptoms in sex offenders92 research suggests that antiandrogen treatment may reduce sex offender recidivism in many cases93 antiandrogens do have side effects which might explain the high dropout rate for offenders who use them94 antiandrogen treatment requires high level of medical supervision which can be costly95 also doctors do not know what the longterm effects of the treatment are96 another metaanalysis study found that overall cognitivebehavioral treatment appears to be promising way to reduce recidivism in sex offenders97 research also shows that cognitive behavioral treatment combined with other treatments such as relapse prevention98 group therapy or social skills training99 can help prevent recidivism100 cognitivebehavioral treatments are some of the most common forms of therapy for sex offenders101 cognitivebehavioral treatments seek to change sex offenders belief system eliminate inappropriate behavior and increase 90 the recidivism rates were based on an average 46month followup period using the recidivism criteria reported in the original studies the study also found the same to be true

include social skills training victim empathy training108 lifestyle management sex education and relapse prevention because violent sex offenders ie rapists and child molesters are the most likely candidates for civil commitment there are concerns about whether treatment can decrease recidivism research indicates that treatment for incarcerated sex offenders who are more likely to be violent sex offenders is promising but the findings ar somewhat mixed one study found that offenders who were treated in prison had 94 recidivism rate compared with 176 recidivism rate for untreated offenders109 another study indicated that cognitivebehavioral treatment for incarcerated sex offenders can decrease recidivism but the effect of treatment is smaller than the effect of treatment for nonincarcerated sex offenders110 other research found that although cognitivebehavioral treatment for incarcerated sex offenders looks promising the evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusion about the effectiveness of treatment for incarcerated offenders111 studies that evaluate the effectiveness of sex offender treatment can only determine whether the treatment was effective as long as the researchers are following the treated offenders to see if they recidivate it is possible that treated offenders might recidivate after the followup period ends which raises questions about how long treatmen t should be shown to decrease recidivism in order to be considered effective if form of treatment is shown to decrease recidivism for five years is it effective one researcher found that the longer sex offender can remain offensefree the greater the likelihood that the offender will not recidivate 112 therefore any treatment 102 ibid p 354 103 aversion therapy pairs deviant sexual fantasies with punishment such as an electric shock or noxious odor the therapy links the deviant fantasy with the punishment thereby decreasing the desire to act on the deviant fantasy ibid 104 covert sensitization pairs deviant sexual fantasies with mental images of adverse consequences such as being arrested for sexual offending sometimes offenders are required to subject themselves to noxious odor to augment the imagined adverse consequences like aversion therapy covert sensitization links the deviant fantasy with the punishment thereby decreasing the desire to act upon the deviant fantasy ibid 105 imaginal desensitization teaches the offender deep muscle relaxation techniques which are paired with fantasies of chain of events that lead to sexual offense the therapy is meant to teach offenders to tolerate the feelings associated with sexual offending without acting on them ibid 106 in mastubatory reconditioning offe nders use masturbation to reinforce nondeviant fantasies

of offenders who may be likely candidates for civil commitment may make them less likely to benefit from treatmen t potential candidates for civil commitment especially rapists might be diagnosed with psychopathy113 or antisocial personality disorder aspd114 offenders diagnosed with aspd or psychopathy may not be as amenable to treatment as offenders diagnosed with paraphilias115 candidates for civil commitment are also by definition repeat offenders according to one researcher repeat offenders are more likely not to complete treatment than firsttime offenders116 moreover candidates for civil commitment are likely to have served long prison sentences before being committed if an offender did not receive treatment in prison before being committed it may make treatment more difficult117 delays in treatment could allow offenders to deny their sexual offending externalize responsibility or claim amnesia for their offenses such distortions make it harder for offenders to accept responsibility for their offenses thus making it harder to treat them118 questions also exist regarding whether involuntary treatment can reduce sex offender recidivism most of the recent literature on treatment involves sex offenders who wanted to receive treatment119 this is noteworthy because civil commitment laws require treatment for offenders who at least initially chose not to participate in treatment many experts believe that there is sound evidence that sex offender treatment can reduce recidivism120 however other researchers warn that more research needs to be done because currently it cannot be proven that treatment is effective121 results are less than definitive because there is not large body of highly rigorous treatment research in conclusion the research

recent research has addressed many of the methodological problems of past research but issues still remain122 as mentioned before faults in the methodology used in some research can limit the generalizability of the findings the issues include the following in some cases treatment groups are limited to sex offenders who meet stringent criteria thereby treating only sex offenders who are the most likely to respond to treatment 123 some studies provided treatment for sex offenders that was questionably implemented124 some studies did not use comparison group and in other studies that did offenders were not randomly assigned to either the treatment or comparison group125 some studies did not count offenders who refused treatment or those who dropped out of treatment when calculating the recidivism rate of treated and untreated offenders therefore the lower recidivism rates for treated offenders in these studies could be the result of the fact that treatment groups consisted of offenders who were more open to treatment 126 in some studies recidivism is narrowly defined studies only count new sex offenses when calculating recidivism or studies rely only on one data source to determine whether or not treated offender recidivated127 the length of the followup period in some studies might be too short to effectively determine recidivism128 research has shown that the longer the followup period the greater the rate of recidivism129 g21g142g149g142g140g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 notwithstanding the supreme courts rulings that addressed

and management of sex offenders have been passed in many states out of concern that sex offenders are not only dangerous but they are more likely to commit new sex crimes some research indicates that sex offenders do not specialize in sex crimes hence it might be difficult to label an offender simply as rapist or child molester130 one researcher reported that convicted rapists selfreport sexual contact with children and convicted child molesters have admitted to raping adult females131 most sex crimes are committed by offenders with extensive criminal histories that involve other violent and property crimes132 in many cases sex crimes are committed by individuals as part of pattern of violent and nonviolent offending this section presents data from both the 2002 bjs report on the recidivism rates of 272111 prisoners released in 1994 and the 2003 bjs report on the recidivism rates of 9961 sex offenders released in 1994 to analyze whether sex offenders specialize in sex crimes this section reviews data on the relative likelihood that violent offenders were rearrested for the same crime for which they were incarcerated next this section reviews data on how many rapists sexual assaulters child molesters and statutory rapists were rearrested and reconvicted for any type of crime within three years of being released finally this section also reviews data on the criminal histories of released rapist sexual assaulters child molesters and statutory rapists data indicate that sex offenders do specialize in sex crimes to some degree but they also commit other crimes table 2 shows the likelihood that released violent offenders were rearrested for the same crime the odds of rapist being rearrested for rape was 42 times the odds of nonrapist being rearrested for rape 133 the odds of sexual assaulter being rearrested for another sexual assault was 59 times the odds of nonsexual assaulter being rearrested for sexual assault the odds ratios for rapist and sexual assaulter relative to the odds ratios for murderers robbers and assaulters suggest that rapists and sexual assaulters are more likely than other violent offenders to be rearrested for the same crime in all cases the odds ratios for rapists and sexual assaulters is at least double that of the odds ratios of other violent offenders 130 leonore mj simon an examination of the assumption of

than other sex offenders136 one study found that more than 80 of sex offenders released from maximum security psychiatric facility who were diagnosed with psychopathy were rearrested or returned to custody for violent offense within six years137 in comparison about 20 of nonpsychopathic offenders were rearrested or returned to custody for violent offense within six years138 however it should be noted that recidivism in this case was measured as arrest or return to custody for violent offense not just sex offenses other research found that high psychopathy checklistrevised pclr139 score was good predictor of violent recidivism in general140 however it also found that sexual recidivism was predicted by combination of high pclr score and deviant sexual arousal141

two general methods for predicting dangerousness clinical and actuarial 142 the clinical method involves clinician examining the offender and the offenders history including the offenders criminal record psychosexual history and other biographical information 143 the clinician weighs all he knows about the individual and then based on knowledge of risk factors makes judgement about the likelihood the offender will reoffend if the offender was released to live in the community without supervision 144 the clinician has the ability to decide how much weight if any to give each risk factor145 supporters of the clinical method argue that trained clinicians can shape their assessment based on cues that actuarial methods cannot pick up especially if the clinician interviews the

g344g346g561the actuarial method involves the use of actuarial instruments147 by trained individuals to predict the risk of reoffense actuarial instruments are developed by studying large numbers of repeat sex offenders and collecting data on their common characteristics148 researchers also collect data on the rate of reoffending by group of sex offenders with set of common characteristics actuarial tools predict the likelihood that offenders will reoffend based on how their characteristics match the characteristics of group of offenders with known reoffense rate supporters of actuarial instruments argue that the instruments are developed using proven statistical methods for calculating risk and that large number of repeat sex offenders have been studied to provide them with reliable predictive accuracy 149 supporters also maintain that the instrument prevents evaluators from introducing errors or bias thereby making them more objective both methods have their flaws some are particular to the method others are inherent to the nature of predicting risk studies indicate that clinical judgements about sex offender dangerousness are quite poor150 one researcher reported that number of studies that have evaluated the predictive accuracy of clinical judgements of sex offender dangerousness found that the average correlation between prediction of reoffending and actual offending was 010151 there is also the possibility that clinicians could introduce bias into the risk assessment such as giving more weight to some risk factors and less to others actuarial instruments can only identify range of risk for group of sex offenders they cannot identify the specific risk for any individual within the group152 given individual in the group might have risk of reoffending that is either higher or lower than the groups risk actuarial instruments rely heavily on static factors ie factors that do not change with time such as age at first offense number of victims and gender of victim when determining risk153 this means that when offenders are placed in risk group based on their history they will most likely stay in that risk group because their history cannot change there is also the possibility of type i errors154 one inherent problem in risk assessments for sex offenders is that sex offenders do not commit new sex crimes at high rates which means that there is low recidivism baserate155 upon which to predict risk156 however as discussed above 147 several actuarial instruments have been developed to predict the risk sex offenders pose they

advancements in determining whether an offender is at risk to reoffend not as much progress has been made in developing methods to determine when it is safe to release sex offenders from custody 157 predictions of dangerousness are based on static risk factors158 but predictions of safety are based on dynamic risk factors159 researchers have yet to accurately determine which dynamic risk factors are associated with decreased risk of sex offenders recidivating160 this is problematic because sex offender treatment attempts to decrease the risk of reoffending by changing dynamic risk factors some have argued that it is difficult to assess risk in an institutional setting because the offender does not have the opportunity to re offend 161 offenders do not face the same stimulations and opportunities in institutional setting that they will face in the community hence it is difficult to tell whether they can apply what they have learned in treatment162

release from confinement raises questions about whether less restrictive alternatives should be used to manage sexually dangerous persons some have argued that judges or juries should be allowed to in certain situations civilly commit an offender to outpatient treatment or if the offender is placed in an institution the offender should be released to community supervision after he shows improvement

specialized units that focus solely on the supervision of sex offenders165 some offenders under the supervision of these units are placed in an intensive probation supervision progra m offenders in this program are assigned to probation officer po with limited caseload that gives the po more time to monitor the offenders each po has maximum caseload of 25 probationers166 pos are supported by surveillance officers who make random field visits to offenders on their caseload pos also have maintenance caseload that is composed of offenders who have been on probation for several years and are considered lowrisk 167 all offenders begin probation on specialized caseload and are designated as highrisk until they have undergone an evaluation168 periodic reassessment is conducted to determine the risk the offender poses thereby determining the degree of supervision he will receive offenders also receive set of conditions for their supervision which can include requirements to attend sex offender treatment register as sex offender and restrictions on where the offender can live and with whom he can have contact 169 violations of the terms of supervision result in increased supervision and surveillance170 the offenders probation can be revoked if the graduated sanctions fail to ensure compliance offenders are also subject to polygraph examinations to ensure that they are following the terms of their supervision171 the program appears to help prevent recidivism agency data showed that 395 of offenders supervised by the specialized units over sevenyear period may 1993 to august 2000 returned to court at least once for violation of the terms of supervision less than 7 of the supervised offenders committed new criminal offense and less than 2 committed new sex offense 172 data also showed that 319 had violation for not complying with treatment 296 had violation for using or abusing alcohol or drugs and 269 had violation for having contact with children173 however it is not clear what proportion of the offenders on lifetime supervision were sentenced for violent or nonviolent sex crimes hence it is difficult to tell whether the program was successful at reducing recidivism for violent sex offenders successful outpatient civil commitment program could have many of the same elements as maricopa countys lifetime probation program the use of polygraph examinations reduced caseloads for pos set of conditions for superv ision that includes requirement for treatment and intensive supervision however additional elements could be incorporated into an outpatient civil commitment program the program could use electronic monitoring to ensure that sex offenders avoid prohibited areas colorado has sex offender management program similar to the maricopa countys lifetime probation program but it also includes some elements not found in maricopa countys program colorados program uses containment plans tailored to offenders based on their offense

that are part of their offense patterns175 allowing offenders to be placed in the community under intense supervision could assist in the treatment of offenders while they are committed176 the program could motivate offenders to participate in treatment because they would know th at there is possibility of being released the outpatient treatment program would allow psychologists to evaluate offenders outside of institutional setting to see whether they are pplying what they are learning in treatment however there is always risk associated with placing an offender on parole even with intensive supervision po cannot monitor sex offender all the time hence there is possibility that an offender can commit new crime while on parole there is also the possibility that an offender could abscond while on parole g11g151g141g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g142g561g21g142g151g157g142g151g140g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g21g142g161g561g17g143g143g142g151g141g142g155g156g561 starting in the 1980s many states adopted determinate sentencing laws in general these laws allowed judges to impose fixed sentence to help structure determinate sentences many states adopted sentencing guidelines that suggested how long an offenders sentence should be based on the crime the offender was convicted for and the individuals criminal history among other factors in most instances determinate sentence laws eliminated parole so even though offenders had to serve most or all of their sentence they were released unsupervised after serving their sentence although many states implemented determinate sentencing laws some maintained indeterminate sentencing under an indeterminate sentencing approach statutes provide range of possible sentences offenders are released on parole as determined by parole board and rehabilitation of prisoners is the main objective one researcher has proposed that states implement what he refers to as sexually dangerous offender sentence 177 the proposal would allow for sentence that is both determinate and indeterminate offenders would be sentenced to an indeterminate term in addition to whatever punishment they would receive under the existing determinate sentencing structure offenders would be eligible to receive sexually dangerous offender sentence after they commit second serious sex crime special hearing would be held where the prosecutor would present evidence that the defendant is sexually dangerous offender with an enduring propensity for committing sex crimes the hearing would focus solely on the offenders current sexual dangerousness sexually dangerous offender laws would ensure that the offender serves at least the minimum sentence required by law but if there is reason to believe that the offender is still dangerous and would commit new crime if released the state would not be required to release him from prison much like if the offender had received an indeterminate sentence also when released the offender would be released on parole instead of being released unsupervised sexually dangerous offender laws would have the benefit of avoiding the costs associated with civil commitment 178 they would also send message to sex offenders that if they continue to commit sex crimes and are found to be dangerous they can be punished indefinitely179 175 ibid 176 ibid 177 jq lafond 2005 p 161163 178

g344g350g561this system could be implemented at the federal level but it would require congress to reestablish parole for convicted offenders such proposal would also have to provide the appropriate procedural due process to the offender such as the right to contest evidence and the right to present evidence with the assistance of counsel and the offenders expert and jury would have to make finding of sexual dangerousness180 g5g152g156g157g561g152g143g561g5g146g159g146g149g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g150g142g151g157g561 the annual cost of civil commitment program can run into the millions of dollars different sources have attempted to estimate states costs for implementing and running civil commitment program 181 one researcher stated that it costs about 100000 per person per year to civilly commit an offender182 projected annual costs could continue to increase as more offenders are civilly committed as of fall 2006 2694 offenders in 18 states183 have been civilly committed of the 2694 offenders 252 have been discharged 94184 of the 252 discharged offenders 81 321 were released by the state of arizona and 59 234 were released by the state of california185 five states minnesota nebraska186 north dakota pennsylvania and texas have not released any civilly committed offenders187 the population of offenders will likely continue to grow because very few offenders are being released after being committed as more offenders are committed states will likely have to build new facilities or renovate old facilities to house the increasing population it is likely that there will be an increased demand for new facilities because the facilities used to house committed offenders will have to be therapeutic and secure 188 also states might face costs associated with increased medical care as the civilly committed population ages as of fall 2006 229 85 of all civilly committed offenders were over the age of 60189 an elderly civil commitment population could be growing problem if the trend of releasing relatively few civilly committed offenders continues civil commitment includes other costs in addition to housing and treating committed offenders states have to pay the cost of the legal proceedings required under civil commitment laws the state of washington estimates that court and litigation costs are on average 35000 per patient per year190 the state

demands for harsher penalties for sex offenders and better methods for managing them in the community recent media coverage of highprofile sex crimes may have increased the publics fear that all sex offenders are dangerous elected officials in 19 states and the federal government have turned to civil commitment as means of trying to ensure the publics safety from sex offenders yet there is growing controversy about whether civil commitment is the best policy for protecting the public from sex offenders notwithstanding the supreme courts rulings on civ il commitment issues remain that continue to fuel the debate over civil commitment some of these issues include the following are sex offenders the threat most people believe them to be there is some evidence that they may not be but evidence also shows that select group of sex offenders are at high risk to reoffend data on sex offender recidivism is not conclusive the rate of recidivism among sex offenders varies depending on the study which along with the limitations of recidivism data makes it difficult to conclude that sex offenders are not the threat many think they are can sex offenders be treated studies show that there are promising methods for treating sex offenders but certain traits found in some sex offenders especially those who are candidates for civil commitment may make them more resistant to treatment review of the literature on the efficacy of sex offender treatment indicates that consensus exists regarding whether treatment can reduce recidivism among sex offenders questions persist regarding whether dangerousness can be accurately predicted this can make civil commitment problematic endeavor because for it to be effective only the most dangerous offenders should be committed and they should be released when it is safe to do so the potentially high cost of establishing and maintaining civil commitment program continues to be concern if however few civilly committed offenders are released costs will likely continue to grow as the population of committed offenders increases these issues raise questions central to the debate on civil commitment if sex offenders are not at greater threat to recidivate than other violent offenders should they be subject to civil commitment if sex offenders cannot be treated is civil commitment viable method for managing sex offenders would it be better for sex offenders to be managed by the criminal justice system rather than requiring mental health professionals to work with offenders that are 191 ibid
