roman numerals to apply to body of data eg scientology iii not 3 auditor report forms are getting standardized format when handling service facs you are handling stuff that can bypass more stuff than any other thing there is if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on his case and he blows his skull off the service fac is what keeps the environmental restimulation restimulated when you are handling the service fac you are handling what makes aberration permanent many pcs have second dynamic service facs this has nothing to do with life but it has to do with your situation on this planet at this time the sickness and incidence of illness on this planet is unusually high because the way to make everybody wrong is obviously to produce nothing everybody counts on guys going ahead and making bodies keeping the civilization wheeling to keep thetans interested enough so they will keep reporting back the industrialist is in trouble at this time because he is producing on wholetrack basis thetan is in trouble simply because of mest that is how he looks at it if he could have arranged never to have created anything he would not now have anything to be in trouble with clearly so any creative activity is doomed to attack and the artists and musicians of this planet always attract 502 someone who caves them in the same is true of industrialists etc they dont have enough force to protect their creativeness so people attack them therefore you find lot of service facs having to do with the second dynamic r3sc is thinice activity if you go one step too far you are in the soup so be careful to word questions with in this lifetime that way you will avoid lot of trouble from overrestimulation from getting onto the whole track with service fac running we are engaged upon keyout not bank erasure keep the pcs attention on this lifetime and be careful since it easily goes to other areas which can then easily become bpc that is the second factor that makes service facs fraught with potential arc breaks the first factor was that if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on the case the moment you combine scientology iii with scientology iv you will lose you will have had it you will have left on the pc restimulation both from the pt environment and from the whole track how do you handle this so as to avoid this situation word questions so as to avoid all goaltype answers if an item rocket reads dont take it since only gpms rocket read you could get away with running it if you handled it very gingerly with in this lifetime and if you were very careful and didnt oppose it you can note it for later reference the best way to avoid problems is to ask questions that cannon be answered with goal asking for safe assumption about item is pretty safe in that you dont get goals but asking for safe solution to something tends to give you goals service facs are almost never to but they can be expressed that way avoid it scientology iii bypasses less charge run skillfully than scientology iv just because you are not among so many potentially heavily charged restimulatable things what you want to do with scientology iii is to destimulate the case so dont restimulate it in running service facs you can be wrong by restimulating the more you restimulate the more wrong you are the value of destimulation appeared in the search for ta action which is the only way to advance the case the whole track is too restimulative for most pcs getting into it produces overrestimulation and stops ta action the only reason that the ta doesnt move is that the pc is in overrestimulation take room and fill it half full of cotton bales representing charge person in that room wont be able to move too well then put some more cotton bales in the room now the person will have even more trouble moving trying to handle the situation by putting even more cotton bales in the room stops his entirely the proper course of action is to get rid of as much as you can that is already there clearing is getting all the false data and this lifetime restimulation off the case prior to recovering the truth one gets very good ta action doing scientology iii just by working on that line any case is overrestimulated when you start work on it the basic mechanism of entrapment is to keep the persons attention diverted to financial matters for instance to keep kicking him ground with various forms of trouble and worry so that he doesnt have chance to observe what is really going on the thetan wants something out of this planet and he thinks there is some pay he thinks that he is getting something out of it the trap wouldnt run at all unless the thetan was so busy in it that he never had 503 time to look at it if he could see the trap he could get out of it but his attention gets diverted in it he then makes foolish decisions to hold off foolish confusion and gets still more entrapped it is perfected system of attention fixing shifting and dispersal real trap not just cynical snide comment those aspects of this planet that you protest are probably there to excite protest and overrestimulation eg finances money is bum itsa what is it in socialism you can never buy yourself off you stay tied down life is constant restimulation the pc comes into session subject to all this environmental restimulation restimulation comes in several different forms see fig 21 1 pt environment 2 restimulated bank restimulated by the service fac actually there is an interrelationship between environmental restimulation and service fac restimulation in that the pc wouldnt have the ptp of environmental restimulation if it werent for service facs 3 auditing restimulation what has been restimulated in auditing and not erased 4 current session restimulation what you are going to restimulate in the session or what you are in the process of restimulating in session 5 auditor restimulation restimulation occurring simply from being audited if the auditor is rough restimulation from flubs all of these sources of restimulation are interactive to some degree they all hinge on the service fac crossrestimulation occurs the only core on which it sits is the service fac the service fac keeps the environment restimulated it has great bearing on other forms of restimulation and prevents their discharge however it can be knocked out figure 21 the service facsimile and restimulation graphics inserted 504 the most notable thing about the service fac is that the thetan is doing it right now he is making himself right and someone else wrong all on his own cockeyed determinism he is keeping the gpm in restimulation because he is using the service fac he is mocking up his bank and he is the effect of it too but he is responsible for everything that is happening to him the preceding is happening right now he is doing it it is decisional how does the auditor restimulate something by putting the pcs attention or letting the pcs attention go on any heretofore inert charge that can be restimulated ie anything that is not already discharged the pc is totally incapable of causing trouble in session the auditor can let the pcs attention wander all over restimulating anything his service fac directs him to you wouldnt have psychosomatic illness unless the thetan had as all do the service fac that the best way to handle situation is to get sick that is service fac that goes backtrack easily the way an auditor restimulates something is to let the pcs attention wander to it or to mention it how much it gets restimulated just depends on how often you mention it and with what intensity the mechanism of restimulation is name it the way to get an arc break is to name something and permit itsa this gives you instant bpc as when the auditor says sorry about that last session we had another way to get an arc break is to let the actions of the session bar the discharge of materials already restimulated eg the pc comes into session itsaing and the auditor getting model session in shuts the pc up auditors often ask silly questions to be sociable then shut the pc up in order to start the session cutting the itsa line an auditor can goof at start of session by putting in whatsit eg how are you doing and then not letting the pc itsa were going to start the session now you can do this any time it results in an explosion on an uncleared pc the service fac is interacting with whatever else is restimulated so the pc is putting in continuous restimulative factor in sessions you will get restimulation trouble as long as pc has prominent service facsimile getting one out of the way knocks about half the potential restimulation out of the way audit smoothly as you do it if you the auditor do the tiniest little thing wrong when you are approaching service fac the pc targets you as the one to be made wrong provide good specific small targets for the pcs attention and dont let his attention slide around it is trick to find service fac without restimulating everything here are some tips 1 audit smoothly this is the solution to session restimulation 2 restimulate more in your current auditing than you have to dont start naming whole bunch of things 3 give the pc frequent on auditing prepchecks to handle charge from past auditing do this every five or six sessions 4 keep up with the pt environment audit at least 2 12 hours week in case that was overrestimulated one would look to see what was practical to cut out normally the auditor would be concerned with reducing the auditing restimulation this is often overdone by excessively big targets b loss of control of the itsa line the auditor lets the pc talk too much 505 one reason an auditor goofs is that he has his own service fac he is unwittingly trying to make lrh or the tech wrong he will usually come around when this is pointed out another phenomenon is that as you look for the pcs service fac and jog it he will target you to be made wrong which can be fairly restimulative and make the auditor flub one way to handle that would be to switch auditors you want to key out service facs so in assessing always use in this lifetime you dont want whole track only gpm rocket reads if you have room full of cotton bales you wont get anywhere with that finding the service fac directly because there is room to move around but you can reduce the restimulation in other ways if you handle all auditing on the basis of reducing restimulation you will seldom be wrong any pc who is running badly is doing so because of overrestimulation any solution of the auditing situation or the case has to take into account reduction of restimulation either by discharge or destimulation you can destimulate the persons life somewhat you can reduce one or more of the five sources of restimulation see p 503 above you could destimulate any restimulatable area whatever you can in fact work with then audit out this lifetime service facs case is as hard to run as it is restimulated more than that anything that reduces restimulation on the case is valid auditing for instance you could destimulate past therapies psychiatrists add more environmental restimulation than they pick off case so of course they fail l ron hubbard type 3 idate11963 volnum1 issue306 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec306 service facs and gpms 6309c11 shspec306 service facs and gpms hcob 8may63 routine 3 the nature of formation of gpm says the early gpms contacted are implants this does not mean the pcs own gpms do not exist the pcs own gpm has power and velocity over an implant gpm in ratio of 1000 or 100000 to 1 there is great difference in order of magnitude the whole and entire amount of implanted gpms all together are one ri of one of lrhs gpms the oppterm goals which is one of about hundred ris on personal gpm which extends from trillions 30 to trillions 20 on the track and is actually still continuing number of you have some protest on the length of the time track multiple trillions of trillions etc modern times is trillions 13 to now the stuff that is likely to influence the pc in pt what you are doing in r3sc is fooling around with the pcs current ri in his existing pt goal line of his current truncated goal gpm there is an opposition to it clearing up this stuff is clearing dumbbell pair out of the pcs own gpm restimulated in pt out of sequence on the track the pcs goal will fall out of this with thud it is probable that while you are listing for the pcs service fac you will get the pcs goal rocket reading the amount of aberration required to reduce power must be comparable to the power reduced to account for the reduction of power of the thetan we must find some force of equal power that could aberrate him all the implant gpms did was to confuse you as to what was your goal and what was an implanted goal implanted goals were installed backwards from top to bottom an actual gpm is run the way it was lived from bottom to top use r3m2 506 to run actual gpms r3m2 is apparently variant of r3m r3m is method of running the sequence of actual gpms ri by ri starting either with an ri or with rocketreading goal starting with the goal the first ri is obtained by using goal oppose list also known as source list more or less with the wording who or what would the goal oppose subsequent ris are obtained by ri oppose lists these have to be listed rightwayto there are different rules for finding the item on these two sorts of lists each ri after it is found is packaged by relating it to the goal and to the ri found just before it and when verified is added to the line plot this packaging step also lets you know when you have entered new gpm as the ris will longer relate to the goal previously found when this happens the new goal is found by doing new goals list for new rocket reading goal or the pc may volunteer the new goal you can also start r3m with an ri perhaps one that was obtained from r212 in this case you just keep doing ri oppose lists and getting new ris by the time you have several ris the pc will give you his goal but you continue with the ri oppose lists other references on r3m are to be found on p 382 above dont use an early actual goal as service fac and try to run it as such if you do this you are making the guy look down the goals channel the goal in an actual gpm is the furthest item from pt being the bottom terminal when you get the pc to reach down for that goal he is to some slight degree traveling through time between that goal and pt and he livens up the whole track which is lot of charge it is like looking down between the rows of the helatrobus implants you get tunnel of blackness that is what happens when you reach down gpm the same thing happens with the pcs gpm channel only it is quite different order of magnitude with the helatrobus implant it is not so good to do this but with the pcs own actual gpm channel it is like having your head shot off with sixteen inch cannon the residual charge in an actual gpm is incomparably greater if the goal comes up as you look for service fac put it in the auditors report form clearly marked with red circle and dont do much with it except in r3m2 if you run it you are getting the pc to look down through the gpm to the beginning of some track with at least hundred ris between you and it you will get ta etc if you run it as service fac but the pc running it will scuff up his track the pcs own gpm looks like black island floating it is quite meaty they come in different sizes but each is distinct size you are running the pc back and forth from the bottom of mass maybe three feet thick 75 feet long and 30 feet wide you could well restimulate so much mass that the ta will all of sudden freeze up you would have to remedy this by working out the gym with r3m2 the pcs own gpm has the beauty of disintegrating as you work with it you get rocketreading blowdowns the black islands turn grey then start shaking and fraying like opaque jello that someone left in the sun the power in this early gpm is commensurate with the native power of thetan ie there is lot of charge on it this charge doesnt discharge through the pc or the meter luckily 507 the technology for handling this is all in r3n see pp 414 426 456457 above and r3m2 ris relate to goal but each as its own central postulate with regard to the goal this is true of every ri in the pcs gpm for instance the current ri might have central postulate of to ring bells where the goal is to go to school you might get an oppterm of people who bring their lunches without knowing the goal this would be puzzling thats why it would be an aberrative factor r3sc will land you somewhere in the vicinity of the current oppterm or terminal of the pcs own gpm as it applies to pt or it may land you near some old ri that is in restimulation in pt that will be the source of the pcs pt restimulation with r3sc you can knock that in the head you can pull its central postulate but when you try to make the service fac make sense you may find it impossible to do so until you relate it to his goal by running r3m2 so that is actually what you are auditing when you find the service fac you could find service fac without meter by having the pc write list of solutions until he is easy about it and feels that it is complete then looking on the list for the solution that makes the least sense however when seen as an ri such things can be seen to make sense when you are handling service fac you are handling the central postulate of an ri so running r3sc disintegrates the ri the thinkingness of the ri is sometimes different from its beingness eg you may have the ri lame man but from that you may not know what the significance is that lies within it ie you may not know what the central postulate is you could list for this and find it it may turn out to be lameness things can be audited nicely without being related to the gpm where they occur even though under these circumstances they might not make sense service fac is actually not whole ri but just the central postulate of an ri you are handling the central postulate of an ri when you are handling service fac so you get disintegration being assumes an identity because it has solution in the middle of it for instance in the middle of the identity lame man we may find lameness as solution to something sometimes an ri comes up as its own thinkingness but beingness ri in particular may have an idea at its core an ri always has an idea at its core but sometimes you dont have the central idea when you have the ri given the ri you could list for the central significance which is an automatic solution its safe it solves everything this safe solution would be the service fac that is how an ri is generated the thetan has an idee fixe so he never has to inspect in order to solve so therefore he never asises the mass so therefore he gets caught in the middle of the mass if the thetan does this with goal he gets an accumulation of ris resulting from this goal each of these ris has the goal carried through into it but there is also new idea that makes each ri and that whole mass comes together as gpm so you get this huge mass this huge block of energy with its separate items in it they dont appear separate the whole thing is all squashed together from so much attack and so little inspection the whole thing is dominated by one goal eg to go to school which is common to every ri or identity within it this is what it is accumulates it but that goal all by itself is noinspection it is way to solve all problems totally uninspected in fixed 508 way for instance the goal to solve all problems go to school is totally uninspected solution and now gathers to itself identities who have this idea as well as other characteristics because the goal is uninspected automatic and fixed it generates into itself the second step of identities eg an idiot child that have the goal as central idea but which already have their own characteristics they have the main idea the goal as dominant but the characteristic of the identity after it is longer able to carry out the postulate is something like that of an idiot child the idea of an idiot child is people like unintelligence so the central idea may be unintelligence solves everything but the ri is an idiot child the only way that it could exist in the first place was that the thetan had the idea of the goal to solve all problems go to school so there are three types of ideas in gpms 1 the goal of the gpm this is the first postulate and central idea of the gpm 2 the central idea or postulate of the ri which in itself forbids inspection 3 the identity or individuality or the ri this is the accumulation of mass that results from the fact that 1 and 2 above being fixed uninspected solutions forbid itsa and hence forbid an asisness from occurring that is the anatomy of an ri but it also tells us what service fac is this is what gives us the dwindling spiral of abilities ris substitutions of ideas for thetans the thetans ows all these get piled up on these fixed ideas the biggest fixed idea was goal which then developed into gpm that which is not inspected tends to persist because it is never asised what happens person gets hell knocked out of him the ri and its significance is the constant invitation to attack but it is never the right enemy the constant ow and battling that ensues from this fact accumulates as the mass of an ri it is interesting that an idea is most easily substituted for thetan because it has mass and seems to contain some wisdom i am guard implies i dont have to understand or inspect the thetan has tried to solve screwup with fixed idea or postulate this is sort of sweeping under the rug that permits inspection therefore asisness therefore persistence any idea is liable to become substituted for thetan because he does it himself when one gives up on one goal one gets another for instance say the last three or four mountain ranges the thetan built fell down and fouled up his planet so on the ideal planet never build mountains becomes the solution that holds all the confusion uninspected it is solved instead sooner or later we will find him running society for the prevention of building mountains he is now an identity he is the idea never build mountains substituted for thetan the pc keeps abandoning old solutions as they fail and keeps getting new goals this is covered in r3m basically except for finding the pcs own goal and distinguishing it from implant goals so be alert to anything you find in r3sc that rocket reads but dont run it with service fac tech you cant run gpm with service fac tech but you can run one ri with it but that rocket read is more than just service fac r3sc does handle the ri that is part of the pcs pt environment 509 if you find an ri and your pc is having energy doing odd things to him giving ghastly sensations body distortion sensations etc the pc is liable to disclaim the ri in an effort to get away from it all getting towards the service fac causes qualms and invalidation in pc the service fac is prosurvival so he doesnt want to give it up dont q and with that invalidation to do so will just restimulate it worse if the invalidation occurs pick up everything found as service fac and finish it off standardly with all of the r3sc steps when stable datum is pulled out and not run off completely you leave some of the confusion behind so just get it with r3sc if you take the stable datum half way out of confusion you leave the confusion this is what happens when you leave r3sc on something halfrun the result is that the person will get foggy his memory will deteriorate if you took the stable datum all the way out you would blow the confusion the postulate in the center of the ri is so far downscale that it is twenty ta divisions below hide it is an idea that has turned into mest you run it only as far as cognition but it may enter at any of these levels 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival but real gpm item service fac goes through the steps of 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival 5 domination 6 rightwrong then the next 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival etc again the service fac may enter at any of these stages it starts off reasonably sensible but becomes very weird like cows are kissable as safe solution to how to repair motor cars this service fac will turn out to be intimately related to solution or domination etc in the pcs mind when you try to run it the pc may not be able to fit it in on rightwrong so check it over on the other buttons he may well cognite on it and blow the charge you could then see how it is solution how it would make or has made him right and others wrong around and around on the buttons until the pc is out of answers and the buttons are clean do an 18button prepcheck and it will all cool down the auditor is always in danger of grabbing the gpm accidentally getting the goal instead of the service fac this has advantages too since the pcs goal is hard to sort out from implant goals the pcs own ris are probably what make implant goals read they read off the top of the pcs own ris the service fac doesnt have to rocket read you can accept one that does but be equally prepared to take one that just ticks 510 the pcs service fac is his current solution his current ri monitored by the goal it is very aberrated stable datum it is an unexamined solution that keeps the pc from doing anything it was decent solution when the thetan first got hold of it but then it started running his life therefore it does not even vaguely take care of environmental enturbulation the rule when in doubt communicate is an attempt to overcome the effect of service facs you have to work at it to do r3sc wrong the best way to do it wrong is to be completely unthorough to leave everything unflat the pc will get very confused from having all his stable data pulled away when you handle service fac all the incomplete cycles that the service fac has caused hit the pc at once this generates confusion when the service fac running is not completed the confusion gets even worse so it is good idea from time to time to clean up what you have done get it all finished up some service facs wont run quite in the order given for r3sc see p 509 it may start on later step than rightwrong or earlier at solutions real service fac behaves outrageously in that regard something else that isnt service fac may be far more mannerly while still giving ta action keep your eyes peeled for the pcs goal since this is the best means of finding it that we have developed keep running service facs until the case is in good shape and the pcs goal has shown up you get the best ta on the pcs own gpm channel you can use r3m2 when you get his goal but that is not your immediate purpose r3sc is for destimulating the pt environment factor l ron hubbard type 3 idate12963 volnum1 issue305 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec305 service facs 6309c12 shspec305 service facs the difficulty with getting pcs case forward is that the pc has hidden standard which is that by which he measures his progress it is often unknown even to the pc that is why it is hidden an aberration is an outofcontrol exaggeration of the positive or negative of anything thetan can do hence aristotles doctrine of the golden mean the fact that something is normal doesnt mean that it isnt aberrated for instance the difficulty of exteriorization is accepted but it is not anything much in line with the thetans abilities so departure from the normal is particular index of case state auditors sometimes have trouble because pc runs too easily so in judging case level dont use the pcs behavior as an index use the amount of ta motion by running service facs the case can change very quickly so worrying about the pcs normal behavior is unnecessary and irrelevant it is easier to measure persons case against some scales of abilities than against behavior and it is more accurate the condition of restimulation of the case has more to do with understanding the pc and handling him effectively than does the pcs behavior the only things you worry about with pc are 1 can he do the process 2 is he getting any gains 3 is he getting ta motion 511 the fact that someone has hidden standard merely means that he has chronic restimulation that is throwing extra charge on the case it is some facsimile or whatever in chronic restimulation if it was changed in the session the pc had gain if you got ta some of the chronic restimulation will have gone so the pc will have had gain and will probably say so that unfortunately isnt all that happens with hidden standard the pc is also trying to fit every process to this thing to resolve it he is so introverted in session as result that he doesnt asis anything and you dont get ta action time and the ta fit together and the pc drags his hidden standard facsimile up into every incident or whatever in order to evaluate it therefore the pc is always misdating something the hidden standard isnt the date of it whatever date he is in that is why it is the most effective ta stopper there is way of getting rid of the hidden standard process called r3t now called r4t in this process one simply asks the pc for his chronic psychosomatic what he is experiencing and what is always present he answers and you date it whatever it is then you get the itsa line in on it in most cases that is the end of the hidden standard the hidden standard always expresses itself physiologically it is never hidden physically it will be what the pc complains about sometimes it will take you an hour or so of itsa to find out what it is when the pc spots it he will feel better and you will have been getting ta dont let him start giving you problems or you have had it since problems are not itsa so perhaps you should stick to what physical condition are you trying to solve he will finally itsa it out if he doesnt tell you all at once if he gives it to you right off the bat you might get some ta with when has this troubled you in auditing or in this lifetime you can take it up with r3t and date it taking it back as far as need be sometimes dating it will cause it to blow on the spot especially if you dont get it so narrowed down that you get the pc into an engram and have to run it with r3r or if he gets stuck in his own gpm with r3m2 or if in another gpm with r3n r3t seems to be the precursor to the date portion of the datelocate for handling intractable pressure somatics r3t is commonly overrun youve got to watch the pc when you first start using r3t you are likely to overrun it roughly 80 of the time eventually you get slippy and stop overrunning it not every pc has hidden standard to the point where it ruins the auditing but hidden standard exists in every case that has difficult or delicate ta that the auditor has to worry about so r3t is the weapon to use to get the ta moving again when all else has failed r3t can fix it but little goes long way dont try to run the whole case with r3t since if you tried to do this you could end up with messedup pc however you could do r3t on everything the pc is worried about in pt you could clear somebody with r3t as long as you you kept good control over the pc and just dated all his pt hidden standards the service fac has to be severely located on the time track in this lifetime so that it will key out handle every hidden standard that the pc could dream up but dont let him pull anything up from the back track in the meantime use tr2 if r3sc goes nowhere you can still clear the pc using r3t the tough case is the pc whose service fac is his hidden standard the only workable handling is carefully to get it dated 512 this is all destimulation so you have to be careful not to run anything the reason you are trying to destimulate the case is so that the pc doesnt have ptps so that he can put his attention on the session if you start destimulating action and then go backtrack and start running something the pc will get restimulated and if the pcs service fac includes making you wrong that is the first thing he will do he will try to restimulate more than he can handle how do you keep the itsa line in on pc that wants to restimulate more be awful damn careful of your whatsits remove all social actions and chitchat from your auditing avoid all violent attention shifts and attention shifts directed by whatsit and dont direct the pcs attention in way that arc breaks him so that he has to get even with you by whatsiting the type of model session to use on case that isnt getting much ta is your wunit type model session social frills w unit was next after the v unit which was heavily supervised r210 and r212 on coaudit basis w unit contained ruds havingness cchs and assists it used gf model session or goal finders model session see hcopl 8dec62 training saint hill special briefing course summary of subjects by units for description of w x and z units gf model session is given in hcob 15oct 2 goal finders model session this bulletin is not on the shsbc overrestimulation leads to selfinvalidation and invalidation of scientology and other dynamics the pc invalidates his own case chews himself up all the time and he doesnt know so let that be warning sign to you the case minus the service fac is subject to less restimulation because he pulls in fewer ptps in his environment case without good processing gains has ptps the way to handle them is by handling service facs there is way of listing for service facs that nails ptps 1 whats safe assumption about your environment 2 what would be safe method of handling your problems here and now in life this is only one of many solutions to this situation such question will drop into your lap the stable datum that the person is using to hold at bay various sectors of his existence so in that respect it becomes method of destimulating the environment you wind up with what he uses to handle his family his job etc take the pcs whole environment to pieces find out where his life is in conflict and what it is in conflict with in pt get what pt consists of this orients the pc and is good scientology i see p 479 above for description of scientology i note also the similarity to the pt environment list in expanded dianetics you should both categorize things and locate them spatially this is good for the pcs itsa after you have all of pt use the above process on it you could plot the pt environment out and find where most of the pcs problems are the pc gets gloomiest when talking about this area the ta dies down as you keep talking about it indicating that there are more problems there than the pc can confront he cant put any itsa into the vicinity as the pc looks at the stable datum that he is using to hold sectors of existence at bay and as he finds out more about it you will get his confront on the environment increasing and increasing as his ability to differentiate comes up this is terrific hgc approach 513 now that you know about the hot spots and fixated areas in the pcs environment you have subjects where he cant itsa you can assess by rising ta to get zone where there is service fac in operation as long as one cant itsa something he will continue to have ptps with it so since the pc cant confront the areas of rising ta he will have ptps there make mistakes etc the frequency of ptps is the measure of noconfront noconfront is caused by substitute confront which is service facsimile it isnt that the thetan cant confront it is that as long as the pc has the service fac the things he is notconfronting can keep caving him in and restimulating him here is lesson that you should learn about life dont stay in places that you dont want to keep confronting because your nonconfronting will lead you to pick up stable datum to do your confronting for you in that vicinity and the next thing you know this is going to be gorgeous piece of mass and will give you more ptps than you can ordinarily count and your life will become very restimulative the rising ta is less observable than the pcs attitude if the pc hasnt got anything to say about something he isnt observing it something is observing it for him and that something is service fac find this and run r3sc steps on it if you are having trouble with r3sc you have collided with the ri of the pcs ongoing gpm it will still handle with r3sc if with some difficulty you use several assessments to get something to run on r3sc you can use scientology list one assessment or discussion of pt doingness and environment with observation of where the pc goes downtone and where the ta rises indicating areas where the pc cant confront and itsa when you run the brackets step of r3sc you will get ta by asising stable data and letting confusion fly off do thorough pc assessment sheet you can use the pc assessment sheet to find out about the pcs pt if you treat it as leisurely 2wc activity looking for ta action not data ie doing it as an r3sc assessment when dealing with this lifetime let the itsa run free when dealing with past track control the itsa line very closely assessment at scientology iv is rapid bangbang assessment l ron hubbard

what you are processing the idea of oldtime psychotherapy is completely useless we have always gone along with the notion that the ideas of oldtime psychotherapies had some historical interest but they are worthless all we can say for the oldtime psychotherapists is that they tried and they did give people the idea that something could be done in dianetics we talked about the mental image picture this is handled today with r3r it is great that we can now get any pc to see facsimiles just by getting the date and duration but the therapeutic value of dianetics is limited since it handles free track which is relatively unaberrative the aberrative value of free track isnt enough to keep someone from being clear or ot you could run r3r for long time and never get there frequently you can of course heal psychosomatic illness with r3r unfortunately the wins you get with it are sporadic this makes it dangerous technology since you will keep going on hoping for repeat win it is an excellent piece of training technology however and it is very useful for an assist 514 r3n handles implanted goals and materials see p 414 above people keep on worrying whether the fact that they have implants means that they were implanters what is the relative value of this implanting the value of it is that without knowledge of implant goals and implanting you can easily get pcs own actual track mixed up in then and you will always be confused on the subject an auditor would mess up the pc thoroughly if he ran an actual gpm as an implant gpm or vice versa r3n is very good as way of teaching the form of gpm it gives lots of practice getting rocket reads etc implant gpms have practically aberrative value compared to that of pcs own actual gpms what implanters did was to take the form of an actual gpm as made by thetan and mock up synthetic gpm with his own goal in some cases and implant it some implant gpms were given several times that was very confusing to thetans because it was parody and mockery of the thetans own actions implant gpms were intended to key in the thetans actual gpm they were somewhat successful at doing this but they didnt manage to scramble up the actual gpm undoubtedly implant gpms influenced the thetans postulate of his next goal or some of his ris however the implant gpm makes the thetan feel sad about the universe but the implanter did us favor in that he gave us training ground that can be used to gain familiarity with gpms without wrapping the pc around too many telephone poles the implant gpm has real impingement on the pc he has never been upset about its ris but when you get one of his own ris you will get charge off cognitions etc an actual gpm looks more like the gorilla gpm it is more natural ta action lies in the actual gpm because it is much much much more aberrative than an implant gpm it is difficult to get at the actual gpm finding the goal of the pc has always been struggle we have just speeded it up by using the service fac to find the goal the service fac is the top ri terminal of the pcs actual pt developing gpm the reason that the pcs goal was so hard to find was that pt bearing down hard on the goal the gpm all its ris and particularly the ris in pt kept the pc sufficiently overrestimulated that the ta was stuck and the rocket read is suppressed if you cant immediately find the pcs goal all the pt sources of restimulation are bearing down on the pt ri and oppterm the last two items of the goal that the pc has and is living with in pt this is all happening because of the pcs own postulate the service fac the mystery of stuck ta is the environment impinging on the pt ris which are held there by the pcs postulate so the pc is doing something there and we have the service fac when you find the service fac in its entirety you have the top or next to top pair of ris in the pcs actual gpm the pcs own gpm will now rr providing you unburden it here is the situation the pc is very overrestimulated by pt and he is keeping himself superaberrated with stable data like horses sleep in beds on the goal to ride the pt goal is so overburdened by pt that if you find goal at all you will find it way down the track at trillions 50 or trillions 30 if you try to run that one the pcs bank goes creak all the back track charge is smashing him forward towards pt his attention is pinned in pt and the goal you have found seems unreal to him it is probably dichotomy of his pt goal 515 r3sc run successfully occasionally gives fall which you will see in the next session as accelerated falls on everything you are running in the next session as you are nulling list you start seeing rocket reads the bank has loosened up enough so that you are reaching locks as the pc differentiates soon you may get rocket reading goal showing up which keeps rocket reading now we have arrived among the last four or five gpms not necessarily at the most recent gpm as they approach pt the gpms are so restimulated and jammed up that it is hard to be sure that you have the most recent one when you get goal eg to hide test it to see if it is an implant goal if it isnt oppose it you want the pc in good shape before you do this since you are about to drag him through three or four actual gpms say you have the goal to have nothing worth taking this will seem to be the pt gpm check who or what would oppose _______ and get the next goal you may have to do this again by now the pc is very uncomfortable try to oppose whatever you get keep doing oppose lists until you get the pt goal test it out thoroughly and list for the latest terminal of the goal eg not to be so slimy when you get the latest terminal the similarity or connection to his service fac will be clear he could have gone over to the enemy camp where he is about to start new gpm the pc may in this case be feeling pretty awful and may start rejecting the goal he is dramatizing the ri terminal that he is in which may oppose his goal the way to run the gpm is as accurately as possible just keep listing your way down to the bottom of it not missing ris or getting off into other goals when you get to the bottom go around and run it back up to get the remaining 50 of the gpms ris that you missed on the way down implant gpms are all backwards but an actual gpm is laid in as it was lived so the bottom is earliest in an actual gpm dont go farther south than the bottom otherwise you might get into foreign gpm dont fool around too much at the bottom the goal throws the whole gpm into violent restimulation dont find ris for goals you dont have that is the only thing that turns off rocket read note that with r3sc you are looking for ris with goal so how long can you keep looking for service facs without finding the goal because you are shredding up rocket read chewing it up there is some danger in it although the way it works it is probably ok for 1550 hours the phenomenon of shredding up rocket reads doesnt start to appear until the pcs goal shows up when the goal does show up put it down prominently in box labelled as goal we havent yet seen r3sc turn off rocket reads but the rule is valid so some caution is in order using this analysis and program we have programmed ot well within reach by making goal finding easier we have also found method of straightening out pt which is useful any time we run into trouble with running an actual gpm the condition when this happens is that pt is now an overwhelm to the pc so if you are running an actual gpm and having trouble we now have handle 1 scout out the possibility that we have run bunch of ris without goals 2 do an arc break assessment 516 3 do case analysis checking for going into the next gpm b skipped gpms c listing backwards d implant goals etc 4 run r3sc assuming that the current ri is in restimulation clear would be attainable then r3sc is good way to end off an r3m2 intensive you can get the state of clear at any time with one proviso the most dangerous time to use r3sc is at the outset before finding the first actual gpm because you are finding ris for known goal yet this is also the easiest time to run r3sc so the auditor must be alert for any rocket reading goal if he finds one he must mark it clearly he has to find out what goal it is because you only want to run the last goal closest to pt the system that you know as the service facsimile is the system that applies to every ri in every gpm the pc has it is the system that has aberrated the pc all pcs have done this the service fac cum laude for every gpm is the goal as an ri it accumulates mass in the form of subsidiary ris the point where you look for the pcs goal is when using r3sc you have rehabilitated the pcs rr you should always run case on the latest point of his aberration that keeps his pt cleaned up it keeps his ruds in his skills as an ot will slowly be rehabilitated he advances as being in relation to pt therefore he advances smoothly and calmly with regard to pt you wont get flukey manics turning on and off rollercoastering because of dropping earlier on the track than is real to the pc this in fact is the cause of manic behavior the pcs arc is down because of unreality which occurs when he is run over his head so he cant cope with the aberration that is thrown at him it is actually doubtful that the pc could make it to ot unless you continually handled the aberrative factors of pt it is best to cut the case back from pt this gives better reality factor and smoother stabler gains running smoothly cutting back from pt cuts down the time you will require also the pc will be cogniting on pt having wins etc pc ever really progresses beyond his ptp that is the secret of processing at any given moment in auditing the pc is introverted at the level of what is now live in pt his thinking about pt is colored by and introverted into the ris that he is sitting in so they can discharge against pt therefore his power is consistently and continuously cut back to practically nothing we have to handle this the pcs perception of what actually is ptp improves with time so he is seeing bigger and bigger ptps as we go back along the actual gpm or as he progresses in auditing all progress is measured by the pcs ability to perceive ptp the measure of pcs power is the extent of his ptp it isnt how far he can reach it is how wide his ptp is in every case it is the pcs reaction to pt that is creating the problem beyond that there are problems as ris are peeled off the gpm and new ris come up into pt new problems appear to the pc the pc is being an ri and therefore it is his service fac underlying it is many more ris his current gpm etc fortunately there are only twenty or thirty actual gpms on the whole track this puts us on the sunny side of thousand hours to ot and perhaps even within 500 hours of ot 517 l ron hubbard type 3 idate18963 volnum1 issue308 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec308 saint hill service fac handling 6309c18 shspec308 saint hill service fac handling it is adventurous to go in to handle something like the mind without knowing what you are doing every case and every practitioner in the field of the mind has been concentrated on one aspect of existence and dedicated to observing existence only through that aspect so wonder little has been discovered and less applied knowledge about the mind means freedom for life and beings in this universe therefore anyone who is after enslavement is also in favor of ignorance about the mind there are two ways to make people ignorant 1 deny any information at all 2 substitute false data this is an easier and more effective way add to this the fact that 3 everyone is mired in his own favorite data and youve got good trap the way to overcome ignorance is to find the precise mechanics that apply to all minds because this will be broader truth that overrides all the minor data on which people are fixated false relay of the basic truth dropping out bits could again make slavery because it would deviate enough from the generally recognized broad truth and degenerate into opinion and fixed data this is the difficulty that scientology has had to deal with over the years the solution is results because once the technology is producing results you get arguments so the whole contest has not been for the achievement of certain truths we have had these for years rather the contest has been for workability so that we can get an application of those truths so that we can get rapid release of attention from favorite data and so that there is demonstration that by using the truth greater freedom is attained the one reason why you cant get pc to see that he can get release of attention by virtue of applying general truths is because of his favorite data his fixed idea he considers that any other truths have to agree with this favorite idea in order to be true he is sure that all horses sleep in beds this is not only his fixed data it is his total data any data that doesnt contribute to it he will discard to person with service fac his idea of truth is whether something fits his idee fixe person may have his attention fixed to varying extent so person whose attention is not totally fixed may obtain fringe benefits from studying scientology to the degree that persons attention is fixed he is not able to explore the perimeter of his ideas and therefore cannot see greater truth so he is more entrapped than someone who is less fixed the greater the fixation the closer to psychosis psychosis is the state in which the individual has only the idee fixe the degree of enslavement is the degree to which the individual is fixated on the fixed idea if you try to communicate datum to someone with very fixed idea the datum will be received as false unless you indicate the fixed idea if you communicate some idea that fits with the fixed idea it will be accepted as true it could be that any other datum you then communicate will be taken as true but these data will not be inspected 518 false data is worse than none as far as entrapment is concerned it is like putting up sign pointing over cliff and saying this way lies freedom one can only get fixated on falsehood never on truth truth is an allfreeing mechanism if freedom is not obtained the truth in question must be to some degree limited either in conception reception or application therefore anything you are worried about must have falsehood connected with it there is always lie connected to anything that you are having trouble with session goes well if and only if you get ta action the discovery that pcs case gain can be measured directly by ta action seems simple but it is an advance in technology beyond anything in the past fifty thousand years since it takes judgement of improvement out of the realm of opinion and possible inability to observe on the part of the auditor or the pc all confusions and masses must be there because they are held in abeyance so far as observation is concerned and will not asis because of stable datum stable datum prevents observation of the environment or these masses and therefore accumulates masses what is wrong with mind is that stable datum is substitute for observation person 1 ceased to inspect 2 fell back from living 3 let everything go to pieces 4 chose stable datum instead of inspecting 5 got an accumulation of mass and confusion when you shake up the stable datum by taking apart some of its ramifications confusion can start to flow off the amount of ta determines whether or not the pc had good session matter what the pc says there is opinion about it at all good ta means that the pc will feel better bad ta means almost invariably that the pc wont feel good stable datum is held in place by the confusion its supposed to confront and doesnt instead of remedying the confusion as it was supposed to do and as inspection would have done it collects more confusion like dam the more confusion it is supposed to hold in place the more confusion batters at it so the more confusion accumulates around it like twisting fork in bowl of taffy modern science and other mental technologies have taken stable datum that man is an animal and that the mind is brain the idea that man is mass is stable datum in confusion that is persistently dramatized try to tell the modern scientist about stuck flows and he will think that you are giving him lecture on blood and the causes of coronary thrombosis they cant be taught until you get them to inspect some thoughts that they have had about brains modern science has man equals the brain as stable datum what can you do for someone who is totally bound in and fixated to the point where he is being stable datum you could take datum of enormous magnitude and hold gun on this person and say believe it or we shoot you that substitutes forcedatum for inspection ultimately it fails because it is just another stable datum with an associated confusion that is why iq usually deteriorates with years of schooling since modern education is usually just laying in more and more uninspected stable data you would have whole new area of education if you said look over this data and sort out what is true in it you should have the student inspect data and find what is right or wrong about it 519 this is of limited usefulness as long as everyone has his own fixed idea by which to tell rightness from wrongness another way to go about it would be to free up peoples ideas so that their perimeter of inspection increases so that they can inspect the data that lies before them you lead them up with disciplined action that leads them to their fixed idea when they have spotted and disposed of that they are free to inspect and move up to higher levels of truth therefore it is important to find the pcs central fixed idea as soon as possible thus freeing him to inspect more broadly you free being by freeing him not by making him wiser exteriorization and even the state of ot depends on getting greater freedom not more wisdom because with the freedom wisdom will be attainable and will take place anyway by concentrating on the wisdom you are all too likely to fall into the idea of the implanted stable datum freeing attention leads to freeing the being since all that can trap being is his attention thetan can only trap himself by 1 being unwilling to confront things that are not interesting to him 2 being unwilling to back out of situations in which he has lost interest 3 being unwilling to move off and go his way but still somehow be responsible for where he was various combinations of the above lead to the individual trapping himself by leaving some inanimate postulate in his place to confront confusions for him eg i have an unconscious mind that does all that the unconscious mind is that totality of stable data that is holding back that totality of confusion that the individual is longer aware of but is still doing so when you are looking for the pcs service fac you will be looking for that on which his attention is most fixated in pt fetish objects are just things associated in some way with persons service fac any cousin to the service fac that you find will give you ta as the confusion can flow the service fac is the last pair of ris formed at the top of the last truncated gpm postulated it has lot of locks and cousins which you will be able to pick up first it is actually impossible to find the exact pair of items as the service fac the pc has to know that they are part of that gpm before he will recognize them they must be seen as part of the bank before they are recognizable to the pc they have to be related to the last goal and to the last two ris you need these three data in addition you wont find the service fac but try anyway because that is where you will find the last actual gpm it is those two top ris that have the pc so restimulated that pt is restimulative and his ta wont move so you have choice but to find the pt goal of the pc having found the goal find the top oppterm of its gpm by asking who or what would be the latest idea formed concerning this goal to catch catfish make reasonablesized list list it to clean needle and null to reading item prepcheck it after the pc has cognited for awhile then you might see it rocket read the difficulty in finding pcs goals has always been in getting them to rocket read you can do this whole operation with only ticks and rr until you have prepchecked the top oppterm 520 here is how to do it 1 find what you hope is his service fac this gives you enough ta so some charge is off hunt and punch around until you know youve got something that will get good ta action either on rightwrong prepcheck or something dont do anything with it it is not the real service fac this keeps the pcs tone and morale up by virtue of getting some ta off it or by having the promise of getting ta off it 2 start looking for the gpm if things bog down while looking for his goal you can still run the item from 1 for awhile and give him some ta 3 this could go on for couple of sessions until you get goal that ticks and that keeps going tick which reads as an actual goal probably from the past track it is not likely to be the pt goal so 4 use goaloppose to get up to pt so you oppose the goal do the same check on it then oppose that goal and get another one check each new goal found as being for sure an actual goal check if it is the pt goal the pc will be very interested in what you find since they are his actual goals keep doing this until eventually you will reach his pt goal 5 when you reach his pt goal and you oppose it the list goes nowhere it keeps developing more and more ta the pc wont arc break because you are listing towards his future postulates and unburdening the pt goal by the above phenomena you know that you have the pt goal 6 you check this make sure it is the pt goal 7 list for the top oppterm which may or may not be opposed yet you could find out where the pc is on the gpm by asking him if he has started to oppose the goal yet list to clean needle null it dont have two rrs on the list etc dont be too concerned with whether or not it is really the top oppterm the top oppterm will most likely give lots of needle action when you hit the top oppterm the needle goes mad 8 after you have given the pc his item you sit still and let him cognite 9 put in bigmidruds on the item as far as you can 10 call the item you will probably see it rocket read that is fast slippy way to get into the pcs current actual gpm starting with r3sc when you are on the goals finding step check over any goals that the pc may have mentioned earlier that were seen to fire then having found the pt goal you are ready to take the bank apart that first ri accounts for all pt restimulation the reason why we havent been able to find goals on pcs is the overburden of the top terminal and oppterm accumulating all the debris of pt and masking the top gpm or any gpm for that matter because of this masking action we used to have to find goals with ticks instead of rocket reads when the top ris and their accumulated mass are gone you are ready to roll right down the bank and back up again the pc gets ta ta ta now hes got new problem we are in new gpm and can go get it in the same way 521 l ron hubbard type 3 idate25963 volnum1 issue310 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec310 summary ii scientology 0 6309c25 shspec310 summary ii scientology 0 note summary i was probably 6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing pp 421423 above in the material covered since 24ju163 plus cchs and touch assists we have basically all the material in scientology every level of scientology contains in vignette all the levels of scientology scientology 0 deals with the problems confusions and wrongnesses of existence with the identification of those zones of chaos falsity and upset people go around thinking that healing including mental healing is all solved scientology 0 points out that they are unsolved areas this level is easy to work with because all you have to do is to find falsities and wrongnesses it is matter of degree how much you reveal and point out you dont want to open up too much scientology 0 too fast this requires judgment it is level that has ta in it unless you talk about false solutions it is better to talk about solutions than problems dont imply that there are only problems this gives the audience ta the last stable datum anyone can get in is tolerance of terrible condition it is best to talk about false solutions but this is scientology i scientology i gets the false solutions off scientology 0 just recognizes existing chaos typical question on scientology 0 would be do you find your home noisy do you like your job the idea is to give the person the idea that his life might be better that is the sole therapeutic action of scientology 0 hope instilled by identifying problems and giving faint hope for change this is quite workable this level says 1 there is problem 2 maybe something can be done about it hope factor view of scientology 0 is view of the world as it exists we need this as legitimate level of inspection scientology 0 is in processing to the extent that in order to find service fac you have to find what problems the pc has that is the scientology 0 factor at that level little of this goes long way in all auditing you have to keep the hfactor in scientology 0 is very acceptable on public level if you keep it very mild as far as the degree of hope you offer is concerned if someone comes in with all sorts of problems take only one and tell him that maybe you can do something about it pick out some small possible gain and put some hope in on it person can have this he can give up just little of his service fac so this gets around the service fac little dont promise the sun and the moon that is too much it is unacceptable it threatens his service fac so what youve got to do is to take one thing and put in very little hope that is acceptable that is confrontable you have to judge what is confrontable and give him neither too much nor too little if you ever gave somebody drill on scientology 0 you would give him long list of confusions and have him pick out the one or ones that people could confront there always something that you can get pc to confront on any dynamic the trick is that there is something to be done about any condition that the person can do the elements of hope are 1 there is something that can be done about it 2 there is something that you can confront and do about it in processing if the pc gets in trouble just getting him to tell 522 you about it can raise his tone level because that is doing something about it in scientology iv never force the pc forward if the hill is too steep dont push be willing for the pc not to do it but at scientology 0 find something that person can do and get him to do it remember gradients when giving advice to people if you advise people this way your advice will be followed and you will win dont ever suggest that they do something that they know cant be done nobody ever gives anybody anything they can do in social work consequently you get socialism and total indigence and you get social workers who go terribly downtone because they have given the client an overwhelm and arc broken him by telling him something that he knows cant be done because of some stable datum that he has adopted at scientology 0 it doesnt matter if you put the itsa line in or he does even in r3sc you can offer things to the pc that you noticed had gotten ta and run them they may be quite confrontable things and therefore not really the service fac but you could get ta running them person who can only confront getting mad at the auditor can confront getting mad at him because he is the persons best friend this is the secret of the arc breaky pc he is arc broken in the world at large and it is safe to get mad at the auditor people may get mad at their friends because that is all that is safe perhaps marital squabbles exist by virtue of this mechanism the scientology 0 aspect of existence is that you dont tell people about problems that you know are unreal to them that they cant do anything about and expect them to be enthusiastic about doing something about them people arent even capable of observing an existing condition they destroy ones stable datum that seeing is believing or that if people just saw something with their own eyes they would believe they dont even see thats the trouble dont ever bother to try to prove anything to person with fixed idea in an area even if he sees it he wont believe it there is ability to observe there is only generality or service fac instead of observation and judgment this person is incapable of asking what is the situation the easiest thing to relay then is an idea that doesnt violate the reality and confront level of the person who is receiving it if he cant look he can get something trustworthily looked at someone who can confront only in small area will be able to be effective only within that area when his confront comes up he will get larger problems to handle he will solve these problems if they are the real problems and not some lowerscale mockery to have real justice you have to have the real situation actually looked at as unbiasedly as possible if all during your career in this universe you had only operated on the real facts you would be in fine shape if you are going to have group operate on any cleared level youve got to take the service fac out of the group as far as you can the characteristics of service fac are 1 nonobservation 2 generality substituting for judgment you cant utterly remove those on an absolute basis from all situations everywhere but you can go long way in this direction 523 the formula for successful handling of case or of third dynamic is 1 what is the situation 2 what part of it is potentially confrontable 3 what part of that can someone actually do something about neglect of this can give you case failures that is the usual reason for case failure someone made an inadequate observation of the confusions of the case and didnt handle the case on the basis of what the auditor and pc could confront the auditor should look over two aspects of case 1 problems and difficulties that he can see in the case 2 the ones the pc can see these are often quite different there is certain level of pc difficulties that the auditor thinks is confrontable and then there is what pc thinks is confrontable if the auditor pays attention to the pcs view of problems and difficulties he will have some loses there is also the question of what the auditor can confront about the case vs the pcs view of what part of his problems as he sees them he can confront then there is also the level of doingness the auditor can confront and the pcs idea of what he can do about those difficulties he can confront thus there are six factors in the auditorpc relationship at scientology 0 1 difficulties the pc is in that the auditor can perceive 2 what the auditor can confront 3 what the auditor is capable of doing about it 4 the pcs estimation of his difficulties 5 which difficulty is confrontable for him 6 what is he willing to do about it you can get case failures by misestimation of any one of these this becomes quite important when you cant get ta action then little discussion with the pc can be very enlightening the greatest use of this survey is in odd advices to pcs advice is something we ordinarily ignore because of fear of evaluating but scientology 0 is the level of giving advice using the above survey would make you very successful advisor whose advice would always be followed 1 get an estimation of the problem situation 2 find what part matter how small he could confront 3 get what of that he can do something about 4 get what he could do about that 5 tell him to do it when you find out what the pc can do be militant about his doing it he will think you are genius but you are just getting him to actually estimate the situation and do what he thinks he can do about it when someone acts on that he gets larger reality more confront etc the cycle can be repeated after being successful once the only difficulty is that pcs confidence can rise faster than their real doingness sometimes pcs overestimate their confront ability so undercut what they think they can do just get them to do that point that they can do and you will have agreement because you havent told them anything that they think is false scientology 0 is the level at which one gets an estimation of the case or situation if you can get the other guy to estimate the situation you seldom have to scientology 0 deals with confront life is successfully lived with scientology 0 well in you probably came downscale just because it was out 524 l ron hubbard type 3 idate26963 volnum1 issue311 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec311 summary iii about level iv auditing 6309c26 shspec311 summary iii about level iv auditing do not underestimate the difficulty of r3 processes that look for the pcs goal what saves our bacon is r3sc which permits unburdening of the bank by removing the two top ris r3sc gives you variety of locks which can be called possible service facs you get perhaps five or six of these pick the one that gives the most ta to list goals on it wont be the ri but it will give you the entrance point for the goal then you can try to find goal which that fits by asking what goal wouldmight relate to possible service fac obtained from r3sc the overrestimulation of the top ris was what made finding the pcs goal difficult and prevented the goal from rocket reading to parallel with processing what the mind is doing has always been the basic mission of processing the mind is holding in the pcs two postulated ris based on his most recent goal on top of those we will have locks finding the locks takes charge off the ris we list goals against lock that gave good ta since it has been unburdened the goal can rocket read if you get the wrong goal ie too early goal you can oppose it to get up to the pt goal note that pt goal is not very hightoned it tends to be pretty degraded one when youve got the pt goal you want the top terminal this is hard to find because the gpm is truncated incomplete you can find out roughly where the pc is in the gpm and get the terminal by getting the pc to list what are you in pt that relates to the goal on all other gpms you can ask for the top oppterm but not in the case of the pt gpm this is the truncated gpm the programming for any actual gpm whether totally formed one or truncated one is to find the top ris go down through the gpm to the bottom and take out the bottomplusone ri you may have to find the next goal to get the bottom oppterm you want the goal as an ri discharged and you want what it opposes totally flat you want the pc totally out of that bank before you repair it you do it this way because the goal as an ri and its opposition hold everything fixed and rigid in the bank until they are gone go all the way down then come up check the items you found on the way down to see if any are still ticking if so they came from an incomplete list abandon that item and complete the list it came from from this you will get whole new series of ris to do the reason why we dont go from the bottom of the bank to the top is that the goal is part and parcel of every ri it you listed starting at the bottom from the goal as oppterm you tend to beef up the whole bank you throw every ri alive and the pc cant reach them he will have very heavy time you could find yourself getting turned around and heading for the bottom of the bank again it is easier to go from the top down partly because the pc has been implanted with thousands of gpms backwards the main reason is that the pc is more interested in the later ris than the earlier ones also you are unburdening as you go down coming up past actual goals while doing the goals oppose lists see p 520 above restimulates the pc more than if you just got the pt goal right off the bat but this procedure is acceptable so long as you dont try to run some far backtrack gpm if you foolishly start to run one you are committed to running it all the way out and it will be difficult since it is unreal and inapplicable to his pt condition it is great strain on the auditor and the pc the only reason why you get old backtrack 525 gpms being restimulated in pt and coming up for example in r3sc would be something like 1 the past goal may be some kind of dichotomy with the pt goal or with goal near pt 2 it seems safe it is far from anything that is wrong with the pc even if the goal you were running turns out not to be the pt goal finish running it then take another shot at the pt goal when you have the pt goal start listing for the terminal of the first pair of ris then go right on down the pt gpm clean out the whole bottom of the gpm when you have cleaned out the whole pt gpm you have to find the goal of the next gpm down then find the top oppterm of this goal that is easy you just ask who or what would the goal as an ri oppose then despite the pcs protest about it go back and clean up the pt gpm picking up any ris that you missed on the way down when it is all cleaned up you can put polish on it by prepchecking the auditing of it and prepchecking the goal sometimes the ta will go up and stick because the pcs interest is in the next bank down all you have to do about this is to call it to the pcs attention and the ta will come down if you dont finish up gpm it will give you trouble from then on when you do your next gpm do the same top to bottom and clean it up in reverse when you get two or more items ticking on this step always take the one nearest the top and work on it say you have three items ticking as you read the line plot take the top one then you wont have to worry about the other two they will fly off and cease to be part of the list recheck for ticks etc until there are more reactions get the idea of shortcircuited electric blanket 35ft by 3ft by 10ft coalblack or fuzzy black with grey undertones sometimes it is grey this object is one actual gpm of the pcs it is made of ideas both gpm and block of concrete are ideas if you get an actual gpm out of sequence and get items out of other gpms they pile up on the pc and jam here and there pc can get gpms out of sequence and maul them about say you have carpet of these things that stretches about mile at the bottom is the earliest past say you take the third from the beginning of track and insert it between the third and fourth gpms back from pt now crisscross the items from the early gpm with the items from the fourth gpm back when you do case analysis you park two of the gpms over to the left now you find more items in the gpm that is ten back you find wrong items and it goes out of gear and is thought of as long in the past it goes out with three that are twentyfive yards away this is longshoremens work in livingness the pc may have found new use for an old goal he may have pulled it out of line so an auditor gets at it goofs and you have debris all over the place it is mechanical proposition like diving into tar pits it is that physical when you run gpm correctly the pc will start getting repetitive rocket reads as the gpm folds up as the pcs perception comes up he can start to see the gpm discharge and fall apart sometimes you have to run two or three gpm before he sees these things the further back on the track gpms are the bigger they get they are like black islands the pc can energize the whole thing by raking his thetan paws over it grubbing around in it sometimes he activates his own suppress and it all goes black sometimes the pc gets into creak of bpc in his vicinity where he feels pulled or pushed into an odd shape by unidentified bpc 526 when pc is in trouble you have new tool to use analysis of whatever youve got for instance when you find an ri before accepting it do an ri analysis on it 1 make sure there are bypassed ris 2 find out whether it came off an incomplete list 3 find out whether the wording in it is correct 4 find out whether its position in the bank is correct 5 find out if it is from the right goal ie not from some other gpm if one of these reads finding out now saves time and trouble it is the same with goal we want to know if it is an implant goal or an actual goal and whether it is in the right place etc dont expect an analysis to be completely valid however the case can be so charged that nothing reads or that not enough can be seen to sort out what is there because of charge so we have the rule complete process cycles of action begun on the pc given available time and when you do case analysis do it and then complete what you were doing before you did the analysis eg you were opposing catgut the pc is in creak you do case analysis and find out that you had wronglyworded goal fine now go back and finish opposing catgut case analysis has shown up the fact that auditors have q and ad by finding something wrong going off to fix it and then never completing the action they were previously on this would be enough to keep pcs from going to ot the case analysis is there to take the creak out not to be followed it is the same situation as with an arc break assessment you want to find the bpc not to do something about it if you get case into repair session with lots of incomplete cycles which is now in the middle of something else finish what the pc is in the middle of because that is where his interest is or take the cycle the pcs attention is stuck in do that one first this is not necessarily the earliest cycle left incomplete however sometimes the pcs interest is in the case analysis and the auditors interest is in the case analysis it is more interesting than hodwork the pc wants to lay bricks and make things pretty if you find out that the item you are listing against is wrong dont try to complete the list complete the earlier list that you got the wrong item from the general rule of completing auditing cycles of actions begun on the pc needs to be applied using ones judgment about importances and working from fundamentals l ron hubbard type 3

another is communication education therefore the arc triangle operates if you can take effort out of the comm line you can normally get fast accurate comm line but when comm line loses enough mass it becomes unstable that is what happens with verbal data line sometimes there is data on tapes but not in bulletins this is unfortunate since sometimes there is data in the tapes that could make all the difference but you cant hold duplicatable standard because it isnt down anywhere in writing with nomass data eg verbal data it gets altered in the relay there is always some data that escapes the solid comm lines so you cant get all the data for this reason you have to reduce things to their fundamentals keeping what is important you can always have communication of fundamentals both for educational purposes and because to reduce something to fundamentals makes one understand it better 527 the relay of data from mind to mind b is susceptible to many alterises there are almost as many sets of alterises as there are minds for the data to be transferred through this also occurs on the timestream we probably have very little grip on what was thought in 1800 there was tremendous change in manners in the us because of the telephone movies radio tv and the automobile you can overload comm line by putting too great volume of data on it so that it doesnt communicate the door to learning can be shut that way too students sometimes feel overwhelmed by data and long for some fundamentals an overloaded comm line is overloaded because of insufficient time to peruse the material being communicated you can also have too little or too varied communication scientologys data is basically research data at present it is not yet sifted and clarified into fundamentals and less fundamental data we started with the definition of an auditor as one who listens and computes thirteen years later it turns out that listens is the fundamental not the and computes which was part of the original definition in the meantime lot of other data got added which in fact was only added because there was insufficient understanding of the original definition there is datum in the sciences subject has arbitrary data in it in direct proportion to its distance from the actual comprehension of its basics so you get into pure opinion and arbitraries as in art there is nothing actually known about subject when the subject is nothing but opinion opinion present is proportional to knowledge absent for instance when psychological testing requires the opinion of the tester you know that nothing is known developmental line is an ambitious selfcritical line which is trying to achieve parsimony of information the data keep condensing and becoming more fundamental with importances well evaluated this evaluation factor is missing in other philosophies eg that of krishnamurti krishnamurti on time is great but it is not evaluated for importance by him it isnt true that you are studying lrhs case the struggle has been to rise above ones case and the colorations given by the condition of this planet etc this has been quite successful whenever things get more fundamental bucketful of items drop out which can make one wonder what is stable from the past the stable data are the axioms the logics and prelogics the fundamental material of the philadelphia lectures and the behavior of thetan the only thing changed was the idea of exteriorization what will person do when brought to point where he doesnt have to be in body we used to think that he would move out of his body this is not what he will do he will move his body off of him because we have changed him upscale to where he could hold position the factors and arc triangle and scales of all sorts these are stable what has altered is applied technology not the theory better more efficient ways of applying the theory have been discovered it is reevaluation of data as applied tech that you are seeing and because you are studying to become an auditor not theoretician you need to know application what gives you headache if anything is trying to apply the theory to case so as to get result all your bulletins are addressed to this subject 528 the data that you are using to square away an aberrated student or pc has to be absolutely fundamentally true the project 80 hcob actually hcopl 21aug63 change of organizational targets project 80 preview p 1 where scientology is defined as the common peoples science of life and betterment drew some criticism because of one phrase the common peoples science of the mind oddly enough this is the one inaccurate phrase in the bulletin the critics didnt spot that fact they just objected to the phrase the mind tends to fixate on those things that contain an alteris of truth and an alteris of truth is the thing that most resists the truth of the situation it is an aberrated stable datum where you have slightly altered truth that you try to give to someone who has already got an altered truth on the same subject the two will come into conflict which promotes all sorts of bad applied technology it is like trying to drive truck through truck when you have two alterised truths in conflict to try to understand an aberrated datum through another aberrated datum results in complications so if you are studying body of data that has any alteration from the fundamental that should be there and you have an alteration that is contrary to the altered datum that you are trying to assimilate you get dogs breakfast you never look at what is wrong with the datum that you are trying to assimilate the conflict wont resolve because you have vested interest in trying to make it fit with an aberrated datum you get conflict of aberrated data against each other overlaid with opinions you have pc who is gold mine of aberrated stable data if any datum which you are using to solve that case is the least bit curved the case wont resolve but will develop new complications therefore the mass of technology that grows up in scientology is centered around applied technology you get masses of data that subside when fundamental is clarified so the greatest possible truth has to be used in application hence research is directed at finding the clearest fundamental possible we have gone long way and have made great gains but we still have to cope with the randomity in the person who is assimilating and trying to apply the data if you in assimilation of data are assimilating to the slightest degree data up against miscomprehension or an allness which you are putting in place of the auditor you dont get an assimilation you have difficulty assimilating the data but you can assimilate the data your trouble comes when you turn around and take the data youve assimilated and altered in some fashion and then try to apply it to the case that is sitting in front of you the alterises in that data will then bring about nonresolution of that case you are confronted with the only solvent is truth even though absolutes are unobtainable truth in very refined form the purest possible is the only thing that will resolve cases all the way because it is the one thing that the aberrated case cannot argue with therefore you as an auditor desiring results have business twisting the technology there is fortunately considerable zone of tolerance that permits the tech to work even when it is imperfectly applied as long as you stay within this zone of tolerance but the tech has to be as nearly perfect as possible the tech heretofore was too imperfect ever to work it has been lrhs task to bring about recognition 529 of fundamentals that is sufficiently great and tech that is sufficiently great to overcome lot of this alteris this task is thousand times greater than the task of simply presenting what is necessary to resolve the case we have to present if so accurately that the pc can still alter it and the auditor alter it and still have resolution of cases this is an heroic problem the amount of difficulty that you have with cases is directly proportional to the amount of aberration or alteris that you are adding to the data that you are trying to apply it is also inversely proportional to the purity and assimilatability of the material that you are asked to study that is tough one but it is pretty well handled the way you solve solutions is solutions wherever lrh has made little mistake or wrong emphasis there has been trouble because the additional alteris added by the auditor takes it far enough from truth to make it flukey to apply lrh in describing some horrendous auditing error says its good thing kids that im almost indestructible these things usually get done to first level iv makes an ot but it cant be varied 118th of an inch from its procedure and still work there was hole in it that appeared when it was imperfectly applied there are three types of goals that will rocket read 1 an actual goal with gpm connected with it 2 an implanted goal 3 an actual gpm any gpm can have in it up to hundred actual goals plus the goal of the gpm but there is another source of rocket read 4 phrase in an engram this wont necessarily rocket read but it might even pcs life or session goals can be free actual goals every now and then one will rocket read it is probably lock on an ri if you run it as an actual gpm goal you can even find items from the nearest implants or other gpms or locks but there was gpm there in the first place so when you find goal rocketreading you should check on the meter 1 is this an actual gpm 2 is this an implant gpm 3 is this gpm auditors have been asking is this an actual goal etc instead this can wrap you around telegraph poles because you will be trying to oppose it when it is lock on something and you can do this pulling things all out of place for awhile until the pc crashes in flames the three comm lines in session include the itsamaker line the pcs line into the bank the whatsit line and the itsa line it is an error to cut the pcs comm line to the bank in order to put in the itsa line this stems from misunderstanding of the auditors role as listener the error could also have come from failure to communicate the importance of the pc to bank itsamaker line since it was obvious to lrh that that was what auditing is all about he didnt mention its importance it is where the itsa line comes from without it the itsa line has nothing to carry the auditor is actually there to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the reason why that communication wasnt accepted or didnt go through is the reason why the auditor is having trouble auditing 530 education is acceptable to technical end only when it is conceived pretty purely and relayed well technical data must 1 be conceived purely 2 be relayed well 3 be received accurately its test in scientology is results auditors can also have trouble because they have glommed onto some older datum and made it an all but there is this overriding fact that datum i give you is substitute for you thats the burning thing to remember as an auditor datum wont audit pc the only thing that can handle auditing is live thetan because that is all that can handle the complications that come up youve got to have technology but the live thetan in the chair is necessary to audit the pc l ron hubbard type 3 idate161063 volnum1 issue313 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec313 the itsa maker line 6310c16 shspec313 the itsa maker line the itsamaker line is the line you are guiding as an auditor which sorts out the things in the case and gets the material that is reported to the auditor as itsa the itsa occurs at the end of this line the line from the pc to the auditor is the itsa communication line itsa is the identification of isness or wasness it is simple commodity until an itsa is recognized it is only potential itsa auditors can make mistake by thinking that there is potential itsa where there is only nothingness this is the commonest method by which an auditor refutes itsa the meter version of it is cleaning clean this is demanding more than the pcs got if you repeat the question this makes the pc feel as though you havent accepted his itsa when you do this in effect you deny the itsa that you have received you have cut the itsa comm line by refuting the itsa that was offered you may think that the arc break was caused by your cutting the comm line but it was really the invalidation of the pcs itsa that did it the auditor is likely to try to cure this situation by asking whether he has interrupted the pc that is also cleaning clean so the arc break intensifies you havent interrupted the communication you have enforced it you have to keep in mind what you are trying to do which is to get ta action all the significance on the case will have to be handled at level iv anyway so at levels i ii and iii what counts is ta action for description of these levels see p 462 above see also recent tape on level iv pp 524526 above everything wrong with the pc except how and why he started to make time track in the first place comes out of his gpms anyway level iv is the scientologists level the preceding levels mainly set the pc up for level iv i dont think that anyone will make ot except trained auditor trained auditors confront is up he knows what he is dealing with etc probably the basic barrier on the track in mental sciences has been specializing in results without also trying to make everyone into pro causer pcs have been audited on level iv in hgcs they have understanding of what is occurring they arc break easily they dont have the confront mainly they arent educated enough to understand what is going on so they get upset by reason of unknownnesses 531 there is only one way that gpms can be run you must find and run the pt gpm first then keep going on down the track to prime postulate then repair you cant do it as you have been previously told to because you will get items out of other gpms you cant repair gpm until you have gone through the whole thing but you cant afford to make single mistake because you will spend amazing amounts of time correcting it youve got tremendous processes at levels i ii and iii so you should be able to sit down with raw public pc and turn out 35 divisions of ta in your first 2 12 hours on any pc anyplace if you cant do this it is because of lack of understanding of one of the basic points of auditing like the itsamaker line you might have some wild idea about something basic it might even be scientology datum magnified out of all proportion to its true importance for instance you may think pcs never answer the auditing command so you always get the itsa from the meter and leave the pc out thus destroying the itsamaker line you and the meter can act as substitute thetan perceiving things in the bank that the pc isnt perceiving at level iv the material is subitsa you have to depend on the meter at level iv because the pc cant itsa what is in the gpm without some assistance the auditor can undercut this with the meter and find out what the goal is because it rocketreads but if we rely too much on the meter we cut the pcs itsamaker line you still have to stay in comm with the pc and avoid invalidating his itsa and cutting his itsamaker line this doesnt mean that you should be very careful it just means that you should know what you are handling and how to handle it get observant so that you can tell when the pc is introverted when he has said all he wants to say etc in session means not only 1 interested in own case but also 2 with the itsamaker line in on his case not on the auditor but under the auditors control the top of the gpm is hard to run it is resistant to processing since the itsamaker line is invisible to the auditor the auditor has to synthesize what is going on the itsaline is not unit area thinkthinkthinking it is an actual line between the thetan and real thing the bank an auditor who attracts or rapidly shifts the pcs attention to himself has moved the itsamaker line to himself and it has become whatsit whats wrong with the auditor etc the itsamaker is what makes ta occur it is the pcs attention line an arc break is caused by sudden shift of attention you should be aware that perfection in the control of the pcs attention and perfect handling of the itsamaker line is impossible you will make couple of mistakes in this per session even if you are an expert what counts is how adroitly you can wriggle out of whatever you get into not how careful you are to stay out of trouble it helps to spot the birth of an arc break well in advance of its overt appearance an arc break is much easier to handle early on and you wont have audited over the outrud if even implicitly you give the pc an order to shut up and let you write the pc will do it and keep doing it pcs and the bank generally do what the auditor apparently wants nonverbal behavior may communicate an auditors desire to the pc auditors main goofs consist of giving apparent orders that they arent aware of and dont intend like stop inspecting your bank and 532 put your attention on the emeter this may occur when the auditor fiddles with the meter lot fumbling takes away the auditors control of the itsamaker line by shifting the pcs attention to the auditor and the goof the bank always does what the auditor orders it takes combination of the auditors orders and the pcs inspection to get the bank handled randomity will occur the auditor who is allergic to unforeseen circumstances would do better to go to an old ladies home to get bank inspected 1 the auditor must direct the itsamaker line 2 the pc must put in the itsamaker line how does an auditor straighten these things out for one thing he can audit smoothly getting good ta so that he has cushion to use in working with the pc dont fix something when the pc is running well something that upsets you does not need to be handled if the pc wasnt concerned as long as the itsamaker line isnt affected in other words dont repair nonexistent situation if you try to repair something that didnt upset the pc you are cleaning clean and you will get an arc break sometimes the auditor gets consciencestricken this should not be remember that when you ask pc about something you put his attention on it you can also put pc on whatsit by being so conscientious that you are always looking for what is wrong you should only repair auditing when auditing isnt occurring case repair is otherwise an interruption of auditing l ron hubbard type 3 idate171063 volnum1 issue314 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec314 levels of auditing 6310c17 shspec314 levels of auditing getting ta motion is common denominator of all scientology activities the state of case of the pc has practically nothing to do with your ability to get ta motion on him some day you will cognite that if you dont yank the pcs attention off of his case and if you give him something to itsa and if you dont stop him he will get ta motion you can reduce ta motion by being unpredictable as an auditor eg by varying the form of model session keep the session drill constant and predictable from session to session or the pc will start running whatsit on the auditor then the auditor runs itsa on the pc and you get ta the auditor not the pc is in complete control of the bank the bank always does what you tell it to do the pc sometimes does and usually tries to when new style of auditing is released like listen style auditors at first go to pieces they will start introducing some listenstyle into formal auditing you should let the pc itsa the item or goal but thats all if you let the pc itsa the bank you will have sick pc on your hands the ta might move for awhile but the overrestimulation that the pc could get into will lock up the ta pretty soon the things that you are handling in the bank are the things that prevent itsa so letting the pc itsa around in the bank isnt effective the pc will restimulate that which prevents him from itsaing so he wont be able to itsa level iv is all subitsa but when you give the pc an item do let him cognite and itsa on it or you will stack up missed withholds bpc and high and stuck ta this presents bit of problem since eg when the auditor stops the pc from wandering into the wrong gpm there is bpc which can produce fierce arc break what you have to do is to audit fast enough and positively enough so that the pc never gets chance to wander 533 the two great dangers in level iv auditing are 1 the tendency for goals list to be underlisted 2 the tendency for an item list to be overlisted when you fumble command you are not in control of the pcs itsaing of his bank but you are in absolute control of the bank so if you fumble list the bank will fumble so the bank fumbles unseen to you the pcs attention line is on the point where you fumbled therefore the bank has shifted under that scanner and the pcs attention goes off onto other things because you have shifted other things into his view with your fumbling soon after such fumble the pc will add something to the session some kind of yipyap not necessarily critical you did something that showed that you did not have control of the pcs bank you distracted the pcs itsamaker line and shifted the bank underneath it with this goof so you are going to get some other stuff it isnt neat and clean the pcs attention will now be somewhere you dont want it if there is any bpc lying around the goof or cutting the itsa line will key it in and you will get an arc break you will get dispersal of attention the itsa goes all over the time track there is always bpc in session you cant avoid it the bpc is either from past auditing or from this session the keyin of bpc is always some communication failure eg cut comm or refuted itsa on the part of the auditor you could even get wrong goal and if you audited very smoothly you could audit without giving the pc single arc break because it takes cut comm line to restimulate any bpc even when it is there the fact that there is bpc does not mean that there has to be an arc break but the fact that there is an arc break does mean that there was some bpc bpc via rough spot in auditing via session keyin cut comm etc gives rise to an arc break wrong goal may cause very uncomfortable pc but need not cause an arc break whether there is an arc break from bpc is entirely dependent on the auditor of course the more bpc there is in the session the tinier the mistake could be that could key it in the cycle of any arc break is 1 bypassed charge 2 rough spot that gives the pc little dispersion 3 cut line on the rough spot 4 the arc break dead on the arc break you will find little misdemeanor but ten minutes to 1 12 hours earlier you will find nice nasty misdemeanor for instance you might find that some sort of forcingness was going on guide the pcs attention dont force it the bank does move to whatever the auditor says running an engram is like developing picture just have the pc look at it you can move his attention over it repetitively this procedure will develop his picture of whatever was there lrh did this with pc who was dead in his head lrh moved the pc to nonsignificant date and moved him through the next half hour over and over the pc got to where he was reading the mail that he had read at the time that lrh moved him to word for word if you get the date and duration of any picture on the back track the picture will turn on the only thing that fouls this up is 534 1 the comm line is too lousy for the pc to report that he has done it there are several ways to prevent pc from reporting what he sees you can also foul up the comm line by refusing to take the pcs data you could fail to believe that you were moving the date under the pcs attention 2 the track is stuck in something you can demonstrate the above phenomenon by taking some nonsignificant date and getting the pc to pick up everything in it by moving him through it enough this is even easier than getting aberrated incidents since there is charge debarring it running chargeless incident is test of an auditors tech because there is nothing there but the auditing if you dont go goofy and demand more than the pc has you can get the picture you may not get the pcs state of consciousness in the incident unless you spend long time on it it would be good test of auditing there is upset present except what the auditor introduces if your auditing is rough you will find that when you are trying to get the pcs attention on the rough stuff of level iv his confront will be lowered his confidence will suffer and his ability to itsa will be lessened the pc will only have difficulty on what he can confront and do if you make difficulty for the pc additions to the comm cycle do make trouble for the pc so keep itsa where it belongs when youve got nice long item list 20 items long give the pc his item let him look at it and cognite when he has done so you can show him the list and ask him how the other items relate now you will get more ta and more confusion

always has to be manufactured living beings are theta beings they have to work pretty hard to be entheta beings one may not be aware of the labor involved but it is still being done there would be mass in the bank if it were not being created in the instant in which it has an effect on the individual thetan creates his own bank it is not that thetan has created his own bank it is that he is creating his own bank at this instant there is such thing as continued creation all creation must be done at the moment it is perceived there can be utterly unconscious creation that is the source of the reactive mind the reason thetan is creating is contained in the things he is creating trickily enough the thetan creates the item creativeness which then forces him to create person generally cant confront what it is that is causing him to create or what he is creating to cause himself to create he is not confronting the fact that he is creating it so it is gone notised not asised the difficulty with this creativeness is that in view of the fact that the thetan can create so much automatically he cannot differentiate what he is creating so he cannot asis what he is creating 535 the easiest thing someone can do is to create an artist who is sweating over his creation has put some arbitrary barriers there such as time barrier eg it must be done in fortnight or economic barriers eg he has to sell it or he cant eat and possibly material barriers eg the paint he has must be used even if it is suboptimal you could sort this out with him easily this action taken to its final form is r4 you audit out all the gpms and ris youre auditing out the barriers which person has put in his own road in order to prevent imagined oppositions from having an effect upon him game of shadows we tend to poohpooh the trouble that the bank causes him because it is shadows but the individual does in fact have to be bailed out if groups etc are going to be made effective anything thats wrong with an organization is being created now by the organization it is the same with the individual difficulties in auditing are all made in this universe difficulties have to be manufactured except for the question of succession benevolent monarchy is the most nearly ideal form of government people wont accept it because it might fail next year benevolent people is preferable to benevolent monarchy you

organization there is enough theta to make it whiz unless someone is keeping it from whizzing livingness is monitored by the amount of arbitraries to which it is devoted the amount of livingness present is reduced by the amount of livingness invested in notlivingness in arbitrary factors it isnt really reduced strictly speaking because it is all recoverable by auditing by asising the notlivingness auditing is recovering the water from the mud pies the theta from the arbitraries the entheta and enmest ta action is the flow of theta coming out of the mud the mud is the bank why cant you audit pc who has screaming ptps because there is too much attention theta invested in the ptps entheta an auditors action is to find some entheta and to invest it in an orderly fashion to recover more theta from entheta when there is never any theta present you have psychology and psychiatry when there is theta present you have overrestimulation and you get ta action there has to be some pc there if the pc is unconscious ie all mud you have to run some cchtype process to get him aware enough to be audited take pc who is pinned down in fox hole he is out of food and ammunition with mortar shells beginning to bracket him in that is how some pcs feel they dont dare take their attention off of pt all you can do is to find out what the mind is doing and parallel it in routine 4 pc can get so keyed in that he doesnt want to continue auditing on r4 person with heavy ptp on the perimeter of his consciousness that you have eased off with lowerlevel processes who was doing fine at getting ris before now wont run as well he gets fewer items they dont fire etc this happens because the pc has attention invested in ptps the same thing happens at lower levels with the ta being stuck there is free attention with which to asis aberrated stable data at levels i ii and iii the pc can run into level iv when neither the auditor the pc nor the process are equipped to handle level iv 536 because there is actually more potential overrestimulation of the pcs ptp on the pcs track than there is in his present time environment when you look at gpms and their ris there is more potential restimulation on the track than there is in present time so the pc could be more restimulated by reason of keyedin gpms and ris than by simply getting knocked off in present time this liability is answered by auditing goals with in this lifetime prepchecks if the pc has given you some goal you could get rid of the level iv potentiality with such prepcheck probably but you will find while doing level iv that prepcheck of this kind is messy to work with when you have already found the pt goal you get to the bottom of the second gpm and end session with the ta at 30 week later the pc comes in with the ta at 50 something has keyed him in midruds dont handle 2wc on what has happened in the intervening week doesnt handle so you go on to list for the next goal and the ta goes down it was the next goal that had the case restimulated the pc went around talking about it i told joe it was _______ or _______ one of them at least was wrong goal and finding the next goal was the only thing that would bring the ta down so auditors at levels i ii and iii should be able to assess an arc break assessment that includes goal restimulated and item restimulated if you hit one of those the ta will come down ptps almost always appear on the goals channels the pc thinks that he is influenced by one or two ris and that his character is formed by one goal in reality it is the whole bank that influences him ptp usually occurs as keyin of an ri or gpm of one or another of the pcs goals chronic ptp is keyedin gpm out of sequence that can cause psychosomatic illness an educated pc will respond to an l4 or case analysis that spots the fact that gpm concerning that illness has keyed in if with good smooth spoton auditing there is ta action then r4 has gotten in the road spend session or two analyzing the case dont try to date gpm because it may span trillions to the x power of years you can date the top and the bottom of the gpm this will cause the gpm to move in find by case analysis what caused some chronic illness an ri gpm an implant gpm an actual goal etc actual goals stick on gpms as locks by themselves they are not aberrative gpms out of sequence gives psychosomatic illness ris can pull chunks of gpms along with them when the pc gets into the wrong gpm because of some similarity the bank isnt all chaotic it is actually pretty neat basically see fig 227 it consists of thirty bricks laid end to end each composed of forty subsections ris when you start thinking of the mind as vehicle of thought you are already licked in handling it it is not vehicle of thought it is made out of things like bricks and tar the spots of tar on the bricks are the implant gpms actual goals thousands of them are stuck onto each brick like lumps of dough the gpms look like black energy masses thats why thetans get restimulated by black energy masses the gpms can get shoved out of order say bricks five through eight have been inserted in between bricks 19 and 20 etc figure 22 actual gpms in the bank graphics inserted level i auditors dont have any business trying to straighten out gpms the meter is necessary because pc restimulated by the bank cant perceive the bank and can audit it hence there are three essential parts of auditing 1 the pcs body 2 the emeter 3 the auditor 538 level ii and iii auditors should be skilled in arc break assessments they can prepcheck goals in this lifetime and can do level ivtype arc break assessments if they can bridge the comm gap with the pc there is one case that cannot be patched up well at levels ii and iii case that has been run badly on r4 that has been thoroughly loused up can only be remedied by having class iv auditor straighten it all up you could prepcheck or analyze wrong goal and find out what it is and perhaps where it belongs etc any case that has had goals run would probably do very well with list 4 and case analysis to sort things out and slip them back into line the bank is full of pictures but the gpms are what need to be sorted out and gotten rid of at lower levels you dont disturb the gpms as rule as you go up you get closer to them until at level iii with service facs you could get rocketreading goal which you may or may not be welladvised to do anything with since it may be the fifth goal back everyones ability to create is so good that they can keep creating whole bank they underestimate their own power to create and stop themselves people get stuck in their own mazes and are now lost in their own creations they will never sort themselves out of the maze by themselves they dont want to be this way even though they are creating what entraps them every now and then thetan in the betweenlives area tries to sort out the stuff but this stuff is all subitsa and without meter or anyone to itsa it to it is hopeless even now knowing all about the gpms one couldnt make it without body or meter cf the buddhist conception that the only condition from which one can reach enlightenment is that of being in human body lrh has tried meterless systems but none has ever succeeded an auditor is necessary because thetan restimulated by his own bank cant see it but an auditor not restimulated can see it with an emeter as an auditor you must realize how slight the barriers are in fact until r4m2 longer seems difficult or complicated to you lrh knows that auditing at this level can happen because he has been through it all the way from the complication to the simplicity so you start at the top and start going back goaloppose ris ris ris making mistakes when things go all weird you straighten it all out and come back up to pt with it all aligned there are different types and styles of auditing but keep in mind the fact that it is the same bank matter what level or what pc you are auditing level iii is the only level that is really dicey since you are moving ris and gpms around in your search for service facs you can audit the only reason you feel you cant is because of difficulties that you conceive to exist 539 l ron hubbard type 3 idate51163 volnum1 issue321 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec321 three zones of auditing 6311c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing as an auditor you can now be found out by the ta motion that you get on your pcs an accomplished auditor can get ta at will ta motion has to be prevented by the auditor to keep it from occurring it is prevented by 1 additive complications 2 failure to recognize basics there are three zones of auditing and applied scientology 1 basic auditing 2 case analysis 3 routine 4 so there are three zones of expertise which you should recognize as separate areas of performance to be expert the auditor must be good in all three zones someone could do technique perfectly but lacking basic auditing and understanding of what the mind consists of he will not get anywhere lrhs auditing is perfectly mechanical and bythebook doing r4 he goes along doing it until the pc either gets to the end of the processing cycle or until the pc has fallen on his head in the latter case he becomes case analyst using different set of data namely how do banks go together the pc can say anything he likes about the situation as long as there is ta when the pc is done the case analyst goes looking for why the list is misbehaving having done an analysis the auditor knows that the accuracy of the analysis is subject to question because of the charge on the case so any charge gotten off will make more accurate analysis possible until all charge is gone only factors that are present now are analyzed former analysis is relied on analysis is valid after its date of inception because more charge may meanwhile have been taken off the case the accuracy of case analysis depends on the pcs ability to itsa so caseanalyses shift they are always conditional and timespecific there is trick of not speaking invalidatively while not buying something the pc is selling the pc says that x is his goal you say fine ill check it out calls the goal im sorry that didnt read in case analysis you look at the source that you got list from as well as the possibility that the pc was arc broken or not answering the auditing question etc when you find the right answer you will get some ta action it will correct to something like it should be when you reach that point you go back to being an auditor being mechanical etc and you give the question you go back to what you were doing you never wear both hats at the same time just wear the hat that is needed at the time there is one hat that you wear all the time the basic auditing hat lacking that it doesnt matter how good you are at the other two basic auditing is giving someone something to talk about letting him talk letting him know that he has said it when he has and running an emeter all the while the basic auditing hat includes 1 trs acknowledge at the end of the complete cycle of action if the answer involves only one itsa ack at the end of one itsa if it occurs after fifty itsas ack after 50 itsas 2 the auditors code 3 metering 4 itsa line handling 540 all basic auditing actions are coordinated with the pc there are four elements to what happened in session 1 what the pc did 2 what the auditor did 3 what the bank did 4 what the meter did the auditors actions in the session are relatively unimportant the most unseen character in the world is an auditor in session he is about as visible as drop of water in stream this is an almost perfect example of thetan with mass the important actions in the session are the performance of the pc the pcs bank and the emeter the auditors actions only matter to the degree that they interfered with the pcs actions an auditors actions can be anything so long as they are not destructive to the session an auditor runs mostly on lack of action auditing is third dynamic activity the auditor merely runs it basic auditing is like the firebox of the ships engine thetech is like the generating equipment the big engine is the bank this is not so great an analogy all an arc break means is that something has gone wrong in the case analysis department not in the basic auditing department wrong goal found can be listed smooth as silk but any later slip will produce an arc break basic auditing can always be improved it is not bunch of dos and donts it is thetan sitting in the auditing chair running the pc and the pcs bank verifying it on the meter and keeping up both the small and the large auditing cycles there are rules or tricks in it anywhere that solve all its problems because it is not complicated action you make it far more complicated than it is the zone of auditing called r4 mentioned earlier in the lecture p 539 above is really technique of any sort these three zones of auditing apply at lower levels too in the same order of use and importance basic auditing then technique and case analysis if you get confused in your own mind about whats what you will think that you need new technique when your technique is fine but your basic auditing is out you think that you are being trained as auditors when in actuality you are simply being untrained from all the complications which during the vast vistas of time you have accumulated with regard to human relationships and minds person believes that if he takes too much responsibility for one of these sectors it is liable to go wrong that is just because he is unconfident the think on it is it is best to let the pc run the session because hidden datum if anything goes wrong then it isnt really my fault and this is called making the pc selfdetermined or the opposite think can occur the pc doesnt know what he is talking about he will get himself in trouble and i will be to blame so therefore i had better do everything in the session and not permit the pc to do anything in the session because if you depend on the pc that will make him guilty and that is like blaming the pc you really shouldnt do that so we will relieve the pc of all responsibility we will get our itsa from the meter but what is all this worry about it going wrong an effort not to have wrongness is not session 541 there is very little to teach in basic auditing there is the pcs attention line you keep it on some area of the bank until he has said all that is there and when he is finished you see that he is and you tell him that he is done you can produce ta action with do birds fly with good basic auditing surprisingly enough auditing is doing basic auditing running process and having an analysis of the case that justifies running the process and that tells you when the process is flat auditing is these three departments the most important part of the session is the pc the next most important part is the pcs bank the next is the meter and its verification of what is going on and the least visible part though the most important part as far as the beingness of the session is concerned is the auditor session is an irreplacable section of time that will never occur again so what happens in the session is important the important questions for session are 1 what actually happened in the session 2 was there ta action 3 was the pcs ability to itsa and confront improved 4 was the pcs bank straightened out those are the important things not whether you appear in session in costume so long as when you appear in session your appearance doesnt impede the session appearance is only important in that it could be distracting or disturbing basic auditing training is simply the average action best calculated to produce result in session with minimal impedance of session gain there is completely proper auditing action except as measured against these elements all your selfcriticism is badly spent it is whether you produce results that really matters l ron hubbard type 3 idate71163 volnum1 issue322 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec322 relationship of training to ot 6311c07 shspec322 relationship of training to ot you are very fortunate people to come all the way down the track having done all those stupid things and to wind up here with chance out the chance is as good as you can audit and not bit better the number of rawmeat pcs that will go out through the roof is nonexistent unless they become fully trained auditors they wont make it the raw meat case is very easy to audit but what you are doing is auditing the charge off the top ris scientologist appears to be tougher case because the charge is off of those you will have to find the two top ris now and go on down the bank you cant go on and run the bank on someone who hasnt clue about his mind who doesnt know what is there frontwards and backwards the pcs ris only disintegrate when found in their right locations even though they can be found out of position so dont worry about case getting messed up by ris being found in the wrong place goals which have already been run can mess things up all you can do if an ri or gpm has been run is to date them even after you have run an ri you can verify it by dating the reason for this is that in running it you pulled it little out of its own timesphere so you can still get bit of bang on dating it and reorienting it you are just getting the idea of it which is still there in position the mass is already gone 542 sooner or later someone will take lot of clay and work out the mind with the pc an unusually smart pc who will get it and go on being audited with understanding but this will be very rare occurrence getting someone to be responsible for session occurs on gradient the people who start on an hca course etc are already preselected just by the fact that they enrolled any of them including any upperlevel auditor including lrh gets nervous over pcs wondering if the ta is moving the pc doing ok etc that is to be expected people who persist into upper levels of training are further predetermined by their willingness to continue in the face of struggle and disappointment there is an additional problem where do you take over the pcs itsa so as to allow him to itsa just enough neither cutting it short nor letting the pc wander around mucking things up these points vary from pc to pc and with the same pc as he gets more able some pcs have good perception and if they say it is so it probably is so with other pcs you can count on it that if they say its _______ it isnt you should be increasing the pcs perception of and confront on his own bank so as the pc gets closer to ot you should have him in good enough shape so that he can perceive what is there to be run next where you can deduce change in the pc you are of course changing the values by which you audit also the pcs itsa can deteriorate if he has had some loses and the case is going sideways and backwards you will have to take over more responsibility for directing his attention until he is fixed up cases are always different from one moment to the next lowlevel cases run on fat they have charge leaking out of their ears when you have gotten off the fat that exists on the two top ris you have got the whole bank to deal with now you have to be genius to find some fat to get off the case and the case is more likely to get arc broken from the aspect of cleaning cleans this makes you very good auditor what happens when someone is in the position of doing r4 they are probably somewhat trained by now but they will need more training the surest way to get to be ot is to be highly trained auditor for various reasons including the aplomb that it takes to confront the bank case is on its way to ot when the first gpm has been run out this can take up to two years after finding the first not necessarily the most recent goal running out that first top gpm is more hell for the pc than anything the thetan has thought of confronting and this is true for several reasons the state of the technology the hazards of the auditing possible errors previous errors the lack of the pcs perception of the pt gpm because of its pt restimulators etc etc raw meat not understanding what is happening wont put up with it they cant confront it even though goal is an incorrect goal it could be that only its position is incorrect not its wording you can get wrong items wrong line plot for an implant gpm without turning off the rocket read but if you take an actual gpm and try to run it on an implant pattern it turns off the rocket read right now and it turns off any other meter phenomena as well 543 there is another horrible datum an actual goal invalidated will now behave like wrong goal it will turn on the same creaks as really wrong goal the pc will arc break the same way it will read as wrong goal it will turn off arc breaks when indicated and so forth so now after you do case analysis prepcheck everything found so that you dont discard an actual goal it is possible that wrong goal sufficiently asserted and validated might behave like right goal one thing will still be the case any actually wrong goal or an actual goal run as an implant goal will turn off the rocket read within two or three items this saves you from running wrong goal you wont have any rocket read to run it with what is dangerous is that an actual goal thoroughly invalidated will be consistently discarded by the auditor he and the pc agree that to spit is wrong goal and they continue looking for the next gpm in line or the pt gpm but they will never find it many are called and few ever hit the top of the bank these are the sorts of errors that can occur and that make r4 hell for pc and auditor nothing will make it easier because that is happening with all the data the besttrained auditor and the most educated pcs r4 takes high degree of skill compounded with phenomenal degree of luck with hindsight one can see how things got off the track but as one proceeds one is walking in the dark with thousandth of millimeter peephole what takes time in r4 is the mistake the worse r4 goes the harder it gets for the pc and the auditor to see what is the true state of affairs however dont put attention on not making mistakes because the effort not to make mistakes will produce mistakes directly and indirectly most of the auditing time is consumed in handling mistakes and most of the mistakes you make are in trying not to make mistakes anything that can make meter go out or any condition that can get you an erroneous read is then susceptible to throwing out case analysis and your own efforts to straighten out case analysis are susceptible to throwing out case analysis and case analysis can be wrong in the first place ok those are the nerves with which you live so the only questions for case analysis and the only points of randomity should be 1 exactly what is happening with this bank that i am handling 2 exactly how is it going together 3 what are the contributive data i have with which to make up my mind about the situations in this bank so you have to have basic auditing and techniques down to the noattention state because there are enough hazards and difficulties in case analysis so that you have attention to spare for anything else the ideal scene with the auditor and the pc is still going to be porcupinejuggling act you should be able to think bank so as to be able to parallel the pcs mind well enough to figure out what is happening with the bank in front of you that is plenty to confront and handle therefore training is vital part of becoming an ot thus in the short run many are called but few are chosen though eventually all can make it by the training route 544 l ron hubbard type 3 idate271763 volnum1 issue330 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

sitting and looking at pc who has nothing to say or who has said all or when you havent asked question the pc will arc break failures in basic auditing are the usual reason for progress of case you cannot apply technique in the absence of basic auditing l ron hubbard type 3 idate281163 volnum1 issue324 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec324 seven classifications of auditing 6311c28 shspec324 seven classifications of auditing scientology will go as far as it works not as far as it is administered therefore lrh has focussed on full technological development first with the administrative picture to come later when the technical data was completed the administrative pattern could not be let out without having the technical data together the tech data turned out to be an account of highly precise coordinated activity it turned out that people couldnt be audited at high levels unless brought there gradiently this turns out to be true at lower levels too people have to understand what is being asked there is always repercussion to any stimulusresponse cycle or causedistanceeffect cycle the response being new stimulusresponse causedistanceeffect cycle so every stimulus response cycle has return stimulus response cycle where the first response acts as the second stimulus the philosophic conundrum is that you cannot act without consequences in this universe the buddhist answer to this conundrum is cause nothing ie by not building up karma we have another solution audit it out but only trained scientologist will grasp this the questions of what is right conduct and can you ever really cause anything come up here if you try to trace back the cause of something you can get into difficulty say guy is shot with rifle you can try to trace back the cause to the finger tightening to the thought or intention behind this to the motive to early childhood to mother ad absurdum to solve the problem of where cause started you could say it started nowhere but that doesnt really solve anything 545 people get so interested in the cause end of the causedistanceeffect line that they never look for the other end they never look to see what cause comes back from the effect point for instance oswald fired rifle and twentyfour hours later he is shot dead causeeffect cycle always leads to causeeffect cycle there is room for lots of think about it but one simple fact applies in this universe you cant cause something without receiving some sort of effect in return in this universe the magnitude of the effect may differ there is the question of how much you can confront how much you cause is monitored only by how much you can confront if you can confront getting shot shoot moral conduct would consist of only causing those things that could be confronted by those to whom it is caused that is route around the overtmotivator sequence cf the two rules for happy living in scientology new slant on life pp 2328 cause only what others can confront if you do this you lead rather unrestimulated life if you are causing things that others cant confront without great detriment such as starting war you can expect to get your head knocked off eventually even though you think you could confront it an overt is the generation of effects that are unconfrontable and the motivator will be someone causing an effect that you cant confront that is the story of this universe selfdetermined thought is not permitted in this universe the message of this universe is all thought occurs by association but this is not true what is omitted from this is that at any moment thetan can get an idea totally independent of all other ideas by an independent postulation not by stimulusresponse by prime motion that is what puts randomity into the whole picture psychologists and earlier philosophers didnt believe in independent postulation or they missed it lacking independent postulation there is trap they will argue that you cant think of an independent thought because whenever you do you will find that there is another thought with which it is associated in trying to disprove this you go into agreement with it so you cant disprove it this is the old hippopotamus mechanism dont think of the word hippopotamus was part of the alchemists formula for the transmutation of baser elements into gold cf the think thought process in pab 54 pp 23 people want to predict human behavior so they never look at the fact that human behavior can be unpredictable and take this datum into account as part of their predictions this denial of the human beings ability to be unpredictable takes away selfdeterminism of think in this universe now we get up to the question of how much think person can tolerate running overts on the man in the street we get motivators instead of overts all put forward as overts on self this relates to the concept of responsibility the man in the street thinks that it is all being done to him that is why book one has such appeal in scientology the emphasis is on you done it thus scientology has higher responsibility level than dianetics this makes scientology highertoned however it is harder to attract people to scientology on that account than to dianetics irresponsibility is very popular people prefer to think that they never started an action that they never really caused anything 546 this relates to the thinkingness of criminal the criminal knows that nobody owns anything anywhere but they have entered into conspiracy by which they pretend that people think people own things and this is done for only one reason these other people pretend this to get him in trouble and to be nasty to him courts exist not because there is such thing as crime but so that they can pretend outrageous and unreasonable things so that they can get him so criminals have total reality of the uncriminality of criminal acts criminal acts arent criminal to the criminal the cops have picked up some of our think on this eg the idea that criminals cant work but they dont realize that the person they arrested for overtly stealing car knows that the police are bunch of frauds the car never belonged to anybody and the police are fraudulently pretending that cars are owned in order to get this fellow in trouble mest goes to pieces around criminals because they know one owns anything the criminals reality is basically neurosis which at lower levels becomes psychosis for instance another characteristic of the criminal is the notion i didnt shoot anyone because there is one there everything is figment of his imagination solipsism his imagination gives him universe which he knows is delusory even the guy in the street has the idea that something was done to him that accounts for his condition he feels that all responsibility for his state of beingness is exterior to him the common denominator of most thought is it was done to responsibility lies without not within this individual failed or wouldbe writers used to get lrhs goat by saying i always wanted to write but i didnt have the education they were saying this to lrh who was trying to get rid of the phobias had instilled in him when you disseminate scientology you err by not estimating the amount of cause that the person is willing to accept you are willing to assume some degree of cause but he is not and he will find the thought of overt causation and responsibility to be unreal he believes that he is the total effect of life there is some truth to this the pc can be the effect of tremendous number of things to the extent that he cant see himself as cause you might be able to reach him at this level at some time in life in some area if you look it over very carefully you may find that you had something to do with what happened for instance perhaps once you decided to read book and did it that he might agree with you give him rule he might apply eg communication or how to do touch assist right and he will find that he has caused something by experience this approach is more effective than that of giving him the theoretical philosophical data he realizes that he is causing the effect people mostly want the comfortable agony of being at effect catholics get to thinking heresy if you tell them that they can cause effects or create things they are the toughest nuts to crack people who are saddled with religious superstition are the hardest to bring out of this rut in ireland the lecture on creation laid an egg every week for this reason create is the wrong word to use cause would be better though even that is hard for people to admit the areas where one knows everyone fails are those of communication relationships with people and health those are desirable effects so if you give the individual tools and let him find that he can cause an effect in these areas 547 you have snapped him out of the cycle of be nothing but an effect to cause is impossible etc it is not that the man in the street isnt interested in philosophy it is just that he has failed at it the savants have made the field seem unapproachable but what they are concerned with isnt live philosophy anyway the real philosopher is the little guy in the street who actually is concerned with questions like who am i what am i what am i doing here what are people what happens to when i die why dont people like etc in short the real philosophers are people like you and and those are the basic questions that philosophy hasnt answered but pretends to have answered at an unattainable level for many this failed attempt to arrive at answers to these basic questions led to the service fac god made everything cf the why is god we come to full stop in this search until we realize that every being is an independent being who is himself capable of expressing thought or intention independent of any other thought or intention at any moment the idea that man is or can be cause cracks the back of philosophy when we recognize that every individual is capable of being causative we have scarcity of answers when we realize that it is the degree to which an individual can accept or execute causation independent of other influences that brings about his state of case we have then cracked the whole riddle of philosophy and training person gives him the idea that he can cause an effect as soon as weve got time stream then all befores influence all afters post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy then we can prove that nobody can be cause because the time stream exists this holds water until we realize that the time stream itself is capable of being influenced by postulate the time stream can both be caused and escaped from it this is possible then we have level of cause that is senior to the time stream in disseminating scientology if you only tell people things about it on which you yourself have excellent reality and which you have experienced you will find that you communicate like shot to everybody because the rfactor in you is so high that you cannot help but put it across to others complete truth from the point of origin does get across with effect it isnt the startling thing you say its the real thing you say and it isnt whether it is real to the other guy it whether it is real to you the classification scale is scale of willingness to accept cause over ones destiny and that of others it gives the degree of being at cause madmen get into obsessive cause as lowerscale mockery but you could find where someone is on this scale every time by finding what he has done and withheld and feels responsible for ie what his ows are cause is not expressed in actions in life but in case responses it is cause over ones own case that is important where we are concerned people make progress in processing or they dont if they dont they set the same goals session after session if the pcs goals change violently from one session to the next there was an arc break cases dont leap from one case state to another they gradiently and smoothly become more at cause over more matter energy space time and other beings the person isnt necessarily becoming more causative he is more capable of cause he can handle his mind better he is therefore capable of handling other things better his responses in processing are your best possible indicator this is not quick test however so it tends to be neglected 548 case progress is direct index of cause you dont realize how far you have come until you ask someone on the street whether he has any problems and you find that he is living in madhouse from his viewpoint the seven classes of auditor are really eight because they start at zero an unclassed class plus seven classes see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified for description of the classes person could be class zero and have certificate without being of class that is important because there are always some people who work very hard and pass their checksheet but dont make the grade they get certificate showing that they were there classification means more than just getting the certificate class zero certificate is not sign of being classed there are all sorts of valuable processes lying back along the line and they fit into various slots for instance class ii will be studying comm lags of equal length as sign of when to end process this is all an effort to graduate cases on up the line lrh has found that they do not advance further than they are trained so this is the creation of bridge from lower to higher levels this increases information and skill and auditing availability right on up the way it is now people dont know where they are or where they are going or what is expected of them there are professional pcs from 1950 waiting for someone to process them to ot whose cases havent improved much there will be chart with all the processes and training skills of each class on it all the way up at some late date

certifications and classifications see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified why have we put in the classification and certification system the original method of dissemination very successful one was to gather group who had troubles and wanted processing and give them some training setting up coaudits and supervising them charging small fee for the supervision and having them pay only for patchup sessions as needed the textbook was the original thesis distributed in mimeo the auditing was clumsy but some fantastic things would happen when the foundations were formed not at lrhs instigation there were lots of bosses around and many schools of technology developed they started training on the basis of letting someone hang around for month or so to pick up what was going on that was parker morgans idea this started the academy these first auditors were trained to audit others not to coaudit lrh taught them straightwire the same fault turned up here as in the earlier group people wanted only to be processed not to process anyone this is destructive action because it denies training and dissemination and neglects the people who keep it going if you want lots of auditing to do get lots of coauditing going there are always lots of patchups to do 549 so the central organizations of 1950 went into the processing business and everybody they processed who wanted only processing and who didnt want to give anything for it introverted the purely pc person doesnt ever disseminate despite all his gains and ability because he never mentions his auditing unless you do something wrong this is the phenomenon of negative gain if something is eradicated properly the pc never says anything about it because it is gone the pure pc remains at the effect point and needs to be moved to the cause point to some degree with respect to scientology people who coaudit disseminate central organization can also make the above mistake they can concentrate on income from the hgc and neglect training auditors coaudits do produce lot of randomity all sorts of goofs do occur but that means repairs which can be done in the hgc the individual who is helping someone else while he is being helped gets his attention extroverted and introverted during the time the coaudit is on life gets off the first dynamic often for the first time it puts person in better frame of mind to combine both flows furthermore person can progress only so far without an increase of understanding which comes from training the pc starts at level i with itsa just talking about his problems etc assists and r1c are at this level then he changes gets better and moves up to level ii where repetitive auditing gets used and where it is the number of commands per unit of auditing time that determines the pcs progress this principle carries through to the highest level of ot processes the pc longer gets ta from wandering around in itsa so now you have to start pounding ta out of him with smoothly run repetitive questions cchs straightwire and ow are at this level then the pc moves up to level iii r2h see p 426 above the auditor has to be able to get the pc to spot things like bpc and if the pc has reality on it he will drift around you may have had the idea that the higher the process the more it would do for the case well the process that does the most for the case is the one that is realest to the case at his state of case that is new look technical revision the pc will get maximal gains on the process that is the most real the further his case is from optimum the more tiny little things are real and the more big tough things are unreal we were running people over their heads in 1950 they couldnt confront engrams but they did fine on straightwire processes pc who is being asked for selfdetermined changes for prepcheck see problems intensive procedure p 292 above may not believe that he has ever decided to do anything he may need to be run on some lowerlevel process like get the idea of deciding to changenot to change until he cognites that he can decide and eventually that he has decided it takes an educated pc to run arc break processes because you are asking the pc to look at complicated area unless he knows something about it it is too confusing and there is too much charge in his way then at level iv we handle service facsimiles the service fac is very esoteric thing to conceive of the pc has to take over responsibility for his own illness that is impossible for lowerlevel cases missed withhold running is at this level because missed withholds take higher level of responsibility to run than ow at this level we also get arc break assessments and case programming 550 at level v the pc gradually starts getting reality on the idea that he has had other bodies and other identities with some acquaintance at first with the past 2500 years at this level he works with implants engrams whole track and gets whole track case analysis at level vi the pc gradually gets reality on track back to trillions to the eighth power where the earliest implants are at this level he runs ot processes his own actual gpms and old r3 and r4 processes then at level vii he will get reality on track back to trillions to the 200ths that is real sweep of time here he finds that one gpm will cover from trillions 29 to trillions 21 dating gets crude when the numbers are that large at this level when the pc has all the bank run out there are various drills for ots route 1 change of space processing etc for route 1 see the creation of human ability pp 3343 this includes change of space processing done in connection with the grand tour the grand tour consisted merely of getting the pc to be at different places in the physical universe the change of space aspect added an alternation of being at these different locations with being in the auditing room the pc is made to run change of space on any area until that area is in pt this process is also known as r19 it is questionable whether any of these drills are necessary lrh has found that if he is exterior all he needs to do is to itsa to an auditor for awhile to get over feeling queasy about whether he can hold his position in space as far as we are concerned the whole problem is one of dissemination smooth processing and keeping the bridge open behind us the smoothest way to do it would be to insist that the individual doesnt outstrip his training level with his processing level how do you guarantee that someone will make it all the way that is an important question there is the economic question too if it would take 1500 to 2000 hours at 1000 per hour just to be processed then even if it were possible to go ot in this way it would be too expensive for most people how much would training fees add up to lets say 5000 to 6000 that makes it more possible this cost could be decreased further by requiring that each preceding course be very thoroughly done so that each subsequent course would be shorter the student would of course get unlimited processing provided he was expert enough to keep his coauditor thus the reality level of advance is cared for which takes care of dissemination so any hcahpa could train people at has up to class i this would give this individual coaudit area that he could cope with level ii training would be given in some district it would not be too expensive nor too long about thirty days is the most that most people could spend then you would have higher levels of coaudit going you would need textbooks for each level with all the relevant technology question and answer sections and exams that would really ensure that the person has got the data etc the system of the private scientology practitioner who takes people in processes them and ejects them hasnt been generally successful although few have done it this system is following system set forth by the healing professions which we arent it took the healing professions long time to get this going anyway private clubs also have privileges which are denied to members of the public who have government protection 551 the certification system handles people who do the theory part of the course but not for classification classification is shown by roman numeral if student is studying for the next class he can do the processes of that class provided that he has the nextlower classification but he cant do any higher processes without getting higher classification what about class 0 and class i class 0 has to be double the person is being trained for the has certificate and you have to consider him class of some sort going for the has certificate then you have has certificate classed class i that condition doesnt occur again after that the student always has certificate to put class on there are cases all over scientology that are parked because they skipped one of these levels and tried to leap into upperlevel processes while still worried about the environment it is true that only at the upper levels do you really resolve what is wrong with the case it is also true that you have chance to get at that without getting what is on top out of the way this also reduces the randomity and dangers connected with processing results l ron hubbard type 3 idate41263 volnum1 issue326 rev0 rdate000

auditing is auditors have misunderstood what itsa is giving rise to awful results they are getting their pcs to draw pictures giving the pc nothing to do and handling nothing the place to get your basic auditing together is at class ii basic auditing handles the pc handles the session handles the auditing comm cycle and handles the meter regardless of what else is occurring it is different at class ii than at class iv lrh has been improving his own auditing for the past few months basic auditing should be very smooth lrh has been improving his basic auditing in the area of observing the pc to see when he has said all that he is going to say then acknowledging him one can play it safe by saying nothing but that is cleaning clean comm lagging inviting more itsa when there is nothing there stringing out bunch of unnecessary acknowledgments is also comm lag keep the session rolling that is what gets good ta just sitting there listening is level i auditing it doesnt work at higher levels lrh found that he was causing the pcs dirty needle he also found that he had to increase the pcs ability to itsa by using the meter to get information only when the pc couldnt supply it he found that it is necessary to remain silent while the ta is in fast motion but one doesnt wait after that to see if the ta will move again at level vi the motion you get after the bd on an item is coming from the next level taking up and handling the pcs problems at session start during the session or at end of session is part of basic auditing basic auditing is 1 getting the pc to itsa 2 promoting and increasing the pcs itsa by letting the pc find data not relying on the meter to do it however dont give the pc the feeling that he is getting help 3 not talking while the ta is in fast motion but not waiting for the ta to stop jumping around 4 handling any ptps at session start as they arise or at session end 552 the tvd tape follows with lrh auditing msh the tape is intended to show basic auditing as well as technique it starts out with ruds then gets into goaloppose list lrh finds the pcs pt goal finds where the pc is in the gpm and finds her top terminal he finds the wrong top oppterm technical note the top oppterm of the pt gpm unlike any other in the whole bank should blow up and shouldnt keep on reading it should just go and it didnt so the auditor knows by now that it is wrong item since it didnt blow and that the pc is selling it so here we get into tremble and scramble the pc is getting arc breaky because the pc has wrong item if you missed the itsa once here you would get screaming arc break because the out session rud would key in the bpc of the ot process they do some more work with the top oppterm pc still wont agree that the top oppterm is incorrect however they do verify the correct terminal listing it straightened it out the top oppterm turned out to be being disobedient lrh points out the basic auditing of the session letting the pc itsa not leaving the pc with nothing to itsa the pc should have been arc broken by taking the wrong top oppterm and abandoning the right terminal the pcs ability to itsa is the road out keep the session driven keep it going take action promote and increase the pcs itsa it is the auditors job to make session out of it l ron hubbard type 3 idate51263 volnum1 issue327 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec327 basic auditing 6312c05 shspec327 basic auditing some of the data in this tape is also to be found in hcob 26nov63 all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysis the problems of auditing are divided into three categories 1 basic auditing 2 technique 3 case analysis technique means the exact patter and procedure for getting something audited on the pc we have dug up lots of old processes all of them are still valid except mockup processes processes like spot three spots in your bodyin the room run long enough tend to exteriorize people another exteriorization process is where arent you these processes are ok if they are not run to exteriorization exteriorizing someone tends to result in his coming back into his body more solidly because he becomes alarmed he is unstable this occurs at higher levels eg levels v or vi the pc tends to come back in and hold harder actually what upsets him is the energy masses that he is going through which exert certain emotional responses upon him the liability of these old lowerlevel processes is that they run the pc into gpms and can pull ris out of line eg the liability of tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting is that you could run into the ri forgetting but such an occurrence is very rare people coming up through level iii are in the charge of the top ris but they are getting destimulated as they get more 553 oriented and wiser in their environments just remember when running repetitive process that there is some danger of restimulating an ri especially if the process has fancy or oddball wording you even run this risk at level i when you ask what solutions have you had to that since the track is just series of solutions what saves your bacon is the pcs lack of reality on other lifetimes starting at level iii you would be wise to preface processes with in this lifetime do this for sure at level iv since the pcs awareness has come up and he will slip back on the track pretty easily your main problem will be the manic at level i who insists on running only past track this came up in elizabeth nj with the first foundation when couple of coauditors could only find pastlife engrams to run on each other joe winter parker morgan and john campbell tried to pass motion to make research on or mention of past lives offlimits because it had bad public presence they found out then that lrh could get mad public presence has nothing to do with the truth there is such thing as acceptable truth that is really just lie there is room in pr or public image for truth pr is nice but dont build on it build on truth with most pcs any attempt to go backtrack before their ptps are handled will produce nothing but disaster you are asking them to confront big new datum when they cant even confront their environment most processing failures come from the attempt to process someone higher then his class the classifications are laid out on gradient scale of increasing responsibility for self and the dynamics the processes laid out in any given class form gradient scale too plotted against increasing responsibility so it starts with motivators and ends with overts all this is still techniques the programming of techniques is based on case analysis every level has its own case analysis the three basic steps of case analysis are 1 find out what the pc is sitting in 2 get the pc to tell you about it fully get any lies off 3 handle it by locating and indicating charge as accurately as possible that is the pattern that you would use at any level this delivers the whole world of healing to us it was research target set last january and it has been met at level i this could consist of getting the person to talk about some illness that they have had at levels ii and iii you would find what incident the person was sitting in in dianetics this was done with an ageflash at level vi it is done with all the tech of case analysis asking if it is an actual gpm an implant gpm etc at level 0 it is how do you feel today what have you done about it do you feel better as pc runs actual gpms the subitsa and the pcs ability to itsa come closer and closer together on case analysis they fold over about half way to ot where the pcs ability to itsa surpasses the meter if the pc doesnt say itsa the meter wont read the meter depends on mass and shortcircuits in the mass you will eventually reach point where the person is selfdetermined enough that unless they think it it isnt so somewhere along the line you will also run into their recognition that they are creating all the mass what you will do there hasnt been worked out you will have to get across it and back to the beginning and the earliest postulates with regard to the making of mass and the creation of all this type of bank see pp 337339 above it is rough go unless your basic auditing is superb 554 your basic auditing at levels ii and iii has to be magnificent because the pc doesnt know what you are talking about he has nomenclature he has reality on it he cant put these things together smoothly the whole burden therefore is on basic auditing on handling the pcs itsa improving the pcs itsa never give the itsa to the pc on the meter when he can give it to you dont refuse to check the meter if he asks but wean him off it the only things that vary in basic auditing are the addition of more complicated metering as you go up the levels note that at levels v and vi you never use sensitivity higher than 8 other wise the needle is too loose improving ones basic auditing is the way to improve the amount of ta that one gets given particular technique used dirty needles come solely from out basic auditing see hcob 25nov63 dirty needles on level vi the ta moves around so much that you cant wait until the ta stops to say something you have to talk when it slows down the pc will get heat during bds which will be suppressed if you talk so that you will have to get the suppress off the heat to get it to turn on again if there is nothing going on it is up to the auditor to start something if there is something going on with the pc then there is need for the auditor to start something at the upper levels basic auditing had better be as free from attention as walking this sounds obvious but it is horribly true youve got plenty to do with the meter you dont have time to record ta except when you give the question and when the ta blows down when the pc gives the item apart from that you need ta counter to keep record of it just dont move the ta while the pc is moving around or you will get falsely high count youve got to stop the needle at set with your thumb in order not to cut the pcs itsa while centering the needle you will put in comm lag if you delay while centering it and the pcs attention will go to the meter there are numerous tricks that you can do with meters for instance you can brake the needle to stop it from wobbling know the needle well enough to be able to spot missed withhold without asking for it or to repair havingness without having to run any by getting the pc to spot what upset his havingness etc you can know ta behavior well enough to spot trouble before it arrives so that you are not startled when the pc erupts at level vi technique is an alldevouring monster you can spare attention for the meter or for basic auditing aspects such as the comm cycle there is zenith on how good your basic auditing can get you could probably make some mistakes with techniques and case analysis not many but you cant afford to make any mistakes with basic auditing especially if you do make mistake in another area nothing very serious will happen to pc because of technique or case analysis errors especially below level vi but basic auditing errors will pitch the pc on his head the only serious things that can happen to pc occur because of out basic auditing pcs feel badly when basic auditing is out invalidation is the only way to turn on somatics at level vi ot processes are as rough as there is invalidation it isnt that items turn on pain it is that if you invalidate right item or goal the pc can get good and sick this makes the steps of case analysis mandatory but if your basic auditing is in such that the pcs itsa is in you are less likely to make these mistakes because the pcs opinion and knowingness are consulted 555 the greatest dividend you can get from training is improvement of your basic auditing to point where you can relax and get technique and case analysis to hum get it perfected and your tone arm motion will triple l ron hubbard type 3 idate101263 volnum1 issue328 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec328 scientology 0 6312c10 shspec328 scientology 0 it works out this way having completed scientology research all the way to the top lrh has had to undercut it all to find new series of processes and new processing theory on which to build the edifice that is quite trick knowing the upper strata only makes it harder to build the lower strata because you see it so clearly that it is hard to see how someone else lacking your knowledge could miss it you can know exactly what is wrong with somebody but if he knows differently you cant get him to see your solution or your view of the problem lrh finally has scientology 0 to undercut scientology i it was description of the environment and what is wrong with it it has nothing to do with the persons mind at all scientology i is the isness of things and it takes care of the mind as well but scientology 0 takes care of the environment it is summable up as the dangerous environment that sums up 1 what you are talking about 2 the frame of mind of the person talking with you look around and find something that isnt threatening you or pushing ptp on you or trying to exteriorize you this will help to pull your attention out of the threatening environment it allows differentiation to come about instead of identification many people are professional dangerous environment makers the chaos merchants push dangerous environments on people in sensationalized form this includes politicians newspapermen policemen etc they spread confusion and upset and breed fear of the environment this is the same thing that blackmailer or an extortionist does they make the environment seem more dangerous than it is they sell the dangerous environment 100 the avidity of their sell can be used by the scientologist by means of sort of thetajudo practiced on them understanding scientology 0 includes understanding how to use the enemies of scientology the chaos merchants toynbee working out of libraries came to tremendous understanding of life he says that the reason that the mexican for example does not succeed is that he has insufficient challenge in his environment toynbee has obviously never talked to any mexicans it is myth that primitive peoples get apathetic because of insufficient challenge in the environment the challenge of the environment is actually overwhelming to downtrodden peoples primitive peoples etc the environment is too dangerous for fellow to have ambition this is actually true of anyone who lives on earth the individual on this planet if he has not been able to achieve his destiny is in an environment that he finds overwhelming his methods of dealing with it are inadequate and his existence is as apathetic or as unhappy as his environment seems to him to be overwhelming get those principles down and you will have scientology 0 lot of people spend their time worrying the people around them to death they spread confusion and upset while wondering why their victims dont get ahead these are smallscale chaos merchants compared with newspapers but they are more intimate 556 doctors get paid not by the number of people who are well but by the number who are sick the police would go broke if the prisons didnt make more and better criminals police chiefs would be unimportant if they had few police under them newspaper reporters dream of big story meaning good disaster the environment is never as dangerous as it is made to appear solution to the threat of nuclear war could undoubtedly be found especially if there were profit in it but anything that tends to make calmer environment meets and makes ridge with anything that has vested interested in the fact and idea of threatening environment the expansion of scientology will lessen the amount of fear it will lower the stress perceived by people as emanating from the environment scientology would make for calmer environment it would not be less interesting environment but calmer one one that is in less turmoil this could permit resurgence of the individual because he would be less enturbulated you would get beneficial spiral where the threat of the environment would be dying out the chaos merchant doesnt like calming influences they threaten his livelihood and survival on an individual level domestic chaos merchant gets upset when his or her victim gets calmer with exposure to scientology it is very disconcerting to chaos merchant to be met with humor instead of seriousness the true story of scientology is simple phd develops philosophy people find it interesting people find that it works people pass it along to others it grows that is what the newspapers are trying to make story out of from their viewpoint there is story because there is conflict you can amplify the story and get some statistics but anything else is distortion and lies added on to make the story disturbing and sensational but all disturbance folds up in the face of truth in universe kept going and continually disturbed by lies all the basic facts have been covered up particularly those relating to life and death many contrary data have existed fundamental questions belong in philosophy but philosophy has become so decadent that it is longer source of truth it is at best limited truth and in going for truth you have to go all the way see 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth pp 325329 above the clean blade of truth cannot be stopped but if you talk truth you had better have your hands on it socrates talked truth but didnt have good enough grip on it when you start to introduce scientology to anyone the first target would be the environment not the persons mind you could dream up processes based on the assumption that the person believes that the environment is too dangerous for him any relatively sane person will agree with you on that we know that it is being made to seem more dangerous than it is this is key point of scientology 0 so the person could be brought to perceive that this is so by his own perception it is also key point that the persons 1 health 2 sanity 3 activity level and 4 ambition are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment from these factors we can draw up an improvement program for any person we can therefore improve these things in the individual without reference to his mind we have dealt with this before under the heading of controlling environmental restimulation we 557 know that to handle his problems terminatedly we will have to handle the mind nevertheless we can get very marked and noticeable gains and improvements by handling his environment since we know that most of the threat that he is worried about is imaginary the therapy could be as simple as dont read the newspaper for two weeks and see if you dont feel better at the end of two weeks have him read the newspapers for week get him to see whether he then feels better or worse so that he can decide if he gets too upset or confused tell him to look around the environment and find something that isnt threat to him good havingness process at scientology 0 is finding out what is threat to person and running it as negative havingness process this is actually very sophisticated it could be used at upper levels run against some particular fear it is an improved version of take walk and look at things this is positive education the reason take walk look it over works is that the individual sees that the environment isnt threatening him to the degree that he thought it was when he has inspected it so you could use process like look around you and find something that isnt going to fall on you at scientology 0 you are trying to get the individual to inspect the environment and find some greater security in it the general auditing approach would be look around you and find out if the environment is as threatening as it appears to be but each person would have to be handled individually you could get person to look at the papers on his desk that are threatening him and find something in them that isnt threat that is taking walk while he is sitting at his desk for person who feels that everyone is hostile to him you could use find something that people say or do around here that isnt hostile to you or find one person in the organization that isnt actively hostile to you or was there anything said today that wasnt immediately and directly hostile to you this could also be played in the direction of exaggeration but then it goes up to higher level in mental direction get the idea of chinese in every corner shooting at you with cong hatchets you could use look around here and find something that isnt trying to exteriorize you etc all this runs on the single auditing command look there is effort to get any itsa about it almost any inspection of the environment is helpful except negative one if the pc has secondary if he has lost an individual in an environment where he has been with the person lot eg in love affair you can use look around here and find something that isnt reminding you of the exlover the mechanism here is that the person has identified everything in the environment with his unrest everything in the environment has become identified with the threatening things in the environment the persons charge on the environment can be destimulated by indicating things that are not so threatening thus getting person to differentiate when identification becomes differentiation intelligence and judgment can return an interesting commentary on the character of man lies in the fact that if you really want to interest people at lecture or pe course you should give them something that they can use to help others rather than something that will help themselves man is basically good and this is proof therefore your supplementary advice should always go on the basis of who are you trying to help to discover that the environment is less dangerous than it seems 558 you had better understand the data well enough so that you can give it to him well enough so that he can use it and see result and then use it on himself if you do this right you will often get the cycle 1 the person finds out something to help pete 2 it works on pete 3 he decides to try to use it to help himself take walk and look at things is about the mildest advice you could give someone it would be quite effective if he actually did it lrh did this and found that by putting tension on the beam with which he was looking at things he could pull himself forward without having to walk this got intriguing he went skimming his heels on the pavement until he noticed cop looking at him the master question is what part of the environment isnt threatening this question gets the person to differentiate you can also get him to arrange his life little if you can get person to just plan life in which everything is calmer and less threatening the life he is living becomes calmer and less threatening when you move this up into scientology i and introduce communication factors and show the person how to communicate with people he will find that he can produce an effect on people and that people are less threatening if you keep havingness in mind as you go up the levels you never lose the benefit of having the environment being less threatening which you started at scientology 0 all people are trying to 1 get out of the environment or 2 master the environment if they cant escape any thetan has these intentions and has had them all the way up the universe these are the only totally common ptps of an environment the individual would also like to find something to help his friends what you need is level of help that requires practically education at all this would become real to the individual just the concept that he considers the environment dangerous and would like to find the source of threat is an enormous piece of wisdom to him since before you identified it for him he was being it if you provide therapy by telling him to stay away from the things and people etc that upset him and find and associate with the things that arent threat he will make amazing progress this pushes whole new philosophy under the structure of scientology l ron hubbard type 3 idate121263 volnum1 issue329 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec329 summary of ot processes 6312c12 shspec329 summary of ot processes this is fast and rapid summary of ot processes this is matter of record not so much matter of education this gives the record of the final technology of bank running which is now complete and unvarying the technology is very precise it is extremely crisp you do not vary from it some pcs become fixated on parts of the bank and argue with you about structure for instance seeing two ris the pc may think that he has two and only two gpms there are variations as far as which implants someone could have someone might not have the helatrobus implants for instance but everyone on this planet has the train implant there is whole set of implants around trillions 2 which are similar to the helatrobus implants and for which we dont have the pattern 559 you can get variations at level v but none at level vi or the person wouldnt be here one person has not made different types of actual gpms than another you dont get variations at level vi but lack of data and an overburdened case could bring about an apparent difference in the case the differences are only mistakes made by the auditor andor the pc every actual gpm is similar to every other actual gpm in basic composition see fig 23t the goal as an ri is always the first ri in the bank it then runs on up the line on solve basis not on an oppose basis each item is problem with its opposite item going on up the bank but those masses are actually very huge spheres they are all the accumulated energies that anyone ever had anything to do with on this particular subject they have been lived through and they have been accumulated now an actual gpm has varying numbers of ris on the middle track the gpms have 16 to 18 ris in them late on the track closer to pt they go to 22 to 24 ris each one has crossover the middle pair of ris if gpm has 20 ris at number ten you will generally get the crossover the crossover is very important that is where the pc ceases to be for the goal and starts to be against it on the oppterm side you get progression up through the crossover point from the bottom oppterm which is dead opposed to the goal to the top oppterm which is dead for the goal and on the terminal side you have the goal as an ri at the bottom and it progresses up to the crossover for the goal and then on gradient scale goes against the goal the top terminal of actual gpm is dead against the goal if the goal were to be strong the top terminal would be something like weak or being weak that pattern has to be understood or the pc will get in trouble the patterns are all similar matter what the gpms position on the time track is as you go earlier on the track however there is this change you get more items for the goal ie the crossover point drifts higher but the position of the crossover is also monitored by whether the pc as thetan liked the goal or not the crossover would occur very near the bottom of gpm whose goal the pc detests eg to be obedient you can have the crossover appear almost at the goal on goal that the pc detests perhaps in the first couple or three pairs but this is not an important eccentricity dont be alarmed by it that is the only variation in crossover another variation in actual gpms is that earlier on the track the time span for gpm is longer eg modern gpm could span only billion years an early gpm could span trillions 20 to trillions 30 years there are about as guess 26 gpms in bank very few the closesttopt gpm can be expected to be truncated which makes it difficult to enter the track because the pt gpm may have any number of items in it in case analysis you can only count on what blows down the ta the emeter is not wholly reliable here the meter is only of relative use if all is perfectly correct on the meter you have chance of being right gpm when found will read if not forever it does give you nice long rocket reads and blowdowns when you find it but dont expect it to read forever 560 figure 23 structure of an actual gpm graphics inserted 561 now the pt gpm being truncated will have less than full complement of ris which makes it hard to find its top the present gpm has some top short of total attainment of the goal on the oppterm side and short of total opposition to the goal on the terminal side how short is the pt gpm dont cut your throat if you find after 75 hours that it only had two ris or if you find that it is really the second gpm and is there in full you may not find out that this is the case until you reach the eighth gpm you cannot be sure that you have the pt gpm or any other particular gpm you do the best you can and always suspect that there are more ris into pt once the thing can be repaired and you are getting charge off all the way it is not fatal to make mistakes in doing this but dont underestimate the ability of these processes to nearly kill the pc if mishandled say you skipped two gpms and started to run out the one below it the pc would feel like hell pc never feels worse than on r4 done wrong but he can live through it it is the auditor who is in danger wrongly worded gpm will shut off the rr the pt gpm is the one you are working for but it may not show up until you have run an earlier gpm the programming is done only one way in running these things that is you find the pt gpm you find its top terminal you list the top terminal for two items the first oppterm and the second oppterm from the second oppterm you get the solves it by asking who or what would it solve and you go on down the bank so it is always the same you find the pt gpm you run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm and get its top oppterm and then run all items out of it and find the next gpm etc until you get to the beginning of the time track you can cut in and find the second gpm first by accident and find out later on that it is the second gpm and then by doing goal oppose of it you can find the actual first gpm but that is at the risk of the game that is just fixing mistake properly you find the pt gpm or something that you could believe was the pt gpm you then run all the items out of it then you do goalsoppose list and find the next gpm you get its top oppterm and run all items out of it then you go on down the bank to the beginning of track and that is the only program that is successful taking any gpm that fires and then trying to goaloppose it to pt is not hard to do it is impossible you end up with messedup track you do this same program on every case including cases that have had goals found and run out in various ways you start with listing for the pt gpm what is your present time actual gpm this can be long list it follows goals list format when you get fifty items past the last rr seen on listing and you are getting ta while listing the gpm is on that list somewhere and you find it by elimination this sounds impossible but this pattern has been successful whenever tried pcs come up with the pt gpm every time of course it has to be an educated pc if not you dont have prayer it takes terrific stability on the part of the pc to hang in there when things get tight an untrained person wouldnt stand for it it is not that he couldnt be gotten into it but he will panic when things go wrong and he feels terrible he wont have the security of knowing that he can get out of what he got into it is basically understanding that will carry him through 562 here is tabulated summary of the r4 procedure as outlined in this tape 1 do pt goals list and get goal list for the pt gpm using what is your present time actual gpm you use goalslisting procedure that is you list fifty items past the last rr seen on listing if the ta is all run out then the list is complete you then find the item by elimination 2 try to count the number of ris in the pt gpm then plot it up accordingly and observe where the top of this gpm sits in relation to the crossover point eg say youve got 12 ris then you know that the top pair is one pair past crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal 3 find the top terminal by listing what terminal are you sitting in now 4 list two lists from this same top terminal to get the top oppterm and the second oppterm of this truncated gpm charge will expire on the top oppterm so then you will get the second oppterm because that is the way the pattern progresses going down into the bank after getting the top oppterm list ww wd solve top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm see fig 24 5 solve this across and continue to the bottom of the gpm 6 do goaloppose list to find the goal of the second gpm using goalslisting procedure 7 take the goal as an ri from the pt gpm and list who or what would it solve to find the top oppterm of the second gpm 8 take this top oppterm and list who or what would solve the top oppterm to get the top terminal of the second gpm 9 solve it across to get the second oppterm of the second gpm 10 run all the items out of that gpm in similar manner and continue on down the bank using steps 6 to 10 above to the beginning of the track figure 24 running the top of the present time actual gpm 563 it is the pc who comes up with the answers he finds out what is going wrong if you can get off any bpc he will start giving you some good data about what has gone wrong eg the pcs next gpm is found but wont read so gpm has been missed there is so much inval on the goal that it reads as wrong goal so the pc says that some inval is present so the auditor prepchecks the goal and on the rocket read comes and off they go but repair is too complex to do without help from the pc however pc can sell an item and if the auditor buys it it can land the pc in the soup also if the rr doesnt pack up in the first five items down the bank dont let the pc sell you on the idea that it is wrong goal wrongly worded or misworded lrh once let pc sell him on the idea that goal was wrong goal he listed and found two new goals without realizing that the pc had merely gotten into dramatization of one of the items of the goals gpm and therefore so despised this goal that the pc wanted nothing to do with this goal rule if it is running all right keep running dont make trouble until trouble happens since it is trouble that consumes session time take up trouble as it comes if the pc does get in trouble dont try to force the pc on stop and find out what is wrong and fix it otherwise you can invalidate goals and items and make them read like wrong goals and items the read you get on listing actual gpm items and goals is like nothing you have seen elsewhere it is not an rr and it is not fall and it is not anything else you have seen elsewhere tick will never be the item the real item hits rubber bumper and forces its way through like breaking through stone wall and then falls on through to bd these are item reads only an item read looks that way nothing else does it goes the whole dial and brings about blowdown the rule in itemfinding is to list as long as the pc wants to list and then find the item on the early part of the list that has variation the item could be wrongly worded early on the list and reappear correctly worded later on the list so that it looks as though it actually appears later on the list the item lists are short especially compared to most goals lists you might have shorter goals lists however when the pc gets pretty educated he can spot the goal right away the meter blows up heat comes off etc etc here is an example of an lrh bank the goaloppose question who or what would destroy oppose gave the next goal which was to worship to create was rocketreading implant gpm worship had nothing to do with religion it was too early the earlier you go on the track the simpler and more direct the goals and items are as you go later the items get more dispersive and complicated items like certainty and predictability and solved by unpredictability it will be less neat pattern the thetan is thinking more complexly more involvedly he is in more dispersed state on the middle and back track the thetan is simpler as you get back to the middle track word like the goal appears in 80 of the items on earlier track word with the sense of the goal appears in almost 100 of the items close to pt you get tremendous variation in items and more complex goals that are hard to get oppositions to with the goal almost never appearing in the items the hard end of the track is the pt end the thetan has less scope the gap is less wide between opposites there is more dispersion the thetan is nattery picky and so forth you can see the dwindling spiral of the thetan as you look 564 over these gpms the chances are far against getting simple goals in pt middle track goals are simple when you get two or three gpms back you start getting simpler goals on the middle track for instance you get goals like to do to think to postulate in later gpms there are more items and greater complexity the items disperse more quickly from the basic goal area as was said earlier the goal word appears less frequently in the items but the pattern doesnt change the top oppterm is definitely the goal and the top terminal is definitely against the goal the hard things to list are the top terminal and the bottom oppterm thats shootin into the blue the top terminal is very often but not always controlled by the goal that you are about to get ie the next goal up the top terminal may or may not be similar to the next goal it could be quite disrelated you can get fooled here the pattern might not hold eg the next goal might be the goal to postulate and the top terminal might be sitting you cant predict the top terminal except that it is opposite to the goal of the gpm that it is in the bottom oppterm is the reason he done it of course the real reason he done it is the gpm he just lived through but his particular penchant is usually expressed in the bottom oppterm because it is opposed by the goal as an ri the bottom oppterm is going to say what the person is mad at in the pt gpm like civilization or financial institutions this one is hard to get so the pc might miss it like mad the two bottom oppterms and the two top terminals in the gpm forecast some difficulty the toughest to get are the bottom oppterm and the top terminal how do you list one of these things first do your pt goals list and get goal then try to count the number of ris in that gpm the presumptive pt gpm then plot it up accordingly observe where it sits in relation to where the crossover point is say youve got twelve ris so you know that you are one pair past the crossover so the terminal is just little bit against the goal you can get the top terminal of the pt gpm by listing what terminal are you sitting in now if you want to ask why dont you list for the top oppterm it is the same as asking why dont you try to list the bank its the same question the pc doesnt know whats there relative to the top oppterm but he is sitting in and intimately connected with as himself this top terminal because that is the one that he is living through life in therefore it is easy to list for the top terminal so list for the top terminal and find it then list two lists from this same top terminal and get 1 the top oppterm 2 the second oppterm you are able to do this because charge will expire on the top oppterm when you have found it and therefore there wont be any more charge on this oppterm you then get the second oppterm because that is the way the bank progresses going down into the bank see fig 24 gpms always proceed downwards from the top oppterm why this pattern for running the gpm because if you get this higgledypiggledy in the first gpm you are going to be kittycorner from the oppterm to the next terminal below it and that doesnt solve the bank doesnt run that way and it doesnt solve that way and you will be in trouble so you get the two top oppterms 1 and 2 sometimes you almost wreck yourself by getting both oppterms on the same list both firing but you really need two listings so 565 you can tell which is which so after getting the top oppterm do who or what would solve the top oppterm and get the top terminal back again then take it down to the second oppterm solve it across and go on down the bank that way see fig 24 now items always solve goals always oppose never do goals solve list eg what goal would solve goal the goal as an ri sounds like goal but it is an item and that would be an item solve list for the next lower top oppterm so after you get the whole of the top bank now do goaloppose list to get the goal of the 2 gpm you now assess by elimination to get that goal thats the end of all oppositions until you are up to the point of getting the goal for the next gpm but you still have an unsolved ri which is the goal as an ri at the bottom of the top gpm opposing the goal as an ri is the most critical action in the whole operation take the goal as an ri and list who or what would it solve and get the top oppterm of the next gpm using nice beefy long list on this one that is the touchiest part of the bank if you get it wrong it will be wrong from then on out if you get wrong top oppterm you will go all over the place you will have the wrong gpm it is also the easiest to get wrong because it looks the simplest the top oppterm is the final achievement of the goal that you have just gotten from the goaloppose list the pc is now against it eg on goal to sneeze the top oppterm would be sneezing or people who sneeze or sneezers or having to sneeze etc if you get the top oppterm slightly misworded you have had it so do nice long top oppterm list you want 20 or 30 item list so dont take an item as the top oppterm just on the pcs sayso you can tangle the whole bank dont promote the pcs itsa on this one if you buy the pcs delighted itsa you are likely to get the third terminal from the bottom and get the whole bank upside down the other place where you disregard the pcs itsa is when you are halfway through gpm with the rr still on and he tells you that it is not his goal so get the list on listing for the top oppterm null it with the pcs attention on it ask which item had heat look around the area of that item on the list especially few items above the item that he mentioned see if you can get that area to read get the top oppterm and check it out mow be very careful when you get the top terminal the wording is critical the terminal has an opposite meaning to the bank at large when you have the two top ris make sure that both of them are absolutely correct before you go on the alternative is to get circular invalidation going where you are leaving wrong items behind you and listing from wrong items correcting and going ahead into messedup areas as you correct one item another gets messed up when you find wrong item behind you accept items that you found after you found the wrong item redo all the later lists the way you check out bank when looking for wrong item is to go back over it from the top reading the items off with mathematical precision with the session ruds in the wrong item that you left behind you will tick or rocketread that is proven rule if it reads it is wrong item invariably it is not that it wasnt opposed being wrong it reads and throws into question all succeeding items any items that occur after that if they are right are so merely by coincidence so you have to list again through muddiedup bank to correct the wrong item 566 take the list you got it from and look earlier or later if it was the first or second item on the list or the list could be incomplete but two items reading in the same items list means nothing listing rules dont apply to items lists listing rules apply to goals lists and only to goals lists you can have six items reading on an item solve list and it doesnt mean that the list is incomplete one of the six reading items is the item and you dont continue the list on wrong goal everything you write down reads for awhile then nothing reads the only thing that shuts off an rr is wrong goal wrong item will not do so you can overrun the gpm and run into gpm for which you have goal the only thing that shuts off an rr is not having the goal what shuts down the rr is not having the goal and this is the only way to shut off an rr even slightly misworded goal will turn it off so if the rr continues youve got the right goal so relax and once you get your goal dont call it again until you get to the goal as an ri refer to it by number and dont use the wording how does this ri relate to the goal use how does this ri relate to this gpm or to gpm _______ the reason for this is that every time you call the goal you pull the goal as an ri up towards pt and disarrange the bank you save it so that if you have to use it later to prepcheck off inval in straightening things out you can or you might want to save it for use in later cleanup even then you still say the goal as little as possible if you are prepchecking gpm goal use on this goal dont keep repeating the goal as this will drive the pc to the bottom of the gpm there are lots of things to know lots of indicators but only few simple rules and they are dead on for instance you ask is this an actual gpm after you have found the goal you always check it out when you have run five or six gpms you get response on the meter until the pc says it then it reads as you go down the bank the items will read when the pc says it not when you call it at first when the case is unburdened with r3sc etc the subitsa comes up towards the surface however further on down the line you lose the subitsa again the subitsa line reverses with the itsa line eventually basic auditing must be very well in and the pc must be easily auditable youve got to promote his confidence and itsa so that when you run out of the emeter the pc can handle it youve got to be able to talk to the pc and the pc has to be able to talk to you because in few cases itsa is all that you will have to guide you through the only thing that makes bad basic auditor is person who is afraid of becoming ot or who sees great deal of harm in being exteriorized or in being set adrift alone without body or the idea of setting people adrift or alone without body restimulates all those people that they have held down and stuck spears in the stomachs of that is exteriorization too someone whose basic auditing is poor at levels ii iii or iv will have it fly out at upper levels because he gets so restimulated at the idea of exteriorizing exterization restimulates murder so you get the idea that he doesnt deserve to be clear etc dont look for the significance to explain fear or terror of exteriorization it is just gpms shifting around and colliding caused by the thought of exteriorizing you can set someone up so they will do flawless basic auditing for one session by running ow this shows that they consider auditing to be an overt this was first tested in melbourne in 1960 567 there are arc breaky pcs there are only bad basic auditors the pc who is dangerous is the one who goes into propitiation or lower when arc broken such pc is harder to handle than one who screams any pc audited beyond an arc break will go into the sad effect you could audit the auditor on ow for short session and he would give flawless sessions this is very important tape the exact patter is on the demo tape of last wednesday probably 6312c04 shspec326 tvd 24 basic auditing pp 551552 above lrh also mentions color movie with all the tech in this area and the area of gpms l ron hubbard type 3 idate311263 volnum2 issue1 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec1 indicators 6312c31 shspec1 indicators this was the year in which we achieved the technology of ot and in which we laid the bridge with all the older processes from dianetics on it is the year in which we had our hardest attacks since 1950 these attacks are losing or have lost the irs lost its suit on lrh and msh irs means infernal ravening the work for 1964 should include codification of materials writing textbooks for the different levels etc several techniques have been developed for higherclassed auditor to run on lowerlevel pc we are ready to open the door wide on the subject of psychosomatic healing we could put it on an ethical basis by saying that if you dont get results on patient you refund his money anybody who is receiving level vi auditing see p 550 above for description of this level from an auditor who flubs goes through more illnesses and psychosomatics than anyone can count lrh understands the phenomenon of psychosomatics and is consequently little contemptuous of doctors treatment of these conditions it is rather horrifying from an auditors viewpoint to see what is thought of the illness and how it is treated the auditor would like to be able to see what goal it is what ri what service fac etc when chaos reigns caused by misalignment of the psyche this is fascinating in its complexity and disillusioning in the simplicity of its cause the technology for handling the bank has finally been worked out it is complex it takes expert auditing and an educated pc but the result is an ot this is far higher result than was expected before 1962 to degree that it is unreal to most people at times it is even unreal to lrh even when the auditor and the pc have tremendous skill they can make huge mistakes for instance lrh has been looking for his pt gpm for months he has found seven so far each one thought to be the pt one he has been unburdening the track by running them as they were found he is aware of good case advance since starting out now his goals lists go for five or six items one rocketreading then it goes on by stacking it up putting the gpm on top of it listing in to the top oppterm to see if there was anything there to see if there was gpm closer to pt we handled four of them like they were old sacks of straw he finally got the pt gpm for the first time he looked forward and saw nothing there he woke up wondered if couple were backwards creak got his considerations creak this is far cry from few months ago when he was wrapped around telegraph pole with regularity 568 you made the early gpms without having body so it is tough on bodies to run into ris etc it is nice to be outside not subject to the bodys intolerance of temperature extremes the problem lrh ends the year with is as an ot how do you drink cocacola it doesnt evaporate like liquor and lrh is too big to get into the bottle he thought of putting it in tub with ice if you have wondered whether you will ever make it all the way while you are making it all the way you will have many other periods when you will be certain that you will never make it all the way that is the greatest certainty that lrh can give you he has known many times that it was impossible for you to make it but he has recovered the final end product of scientology or of thetan in this universe has been achieved in 1963 whatever else can be said for the year indicators this is new subject routine 6 this is probably the procedure given in the last tape see hcopl 5may64 summary of classification and gradation and certification p 4 see also p 562 above for summary of this procedure cannot be run without knowledge of indicators and of the proper actions to do when certain things are present or not present indicators are present at every level there are good indicators and bad indicators to know about bad indicators you must know what good indicators are one needs to know both in order to have datum to compare with for instance you dont cut the pcs itsa because you want the good indicator of smooth needle and cheerful pc not because of fear of instructors in the field of say music one has some standards and expectations of how it should sound on hifi equipment etc that is the comparative datum the good indicator the standard test for hifi equipment is how should it sound poor hifi equipment sounds like you are in the lobby of the theater when the aisle doors are closed if you walk down the aisle to about the center of the theater and listen that is what good hifi equipment should sound like people watching lrhs auditing on demos have shown that they dont have standard to judge the session by lrh worked out good and bad indicators to make the standards known and explicit if you know what is right with session you can tell what is wrong with one good indicators people should be happy in session the only frame of mind that you can asis in is cheerful hightoned one the pc should be cheerfully itsaing to the auditor if he runs secondary he runs grief off of it and comes out of it etc we get picture of what the session should be with good indicators if they are not there then bad indicators are there these bad indicators should be handled so as to get the good indicators back gis mean that the auditor should continue what he is doing bis show that the auditor should so something else the particular bis that are present determine what the auditor must do eg if the pc makes critical remark about the auditor pull missed withhold do session arc break assessment or run ow how the pc should look and sound how the bank should respond how the meter should behave all these are the good indicators note that at levels v and vi the male and female clear reads longer apply since thetan doesnt have sex 569 the time to do something about bad indicator is when you cant go on with good indicators not just whenever bad indicator shows up the broad range of optimum ta range is 20 to 40 the common range of ta excursion is 275 to 35 there are three grades of bad indicators light medium and heavy they compare to the suddenness with which you must take action 1 the light indicator shows you that something is wrong so that you can be alert for need for action but nothing necessarily needs to be done 2 on moderate bis action must be taken as soon as it can be comfortably done 3 on heavy bis emergency crash action must be taken right now an example of grade 3 bi would be the pc not wanting auditing 4 grade 4 bi would be something like car going over cliff you hear dwindling scream this pc is never going to be audited again gis mean expected not extraordinary wanting auditing is more common than you would expect it is gi we take for granted if lot of gis are present few bis dont matter too much an ordinary bi not vbi would be the fact that the pc has ptp you tend to it promptly since pc with ptp makes progress pc with an arc break gets worse with auditing so that is vvbi that is the only time that auditing worsens case so the gis are pc in session with ptp and arc break this is something that one should know for auditing supervision you cannot supervise by bis only by gis because when gis cease to exist your action must be directed towards recreating them not just at eradicating bis you could base your expectations of case progress on how many gis are present for every gi not present some bi is present do the appropriate thing to remove the bi and get the gi back know gis more by heart than bis since if there is bi you can always go to the textbook to figure it out for instance you notice that the pc keeps having ptps you eventually think of the datum that when the pc keeps having ptps his goals must be totally divergent from the auditors goals and the session itself becomes the ptp dont act when bis are not present only correct what needs correction dont let win on repairing one pcs bis become the stable datum for all pcs who dont have the same bis this disposes of the idea that some pcs are auditable and others arent you are an auditor and the standard procedures on which you are being trained are the way in which you materialize gis in session they are all calculated to bring about gis in the pc the gains of auditing are astonishingly automatic these days you just audit the pc on standard program if bis pop up always take care of the worst one first naturally you want to get the heaviest bpc out of the way first and keep patching up the case only until you can get back on the road the gi on an auditing question is 1 the pc has received something to inspect 2 he inspects it 3 he tells you what he has inspected he answers the question fully as far as he is concerned 4 then you acknowledge 570 it doesnt matter if you gave him one command and he inspected fully and took half an hour to answer or if you gave him many repetitive commands and he fully answered the question he is going through an electronic circuit and he comes out the other end free of it having inspected it if you cut his itsa along the way he gets lost in the middle of the labyrinth of electronic material this gives rise to dirty needle just keep the pc going with gis building his confidence and not cutting his itsa moving him along up the line l ron hubbard type 3 idate7164 volnum2 issue2 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec2 good indicators 6401c07 shspec2 good indicators some of the material in this tape is also contained in hcob 28dec63 routine vi indicators part one good indicators the good indicators listed in hcob 28dec63 dont all apply to all sessions but most do they dont just apply to r6 sessions for definition of r6 see p 568 above if you learn what good indicators are you can spot bad indicators an auditor tends to look for wrongnesses that is the nature of scientology because if there werent something wrong with man he wouldnt be here unlike other ologies we see an individual as basically good able and powerful this is the reverse of most peoples approach so the way have to improve man is also different we have tremendous evidence that our concept is true and that the opposite one is erroneous for instance we found that childrens iqs drop more and more the longer they spend in school because the longer they stay there the more false stable data get shoved down their throats truth is demonstrated by workability though some dispute truth because its workability challenges their favorite theories all present sciences have built up to their current state on the basis of workability the idea of deleting something in order to bring about recovery from bad condition is not new with us but the simplicity of asking someone for solutions that he has had to the condition is new departure you can ask what solutions and decisions person has had relative to his lumbosis and get recovery from deletion of additives this is all part of the idea that adding something to being makes him feel worse take being who is feeling blah when we put in midruds we are subtracting actions we are subtracting the livingness of some period and he will feel better lrh has made more extreme test of this theory he subtracted an insane beings body from him by exteriorizing him when exteriorized the being was immediately sane back in his body he was insane again this is not therapeutic it is just an experimental technique the good things of life are havingness at ones own choice the individuals power of choice is the only thing he had to begin with which gave him power capability etc that power of choice has been consistently and continually overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things that he did want 571 someone who solves something and fixes the solution instead of just confronting the thing is putting himself down in power in scientology the only right we have to educate anyone is that we are teaching things that are as close to fact as they can be made and the technology of how it is put together is so close to how it is put together that it runs itself out this is the reason why scientology education doesnt have to usual bad effects of education scientology education runs itself out because it is so close to the truth whenever you have solution to problem it gets stuck except in the case of scientology scientology is the only solution in the universe that erases itself you can do almost anything with scientology because of this when scientology solves something it solves what has solved it its truths are shown to you so that you can reach other truths the data of scientology is so minor so sweet and so pure compared to all the other types of solutions gpms ris service facs electric shock treatment etc that we dont come under the heading of adding aberrative data to the individual as solution to his difficulties even if scientology data sits there for awhile on top of some aberration it will eventually reach through the thing on which it is sitting uproot it and the truth of the data will cause it to blow asis along with what it solved you are all sitting in some ri that could behave in this way an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are calculated to degrade and depower him all you have to do is to pick up to asis the mess and you will return him to power if you handle his school education for example his iq will rise the data of scientology is restimulation of more basic and fundamental truths which restimulated tend to blow later data some people can just study scientology and leap out of bed well this adds up to the fact that man to date is an addedto being everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope we have gotten him dependent on tools and that sort of thing the more you give person to work with eg the more machines etc he is supposed to work with the less he works his ability to work is reduced by these additives primitive cultures with minimal tools work long and thoroughly to create aesthetic elements as part of ordinary workaday objects someone with lots of tools doesnt get much done for instance the esquimo with very simple tools elaborately decorates his spear whereas the person with drill presses lathes etc says i cant do this thing because i have to have that other thing first theres relationship between having to have and getting things done the more you have the less you tend to get done have to have becomes never do the fellow who has to have and have in order to get anything done does very little the chinese carpenter working with handmade fish bone dowels and bowdrill didnt have to have anything elaborate to drill hole etc yet he was able to get more done by good deal than his western counterpart with his elaborate tools you could have added to the universe of this chinese carpenter the postulate that you cant do without certain tools think about that wording to the point where he could longer do that is an aberrative side to some thetans bent for collecting havingness eg lrh and his cameras in collecting cameras he has paid less attention to any one of them so now he gets fewer pictures with more cameras there can be minimum amount of equipment needed to get job done but an overwhelmed being has to have and cant do the more you add to the workman the less he can accomplish 572 because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses that is what is wrong with most auditors the recognition of the fact that truth is present to be amplified or increased is vital part of auditing if you dont notice the rightnesses present you dont see the truth present that can then be used to promote more truth so nothing gets done if you only recognize wrongnesses you wont be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think that you have any rightnesses to work with our only purpose in finding wrongnesses is to increase rightnesses you have to look at wrongnesses to remedy them but you have to look at rightnesses to increase them progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop away processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightness is present in the session you cannot take case that has rightnesses present and delete any wrongnesses auditing is the process of maintaining rightness so that you can delete wrongness you are trying to get right being if you dont continuously encourage right beingness you will never get right being to correct wrongness you have to have at least as much rightness present if rightness and wrongness are equally balanced it is dangerous situation you are better off if the rightnesses far outweigh the wrongnesses this will give you an easier job of auditing the pcs ability to asis is rightness of varying magnitude pc who is pretty overwhelmed cant handle or asis large wrongness if you delete good indicators from the session the pc wont be able to asis anything pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in the session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators in the session if the good indicators have dropped out of the session the pcs ability to handle wrongnesses is much less you have got to get gis back in before you can expect the pc to handle what you want him to handle you have to retrograde the process to match the state of the pc if he becomes bis for instance you may have to run the pc on touch assist or havingness you must watch and if good indicator goes out you look for the bad indicator if you are slow find out what happened and correct it bad indicators dont necessarily appear when good indicators disappear they are separate breeds of cat the auditor must always find out what is wrong in session before the pc finds out that is how you maintain altitude to maintain optimal altitude handle the scene when the good indicator goes out but before the bad indicator comes in spotting the absence of good indicator and remedying the situation with remedy of appropriate magnitude will avoid the expense of auditing time on expensive repairs light indicator means that you should be alert medium indicator requires correction heavy indicator means emergency any process has its own series of bad indicators bad indicators come in when good indicators go out dont spend your time looking for bad indicators just know the good indicators so well that when one of them goes out climb on and handle be alert but dont always be looking for wrongnesses 573 good indicators in routine 6 and lower levels 1 pc cheerful in r6 misemotion is allowable at lower levels for instance the good indicator would be the pc getting more cheerful in r3r misemotion should be diminishing but at level vi the pc should be running like grinning idiot 2 pc cogniting this should happen sometimes on any level lack of cognition indicates that the pc has ptp or an arc break or that he is running at level above his reality at lower levels the good indicator would be the pc cogniting at level vi the pc should be cogniting on ris and goals 3 pcs items found are the ones that the pc thought they were at lower levels it often turns out that what the pc thought was wrong is what was wrong the pcs fundamental rightnesses assert themselves 4 at level vi pc listing items briefly and accurately at lower levels the good indicator is giving things to the auditor briefly and accurately the pc is finding things accurately and speedily 5 properlyreading meter at level vi items found are not rocketreading at lower levels things found give the proper meter responses 6 at level vi short item lists at lower levels it doesnt take long time to get things done 7 items found without lot of wrassle at lower level this translates as being able to get data from the pc without big hassle 8 ta continuing in motion ta not stuck this good indicator can be overridden by the good indicator of the pc easily and rapidly flattening processes 9 active needle the needle is fluid or fluent moving not stuck mark v meter can be set at too high sensitivity giving the appearance of more fluidlooking needle than you really have it moves around on the other hand you may need high sensitivity for pulling withholds etc where it doesnt matter if you clean clean once in awhile on the other hand if you leave the withhold by using too low sensitivity you have had it for r6 sensitivity 8 is maximum for listing and 16 for midruds you can have ta action with gummy needle watch for that this is still missing gi the needle should be swinging cleanly 10 pc not being troubled by pains and somatics when answering auditing questions or any somatic the pc runs into discharges very rapidly somatic that stays there and gets heavier is bad indicator you want change somatics 11 ta goes down when pc cognites you should get further blowdown of the ta when the pc talks about something 12 pc gets warm and stays warm in auditing or gets hot and unheats in auditing the pc doesnt get chilled getting chilled is bi 13 pcs somatics turn on occasionally this is gi at lower levels it is bi in r6 14 ta range 25 to 375 ta range 225 to 30 is excellent this applies at any level 15 good ta action on spotting things the expected ta action for any level is the best indicator 16 getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong 17 pc has ptp this is good indicator unless the pc is in total propitiation the bad indicator would be the pcs developing ptps about the session in session 574 18 pc satisfied after auditing and staying certain of the auditing solution 19 pc not critical or arc breaky always gis 20 pc happy and satisfied with the auditor regardless of what the auditor is doing 21 pc looking younger by reason of auditing this is not common but it is good indicator 22 pc without weariness 23 pc without aches pains or illnesses developed in auditing 24 pc wanting more auditing 25 pc confident and getting more confident 26 pcs itsa free but only extensive enough to cover the subject under discussion if the pcs itsa is too extensive he is trying to stop the auditor from auditing the pc should itsa but not too much 27 auditor understanding why it is the way it is when the pc explains it or how it was the way it was the pc is saying things that make sense the auditor should be able to understand the pc 28 pc there under his own volition taken from next tape if all these good indicators are present you know that you are doing good job l ron hubbard type 3 idate9164 volnum2 issue3 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec3 bad indicators 6401c09 shspec3 bad indicators in trying to relay truth it is always necessary to break it down into system by which it can be communicated the system that breaks auditing down into basic auditing technique and case analysis is useful one see the tape 6 11c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing and pp 539541 above case analysis now breaks down into the general subjects 1 case analysis 2 good indicators 3 bad indicators case analysis consists of keeping continuous eye on the pcs indicators case analysis is 1 noting when the gis are still present 2 being alert and noting when one has dropped out 3 looking to see what bi has appeared 4 programming to remedy the bi with some appropriate technique actually there is shifting back and forth between technique and case analysis case analysis contains programming see the book of case remedies bad indicators include the fact that the pc is in body not an ot the corresponding good indicator would be that he is there of his own volition the first bad indicator is that the pc looks like he doesnt want to be in session anymore that is good indicator is gone namely the pcs being there of his own volition the bad indicator is unwillingness to be there that is our first hurdle free choice not there of his own volition that ends the case analysis 575 the above is simple example of case analysis from there on it is matter of selecting process to fit the case level what technique to use to handle this bi depends on the level of the pc and the auditor so case analysis starts out with the observation that the expected indicator or behavior ie the natural behavior of being the good indicator has gone out good indicators are actually the natural behavior of being the world particularly since freud with his idea of the censor has been crashing along on this lie that inhibited behavior is social behavior and that any uninhibited behavior is antisocial so the criminal is uninhibited so you have to punish him and put him in cell and if you inhibit him enough you will make social being out of him actually superinhibition brings about social catastrophes if you cant fix behavior you can always inhibit it you are suppressing it though and thetans forward actions and desires do not fade away they only submerge impulses do not fade away they only submerge this is axiom 0 thetan never gives up trying to create an effect holding grudge is 11 characteristic eg henry viii got even with the pope by creating the church of england this gives you better understanding of people in general seeing what happens when impulses meet with inhibition people get even you will understand history teen agers criminals and everything lot better if you realize that thetan never really gives up this is the secret of behavior this is why teenagers so commonly reject their families the child never forgives the parents for certain things often tiny things you have to find the source of rejection or revolt auditing easily brings this to the fore the child rejects his parents to get even besides forgiveness per is propitiation the source of mans ingratitude and the secret of leadership is just the fact that thetan never gives up as an auditor you are just auditing all the nutty aberrated inhibited times when the pc never gave up when he postulated something silly when he tried to do something stupid you can actually graph how some innocent goal or impulse goes through this process of degradation 1 it becomes inhibited submerged and warped 2 it emerges at lower level as an overt 3 below that it emerges as withhold you could graph that on any ambition 4 below that is unawareness which submerges down to 5 unconsciousness 6 humanoid that is how goal becomes an overt withhold unawareness unconsciousness and below that humanoid so when being comes in for auditing his being there of his own volition is the biggest good indicator there is he is surrounded by bad indicators which you are going to eradicate the hope factor is put in by validating whatever good indicators are present the next best indicator is that the pc is getting better betterness to us means less present in the sense of my ankle is getting better the pain confusion etc is less present betterment is the lessening of bad condition so the pc getting better wrongnesses less present is good indicator this is negative gain if all you did in session were to validate the good indicators that were present and attack and handle one by one the bad indicators that were present thereby restoring more good indicators you would get amazing results you would be enormously successful the pc would approach native state 576 dont try to train or audit someone against his own volition assuming that you have tried and failed to change his mind it is bad indicator all you need to be able to do is to spot gis and when gis are not present to spot the bad indicator that is present and to go ahead and handle it if case goes on talking about something he hasnt gotten rid of it and you havent yet achieved negative gain in the area all your lowerlevel gains are based on destimulation and removal of bis progress on case is measured by the number of gis that you are restoring this applies to level iv or below note that this is the precursor of grades auditing bad indicator 1 pc nervous about auditing level 0 at the lowest levels you assume that the pc is not there on his own determinism and work on fixing this up you want to have pc who is not nervous about getting auditing at level 0 discuss scientology with him let him know what it is about try to get him there under his own determinism get him to decide level i discuss auditing healing therapies etc get his ideas about these things reassure the pc that you are not auditing him to make him guilty you are only concerned with making the able more able get what others ideas or opinions are about treatment and what it might do to him try to cope with the pc intellectually get into general discussion of his being audited level ii here you could run repetitive process which could go as follows what have you had to do which you didnt want to do or what orders have you had to follow about your health general ow would also be runnable at this level level iii pull missed withholds on auditing past auditing or treatment prepcheck any of those or something like on auditing goals or on being forced to be audited you could run r2h now renamed r3h you could do arc break assessments or find the pcs basic ideas about being audited how he originally felt about it level iv here youve got service facs arc breaks with auditors practitioners arc breaks that the pc has had in past processing etc etc at level iv we can find one session that the person didnt want in the past because of withhold or something that would be key point to knock out of the way you could run how would refusing to be audited make you rightothers wrong why shouldnt you be audited is crude but workable process at this level bad indicator 2 pc unfriendly or cool towards the auditor unappreciative of the auditor or auditing this opens the door to large area of withholds overts cut comm cut itsa etc you can run out of itsa by specializing in solutions only not problems even though the ta motion comes from solutions thus you sacrifice some present ta motion for greater amount of future ta motion you could spend fifty percent of your time on problems and fifty percent on solutions and get more ta by not running out of itsa it is fiftyfifty proposition this is because gpms are fifty percent terminals fixed solutions and fifty percent oppterms fixed problems both give good ta 577 unfriendliness to the auditor could stem from the auditors keeping the pc from itsaing as area of interest including problems you must get into problems somewhat so that the pc has something to talk about at all the pc will get unfriendly if the auditor never gives him anything to talk about level 0 get the pc to discuss what damage the auditor might do to him or her this is lousy solution since it asks for more critical but it is better than nothing get the pc to explain why he shouldnt be audited this can get him quite friendly and right into session level i another lowlevel remedy would be how could you help this raises the arc of the pc you could also get the pc to explain any trouble he has gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely that also gets off few missed withholds you could use what are you willing to talk to about level ii you could use similar processes here as well as general ow on auditors level iii you could pull withholds missed by auditors you could prepcheck auditors practitioners help or failed help as indicated level iv you work on help and failed help on service fac basis using if you were really helped by auditing how would that make you wrong if you werent helped by auditing how would that make you right when pcs at levels v vi and vii are unfriendly to auditors there is some foulup in the root of the bank bad indicator 3 pc nervous about being audited in particular auditing room thats the auditing environment these things always run down to some horrendous ptp or arc break level 0 discuss the dangerousness of the environment level i discuss dangerous environments in general the trouble he has had in auditing rooms in practitioners rooms get solutions off how he has solved it level ii finding things that are safe level iii havingness level iv get associative restimulators here is suggested exercise make list of bad indicators that could be present if homo sapiens were dragged in chains into your auditing room then figure out what you might be able to do about these things given enough time perhaps over course of months you should be able to turn him into highflying pc by 1 seeing good indicator missing 2 noting all the bad indicators 3 selecting the one that is most in the road of auditing 4 eradicating that one first 5 continue handling the bis one by one by getting considerations off etc until more bis are present using this procedure you could get anyone matter how initially hostile he was to want auditing on his own determinism and not by overwhelming him auditing is converting bis to gis 578 as you work the case remember that the person has had some impulses somewhere along the line that got inhibited and submerged handling those by getting back to them will give resurgence of the case l ron hubbard type 3 idate4264 volnum2 issue4 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec4 auditor selfcriticism 6402c04 shspec4 auditor selfcriticism enough of this goofing off as auditors and students the subject of selfcriticism of auditing is very misunderstood because it is too simple lrh has been researching r6 see p 568 above during january on the theory that it is better for him to get the body knocked off than for the rest of you to get it r6 is incredibly complex but totally necessary you need very smooth basic auditing in order to make r6 work selfcriticism simply means taping your session listening to it and spotting what needs improvement one gets amazing responses to the question what happened in the session selfcriticism of auditing is vital from level iii on up the deeper you go into case the more reach the processes have the more nearly perfect your basic auditing must be flubs impinge to the same degree that the auditing does at levels 0 and i the auditor isnt impinging very much hence his flubs dont impinge much either at level ii with repetitive processing there is more impingement and less tolerance of flubs at level iii you are using the meter to reach deeper than the pcs unaided itsa here we have moved into an area where we can get hold of things that the pc wasnt ready to give there is more impingement so the auditing must be better since the flubs impinge more too the greater the charge you are dealing with the greater the bypassed charge can be the meter mines subitsa it increases the impingement of processing there is one thing that always happens when you run somebody above his level and get him into areas that he finds hard to confront you will get more bpc and arc breaky sessions the level of impingement of an error is greater than pc can tolerate when the pc is audited above his level so up to level iv the best handling of an arc breaky pc is to reduce his level this certainly doesnt apply at levels v and vi where the bpc comes from wrong goal wrong item or whatever at these upper levels reducing the pcs level will just leave the wrongness and the pc will go into sad effect if you give person wrong goal he will dramatize it more than the right goal this happens consistently in psychoanalysis the only thing you get off psychoanalyzed pc is psychoanalytic computations bunch of bunk invented items wrong goal doesnt asis it beefs up find the persons right goal and he will dramatize is less which makes somewhat goofy test for rightness of goal person tends to dramatize validated error more than genuine aberration someone who has had errors validated also tends to be very careful all the time this comes from some old advice he got you can find the error by finding out what the person is being careful of if you scan someone through his psychoanalysis you will turn on all his old symptoms if you keep it up they will turn off by erasure analysis cured its patients by inventing new evils the id etc it is an alteris negative itsa the analysand examines things that never existed 579 an auditor can wrongly date somatic then later auditor can date that somatic getting the same wrong date and he can in fact get some improvement of the somatic by getting off some of the charge of the somatics being wrongly dated but he may be deceived into thinking that he has the right date person dramatizes validated error more than an actual aberration that has been contacted if you find that the pc is selling something to you do case analysis 1 find out where he got the idea where he is sitting 2 get his considerations off 3 find out where it really is or whether it is really true the reason why one attacks process errors in upper level processes instead of since midruds is that everything that happened between sessions is sitting on top of the r6 error and it is much quicker to find and correct the error than to do the midruds see fig 25 figure 25 r6 process errors and since midruds graphics inserted at level iv you are dealing with service facs assessments etc the pc has to be able to spot and asis his own wrongnesses and overts by that time by level v auditor errors impinge and any piece of bpc left lying around will get restimulated at level vi the amount of charge you are handling ri by ri is huge and ferocious now that the precisely correct commands have been formulated you have gotten away from some arc breaks but if the auditor fails to clear the command it can act as giving the pc wrong goal or item or if the auditor fails to understand what the pc said you can get immense arc breaks for instance the pc said the second ri from the bottom the auditor thought it was the seventh ri that the pc was talking about he asks about the seventh ri to repair it the pc has huge arc break 580 new demands are placed on ones basic auditing as one moves up to higher levels so as he moves up the levels this can make the auditor feel as though he is auditing terribly the division into levels is primarily based on what is demanded of the pc and secondarily on what is demanded of the auditor but the two are almost parallel it is not possible to selfaudit r6 r6 requires the impingement of an auditor calling the items to get the charge off there is point where person becomes total cause over his own mind up to that point an auditor is necessary if you have an arc breaky session you can straighten it out by running ow on the auditor to yourself you are in perfect order to use assisttype processes on your own mind but solo auditing doesnt produce ta action because of the twoterminal nature of the universe in this universe one terminal all by itself is inert thetan has become so enmeshed in this universe that he has taken the physical universe laws to apply to himself there are two things that chain thetan down 1 mass including space energy and time 2 significance since 1950 we have known that someone could either dramatize nuttiness physically or in thought the mass gives you somatics and the significance makes you think that you are nuts gpm contains both thought and mass when you get the right mass and significance aligned with other masses and significances it vanishes amazingly enough as the thetan stops creating it it doesnt dissipate into energy although you do get heat it vanishes as nocreate without fireworks if you keep changing only thought and not mass you cannot make change in someones condition you cant handle the mass which is causing eg an illness the levels are approaching the gpm by cleaning up charge on all the locks and ramifications that are hung up on gpms the levels are familiarization with what could blow your head off at the very least the levels familiarize the pc with heavy somatics the auditing cycle is the basic discovery of dianetics and scientology all the way from level 0 to level vi you are using the same auditing cycle this is twopole universe and without an auditor or if you dont use the auditing cycle properly you dont get ta action adequate to case resolution in comm courses the comm cycle does things to people all by itself it is so powerful that by itself it produces results the auditor should recognize it as his main tool it has to be as polished as you have charge that can be bypassed on the case it has to be better and better as the auditor audits higher and higher levels the auditors auditing must be adequate to the level he is running his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing which is creating tone arm action only somewhere in level vii does the auditing cycle cease to be necessary if you havent got an auditor you dont have ta action if you havent got enough charge off your case you wont be able to do anything with it if an auditor is aware that his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing that gets charge off the pcs case because the auditing comm cycle is what makes him an auditor then he also knows that his auditing comm cycle must be adequate for the level he is auditing auditor selfcriticism allows him to see whether it is adequate you have tendency to overcomplicate the auditing comm cycle for the level you are running tr2 is the most important if not the only important 581 tr for raw pc since if you can let someone know that you have heard him that you have really received his comm you could get big result the other trs have to come in as the pc progresses up the levels here is the auditor selfcriticism procedure 1 do normal session 2 record it you should have 1 12 hours of tape with the voices well discernable this is because the auditors error is always earlier than rough spot in the session so you want to be able to listen to good stretch of time 3 as the session goes forward the auditor notes bis in session very carefully meter misbehavior any criticism by the pc dirty needles any worry etc 4 after the session the auditor notices in the session record when in the session the bis dn etc appeared 5 listen to that area 6 go backwards bit by bit few inches at time to find the breakdown of basic auditing that caused the bi or dn this should be few minutes or seconds earlier 7 find what the auditor failed to communicate or carry out 8 do that with every rough spot every noted bi if you follow this procedure you will find the errors and see that you didnt get away with the breakdowns in your auditing cycle although at the time you may have thought that you did you will find that if the pc snaps or snarls there is rough auditing comm cycle just before that pc never has reaction in the session independent of the auditor anything that happens in session good or bad happens with the auditor as cause the auditor is the source of the session 100 lrh found that as he moved up in levels of auditing his auditing had to improve so other auditors can improve too knowing what is wrong one can put it right both with ones auditing cycle and with the pc at the time before the arc break hits youre as good an auditor as you can handle the communication cycle and you are as skilled an auditor as you can choose the right process to put onto the auditing comm cycle l ron hubbard
