fy2007 rd funding levels to congress by march 15 2007 the bush administration had requested 1377 billion in federal research and development rd funding for fy2007 this sum represented 24 increase over the estimated 1345 billion that was approved in fy2006 as in the recent past the fy2007 increase over the fy2006 estimated funding levels was due to significant funding increases for the department of defense dod and the national aeronautics and space administrations nasas space vehicles development program see table 1 below the centerpiece of the presidents proposed fy2007 rd budget was the national research councils nrc report entitled rising above the gathering storm and energizing and employing america for brighter future the report expressed growing concerns about americas ability to compete in the technological global market place1 in response to the nrc report the president requested the american competitiveness initiative aci as proposed over the next 10 years this 136 billion initiative would commit 50 billion for research science education and the modernization of research infrastructure the remaining 86 billion would finance revised permanent research and 1 rising above

could reach an estimated 140 billion for fy2007 despite the aci most of this increase can be attributed to large funding increases for development spending in defense and for the national aeronautics and space administration crs estimates that total federal basic research funding could decline in fy2007 five agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22523 account for 90 of all federal basic research expenditures total federal research funding the sum of basic and applied research is also projected to decline in fy2007 american competitiveness initiative aci as part of the 50 billion for research initiatives the president called for doubling the federal rd funding over 10 years this increase would include the physical sciences and engineering research in three agencies the national science foundation nsf the department of energys does office of science and the national institute of standards and technology nist based on p l 1105 hjres 20 both the house and senate fy2007 appropriations actions would partially fund the presidents aci request based on house and senate actions does office science would would receive 200 million of aci funding while nsf is expected to receive an estimated 217million and nist an estimated 37 million of aci funding in fy2007 homeland security the department of homeland security dhs requested 1552 billion for rd in fy2007 an increase of 45 from fy2006 this total included 1002 billion for the directorate of science and technology 536 million for the domestic nuclear detection office dndo and 14 million for research development test and evaluation rdte in the us coast guard the request for dndo was 70 increase the request for the st directorate was 13 decrease the house provided 956 million for the directorate of science and technology 500 million for dndo and 14 million for coast guard rdte the senate provided 818 million for the st directorate less rescission of 200 million in unobligated prior year funds 442 million

national institutes of health nih for the second fiscal year in row nih is likely to see its budget decline in real dollars the president requested program level budget of 28487 billion for nih for fy2007 essentially equal to the fy2006 final budget and 668 million 02 lower than the fy2005 level of 28553 billion the fy2006 amount was the first decrease in nihs appropriation since 1970 nih lost an additional 195 million in fy2006 funds in june 2006 when the hhs secretary exercised his transfer authority to give the centers for medicare and medicaid total of 40 million from other hhs discretionary accounts dropping the nih program level to 28468 billion at the end of the 109th congress the house and senate agreed on the first nih reauthorization statute enacted since 1993 the nih reform act of 2006 pl 109482 the law made managerial and organizational changes in nih focusing on enhancing the authority and tools for the nih director to do strategic planning especially to facilitate and fund crossinstitute research initiatives hjres 20 would fund nih at 289 billion proposed increase of 6195 million this would allow the agency to fund an additional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22523 500 research grants and 1500 first time investigators sciencestatejusticecommerce the house and senate appropriations committees oversee the activities of four major rd agencies they include nsf and nist who are participating in the aci nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in the department of commerce the house passed bill hr 5672 would cut noaa funding from 610 million in fy2006 to 510 million in fy2007 concomitantly the senate appropriations committee reported hr 5672 amended in the nature of substitute which included recommendation of 779 million for noaa rd funding in fy2007 the administrations fy2007 budget includes 5813 million for nist almost 227 below the current fiscal year support for internal rd activities under the scientific and technology research and services strs account would increase 183 to 467 million most of which is related to the aci the housepassed fy2007 appropriations bill hr 5672 provides nist with 627 million decrease of almost 166 from the current fiscal year the version of hr 5672 reported from the senate committee on appropriations would fund nist at 764 million 16 above the current fiscal year for the first time both the house and senate bills would not provide any funding for nists advanced technology program under hjres 20 nist would receive an additional 50 million for research in its laboratories other budgetrelated issues the absence of an early house and senate agreement on the fy2007 budget resolution sconres 83 and hconres 376 played major role in delaying the passage of the remaining fy2007 appropriations bills how the house and senate resolve their differences regarding rd funding remains to be seen one approach that legislators have traditionally used is for the house and senate to split the difference in their funding proposals however as indicated in table 1 below 2 dndo was funded within the st directorate in fy2006 the percentage increases given here for dndo are relative to its fy2006 funding within st the percentage decreases for st are relative to its fy2006 funding exclusive of dndo crs4 this approach would result in some agencies either receiving increases or having significant funding reductions in fy2007 according to an article in cq 82 republican and democratic house members have requested that nsf receive the 6 billion the president had proposed for fy2007 in addition senators lamar alexander and jeff bingaman were circulating letter containing the signatures of 43 senators in both parties calling for the substantial increases in the cr for the office of science in doe3 in an article in the washington post representative david obey incoming chairman of the house appropriations committee and senator robert byrd incoming chairman of the senate appropriations committee indicated that they intend to extend the current cr until end of the fy2007 fiscal year if congress approves extending the current cr to september 30 2007 most agencies would see their fy2007 rd budgets remain at fy2006 funding levels further because agencies are usually not allowed to initiate new programs under cr the presidents aci may not be implemented in fy2007 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22523 limitations on rd activities the current cr allows agencies without enacted fy2007 appropriations to fund existing rd programs and activities at fy2006 funding levels however if congress approves yearlong continuing resolution new initiatives including the presidents aci proposal could be funded in fy2007 if congress approves yearlong cr funding for basic and applied research is estimated to decline 2 in real dollars further based on current congressional actions such agencies as the department of agriculture the department of energy and noaa would see their rd budgets decline significantly in fy2007 the cr would also cancel most of the congressionally designated performerspecific rd projects traditionally known as earmarks that were pending in the unfinished 2007 appropriations bills as part of hjres 20 nsfs research account would increase 335 million to 47 billion according to nsf this increase is downpayment towards enhancing u s global competitiveness by investing in basic science research however according to nsf the loss of the aci will result in the reduction of 600 new research grants also nsf notes assuming research proposal pressure remains stable at 2006 levels there would be decline of successful research funding rates from 21 in 2006 to an estimated 18 in 2007 nsf also indicated that funding for the epscor program would be frozen rather than allowed to increase as recommended by both the full house and senate appropriations committees in addition the cr would result in the loss of 40 planned graduate research fellowships occurring at such time according to nsf when many experts are calling for significant increases in this program according to nsf without these fellowships these best and brightest students from all fields of science and engineering may be forced to seek other funding or apply their talents to nonresearch fields 3 liriel higa and alan k ota c q today requests for extra money in cr multiply january 25 2007 4 shailagh murray and jonathan weisman democrats freeze earmarks for now the washington post december 12 2006 p a3 crs5 according to doe h jes 20 includes 200 million increase for the office of science as part of its fy2007 contribution to the aci the ratio of civilian and defense rd when president bush took office in 2001 the ratio of defense to civilian rd was 52 to 48 if the fy2007 house passed appropriations legislation becomes law defense related rd would reach 812 billion or 58 of federal rd while civilian rd would decline to 588 billion or to 42 of total federal rd spending5 this represents the largest discrepancy between defense and civilian rd spending since the early 1990s some argue that defense rd has little impact on the discovery of new knowledge and the transfer of technological innovation to the commercial market place this issue was raised during the reagan administration when defense research reached 68 of total federal rd spending in the late 1980s one of the major recommendations in the nrcs report rising above the gathering storm calls for an increase in federal investment in longterm basic research ideally through reallocation of existing funds but also if necessary via new funds by consenting to an increase of 10 annually over the next seven years the report noted that special attention should go to the physical sciences engineering mathematics and information sciences and to dod basic research funding according to the report this special httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22523 attention does not mean that there should be disinvestment in such important fields as the life sciences or the social sciences instead the report contends balanced research portfolio in all fields of science and engineering research is critical to us prosperity6 5 this crs estimate is based on defense rd as the sum of dods rdte programs the department of energys defense related rd activities and an estimated
