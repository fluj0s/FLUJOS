military operations in the 1990s nationalist aspirations among the ethnic populations of yugoslavia led to declarations of independence by croatia slovenia and bosniaherzegovina these were opposed by the serbiandominated yugoslav central government in belgrade and by the serb populations of these provinces though slovenia maintained its independence without sign ificant military confr ontations and croatia successfully expelled serb forces in short military campaign bosnia was the site of several years of internecine warfare among bosnian serb and croatian militias following the failure of united nations peacekeeping forces to quiet the warring factions the increasing instability led the united states and its nato allies to intervene directly resulting in the dayt on peace accords and their enforcement by nato military forces in 1995 in 1998 the serbian province of kosovo saw an independence movement arise among the ethnic albanians who compos ed 80 of the provinces population subsequent serbian count erinsurgency operations against kosovos civilian population engendered widespread cern among nato members culminating in natos first offensive military operations almost two months of air strikes eventually brought the serbian government to accept an end to its military presence in kosovo and the introduction of nato ground forces to enforce peace settlement nato deployments in both bosnia and kosovo have generally been heralded as successes active hostilities have been ended some reductions of military equipment have been undert aken and nationalis t militias

clinton subsequently emphasized moral responsibility to aid in ending the savagery of the bosnian conflict on december 14 1995 the presidents of cr oatia bosnia and serbia signed peace agreement in paris in brief the milita ry elements of the agreement in addition to establishing ifor and granting it full authority and freedom of movement to enforce the agreement called for 1 withdrawal of forces behind ceasefire lines within 30 days with demilitarized zone d mz of four kilometers 2 withdrawal of heavy weapons and personnel to barr acks 3 provision of information on personnel weaponry and landmines 4 arms reduction negotiations under the auspices of the organization for cooperati on and security in europe osce all these objectives have been completed to enforce the military provisions of the dayton agreements nato sent the intervention force or ifor which comprised approxima tely 54000 ground troops in bosnia proper that force design ation lasted until december 20 1996

1997support the return of displaced pers ons but not forcibly return them or guard specific locations support the efforts of the intern ational criminal tribunal the organization for security and cooperation in europe and the international police task force supporting tasks have become the primary focus for sfor operations given that the military provisions of the dayton accords continue to be observed the international war crimes tribunal requested and r eceived protection for its investigators and for suspected war crimes sites sfor also agreed to detain suspected war criminals if encountered but until late 1997 declined to participate in pursuit operations this refusal to take more effective action to apprehend suspected war criminals led to tinued criticism from the wa r crimes tribunal and human rights advocates those who favored greater action stressed the importance of supporting the international war crimes tribunal and the destabilizing influence of karadzic and other serb nd croat extremists since 1997 sfor has played more active role in detaining indicted suspects additional detentions and voluntary surrenders perhaps encouraged by nato s greater involvement have resulted in over half of those indicted for war cr imes currently being in custody former bosnian serb leaders kara dzic and mladic however remain at large duration of nato bosnia operations in late 1996 the lack of progress in civilian reconstruction and continued friction among the ethnic factions including within the muslimcroat fede ration led to the widespr ead belief that some nato military force would be required beyond ifors december 20 1996 mandate these concerns led natos political leaders to authorize the stabilization force sfor in december 1996 to last until june 1998 by the end of 1997 there was little optimism that bosnia would have viable national state or economy by that time1 fragile government institutions and c ontinued ethnic antagonisms lead most observers to believe that an international military force of substantial size will be necessary in bosnia for perhaps years if fu rther internecine warfare is to be averted some such the former high representative carl bildt have suggested the permanent stationing of nato troops in bosnia because they believe the re gions conflict to be the single greatest threat to contemporary european security and hence should be longterm nato concern while not accepting this position in march 1998 nato foreign ministers reauthorized sfor and tie d the duration of its deployment to the achievement of specified benchmarks of success in implementing the dayton accords nato leaders hope that tying withdrawal to demonstrable political and administrative progress will encourag more widespread cooperation in implementing the accords those who endor an extended sfor believe that return to ethnic warfare in bosnia holds gr eater dangers for us security interests than the prospect of continued

believed that their domestic public opinion would not support ground invasion of kosovo it was then perceived as choice between do nothing or proceed with air strikes some also suggested that in the wake of the 1991 persian gulf war some advocates have overemphasized the capabilities of air pow er encouraging the belief that ground forces are longer as crucial to achieving military objectives there was also criticism that command by committee hampered nato military leaders ability to wage an effec tive rapidly responsive campaign target lists weapons used and forces deployed we re all subject to prior approval by all nato governments this slowed deci sionmaking constrained operations and sometimes emphasized political over military considerations however nato officials maintain that saceur received all resources requested and emphasized that this consensual process was critical to ensuring the cohesion of the alliance more fundamental criticism is that the ai r campaigns actual objective from the start was political not military ie to bring president milosevic back to the bargaining table this in turn contributed to cons trained incremental approach to targeting after

constraints and military requirements some have suggested greater delegation of authority to natos supreme allied commander europe once the alliance has made the decision to carry out military ope ration however within an alliance of democracies which maintains full consen as fundamental principle this approach has not achieved acceptance in addressing this issue gen clark emphasized that structural reforms aside there has to be strong political consensus founded on common perception of military doctrine to overcome the obstacles we hit in the air campaign 2 in responding to the critics of the air campaign gen naumann has noted that nato planned for limited operation from the outset and made this fact public while president milosevic planned for war naumann also observed that nato threatened military action without having consensus on how it would be carried out thereby precluding its military commanders use of overwhelming force from the beginning 3 in the wake of the yugoslav accepta nce of nato peace conditions supporters of reliance upon nato airpower believe th ey have been vindicated in their approach they emphasize that nato sustained combat fatalities in the

peacekeeping operations in kosovo the house armed services committee expressed its concern that under or unbudget ed contingency opera tions have diverted funds from qua lity of life readiness and modernization programs seeing funds budgeted for kosovo operations in fy2000 nd seeking to ensure that incremental kosovorelated costs would be dealt with only through specific budgeted accounts or supplemental appropriations the committee inserted provision in dods authorizing legislation hr 1401 prohibiting the use of any funds authorized by the legislation for military operations in

military operations in the balkans see crs report rl31185 the war powers resolution after twentyeight yearsconsiderations for congress at the outset of military operations in both bosnia and kosovo congressional reaction was mixed in both cases re solutions in favor and in opposition to participation passed either the house or senate but legisl ation authorizing or prohibiting us participation passed both chambers appropriations for these military operations were never denied though extensive reporting requirements often conditioned the funding6 if current intentions are carried out nat forces including us troops will be completely withdrawn from bosnia by the end of 2004 and replaced by european union force of both police and milita ry personnel with that withdrawal close monitoring of the eus mission performance and bosnias political stability would appear to be the pr imary remaining concerns while nato troops may withdraw from bosnia there appears to be time line for withdrawal from kosovo c ontinued nato military presence in kosovo will probably remain until the provinces political future is determined and perhaps for period thereafter whether the nato c ontingent need continue to include us troops is however open to question th possibility remains that the european union could eventually assume peace keeping responsibilities in kosovo also however that is unlikely to occur until its performance in bosnia is evaluated recent legislation pl 108384 to authorize appropriations for fy2004 for military activities of the department of defense and for
