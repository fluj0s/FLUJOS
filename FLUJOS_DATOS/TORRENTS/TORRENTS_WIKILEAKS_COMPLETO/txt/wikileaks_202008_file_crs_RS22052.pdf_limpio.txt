committee on taxation comparison of revenuer elated provisions of hr 11 revenue act of 1992 as passed by the house and senate jcs1692 102nd cong 2d sess washington gpo 1992 p 36current tax law generally taxable income s included rental income fro m real property however present law provides an exclusion for minimis rental income this exclusion applies to rental income collected for rental periods of less than 15 days per year the exclusion may apply to rental income from either primary home or second home the law also precludes taxpayer from taking deductions fo r any operating expenses attributable to that income such operating expenses would include items such as gas electricity telephonecableinternet servi ces or maintenance expenditu res and also depreciation current law allows taxpayers to claim deduction for qualified home mortgage interest expenses and property taxes which can include rental income property if the property is either the main home or the second home of the taxpayer the tax law does not distinguish between personal and business use for the purpose of the interest and tax deductions for the short term rental period legislative history and rationale the exclusion of minimis rental income was enacted by the tax reform act of 1976 which had six stated major goals as r easons for passage one those goals was to improve the equity of the tax system at all income levels w ithout impairing economic efficiency and growth another of the stated goals was to simplify the tax law by modifying individual income ta x deductions and credits befo re the passage of this act the marketing of vacation homes frequently emphasized the tax benefits of renting the property for part of the tax year congress found it difficult to distinguish rental activities engaged in to make an economic profit from ot her rental activity accordingly under the 1976 act congress set up rules that limited deductions for rentals when the taxpayer also used the unit for personal use2 both the house and senate b ills for the 1976 act provided minimis exclusion while not specifically stated in their reports it appears likely that congress saw the exclusion as simplification measure the senate bill would have provided an exclusion for short term rentals of less than one mont h over the course of year the conference agreement followed the house bill which provided the exclusion for rentals of less than 15 days over the course of year in 1992 the house passed hr 2735 which would have repealed the 15 days minimis rule that same year another bill hr 11 also would have repealed the broader exclusion but provided one exception that exception stated that when accommodations to visitors to an event for which comme rcial accommodations can provide more than onehalf of the needed accommodations then the currentlaw exclusion and denial of deductions applies to the extent that the rental rate charged is not greater than the reasonable commercial rate3 hr 11 was vetoed by former president george h w bush and thus the provision did not become law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22052crs3 4 taxpayers would have been permitted to offset rental income by an

expenditures committee print jcs0205 109th cong 1st sess washington gpo 2005 pp 5758 6 ibidother efforts to repeal the minimis exclusion have been made repeal efforts were included in the house version of the balanced budget act of 1995 and the house version of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 in both of these cases the provisions for repeal were dropped while th bill was in conference the proposal again surfaced in 1997 and was introduced as revenue offset to hr 2621 known as the reciprocal trade agreement authorities act of 1997 this bill reported by the house ways and means committee failed passage on vote in the fu ll house the most recent proposal for change prior to the 109th congress was made by presiden t clinton who called for repeal of the minimis exclusion as part of the fy2000 budget request made to congress under president clintons proposal the prohi bition denying deductions associated with the costs incurred for the rental would also have been repealed4 proposal for change on january 27 2005 the joint committee on taxation unveiled new report entitled options to improve tax compliance and reform tax expenditures 5 which included proposal to limit the exclusion for re ntal of residence rented for fewer than 15 days the proposal provided that the firs t 2000 of rental income would be excluded from the taxpayers income for those ta xpayers whose rental income exceeds the 2000 amount the proposal would allow for deductions attributable to the rental property such as depreciation however these deductions would be redu ced in proportion to the ratio of excludable rental income to total rental income the joint committee on taxation provided the following example of how this would work taxpayer rents his residence for fewer than 15 days during the taxable year the taxpayer receives 5000 in rent and has 2000 of otherwise applicable deductions arising from such rental use under pres ent law none of the 2000 is deductible and none of the 5000 of rental income is incl uded in gross income under the proposal the allowable amount of the deduction is re duced by the ratio of excludable gross rental income to total gross rental income ie 20005000 this reduces the otherwise applicable deductions arising from such rental use by 40 percent from 2000 to 1200 after reducing the gross rental income of 5000 by the amount of the allowable deductions the taxpayers net rental income is 3800 of this amount 2000 is excludable so the taxpayer has 1800 of taxable income from the rental of the residence6 current law prohibits deductions associated with the costs incurred with the minimis rental income under the proposal ma by the joint committee on taxation this prohibition would be repealed as such taxpayers would be permitted to offset rental income by any expenses such as fees char ged by rental agents electricity gas house cleaner services etc wh the rental income exceeds 2000 the proposal does not indicate whether the 2000 amount is to be adjusted for inflation in future tax yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22052crs4 7 ibid p 58 8 hr 2621 was reported out of the house ways and means committee but failed passage in the house 9 this special rule was contained in 301e of hr 2621 as drafted the bill stated that if dwelling unit is used during the taxable year by the taxpayer as residence and such dwelling unit is actually rented for less than 15 days during the taxable year the reduction under subsection a2 by reason of such rental use in any taxable year beginning after december 31 1997 shall not exceed the depreciation deduction allowe d for such rental use the courts have traditionally held that while taxpayer may choos not to avail themselves of depreciation deduction if that deduction is allowable then the propertys basis must reflect the allowable depreciation when sold technical changes were discussed with an agreement that the word taken for allowed would make the provision less ambiguous while noting that the 2000 dollar limitation or any amount is arbitrary the joint committee on taxation explained that the current unlimited exemption amount is not justified using minimis rationale further the committee noted that dollar limitation would allow congress to target the minimis exception to taxpayers with relatively small amounts of rental income which is more consistent with the minimis rationale7 in the current proposal taxpayers who ve rental income greater than the 2000 minimis amount would be required to take depreciation deductions for the rental period though specific legislative language was included in the proposal some past proposals such as that suggested in the 105th congress in hr 2621 the reciprocal trade agreement authorities act of 1997 8 would have provided special rule which would have applied to those taxpayers who re nt their homes for less than 15 days the intent of that rule was to provide those ta xpayers who had short term rental the option to claim depreciation deduction on the home current tax law provides that for those taxpayers claiming depreciation for residential rental property the straight line method based on 27 Â½ year period should be used if depreciation deduction was claimed then the taxpayer would not need to ad just the basis of the house upon later sale9 assessment economists believe that under theoretica lly pure income tax income should be defined as broadly as possible since current law excludes rental income for stays less than 15 days it understates in come and thus does not tax income properly at least according to theoretically pure income tax in contrast proposals that include rental income in gross income and allow appropriate expenses provide fo r purer tax treatment if the proposal included provision allowing the taxpayer the option of claiming depreciation deduction then ec onomists would find that those taxpayers who forgo the depreciation deduction associated with the rental income would be overtaxed on that income by the amount attributable to depreciation nd not deducted if the rule is included as was suggested by the joint committee on taxation those taxpayers required to take the allowabl depreciation deduction would likely have extensive recordkeeping relative to the small deduction allowed resulting in both high administrative expenses and increased tax code complexity to claim depreciationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22052crs5 10 the joint committee on taxation stated that t he burden of this additional basis calculation however is relatively small when weighed against the more accurate measurement of economic income for such taxpayers achieved by the proposal p 58taxpayers must remove the value of land not depreciable amount from the propertys basis the deduction is likely to be small b ecause of the short rental period up to 14 days out of 365day year and the long depreciab period 27 Â½ years further those taxpayers taking the depreciation deduction w ould need to recapture and pay tax on any previously claimed depreciated amounts upon sa of the property the administrative costs would be high not only for the individua l taxpayer but also for the internal revenue service considering the small dollar amount s involved the tax provision is not likely to be cost effective thus theoretically correct tax treatment would greatly increase complexity for taxpayers10 requiring the computation of depreciation c ould result in taxpayers deciding that the rental income was not sufficiently high to offset the accounting and tax preparation costs however if the proposal were to allow taxpayers to choos whether to take deduction for depreciation and not require taxpayers to make reduction in the basis of the property then it would not increase tax complexity it would however be counter to pure income tax model several arguments are made against exclusions in general for example some may argue that all income should be included in th tax base because it is the best measure of an individuals ability to pay taxes other arguments suggest that upperincome taxpayers receive greater subsidy from exclusions th an lowerincome taxpayers because of the higher tax rate upperi ncome households face it appears unlikely that lowerincome persons are more prone to rent their homes for twoweek period than those with higherincome because of the nature of special events or areas with limited accommodations where dema nd is high it can be expected that the costs of accommodations will rise and likely be expensive again news reports suggest that higherincome households are those s eeking such accommodations and that their demands are for more luxurious accommodations more likely to be owned by higher income individuals it is unclear who benefits from the current tax laws exclusion of income from short term rentals while unsubsta ntiated news reports typically associate the provisions use with special events or locations for ex ample homeowners in the washington dc area are reported to have rented their homes during president bushs inauguration while homeowners in new orleans historic french quarter have rental opportunities during the annual mardi gras period besides special ev ents the provision may benefit those living in areas with tight supply of hotel rooms such areas are frequently in large cities with tourist sites as an example it is frequently difficult to find accommodations in new york city where hotels are often booked weeks in advance news stories suggest that homeowners frequently use this taxfree rental income to pay for vacations in other areas while their own homes are being rented out some may argue that owner occupied housin g receives excessive benefits from tax provisions under current law besides having income tax deductions for interest expensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22052crs6 11 us congress joint committee on taxation options to improve tax compliance and reform tax expenditures 109th cong 1st sess washington gpo 2005 p 425and property taxes economists argue that hom eowners also have tax exemption for the imputed rental value of their home all of these tax incentives provide significant benefits for homeowners that are not availabl to renters of course some might argue that home ownership is worthwhile soci goal that should be taxfavored in addition to the tax benefits previously mentioned there is also an exclusion from capital gains taxation for principal residence home sales of up to 250000 for single taxpayers and 500000 for married couples the favorable capital gains treatment of residences encourages investme nt in real estate as opposed to financial assets which experience less favorable tax treatment this preferential treatment of home ownership diverts capital away from other uses including business investment alternatively it may be argued that the benefit of current laws exclusion for minimis rental income may flow through to those renting accommodations in the form of lower rents some may question whether taxpayers would report their short term residential rental income to the extent that such payments are made in cash it would be difficult for the internal revenue service to monitor rental payments the proposal does not mention if it includes income reporting requi rements by rental agents revenue effects the joint committee on taxation has estimated th at if their proposal were to become law there would be an increase in federa l income tax revenue by approximately 10 million each fiscal year11
