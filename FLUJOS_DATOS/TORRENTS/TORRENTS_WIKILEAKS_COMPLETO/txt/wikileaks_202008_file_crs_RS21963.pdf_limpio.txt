such grants will serve the public convenience interest or necessity1 while the commission is charged with ensuring that all broadcasters serve the public interest the public interest standard is not clearly defined by statute2 however the fcc has specified seve ral public interest obligations relating to programming and consumer accessibility that broadcasters must fulfill3 significant part of broadcast licensees public interest obligation relates to political broadcasts while the fccs role in overseeing programming is very limited4 the commission expects its broadcast licensees to be aware

in detail infra equal opportunity regulations pursuant to section 315 of the communi cations act of 1934 as am ended if broadcaster allows any person who is lega lly qualified candidate for any public office to use broadcasting station he shall afford equal opportunitie s to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station9 under section 315 the broadcaster is not permitted to censor the material broadcast by the candidates10 certain types of broadcasts are exempt from the equal opportunity requirements under section 315 an appearance by lega lly qualified candidate on any 1 bona fide newscast 2 bona fide news interview 3 bona fide news documentary if the appearance of the candidate is incidental to the presentation of the subject or subjects covered by the news documentary or 4 on thespot coverage of bona fide news events including but not limited to political conventi ons and activities incide ntal thereto is not deemed to be use of broadcasting station for equal opportunity purposes11 generally equal oppor tunity is defined to pr ohibit discrimination between candidates12 the practices regulations facilities or services for or in connection with service rendered by the broadcaster must be the same for all candidates for political office13 broadcast licensees are also prohib ited from making any contract or other agreement which shall have the effect of permitting any legally qualified candidate for any public office to broadcast to the exclusi on of other legally qualif ied candidates for the same office14 under this provision for

failure to allow reasonable access to or to permit purchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of broadcasting station by legally qua lified candidate for fe deral elective office on behalf of his candidacy could lead to revocation of the stations license15 thus broadcasters are required to permit candidates for congress and for the offices of president and vice president to purchase r easonable amounts of time broadcast stations are not required to allow candidates for local offices access on similar basis however if they do offer time to local candidate the equal opportunity re gulations would apply and time must be offered to all local candidates for that office charges for use of broadcast station if broadcaster makes time available to legally qualified candidate for public office the amount that the station may charge the candidate may be limited during the 45 days preceding the date of primary or runoff election and during the 60 days preceding the date of general or special election charges for air time may not exceed the lowe st unit charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period16 the lowest unit charge of the station is typically what the station charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same classes and amounts of time17 the broadcaster must disclose and make available to the candidate any special discount plans or other pricing options that are made available to commercial advertisers18 classes of time are ge nerally defined according to the benefits with which they are associated the commission recognizes the following classes of time nonpremptible preemptible with notice immediatel preemptible and runof schedule19 broadcasters are allowed to establish and define their own classes of immediately preemptible time so long as the differences between such cla sses are based on one or more demonstrable benefits associated with each class and are not based solely upon price or the identity of the advertiser20 classes of preemptible with notice time may also be defined so long as all classes of such time are clearly defined fully disclosed and made available to the candidate21 broadcast stations may treat nonpreemptible and fixed position time as distinct classes of time provided that the differences between such classes are clearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21963crs4 22 47

frequently asked questions are broadcast stations required to provide fair and balanced reporting on political issues or candida tes are news programs required to present opposing viewpoints there are current regulations that require broadcasters to provide fa ir and balanced reporting until 1985 the fairness doctrine required broadcasters to present opposing vi ewpoints on controversial issues of publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21963crs5 30 in re applicability of the fairness doctrine in the handling of controversial issues of public importance 40 fcc 598 1964 31 general fairness doctrine obli

opportunity to respond when the broadcaster has allowed his or her opponents supporters to use or purchase time on the station is presumably longer enforced by the commission see in re request by nicholas zapple communications counsel committee on commerce for interpretive ruling concerning section 315 fairness doctrine 23 fcc 2d 707 1970 for detailed discussion of the evolution and repeal of the fairne ss doctrine see stuart n brotman communications law and practice 2003 ed 204 et seq 32 50 fed reg 35418 1985 33 supra n 30 the fairness doctrine did not requi re that equal time be given for varying viewpoints nor did it require ba lance in individual programs 34 see in re complaint of ross perot against abc cbs nbc and fox broadcasting co 11 fcc rcd 13109 1996 35 while there are fcc regulations that relate to this situation certain campaign finance laws continuedimportance30 however in 1985 the fcc determined that the fairness doctrine was longer justified due to the multip licity of voices in the marketplace31 the commission based its determinati on on findings that the doctrine rest ricted broadcasters journalistic freedom and in operation actually inhibited the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of th public and in degradation of the editorial prerogative of broa dcast journalists32 while not as precise as the equal time rules which apply to the use of broadcast station by candidate the fairness doctrine required the broadcaster to make reasonabl judgments in good faith on the facts of each situation as to whether controversial issue of public importance is involved as to what viewpoints have been or should be presented as to the format and spokesmen to present the viewpoints and all the other facets of such programming33 are broadcast stations required to air political debates are they paid when they do broadcast stations are not required to air political debates and are not paid for doing so political debates are typically aired at the request of the commission on presidential debates and are apparently exempt from the equal opportunity regulations discussed supra 34 some broadcasters choose not to ai r the debates because of contractual obligations to air other programs such as sporting events are there regulations prohibiting broadcast journalist or onair talent from taking certain position on polit ical issue or candidate what about the station manager or station owner there are regulations requiring journalists to be nonpartisan or unbiased under the fairne ss doctrine which is longer enforced by the fcc broadcaster woul d have been required to present opposing viewpoints but there is such requirement under current law additionally there are fcc regulations that would prohibit the station manager or st ation owner from doing so35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21963crs6 35 continued regarding contributions by cor porations may be applicable see 2 usc 441b 36 see
