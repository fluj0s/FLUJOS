unaccompanied refugee children the evolution of us policies 1939 to 1984 washington dc refugee policy group 1984 8 ibidbackground the emergence of unaccompanied refugee minors as an issue has followed pattern in the united states that dates back to at least world war ii this pattern has historically emerged from two overlapping f actors 1 the generation of large refugee flows from conflict or oppre ssive regime and 2 sign ificant us involvement either militarily or diplomatically with the conflict or regime generally these factors have contributed to both the crea tion of notable supply of unaccompanied refugee children eligible to relocate to the united states as well as growth in public pressure on the federal g overnment to provide assistance to these children us policy development beginning with the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 the united states developed policies to deal with unaccompanied refugee minors on largely ad hoc basis early urm policies came with th attorney generals july 13 1940 order and the presidents directive program of 1945 both of which evacuated children from the war zone and displaced persons camps in heavily affected parts of europe the american general public felt sympathy for the refugee children but number of opponents of resettlement questioned the ability of such children to assimilate into us culture noted security concerns such children might present and criticized the effect the children woul d have on immigration quotas4 the first two decades of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union provided the diplomatic tensions and political circumstances for second wave of unaccompanied refugee children from sovietallied countries to become eligible for resettlement in the united states for example the refugee relief act of 19535 and the hungarian refugee program of 19566 allowed for number of european children from eastern bloc count ries to enter outside of any existing immigration quotas thereby defusing much of the potential criticism of previous refugee efforts7 in addition the early 1960s saw one of the largest inflows of unaccompanied refugee children coming from communistcontrolled cuba with more than 14000 such minors enteri ng the country between 1960 and 19628 us military involvement in the vietna m conflict resulted in additional ad hoc efforts at resolving the circumstances of

states9 the first of these flights crashed killing 78 orphans and thereby marring the programs reputation furtherm ore the buildup of large populations of indochinese refugees and displaced pers ons in southeast asia resulted in the indochinese refugee children assistance program10 as well as programmatic clarification efforts in 197911 although the number of urms were fewer than had been brought into the united states th rough operation babylift the indochinese refugee program was significant for future policy development because it highlighted key jurisdictional and operational difficulties in handling urms crucially although op eration babylift resulted in federal progra m coordination between the department of defense dod department of state dos and the immigration and naturalization service ins the federal coordination during the 1979 efforts occurred between the dos and hhss orr12 the overlapping jurisdiction and lack of clear procedural precedent was one of several problems that plagued the ad hoc urm policy approach between world war ii and the end of the vietnam conflict recurring difficulty through this entire period was securing the involvement of state and local ag encies because of reimbursement concerns which were normally alleviated with written guarantees from federal officials for 100 reimburseme nt from the federal government in addition problems and concerns arose rega rding the coordination of efforts between the public and private sectors and the detention of juveniles in adult facilities as well as the age determination of potentia l juveniles in the refugee population consequently in 1979 and 1980 congress held series of hearings to inform members on the difficulties that had arisen in dealing with refugees and urms13 the refugee act of 1980 with members informed by experts from both the public and private sectors congress wo rked on passing refugee legislation with the result being the refugee act of 198014 this act which is still reflected in the statutory amendment to the ina on refug ees had two basic purposes 1 to provide uniform procedure for refugee admissions and 2 to authorize federal assistance to resettle refugees and

considerations stemming from the large number of cuban and haitian nationals arriving by sea who attempted to cla im asylum upon arrival in the united states depending on the current political climate as well as the circumstances of individual cases immigrati on officials can choose to either grant refugee status grant parole or return them to cuba or haiti when an unaccompanied entrant is placed

is denied the g overnment may choose to pursue removal proceedings for unaccompanied children who wish to claim asylum in the united states the asylum process is broadly similar to the adult process but with some key distinctions although the general statutor requirements for children re main the same as adults31 both the dhs guidelines and case law provide an unclear picture of the qualifying requirements for example to qualify for asylum child does not need to show that his or her persecutor had malicious intent nor that he or she sought government protection32 yet there is ambiguity as to how old child separated from parent must be before that child can apply for as ylum without parental consent the cases of walter polovchak33 and elian gonzalez34 established that while 12yearold minor was old enough to inde pendently seek asylum 6yearold needed to be represented by an adult in immigration matters the lack of definitive age for asylum is further complicated by the fact that

identifying entrants and asylum children needing the benefits of the urm program providing essential direct services including foster care placements to the children through their affiliate agencies and recommending researching and planning urm program services35 these agencies may also provide additional assistance to the urm program as needed because states are the main providers of child

to the iraq invasion for exampl in fy2001 the number of refugees admitted from iraq was 2473 whereas in fy2006 the number admitted was 202 figure representing 8 of the fy2001 iraqi refugee tota l thus despite the increased violence in recent years fewer iraqis including child ren have been admitted to the united states annually as refugeespotential sources of unaccompanied refugee children unlike other immigrationrelated progra ms the unaccompanied refugee minors program has relatively few pub lic critics because the pr ogram has operated for more than two decades operational criticisms ve largely been dealt with moreover orr has built strong ties with state and volunteer agencies so that the handling of the urms reflects what most observers believe is in the best interest of the child urms are generally recognized as high ly vulnerable population and the agencies and organizations involved in their care have historically put forth marked efforts to meet the childrens needs and ensure their wellbeing conseque ntly current policy debates regarding the urm program are centered around who should be granted urm status rather than how the children should be handled once they are in the united states because the standard procedure for entering child into the urm program begins with the department of state dos identifying child abroad some have questioned whether the dos is being sufficiently proactive in seeking out eligible children38 assessing such criticism however is difficult because very little data on unaccompanied refugee children exist most information on such children comes from media and anecdotal sources one population of concern for us refu gee policy is the displaced population in and around iraq population containing many children iraq has in recent years been marked by violent insurgency resu lting in the deaths of thousands of iraqi nationals and coalition soldiers39 moreover large populations of iraqis have attempted or succeeded in fleeing the violence by crossing the borders into neighboring countries such as syria40 according to estimates published by the united nations high commissioner for re fugees unhcr the iraqi population

another refugee situation that has gain ed notable amounts of media attention is the movement of large numbers of indi viduals fleeing the darfur region of sudan47 numerous advocacy groups have called
