of mandatory arbitration agreements wright v universal maritime service corp jon shimabukuro legislative attorney american law division summary in wright v universal maritime service corp the us supreme court found that mandatory arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement was not enforceable because it failed to specify arbitration as the covered employees sole method of obtaining relief for their statutory claims without such explicit language in the agreement the union could not have made clear and unmistakable waiver of the employees rights to judicial forum although the court identified clear and unmistakable waiver standard for determining whether mandatory arbitration agreement could be enforced it refrained from deciding whether union could actually bargain for such waiver arbitration and other forms of alternative dispute resolution have become incre asingly more common as employers and employees seek faster resolutions and lower litigation costs in response to the rising number of discrimination claims brought under federal civil rights statutes many employers now attempt to require arbitration or alternative dispute resolution by having their employees sign predispute mandatory arbitration agreements at minimum these agreements require employees to arbitrate their claims before they may file charges with the equal employment opportunity commissio n eeoc however other agreements are more expansive they deny employees any opportunity to resolve their disputes outside of arbitration or alternative dispute resolution in november 1998 the

wright v universal maritime service corp 525 us 70 1998 97889to differ in their recognition of mandatory arbitration agreements2 although the courts decision in wright indicated that statutory claims would not be presumed to be arbitrable absent explicit language in an arbitration agreement the court did not resolve the question of whether union may waive an employees right to judicial forum when such language exists petitioner ceasar wright had been employed as longshoreman in the port of charleston since 1970 in 1992 wright shattered his right heel and injured his back when he fell from the top of freight container these injuries prevented wright from engaging in any type of waterfront employment for an extended period in may 1994 wright settled workers compensation claim and other claims for permanent and total disability as part of this settlement wright received 250000 wright had been member of local 1422 of the international longshoremens association aflcio since the beginning of his employment after his physical condition improved dramatically in july 1994 wright obtained permission from his physician to return to work in january 1995 wright returned to the hiring hall of local 1422 to obtain employment he presented himself as having restrictions and needing accommodation between january 2 1995 and january 11 1995 wright was referred by local 1422 to work for several stevedoring companies including respondents universal maritime corp ryanwalsh inc strachan shipping company and ceres marine terminals wright performed all of the duties assigned to him none of the respondents complained or objected to wrights performance however the respondents later informed the president of local 1422 that they would longer accept wright on any work referrals from the local in letters to the president of local 1422 the respondents stated in nearly identical language that an individual is longer qualified to perform longshore work of any kind once he has been certified as permanently and totally disabled3 wright argued that the respondents violated the americans with disabilitie s act ada by denying him employment based on their perception that he was physically unable to do stevedoring work wright maintained that he was able to perform the essential elements of the jobs that would be referred to him by local 1422 the respondents denied any violation of the ada and contended that wright failed to exhaust the remedies and procedures available to him under the collective bargaining agreement between local 1422 and the south carolina stevedores association scsa the scsa is the collective bargaining representative of the respondent stevedoring companies clause 15b of the collective bargaining agreement between local 1422

attempted to sue her former employer for alleged violations of the ada and title vii the employer maintained that the plaintiff was bound by the grievancearbitrat ion procedure set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union the fourth circuit determined that the agreement was enforceable and that the union could bargain for mandatory arbitrationthe scsa provides for threetiered review process for employee grievances4 grievances that cannot be resolved between the local and covered employer are submitted first to port grievance committee if the committee cannot reach an agreement within specified time written record of the dispute is referred to joint negotiating committee if this committee is unable to achieve majority decision it is directed by the agreement to employ professional arbitrator clause 15f of the agreement states that it is intended to cover all matters affecting wages hours and other terms and conditions of employment 5 the respondents maintained that wrights ada claim was within the scope of matters that must be arbitrated in accordance with the agreement6 on january 12 1996 the president of local 1422 wrote to universal maritime service corp to express his concern over the interpretation of the agreement copy of this letter was sent to the scsa in his letter the president characterized the respondents refusal to employ wright as lockout in violation of separate provision of the agreement7 nevertheless the local did not file grievance for wright instead wright filed complaint with the eeoc and sought relief in federal court after receiving right to sue letter the district court dismissed wrights claim without prejudice relying heavily on the fourth circuits holding in austin v owensbrockway glass the court found that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on wrights claim8 the court reasoned that valid agreement to arbitrate future disputes removes jurisdiction from court wright had attempted to distinguish the agreement between local 1422 and the scsa from the agreement in austin by arguing that the austin agreement was enforceable only because it included specific provision that required arbitration of all claims of gender and disability discrimination in contrast wrights agreement made specific reference to claims of disability discrimination despite wrights argument the court concluded that arbitration was appropriate even when an agreement does not identify specific statutes or grievanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98940crs4 9wright v universal maritime service corp

does not need to specify every possible dispute to be binding9 the court compared wrights agreement to mandatory arbitration rule in gilmer v interstatejohnson lane corp 10 in gilmer an employer sought to compel arbitration of terminated employees claim under the age discrimination in employment act adea as securities representative gilmer was bound by the rules of the new york stock exchange nyse one nyse rule required securities employees to arbitrate any controversy arising out of registered representatives employment or termination of employment11 the rule made specific reference to the adea or any other federal anti discrimination statutes nevertheless the court concluded that gilmer could be subject to compulsory arbitration in finding wrights agreement enforceable the fourth circuit made similar determination that an employer does not have to provide laundry list of potential disputes for them to be covered by mandatory arbitration clause12 the supreme court reversed the decision of the fourth circuit writing for unanimous court justice scalia indicated that the general arbitration clause in the agreement between local 1422 and the scsa did not require wright to arbitrate his ada claim the court found that the agreement did not create presumption of arbitration for wrights ada claim that is the broad language of clause 15f of the agreement could not support the notion that mandator arbitration was the only option available for resolving statutory claims in reaching the courts conclusion justice scalia discussed the two lines of case law that have developed from the courts prior decisions in gilmer and alexander v gardner denver co13 where gilmer compelled arbitration of claim under the adea gardner denver permitted judicial review of title vii claim after arbitration in gardner denver terminated employee sought to bring his title vii claim in federal court after receiving an adverse decision in arbitration alexander submitted his claim to arbitration pursuant to nondiscrimination clause in collectivebargaining agreement the court distinguished betwee n contractual rights under collectivebargaining agreement and statutory rights resulting from title vii and other federal statutes although contractual rights could be subject to final arbitration the court held that statutory rights could be vindicated through both arbitration and judicial review because alexander was seeking judgment on his statutory rights under title vii the court concluded that he could pursue his claim in federal court although the wright court recognized the tension between gilmer and gardner denver it resisted any kind of reconciliation of the two cases instead the court chose to respond only to the facts presented by wright the court provided little guidance for situation in which an arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement explicitly requires arbitration of statutory claims in this situation it is unclear whether the unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98940crs5 14wright 525 us at 812may waive judicial forum for its members while the court did articulate clear and unmistakable waiver standard for determining when statutory claims could be subject to arbitration whether the union can agree to such waiver on behalf of its members is lingering question the court stated simply that because the agreement did not specify arbitration for statutory claims there could not have been clear and unmistakable waiver of the covered employees rights to judicial forum for federal claims of employment discrimination14
