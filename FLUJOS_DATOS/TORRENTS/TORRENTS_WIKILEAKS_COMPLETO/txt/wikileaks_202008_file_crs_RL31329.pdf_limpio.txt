and minority students the first significant opportunity under federally funded program for parents to select between public and private providers of tutorial or supplementary educational services came under the reading excellence act through programs funded by tutorial assistance subgrants 4 in administering tutorial assistance subgrants leas were required among other things to provide parents the opportunity to select tutorial provider for their child from among variety of choices that included both schoolbased program and pr ograms delivered by private providers operating under contract with the lea while previously in other federal education programs private non profit and forprofit providers delivered services under contract tutorial assistance subgrants marked the first direct opportunity for parents to select private entity to provide educational services to their children some perceived this as first step toward publicly funded school vouchers 1 esea 1116e 2 us department

equal to 20 of their title ia funding for public school choice related transportation expenses and supplemental educational services 15 leas must spend minimum of an amount equal to 5 of their titl ia funding on each if there is sufficient demand leas may divide the other 10 between the two purposes however if there is demand for choicerelated transportation then the lea must spend an amount equal to the full 20 on supplemental educational services16 the esea does not require leas to provide students with transportation to the sites where ses providers offer services however if leas do provide transportation they may not count transportation costs toward the 5 minimum expenditure requirement the esea limits leas cost perpupil of providing supplemental educational services to the lesser of the lea s title ia allocation per poor student based on the number of children aged 5 to 17 from families below the poverty level or b the actual cost of the supplemental educational services provided to particular student the esea does not stipulate whether the funds used to pay the cost of supplementary education services for students attending particular school must come from the title ia allocation that would normally go to that school or if the allocation to other schools in an lea or to cen tral administration and services may be reduced to cover these costs however leas are

for the cost of transporting students participating in public school choice or any combination of the two the amount of perpupil funding available for supplemental educational services will vary considerably from one lea to another due to the variation across leas and states in the amount of title ia funding allocated under the four formulas basic grants concentration grants targeted grants and education finance incentive grants and because ses funding perpupil is determined by dividing title ia allocations by the number of students from families living below the poverty level17 the

available if the lea is required to offer supplemental educational services to its students for instance the average lea in the top decile of leas ranked according to title ia 17 title ia grants are calculated for each lea based on the number of children aged 5 to 17 in families living below the poverty level in families receiving temporary assist ance for needy families tanf payments in excess of the poverty income threshold for family of four or living in institutions for neglected and delinquent children or who are being supported in foster homes with public funds whether or not they are from family below the poverty line using the number of pupils from poor families rather than the to tal number of title ia eligible pupils to calculate the per pupil cost limit for supplemental educational services results in comparatively higher cost limit for select leas one reason for this is that although the nonpoverty children constitute only about 4 of the title ia formula eligible children nationally this percentage is much higher in certain leas more broadly title ia grants per poor child vary due to differences in the state expenditure factor degree of poverty concentration

for supplemental educational services whereas the average lea in the bottom decile of leas may be required to provide only up to 923 this may result in different levels of supplemental educational services being available to students depending on the lea in which they are enrolled ed has released tables of fy2007 title ia allocations to leas which include estimates of the maximum perchild expenditure for supplemental educational services and the total amount of title ia funds that leas must reserve to fund supplemental educational services and transportation for public school choice should they be required to provide these school improvement options 18 these tables further illustrate the differences in the maximum amount of funding required to be made available across leas when examining ses funding issues it is also important to recognize that since the maximum amount of perpupil funding required to be provided by leas is determined by dividing title ia allocations by counts of children from poor families ses perpupil funding will vary with changes in child poverty counts and title ia funding levels ed reports that in 20032004 leas spent an average of 875 per student on supplemental educational services this was approximately 71 of the maximum perstudent amount they reported being required to make available for ses 19 overall leas were estimated to have spent total of 192 million on ses during the 20032004 school year in leas that offered ses this represented approximately 32 of title ia funds 20

increasing from 2 of the total in may 2003 to 8 in may 200724 in some instances approved ses providers only offer their services in selected regions or areas of particular state for example small nonprofit providers or consortia of teachers might offer services only in particular lea county or urban area often providers may decline to offer services in areas where they are unlikely to be able to serve critical mass of students some remote rural schools may be served only by providers offering services through distance learning in some areas leas are among the major providers of supplemental educational services as previously mentioned leas that become identified for improvement lose their eligibility to be ses providers still certain entities that are affiliated with an lea identified for improvement may remain eligible to be an ses provider examples of affiliated entities include 21 st century community learning centers community education programs and parent information and resource centers25 state lists typically identify the approved providers for each lea that has title ia school in which children are required to be offered services26 according to ed in 92 of leas at least one ses provider has been approved to offer supplemental educational services to students

to make supplemental educational services available to eligible students leas and providers need to negotiate agreements or contracts for the provision of services for each student evidence has shown that contract negotiation can be difficult and time consuming process as separate contracts often must be negotiated with each provider in leas in which services must be offered items that often need to be negotiated include the specific services to be provided for given cost as within each state different leas often have different maximum perpupil expenditure amounts whether providers will

provided if services are delivered off school grounds whether lea instructional staff will be hired and trained by the provider to deliver services or if the provider will bring in its own staff and whether provider will require minimum threshold of students before delivering services eg will the provider deliver services if selected by only one student in particular school or lea27 while the negotiation of contracts may appear to be barrier in the implementation of supplemental educational services the issues being negotiated often are not insignificant for instance providers and multiple leas may have to determine how appropriate services can be delivered when each lea is authorized to pay different amounts for services and providers often are seeking to work in multiple leas this may lead to providers having to develop different service models for different leas some leas may have rules that prohibit the use of school space by forprofit entities or may wish to charge providers rent for the use of school facilities others may have reluctance to have multiple outside entities operating within school after normal school hours in instances where provider s do not have access to school facilities they may want transportation costs to be included in their fee leas are permitted but not required to provide transportation to service providers it also may be difficult for providers enrolling students from multiple leas to ensure that their services are appropriately aligned with each leas curriculum in addition special agreements often must be drafted regarding the provision of services to students with special needs or who have limited english proficiency some ses providers have found it unprofitable to operate in market in which they must work under different contracts with each lea 28 to address some of these concerns ed has issued policy letter clarifying the conditions that leas may and may not impose on providers in the negotiation of contracts29

approximately 117000 students received supplemental educational services in 2002200331 in the 20032004 school year the second year of implementation ed estimates that 1100 leas were required to offer supplemental educational services to more than 13 million students enrolled in 3100 schools however only 600 leas 53 were estimated to have offered supplemental educational services in 2500 schools 8332 ed reports that approximately 233000 students received supplemental educational services in 20032004 and that 446000 students received supplemental educational services in 2004200533 there are number of reasons why eligible students might not be receiving services as previously discussed the initial process of identifying providers and negotiating contracts has been slow in some instances also there have been delays in the identification of schools where children are required to be offered services and in notifying parents of the availability of services in many instances parents have not been notified of the availability of services until after the beginning of the school year 34 also in some instances notices announcing the availability of services may not have been easy for parents to understand or may not have been received by parents

the secretary of education first announced that flexibility in the provision of supplemental educational services would be granted in limited circumstances through ses pilot programs 35 two types of ses pilot programs have been approved the first addresses concerns of some large urban leas that have been providers of supplemental educational services but that became ineligible upon being identified for improvement under the ses pilot programs ed granted flexibility to the boston chicago and new york city leaseach of which has been identified for improvementto allow them to c ontinue to remain eligible as ses providers during the 20052006 school year 36 in return for this flexibility these leas were required to provide early notification to parents about ses eligibility extend enrollment periods provide nonlea ses providers with access to facilities for reasonable fee and participate in an independent thirdparty evaluation to determine the effectiveness of supplemental educational services ed authorized boston and chicago to continue in the ses pilot program for the 2006 2007 school year and also granted similar flexibility to the anchorage ak school district and to

about the sequencing of public school choice and supplemental educational services as sanctions for schools identified for improvement some suggest that it may be desirable to offer supplemental educational services prior to being required to offer public school choice data on the implementation of esea title i accountability provisions may support this contention for instance in school year 20032004 only 1 of 275 million students eligible for public school choice participated whereas 19 of 13 million students to whom supplemental educational services were made available participated 38 similar participation rates were seen again in 20042005 as only 1 of the 52 million students eligible for public school choice transferred schools whereas 19 of the 24 million students eligible for
