1498 b brussels 1493 c brussels 1552 classified by ambassador howard gutman reason 14b and d 1 c summary madame secretary embassy brussels welcomes your visit to brussels on december 34 and your meetings with the incoming belgian prime minister yves leterme and the foreign minister most likely steven vanackere your visit occurs at moment when belgians are poised to take leading role in europe their former prime minister herman van rompuy has just been named as the first european council president under the new circumstances of the lisbon treaty and the belgian government is preparing itself to hold the rotating presidency of the eu council for the six months beginning july 1 2010 embassy brussels believes that properly motivated belgium can be leader in mobilizing europe to assist the united states in meeting two of the key challenges faced by the transatlantic community afghanistan and guantanamo hopefully longsimmering tensions between the flemish and francophone regions and linguistic communities will not distract belgium from this opportunity other opportunities for cooperation exist on africa policy nuclear disarmament in europe and iran the pm or foreign minister may try to promote the candidacy of former belgian foreign minister louis michel for the next president of the general assembly and may again raise belgiums failure to be included as participant or observer at the g20 talks despite being the 18th largest economy in the world end summary taking leadership role in europe 2 c for the past few months embassy brussels has been working to set the stage for change in belgiums selfconcept as small meek country living in the shadow of france and germany to country that can show leadership in europe in spite of stretched financial and material resources mainly by becoming more vocal on the need for europe to assist in the closing of guantanamo and on the need to support the new afghanistan strategy your visit is chance to foster and encourage this transformation in fact of course the transformation began at home in belgium in 2007 when new government made up of motley coalition of christian democrats socialists liberals and humanists from both sides of the linguistic border came to power the prime minister then and now again with the departure of van rompuy to the eu was yves leterme flemish christian democrat formation of the government was delayed for nearly year because of difficult issues of powersharing between the french and flemish communities many of which still remain to be solved stepping up in afghanistan 3 c nevertheless the new defense minister pieter crem with sometimes grudging support from leterme and others in the cabinet reoriented belgiums defense policy where his predecessor had promoted mainly humanitarian eu and support role for the belgian military crem sought to reestablish belgium as small but reliable nato ally as result belgiums troop commitment to nato isaf operations in afghanistan has increased from about 250 troops to nearly 540 with further increases perhaps to 680 in the offing belgians provide security for kabul airport operate and maintain six f16s in kandahar run one operational mentoring and liaison team in kunduz with second due to arrive in january and participate in germanrun prt this increase has been achieved against background of declining resources which have required thoroughgoing restructuring of the armed forces and recall of peacekeeping troops in kosovo and lebanon the government has also bucked critics inside and out of government who prefer more pacifist less natooriented approach and are ever ready to make political out of possible casualties minister crem moreover has reacted positively to suggestions from the ambassador that he become more vocal in his support as way perhaps to help shore up the support of other partners belgium deserves your appreciation and praise for its efforts and although further increases in military contrib subject scenesetter for bilateral meetings with belgian leaders during thesecretarys december 34 visit to brussels 4 c on the other hand belgiums contribuqions to civilian development in afghanistan have not kept pace in april 2009 the gob announced that it was doubling its financial assistance to the country to 12 million euros year this figure is only about 075 percent of its global budget for official development assistance the ministry of interior has been considering sending 24 police trainers to afghanistan but has hesitated over concerns for their security your unambiguous urging of more civilian assistance to afghanistan with both the prime minister and the foreign minister can help to increase resources devoted to afghanistan spurring on closure of guantanamo 5 c the embassy has been encouraging belgium to take leadership role in europe in the closure of the guantanamo detention center in october belgium resettled one detainee whose successful integration should be reassuring to belgian officials we are discussing the transfer of two tunisian detainees who have already been convicted of crimes in belgium not as part of the placement of detainees but instead as part of our department of justice working with the belgian ministry of justice our hope is that that process will make it easier for belgian society to accept the return and also allow us to ask the ministry of foreign affairs separately to take others we have also begun to suggest the possibility of belgium stepping forward from the chorus line and up to the footlights on guantanamo helping solve the usgs and europes problem with guantanamo is lowcost way for belgium to attain prominence in europe there are signs that belgiums reticence is beginning to chafe its leadership complaints about belgiums exclusion from g20 membership and opposition to perceived influence of directoire of large countries in the eu are examples it is matter of convincing belgium that not only does it have selfinterest in more assertive role but it also has uniquely trusted character within europe that permits it to be effective embassy brussels suggests the time is right to ask belgium to take more than handful of detainees and ask in coordination with others as led by belgium so that guantanamo which europeans always so roundly condemned is closed once and for all political pitfalls in regional tensions 6 c with three regions three linguistic communities seven parliaments and myriad of political parties domestic politics and the division of powers in belgium require complicated and delicate series of compromises herman van rompuy though flemish was one politician who seemed able to gain the confidence and trust of both flemish and francophone belgians his most likely successor yves leterme is more identifiably flemish and does not share that reputation one difficult issue brusselshallevilvoorde or bhv symbolizes the divisions and carries unusual emotional power in belgium ref in essence it is question of whether residents of the brussels suburbs should live and vote under flemish control or have special francophone voting and social rights the issue impeded formation of government after the 2007 elections and was kicked down the road ever since special effort will have to be made before march 2010 to either once again delay solution or reach final compromise failure to do so could threaten letermes coalition in the first part of the year the fact that all belgian politicians dearly want to avoid embarrassment during belgiums eu presidency will motivate them to find the necessary compromises but there is guarantee they can interest in enhanced africa cooperation 7 c central africa is special interest of belgium as the former colonial power in the democratic republic of the congo drc rwanda and burundi as such the gob is eager to cooperate with the united states on encouraging security sector reform in the drc consolidating peace in the eastern drc promoting regional economic integration and cooperation among states in the region on security issues in particular belgium is as interested in preventing sexual violence as we are it would like us to encourage continued cooperation between rwanda and the drc to take firmer hand with rebel groups that operate in eastern congo and far too often commit atrocities when you met belgiums former brussels

discussed naming bilateral task force to meet in washington to discuss security sector reform in the drc this has not yet occurred because the belgians opted to wait until the new usg africa team was in place we are now ready to move ahead with this in november belgium announced an increase in assistance to burundi making it the largest bilateral donor to that country it plans to do the same for the drc multilateral approach to european disarmament 8 s belgium has special interest in nuclear nonproliferation issues because it participates in natos nuclear forces at the kleine brogel air force base it rejected recent overture from germany to join with the netherlands italy and germany to propose to the rest of nato that nuclear weapons be removed from those countries ref b however belgian mod and mfa officials apparently had to rein in thenforeign minister leterme when he initially responded too positively to the idea belgiums official policy rejects unilateral approach to disarmament and insists that the issue must be discussed among all nato members at one time with due regard for usrussian bilateral discussions and the npt the government is also opposing proposal from the floor of the belgian parliament to ban nuclear weapons from belgian soil iran sanctions if necessary 9 c belgium shares our concern about iranian efforts to develop nuclear capability it supports strengthened sanctions in the eu and if necessary in that case at least at first it prefers to see existing sanctions made more effective rather than extending them into entirely new areas with the possible exception of conventional arms embargo former fm louis michels candidacy for unga president 10 c one issue the prime minister or foreign minister may raise is request for support for the candidacy of former belgian foreign minister louis michel for president of the general assembly ref c as you know we do not discuss our voting intentions for such posts they have already discussed this issue with assistant secretary gordon and with ambassador gutman
