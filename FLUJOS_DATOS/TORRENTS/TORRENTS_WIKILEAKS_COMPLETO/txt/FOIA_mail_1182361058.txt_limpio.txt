from wahl eugene r wahlealfrededu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re personal date wed 20 jun 2007 133738 0400 hi phil glad i can help even if quite indirectly i know what you mean about the need for community when under duress the individual quality of being scientist works against us in this way attached are the original letter and the official ucar response i dont know what the lawyers might have written other than their input to the official response letter i do know they sought information from caspar and myself but less so i dont recall if we made available to them our correspondance with steve schneider about our responses to the review of wa that mcintyre did which had lot of information in it that debunked his claims about withholding contrary results etc etc in fact we have never mentioned this to steve to make sure that he was in the situation to make editorial decisions as focused soley on the science as possible i was wondering if there is any way we as the scientific community can seek some kind of cease and desist action with these people they are making all kinds of claims all over the community and we act in relatively disempowered ways note that ucar did send the response letter to the presidents of the two academic institutions with which mm are associated although this seems to have had impact seeking the help of the attorneys you speak about would be useful i should think i know that mike has said he looked into slander action with the attorneys with whom he spoke but they said it is hard to do since mike is in effect public person and to do so would take lot of his time assuming that the legal time could somewhow be supported financially if i might ask if you do get legal advice could you inquire into the possibility of acting proactively in response via the british system maybe the public person situation does not hold there or less so i only ask you to consider this question on my part obviously please do what you deem best for your situation finally i have shared the mm letter and ucar response before only with one other scientist now retired emminent person here in the us whom i asked to look over all the materials and give his frank opinion if he felt we had done anything inappropriate he came back with solid and said that what mm were attempting was unspeakable caspar has mentioned that ucar said to him they did not want to disseminate these materials publically and i have kept to that other than the case mentioned it seems clear to that providing them to you is appropriate i have not contacted caspar to think about it at this point and dont feel i need to anyway this is just to give you the context on that side of things i would imagine that sharing the docs with legal persons you trust would be ok note that i am now out of contact through july 9 i wish you all the best peace gene ________________________________ from phil jones mailtopjonesueaacuk sent wed 6202007 406 am to wahl eugene r subject fwd jones et 1990 gene thanks for the email of support ive taken up the idea of asking someone at uea about legal advice i would like to see the original letter if possible i wont pass this on did the ncarucar legal staff put anything in writing as this might help decide if the advice i might get here is reasonable im sure it will be and i know ive nothing to worry about as ive done nothing wrong and neither has weichyung it is good to share these sorts of things with few people i know ben and mike have been through this but wasnt aware you and caspar had thanks for your strength cheers phil weichyung tom i wont be replying to either of the emails below nor to any of the accusations on the climate audit website ive sent them on to someone here at uea to see if we should be discussing anything with our legal staff the second letter seems an attempt to be nice to and somehow split up the original author team i do now wish id never sent them the data after their foia request cheers phil xymailosg wrt8waevm1mybgklj9hailvnyw9gqqfcbarmyvxdn17eho1e0vf5esq4wigjljnsew from steve mcintyre stephenmcintyreutorontoca to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject jones et 1990

us deparment of energy and the prc academy of sciences stating in respect to the chinese stations the stations were selected on the basis of station history we chose those with few if any changes in instrumentation location or observation times this data set was later published as ndp039 httpcdiacornlgovepubsndpndp039ndp039html coauthored by zeng zhaomei providing station histories only for their 65station network stating that station histories for their 205station network which includes many of the sites in jones et 1990 were not available s 5 unfortunately station histories are not currently available for any of the stations in the 205station network therefore details regarding instrumentation collection methods changes in station location or observing times and official data sources are not known s 7 few station records included in the prc data sets can be considered truly homogeneous even the best stations were subject to minor relocations or changes in observing times and many have undoubtedly experienced large increases in urbanization fortunately for 59 of the stations in the 65station network station histories see table 1 are available to assist in proper interpretation of trends or jumps in the data however station histories for the 205station network are not available in addition examination of the data from the 65station data set has uncovered evidence of several undocumented station moves sects 6 and 10 users should therefore exercise caution when using the data accordingly it appears that the quality control claim made in jones et 1990 was incorrect i presume that you did not verify whether this claim was correct at the time and have been unaware of the incorrectness of this representation since the study continues to be relied on most recently in ar4 i would encourage you to promptly issue an appropriate correction regards steve mcintyre from dj keenan dougkeenaninformathorg to steve mcintyre stephenmcintyreutorontoca cc phil jones

summarize what has happened with the wang case first i concluded that the claims made about chinese stations by jones et nature 1990 and wang et grl 1990 were very probably fabricated you very likely came to the same conclusion second some investigation showed that phil jones was wholly blameless and that responsibility almost certainly lay with wang third i contacted wang told him that i had caught him and asked him to retract his fabricated claims my emails were addressed to him only and i told one about them in wangs reply though jones karl zeng etc were ccd fourth i explained to wang that i would publicly accuse him of fraud if he did not retract wang seemed to not take seriously so i drafted what would be the text of formal accusation and sent it to him wang replied that if i wanted to make the accusation that was up to fifth i put draft on my web site httpwwwinformathorgapprisea5620htm httpwwwinformathorgapprisea5620htm and emailed few people asking if they had any recommendations for improvement i intend to send the final version to wangs university and to demand formal investigation into fraud i will also notify the media separately i have had preliminary discussion with the fbibecause wang likely used government funds to commit his fraud it seems that it might be possible to prosecute wang under the same statute as was used in the eric poehlman case the simplicity of the case makes this easierno scientific knowledge is required to understand things i saw that you have now emailed phil ccd above asking phil to publish retraction of wangs claims httpwwwclimateauditorgp1741comment115879 there could be couple problems with that one problem is that it would be difficult for phil to publish anything without the agreement of wang and the other coauthors nature would simply say another problem is that your email says that you presume phil was unaware of the incorrectness of wangs work i do not see how that could be true although the evidence that phil was innocent in 1990 seems entirely conclusive there is also the paper of yan et advances in atmospheric sciences 18 309 2001 which is cited on my web page phil is coauthor of that paper phil this proves that you knew there were serious problems with wangs claims back in 2001 yet some of your work since then has continued to rely on those claims most notably in the latest report from the ipcc it would be nice to hear the explanation for this phil kind wishes doug douglas j keenan httpwwwinformathorg httpwwwinformathorg phone 44 20 7537 4122 the limehouse cut london e14 6n uk prof
