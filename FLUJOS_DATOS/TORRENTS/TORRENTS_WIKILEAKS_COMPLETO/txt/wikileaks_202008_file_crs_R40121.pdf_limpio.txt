approved retirement or resignation which can then be denied or postponed until completion of the deployment there are two variations of stop loss skillbased and unitbased stop loss skillbased stop loss retains selected personnel with critical skills for example in the early stages of oif skill based stop loss was employed to retain special operations and aviation personnel that were determined to be critical to military operations unitbased stop loss on the other hand is used to maintain unit strength enhance unit integrity and maintain cohesion for units deploying to oifoef by retaining those who might otherwise separate before during or immediately after the deployment as general rule if servicemember is assigned to unit that is alerted to deploy and his or her term of service will end during the deployment or 90 days prior to the deployment their active duty period will be involuntarily extended to point in time up to 90 days after the deployment ends complementary program frequently associated with stop loss is stop movement stop movement precludes the loss of unit personnel due to reassignment orders under stop movement these orders will be rescinded and the individual will remain in the unit through the deployment cycle while stop movement originally applied to all assigned personnel in deploying unit exceptions have emerged over the past several years for example army soldiers being reassigned to drill sergeant or recruiter duty personnel selected for schools such as officer candidate school ocs special operations accessions courses and army medical department schools are exempt from stop movement since the beginning of oefoif the services have used various combinations of unit and skill based stop loss and stop movement to address personnel shortfalls and to sustain the personnel readiness of deploying units

called the military service obligation mso this obligation is stipulated on their enlistment ct those enlisting for active duty for the first time will generally commit to two to six year active duty obligation following separation from active duty the remainder of the mso may be served in the selected reserve4 or individual ready reserve irr5 3 the term reserve component refers to the seven individual reserve components of the armed forces the army and air national guard the army reserve the navy reserve the marine corps reserve the air force reserve and the coast guard reserve 4 also frequently referred to as drilling reservists mbers of the selected reserve are assigned to units and generally perform one weekend of training each month the weekend drill and two weeks of training each year also know as annual training additional information on reserve component personnel matters can be found in crs report rl30802 reserve component personnel issues questions and answers by

joining the reserve component variety of options are available but all generally include specified period of active guard or reserve duty in the selected reserve followed by period in the irr until completion of the mso reserve component personnel to include those in the irr are subject to call to active duty under statutory authority servicemembers who reenlist or extend beyond their initial or subsequent enlistment will also have separation date similar to the initial enlistment the reenlistment period generally ranges from two to six years those who decide to separa rather than reenlist are required to sign declination statement confirming their intent but may still be retained by stop loss officer personnel also have an eightyear military service obligation and generally have an active duty service obligation of three to five years depending on their source of commission they may voluntarily remain in their military component as long as they meet promotion requirements officers deciding to separate are required to serve the remainder of their mso in the selected reserve or irr while officers do not have firm separation date they are subject to stop loss if voluntary resignation or retirement application has been submitted g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g157g145g142g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561g143g152g155g561g21g157g152g153g561g14g152g156g156g501g561 stop loss is not specifically mentioned in law but is derived from 10 usc 12305 which states in part during any period members of reserve component are serving on active dutythe president may suspend any provision of law relating to the promotion retirement or separation applicable to any member of the armed forces who the president determines is essential to the national security of the united states section 12305 was added to title 10 by the department of defense authorization act of 1984 6 the legislative history of this section reveals that congress following the vietnam war and the militarys transition to volunteer force was concerned about the effectiveness of the presidents callup authority in the event of war or national emergency to be able to respond to crisis or to present credible deterrent provision was believed necessary that would prevent the loss of both regular and reserve personnel who became eligible to separate or retire during crisis therefore the broad authority of this provision allows the president to extend the enlistment or appointment of essential personnel serving on active duty reserve personnel who have been called to active duty and nonmobilized reserve component personnel if necessary by executive order 12728 7 president george h w bush in 1990 delegated his authority under section 12305 to the secretary of defensethis delegation authorized the secretary to suspend the laws regarding promotion retirement and separation and to further delegate this authority to subordinates appointed by the president this delegation remains in effect 6 section 1021 pl 9894 september 24 1983 7 executive order 12728 delegating the presidents authority to suspend and provisions of law relating to promotion retirement or separation

september 11 2001 president george w bush proclaimed national emergency on september 14 20018 and issued executive order 132239 to order the ready reserve to active duty for not more than 24 consecutive months this proclamation remains in effect today with the reserves ordered to active duty and the proclamation of national emergency the secretary of defens could approve implementation of necessary programs such as stop loss on november 9 2001 the secretary of defense fu rther delegated his authority under section 12305 to the service secretaries there is curr ently department of defense dod policy guidance such as an instruction or directive that addresses the stop loss program over the past few years several lawsuits have challenged the legality of the stop loss program however the courts have consistently held that stop loss is valid exercise of presidential power that is authorized by 10 usc 12305 that it comports with the requirements of the fifth amendments due process clause and that it is proper delegation of congressional power 10

during the 19901991 gulf war where it was initially applied to all deployed personnel and later to selected individuals with critical skills it was also used at the beginning of the bosnia deployment and during the kosovo air campaign however the use of stop loss in oifoef represents much longer rm use of the program with an ongoing impact on tens of thousands of servicemembers and their families the following summarizes the use of stop loss during oifoef 11 by service g3g155g150g162g561 the army the largest service and with the most servicemembers deployed to oifoef has used stop loss

all soldiers the army national guard and army reserve on the other hand adopted unitbased program that precluded separation or retirement from the time the unit was alerted for mobilization to 90 days following the redeployment in preparation for operation iraqi freedom all ar my components instituted unitbased program that retained soldiers from the time of the units deployment or mobilization date minus 90 days through the redeployment or demobilization date plus maximum of 90 days this 90 day period following redeployment or demobilization is designed for transition activities to better prepare the individual for reintegration into the civilian environment the army briefly terminated its unitbased stop loss program in mid2003 and instituted skill based program impacting approximately 25 job skills commonly referred to as military occupational specialties mos however in late 2003 the army reinstituted the unitbased program that continues today as result the armys active and reserve components all currently have the same unitbased stop loss program the primary purpose of unitbased stop loss is to provide trained ready and cohesive units to oif and oef as implemented by the army however stop loss applies to both deployable and nondeployable personnel the deciding criteria is whether they are assigned to the unit nondeployable personnel are normally assigned to the units rear detachment as result soldier with temporary nondeployable medical condition would still be subject to stop loss if the unit was alerted for deployment those in stop loss status remain eligible for promotion and school selection g16g138g159g162g561 the navy implemented skillbased stop loss program for the first year of oef the initial requirement appears to have been overstated and resulted in 10000 sailors being retained in special operations explosive ordnance s ecurity linguist and physician and nurse occupational specialties the initial program was rescinded but was followed approximately six months later with more targeted program to retain hospital corpsmen in support of the marine corps this program initially identified approximately 2600 personnel but the program only lasted for one month and actually affected fewer than 100 sailors the navy halted its stop loss program in august 2002 g3g146g155g561g8g152g155g140g142g561 the air force implemented stop loss program immediately following the attacks of 911 the first phase of this program affected the entire air force and lasted approximately 11 months the second phase was skillbased program that affected fewer than 400 airmen over an eight month period the air force ended its stop loss program in june 2003 g15g138g155g146g151g142g561g5g152g155g153g156g561 the secretary of the navy authorized the marine

antiterrorism brigade and impacted approximately 560 marines the second phase only included marines assigned to c130 aircrew positions the marine corps rescinded its stop loss program in may 2003 while its program was in effect the marine corps was the only service to grant individual exemptions to stop loss under their policy the first general officer in marines chain of command could exempt marine from stop loss g6g17g6g561 shortly after being confirmed as secretary of defense robert m gates tasked the services with minimizing the use of stop loss for both active and reserve component forces 12 at the time when the memo was released only the army was still using its stop loss authority and maintained that the program was still necessary to ensure that only trained and ready units

g21g152g149g141g146g142g155g156g501g561 as implemented by the army stop loss affects both active and reserve component soldiers from 90 days prior to their unit deployment date active component or mobilization date guard and reserve through the deployment currently 12 m onths for units deployed to oif and oef and for maximum of 90 days following the redeployment the 90 days following redeployment is to allow adequate time for transition activities as worst case scenario soldier who was scheduled to separate from active duty 90 days prior to the deployment date would be involuntarily retained in the unit for those three months plus 12 months15 of deployment plus up to 90 days of redeployment and transition potential involuntary extension of up to 18 months in this example an enlistment that specified four years of active duty would have grown to five and half years on active duty however even maximum enlistment of six years and an involuntar extension of 18 months would be less than the contractual eight year military service obligation mso according to dod officials there are four primary factors that affect the number of soldiers subject to stop loss

increases eg the recent army increase from 12 to 15 month deployment s for oif during the surge in iraq the number of soldiers in stop loss status also increases 2 the number of units deployed as more units are deployed eg the recent surge in iraq from 15 to 20 brigade combat teams bct the number of soldiers affected by stop loss increases 3 the distribution of separation dates within unit somewhat random factor but the more soldiers in the unit with separation dates after their scheduled redeployment the fewer who would be affected by stop loss 4 units alerted for outofcycle deployments as more units are notified of deployment dates that are sooner than what was originally planned the more soldiers who will be affected by stop loss the relationship between the number of deployed brigade combat teams bct and the length of the deployment has been modeled by dod to demonstrate the impact of stop loss on individual soldiers the model shows that if there are 15 bcts deployed on 12month rotation cycle the average soldier impacted by stop loss will be involuntarily extended by 48 months if the number of deployed bcts increases from 15 to 20 and if the rotation cycle increases from 12 to 15 months the average soldier retained by stop loss will spend an average of 66 additional months on active duty

linked to the armys rotation methodology for oifoef which emphasizes the rotation of units rather than individuals the army in particular has long struggled with the issue of using individual or unit replacements attempting to balance the benefits to unit cohesion with personnel system that emphasizes individual career development it has long been believed that stabilizing personnel in units would improve readiness and allow the unit to operate more effectively as team however from world war ii through vietnam units were initially deployed to the combat theater and individual replacements were then used to compensate for those who were killed wounded or rotated out for various reasons the unit remained in the combat theater but its composition and identity changed dramatically over time with this personnel turnover during wwii individual replacements were trained by replacement centers shipped to replacement depot and called forward into combat units as necessary with prior unit affiliation these replacements were military orphans with little esprit corps and cohesion with previous combat experience these replacements struggled to be integrated into the pre existing band of brothers in the unit and many quickly became casualties themselves 16 in part because they were unfamiliar with unit operations 16 militaryhistoryonlinecom the us army in world war ii manpower and

separated from his unit during wwii there was little chance of returning to the same unit when cleared to return to duty these soldiers were also sent to replacement depot and would be reassigned to whatever unit then needed his particular skills to avoid new unit and remain with their comrades many wounded soldiers concealed their injuries and remained with their units again in korea units were sustained by individual replacements some attempts were made to recruit train and deploy small 4 to 5 man teams that were supposed to be assigned to the same unit but this seldom occurred due to the combat tempo korea also saw the introduction of an individual rotation program based on time exposed to combat17 rather than serving in combat until killed injured or the war ended individuals in korea were returned stateside after serving specified number of months this rotation policy also increased the personnel turnover in vietnam individual servicemembers were continuously rotating in and out based on when they completed their oneyear tour or deployment as result there was very little unit cohesion and new personnel were continuous training challenge this turbulence was exacerbated by command tour policy that saw unit leaders serving only six months in command while soldiers served year in the unit from wwii through vietnam this soldier replacement method was referred to as the individual replacement system and it was frequently cited for causing an unacceptably high level of personnel turbulence and for inhibiting the formation of cohesive units especially in the combat arms recognizing the importance of unit stabilit to overall combat readiness the army since the end of vietnam has attempted at least four different systems 18 of unit replacement each designed to keep soldiers and leaders together longer however each of these proved unsatisfactory to the armys leadership and the most recent was discontinued at the beginning of the buildup for operation desert shieldstorm since 2004 the army has pursued unit stabilization through the unit manning system to ensure that trained and ready units were available for deployment this system is focused on brigade combat teams bct and linked into the armys force generation model this model categorizes units through progression of deploy ment preparedness from retraining to ready to available 19 however even this most recent attempt at unit stabilization to enhance readiness has depended upon the use of stop loss to minimize personnel turbulence

provision21 authorized the continuation of all special and incentive pays during the entire period of involuntary retention resulting from stop loss the fy2006 ndaa emphasized the importance of informing potential and current servicemembers about the possibility of stop loss by requiring two reports from dod22 the first report was required to address the actions being taken by dod to ensure that those being recruited for the armed forces were aware of stop loss and the further possibility of being recalled from the individual ready reserve i rr following their active duty obligation in response dod revised the enlistment contract 23 to explicitly explain stop loss and is to provide briefing on stop loss prior to any potential recruit signing the enlistment contract the second report required the services to provide stop loss and irr recall information periodically during members enlistment in response to the fy2006 ndaa dod revised the somewhat vague reference to stop loss in the enlistment contract to explicitly state during any period members of reserve component are serving on active duty pursuant to an order to active duty under authority of 10 usc 12301 12302 or 12304 the

perceived unpopularity of the stop loss program would have negative impact on recruiting and the vitality of the allvolunteer military at the height of the insurgency in iraq and with mounting casualties the army did miss its quantitative recruiting goal in fy2005 with recruiting target of 80000 the army recruited 73373 new recruits for shortfall of 83 by increasing the number of recruiters increasing the services advertising budget and raising the maximum amount of enlistment bonuses from 20000 to 40000 the army was able to achieve its recruiting mission of 80000 in each of fy2006 2007 and 2008 27 in spite of the very difficult recruiting environment even with this quantitative success most analysts remain concerned about the decline in recruit quality as measured by the number of

influencers now support joining the military29 since the beginning of oefoif there has been definitive survey data that would demonstrate that shortfall either in quantity or quality has been directly attributable to the stop loss program with the recent economic downturn and rising unemployment rate any concern about stop loss from potential recruits may be overshadowed by the military becoming an increasingly attractive and financially secure option

and only affects about 1 of the total army active reserve and national guard with total force of approximately 1200000 and an average of 12000 soldiers in stop loss status the armys claim is correct but may lead some observers to conclude that terminating stop loss would therefore have negligible 1 impact on readiness however assuming that most or all soldiers in stop loss status are deployed to oif or oef allows for more realistic assessment of the potential impact of stop loss on personnel readiness with 12204 soldiers 30 in stop loss status and 129700 army soldiers currently deployed31 to oifoef those in stop loss status represent nearly 10 of the deployed force requiring units to deploy with personnel shortage of 10 or more would likely have significant detrimental impact on unit readiness more serious dimension of the readiness problem is that approximately 45 of the stop loss cohort are noncommissioned officers ncos in grades e5 sergeant through e9 sergeant major who have declined to reenlist or submitted voluntary retirement requests if eligible these ncos are the leadership backbone of small units and key to the units tactical success deploying without these key ncos at squad platoon and company level or losing them immediately prior to deployment would likely have substantial adverse impact on unit training cohesion and stability the armys deployment criteria for brigade combat teams requires that they achieve 105 of their authorized enlisted strength and 95 of their authorized officer strength at 90 days prior to deployment without stop loss these units might be unable to meet this criteria and would deploy in somewhat degraded readiness posture

demands however this level was strongly supported by both dod and the army in rather dramatic change of position the newly appointed secretary of defense announced on january 19 2007 that he would seek approval to increase the end strength of both the army and the marine corps32 subsequently congress approved an end strength increase for the active army from 482400 to 547400 by the end of fy201233 this represents an increase of 65000 the army intends to achieve this new higher end strength by the end of fy2010 two years earlier than mandated by congress however as congress monitors the growth of th army it should be noted that the stop loss program may artificially inflate the actual end strength for example if the army reports an fy2008 end strength of 530000 this number would include nearly 7500 active duty soldiers who have been involuntarily retained beyond their initial obligation the actual end strength would have been only 522500 soldiers if the stop loss contingent had been allowed to separate or retire as their normal terms of active duty expired as result continuing to grow the army may require additional recruiting or retention ta rgets to negate the effect of stop loss on army end strength

the mandated 65000 soldier increase in active army end strength from 482400 to 547400 by fy2012 as discussed earlier is commonly referr ed to as the grow the army initiative through recruiting and retention efforts the ar my plans to complete this growth by 2010 two years earlier than required by congress based on recent indicators the army appears to be able to meet this growth objective some observers have noted that the army could di vert some of this increase to minimizing or eliminating the need for stop loss however it appears that the army is more committed to growing its force structure from 42 to 48 brigade combat teams and from 75 to 83 modular support brigades and will therefore continue to use stop loss to reduce unit shortages another possible option would be to continue the stop loss program for all ncos recognized as critical to small unit leadership and cohesion but eliminate the program for all junior enlisted personnel most of whom would be serving their initial enlistment while the army has experience with both unitbased and skillbased stop loss this option would require implementation of grade or rankbased stop loss program 32 department of defense
