intended to reduce the ri sk of vital security information reaching the wrong hands and resulting in another terrorist attack the regulations governing ssi however have raised number of concerns about the management of such information and the accountability of governmental agencies this section highlights four cases that have surfaced over the last two years in which the ssi regulations were applied to withhold information the cases deal with airport security procedures employee accountability passenger screening nd airport secrecy agreements in january 2003 the dallasfort worth air port experienced an early controversy involving tsa security procedures the in cident involved federal screener who permitted man to pass through security after his luggage tested positive for an explosive the airport was closed for over an hour while tsa and law enforcement authorities searched for the individual after the incident tsa spoke sman stated that the agency was not going to be issuing any kind of re port because anything beyond the most general of comments would lead us into areas wh ich concern sensitive security information8 the use of ssi rules to prevent the release of information has raised the concerns of some experts for example jane kirtley direct or of the silha center for the study of media ethics and law at the school of journalis m and mass communication at the university of minnesota has stated the public has burning interest in knowing how secure the nations airports are it is not satisfactory in democracy to say when an incident happens that were taking care of the problems9 on the other hand some have argued that the release of certain information could harm the public the tsa has stated if ssi information were to fall into the wrong hands it could be used to attack the transportation system10 second controversy arose when the us attorneys office in miami dropped criminal case against former federal baggage screener who was charged with

overview by jeffrey w seifert 18 piller and alonsozaldivar suspect computer program p 1from passengers in november 200311 the us attorneys office withdrew the charges because federal judge determined that the defense could crossexamine the prosecutions witnesses which could raise the possibly of disclosing ssi about tsas security and training procedures the problem with the decision of the justice department according to tsa spokeswoman is that future pr osecutions of dishone st agency employees would be hamstrung by the same dilemma that led to the dismissal of the indictment12 the public defender in the case suggested that prosecutors could have dropped the part of the conspiracy charge relating to the sensitive security information and moved forward with the other two underlying offe nses breaking into baggage and stealing their contents13 the us attorneys office and tsa however decided the risk of releasing ssi was too great third controversy involves the computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps in the summer of 2004 tsa plans to update the system and call it capps ii14 the original capps system attempted to screen passengers by focusing primarily ontravel patterns and fi nancial transactions 15 the new system in addition to monitoring travel records will check various persona l records of passengers trying to make reservations these records combined with cia fbi and other intelligence databases will be used to select certain travelers for additional screening thentsa administrator loy stated i dont think there is single project that will do more potential good for aviation security the system will be able t trace wouldbe terrorists even if they lead apparently unremarkable lives16 some do not agree the system will function as tsa believes17

that passenger advocate and appeals process will be available when the system goes online19 fourth ssi controversy involves security agreement between airport administrations local police departments and tsa officials the agreements prohibit the local police from commenting on any incident involving ssi that has occurred on airport property without authorization by the proper ts officials failure to comply with the agreement may mean the loss of financial aid for airport security20 partial copy of one of the agreements contains the following two sections copy of any summons complaint subpoena or other legal document served upon local law enforcement organization that is related to local proceeding that seeks records or testimony containing sensitive security information shall be promptly forwarded to the transportation curity administration field counsel all media releases and other contact with or by media specific to the security directive the airport security progra m or other subsequent or superceding regulations or documents regarding law forcement services for aviation security shall be coordinated with the federal security director or the federal security directors designee all media releases and other c ontact with or by media on the terms and conditions of this reimbursement agreement shall be coordinated with the contracting officer21 when these agreements were initially designed many local officials reportedly were not sure of the exact level of compliance they required for example police officials in des moines ia thought that they might be prevented from discussing with the public bomb or shooting incident at the airport the local police chief william mccarthy reasoned that the agreement may even prevent officers from reporting the arrest of drunk at the airport or testifying in court without clearance from tsa22 only after iowa senators charles grassley and tom rkin became involved in the matter was the agreement clarified in letter to senator grassley tsa administrator james loy explained that the agreement was not gag order for local police but was intended to inform tsa officials about inci dents that occur on airport property in addition loy stated that law enforcement fficers who are asked to testify about purely factual matters that do not reveal sensitiv security information may do so

copies of the agreement could be made public except for parts with sensitive security information such as appendix which concerns the amount of airport security23 currently the des moines issue has been resolved between tsa and local police lt david huberty of the des moines poli ce department has stated that since the clarification of the agreement ssi has not been an issue in fact local police and tsa officials have good working relationship the close interaction between local and federal authorities in des moines according to lt huberty has provided the airport assigned police officers with working understanding of ssi24 for example incidents that occur on airport grounds outside the rminal are not generally reported to tsa officials since local police understand that th ey do not involve ssi incidents that do occur within the terminal or at checkpoints however are treated differently in that tsa officials are involved and local police will write up more generalized descriptions of the incident so that ssi is not revealed25 in addition tsa attorney will provide training seminar for the des moines police departme nt to better understa nd the ssi regulation26 conclusions the implementation of ssi regulations s created number of controversies for tsa the agency has worked to alleviate these concerns but some experts are not convinced they are still alarmed that ssi is currently muzzling debate of security measures27 and although they acknowledge that some information should be kept secret the refusal to release other information seems overzealous for example according to paul s hudson of the aviation consumer action project at recently held aviation meeting information in one report was labeled ssi and prevented participants from having any exchange of views28 for some the issue being raised is the need for security versus the publics right to know this issue kirtley contends comes down to whether our openness was what made us so vulnerable29 ssi justifications are not made on those grounds but the tsa warns that ssi would be damaging to the security of the airline industry and c ould well be damaging to the security of the united states were it to be publicly disclosed30 ssi will continually be discussed in post 911 environment where the tsa has to weigh its duty to provide air land and maritime security against the need to keep the public informed and maintain constitutional rights and safeguards
