disabilities act ada provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in employment publ ic services public accommodations and services offered by public entities transportation and telecommunications1 its stated purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities2 title ii of the ada states in part that qualified individual with disability shall by reason of such disability be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services programs or activities of public entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity3 public entity is defined as state or local government4 the department of justice has promulgated detailed regulations for title ii one of these regulations interprets title ii to mean that public entity shall administer services programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities5 however the integrated setting is not required if the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service program or activity6 g17g149g150g156g157g142g138g141g561g159g495g561g14g495g5g495g561 in olmstead v lc 7 the supreme court held that unjustified isolation is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability under title ii of the ada8 the plaintiffs in olmstead were mentally disabled individuals who were voluntarily confined to state hospitals psychiatric unit their physicians had determined that they were capable of living in communitybased environment georgia refused to transfer the indi viduals to less restrictive setting although the programs were available in the state the plaintiffs then brought suit under the ada arguing that their segregation in the state institution violated title ii of the act9 the court ruled that states are required to provide communitybased treatment for persons with mental disabilities when the states treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate the affected persons do not oppose such treatment and the placement can be reasonably accommodated taking into account the resources available to the state and the needs of others with mental disabilities10 however the court found that the state maintains the right to argue that reasonable modification for person with physical or mental limitations who is able to live in 1 42 usc 12101 et seq for more detailed discussion of the ada see crs

would be fundamental alteration of the program and therefore not required under the ada11 sensibly construed the fundamentalalteration component of the reasonablemodifications regulation would allow th state to show that in the allocation of available resources immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities12 for example if the state were to demonstrate that it had comprehensive effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings and waiting list that moved at reasonable pace not controlled by the states endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated the reasonable modifications standard would be met13 g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g3g153g153g142g149g149g138g157g142g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g156g497g561g8g158g151g141g138g150g142g151g157g138g149g561

application to various programs for individuals with developmental disabilities in some instances courts have found states program to be committed to deinstitutionalization and therefore allowed the state to claim fundamental alteration defense however courts also have determined that states program falls short of the olmstead mandate and therefore prohibited the state from asserting the fundamental alteration defense g21g158g140g140g142g156g156g143g158g149g561g8g158g151g141g138g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g3g149g157g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g156g561 two significant appellate court cases held that the state was entitled to claim the fundamental alteration defense for its program for individuals wi th developmental disabilities in both of these cases the state had comprehensive working plan that resulted in fewer individuals residing in institutions in the arc of washington state inc v braddock 14 the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that forcing the state to apply for an increase in its medicaid waiver program cap constitutes fundamental alteration and is not required by the ada15 the court found that washington had shown comprehensive effectively working plan and that its commitment to deinstitutionalization was genuine comprehensive and reasonable16 in another case sanchez v johnson 17 the ninth circuit found that californias commitment to deinstitutionalizing persons with developmental disabilities was genuine comprehensive and reasonable18 and held that granting the plaintiffs requested relief would require the fundamental alteration of comprehensive working plan for deinstitutionalization in contravention of olmstead 19 11 id at 603 28 cfr 35130b7 12 id at 604 13 id at 60506 14 427 f3d 615 9th cir 2005

features of each program before reaching its conclusion the braddock court observed that the states home and communitybased services waiver program was sizeable full and available to all medicaid eligible disabled persons as spots become available20 additionally the program had already significantly reduced the size of the states institutionalized population and had experienced budget growth in line with or exceeding other state agencies21 similarly the sanchez court observed that californias expenditures for individuals in community settings increased 196 between 1991 and 2001 and that california decreased its institutional population by 20 between 1996 and 200022 g23g151g156g158g140g140g142g156g156g143g158g149g561g8g158g151g141g138g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g3g149g157g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g156g561 appellate courts have held in several other cases that the state could not claim the fundamental alteration defense because its programs for individuals with developmental disabilities did not comply with olmstead two of these cases emphasize that the states budget constraints alone are not sufficient to establish fundamental alteration defense in some cases the state did not have an olmstead program but attempted to claim that changing its noncomplying program would amount to fundamental alteration for example in pennsylvania protection and advocacy inc v pennsylvania department of public welfare 23 the court of appeals for the third circuit held that state could not successfully assert the fundamental alteration defense for program when compliance with olmstead would be too costly or would otherwise fundamentally alter noncomplying integration program 24 the court stated that budgetary constraints alone are insufficient to establish fundamental alteration defense25 the department of public welfare attempted to claim that it had sufficient plan in the form of policies and procedures that demonstrate dpws commitment to deinstitutionalization and history that showed that the policy was in effect 26 but the court concluded that the only sensible reading of the integration mandate consistent with the courts olmstead opinion allows for fundamental alteration defense only if the accused agency has developed and implemented plan to come into compliance with the ada27 in another case the third circuit in frederick l v department of public welfare of pennsylvania28 held that state could not assert the fundamental alteration defense for program that was not an adequately specific comprehensive plan for transferring eligible individuals into community based programs29 the department of public welfare claimed that it had sufficient plan that showed the required commitment to deinstitutionalization30 its plan included the non specific goal of closing up to 250 state hospital beds per year but lacked measurable goals 20 427 f3d at 622 21 id 22 416 f3d at 1067 23 402 f3d 374 3d cir 2005 24 id at 381 25 id at 380 26 id at 383 citing appellees brief at 20 27 id at 380 28 422 f3d 151

implement specific plans that had been developed by each of the states regions that were served by state psychiatric hospital31 the appellate court held that general assurances and goodfaith intentions to effectuate deinstitutionalization were insufficient32 and concluded that an adequately specific comprehensive plan for placing eligible patients in communitybased programs by target date must be part of the program in order for the state to assert the fundamental alteration defense33 in other cases the state refused to expand its community based programs to include certain individuals who were otherwise qualified for the programs and argued that this expansion would be fundamental alteration the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held in townsend v quasim34 that the state could not claim fundamental alteration defense solely because it would have to offer its existing program in commun itybased setting rather than nursing home35 mr townsend bilateral amputee who originally qualified for medicaid waiver program based on his income was informed that he would have to move to nursing home or lose his benefits following an increase in his income which disqualified him from the medicaid waiver program36 the court observed that characterizing communitybased provision of services as new program of services not currently provided by the state fails to account for the fact that the state is already providing those very same services37 and concluded these facts alone would not allow the state to claim that the provision of services to townsend would fundamentally alter the states program 38 in another case fisher v oklahoma health care authority 39 the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that the fact that oklahoma has fiscal problem by itself does not lead to an automatic conclusion that preservation of unlimited prescription benefits for participants in the program will result in fundamental alteration40 oklahoma imposed cap of five prescriptions per month on individuals in its home and communitybased services waiver program while imposing cap on individuals in nursing homes and the plaintiffs claimed that oklahomas decision violated the ada because it would force them into nursing homes in order to obtain needed medical care 41 the oklahoma health care authority ohca claimed that the cap was reasonable decision in light of the states financial crisis42 but the court observed that if every alteration in program or service that required the outlay of funds were tantamount to fundamental alteration the adas integration mandate would be hollow indeed 43 31 id at 15758 32 id at 15859 33 id 34 328 f3d 511 9th cir 2003 35 id at 51718 36 id at 51415 37 id at 517 38 id at 518 39 335 f3d 1175 10th cir 2003 40 id at 1182 41 id at 1181 42

plan coverage of communitybased attendant services and support for certain medicaideligible individuals the bills also proposed to establish financial assistance programs for states with communitybased attendant services the bills stated that one of their purposes was to assist states in addressing the decision of the supreme court in olmstead v lc and implementing the integration
