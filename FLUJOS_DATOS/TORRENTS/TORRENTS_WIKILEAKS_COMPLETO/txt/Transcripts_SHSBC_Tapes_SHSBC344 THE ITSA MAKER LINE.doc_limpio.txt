the itsa maker line lecture given on 16 october 1963 how are you today audience fine good good we have the 16th of october ad 13 dont we is that the date female voice 17th whats the date audience 16th all right all right youre outvoted one motion we dont have to table saint hill special briefing course well we have lot of material but the material you were most fascinated with was the examination of the communication cycle and the recognition that there was another communication line in it you hadnt really been aware of several auditors so far have been very very delighted indeed and i think several pcs already have been and there will be great many more pcs who will be delighted with this before we get through i better give you bit of talk about that in spite of the fact that i havent hit on final name for this linewell call it the itsa maker now that possibly is not the most applicable name lets take look at this thing this line is actually the line which you are guiding as an auditor and which sorts out the various things in the case and which then reportswhich then gets the material you might say that is reported to the auditor as itsa actually the itsa itself occurs at the end of this line not at the auditor so actually its the itsa communication line that goes from the pc back to the auditor that is the itsa communication line itsa is commodity its commodity its actually the identification of isnessand of course time can enter into it and you will get wasness now you get all types of variations all tone scales and everything else fit into this commodity called itsa you could ask for failed decisions well the pc says itsa seehe says its failed decision dont you see its this and its that and its something else but you could even have failure to identify you could ask pcs for failures to identify now if you were going to ask pc for failure to identify you of course are on the borderline between confusion and an itsa see thats the borderline in between there times when you didnt find out something now youd be surprised that occasionally youll get little ta action on this but you will also stir up enough overrestimulation to mess things up gorgeously now the commodity called itsa is so simplerecognizing it can have tremendous varietyit is nevertheless tremendously simple as commodity there is nothing much to this commodity you walk in the room and you look around to see whats there you see well its chair its student its ceiling its floor dont you see thats itsa for the room and thats all there is to it now until the itsa is recognized its only potential itsa there is something there to be itsaed now where you get in lot of trouble as an auditor is you think you have potential itsa where theres in actual fact nothingness and youre trying to get the pc to itsa nothingness this is the way you go about it let show you just some of the problems that an auditor runs into with this he says to the pche says whats going on or whats happening you see and the pc says im just sitting here looking at picture of statue you got that now see thats the situation now the auditor says what is happening or what is going on in some version or another now the degree that the auditor can vary this buries it from view of what hes actually doing see the pc has told him what was beingwhat was there see he said itsa sitting here looking at picture of statue see simple now the auditor says what else is there what are you doing what else are you doing how are you doing it and so on what decisions are you making about this you get this well the pc isnt doing anything else isnt making any decisions about the statue and in actual fact there is exactly nothing else going on now this is the commonest method by which an auditor refutes itsa now on meter you call it cleaning clean and youd be very reprehensible at somebody whos saying on this blank has anything been invalidated and the meter is just absolutely sleek see oh what was that what was that what was that whawhawhawhawhat was that what was that you know you didnt get read see and you can count on the pc arc breaking very shortly oh that there isnt anything else theres nothing else been invalidated protest s well ill ask the question again on blank has anything been invalidated oh that reads that reads that reads what was that what was that whawhat was that that reads well yeah theres something there now because he protested the fact that clean clean was so he protested the invalidate button so now the invalidate button now reads on protest you got the idea now out of this idiocy can get some of the most tangled situations see he cleaned clean on the meter and the pc protested the cleaning of the clean which made invalidate read as button so now invalidate reads so now the auditor demands to know what is there the auditor now becomes certain there is something there dont you see reading on the meter isnt it and out of this they can go wandering all over bayous and byroads and up in balloons and so forth and it just goes to pieces from thereall of which proceeds from cleaning clean youve probably seen this happenyou may have had it happen to you its whata very common error any auditor will do it sooner or laterhell accidentally clean clean he just wants to be sure you see anything else been suppressed there you know hes had clean read and he wishes to god he never said so but of course suppress can suppress its own read so youre left in bit of quandaryand the pc said theres nothing else ah ahwell i see read there now protest read or something like this sort of thing pc looks and gives four or five more answerseach one of which is protest do you see so the button keeps reading reading reading finally the pc says yeah but there isnt anything else here see hes getting up into an arc break situation whats he being asked for hes being asked to identify nonexistent itsa now this is the same trick as this you take wide empty room and youthis is brainwashing stuff seeand you say to the person as you bring him in the door describe to the elephant in the middle of the room and the fellow says there isnt any elephant in the middle of the room oh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uhoh lets look carefully look carefully now look all around the floor and see if you cant see those footprints and so forth now youllyoull getyoull get it after while youll get this elephant after while there 1 swear if you kept it up you could make the guy practically mock up an elephant in the middle of the room dont you see but the guy would be very overwhelmed and very arc broken what youre trying to do is tell him that something exists which doesnt exist now perhaps that isaside from the definitions of itthe source ofor failure to understand the definitions and so forth of itsaprobably the source of the greatest difficulty is cleaning cleans youve seen it happen on meter youve seen yourself get in trouble occasionally too cleaning it on the meter well similarly you can clean it without meter you can say what are you looking at and the person says im sitting here looking at statue oh all right good now what kind of statue this is barely admissible see because that one might lay an egg too well its just statue kind of statue you see yes but what does it look like well it looks like statue um all right uhm whawhat else are you doing there oh im not doing anything else im just sitting here looking at thisor was sitting here looking at this statueuntil i was so crudely interrupted all right well now who might have made the statue well i dont know what time period do you suppose its in uh sometime i guess well wherewherewhere is this statue located where is this statue located now wheres it located and so forth well i dont know just here well the amount of tone arm action youre going to get out of that is horrible because actually theres nothing else to itsa dont you see the auditor is creating new things to itsa which arent there the pc was just sitting there looking at statue and actually probably was just looking at vague blur and he couldnt tell whether it was female or male or anything else he didnt know where it was located he knew nothing about it except he was just struck by the fact that he saw this thing and he assumed it was statue and so he was sitting there looking at statue the auditor comes along and says what are you doing you know and he says im sitting here looking at statue now that is the itsaand the way to really foul the pc upand this is something you as an auditor just have to get straightened out yourselves seethe way to foul the pc up then is to demand more than the pcs got and youre not going to get itsa youre not going to get itsa by demanding more than the pcs got because theres nothing else there to itsa there simply isnt anything to itsa you have got the itsa but by asking again you deny the fact that it has been itsaed now theres the real hook in all this you sayyouve said in effect when you say what elseoh you could say what else are you looking at without disturbing the pc too much he says im sitting here looking at statue and the auditor says well what else are you seeing there would be good example see what else are you seeing well maybe he isnt seeing anything else you see this would be your thingbut you have in effect said i have not accepted what you have said so now the itsa comm line is cutas different from cutting the pcs itsa see you have not permitted the itsa particle to travel on that comm line you have not only cut theyou have not only refuted the itsayou see the itsa isnt cutits refuted you say it doesnt exist you havent said anything you havent said anything because i want to now know much more about it than you have said so therefore you havent said anything this is what youre saying so you also cut the itsa comm line see youve not just blunted out the itsa but youve cut the itsa comm line and the pc will arc break eventually under this kind of treatment accordingly so that then it appears to you that by cutting the comm line you have caused an arc break so then you specialize in not cutting the comm line and go on asking the pc ridiculous questions which knock the itsa in the head now you see how you could get fouled up on this and your pc would arc break like mad and be very upset about this and that and about his auditing and not getting any ta action and gains and all this sort of thing you see basically ta action and the auditor could be quite certain whats wrong you see that he is inadvertently cutting the pcs comm line to the auditor in some fashion and so now compound the felony by developing new system which overcomes thisbecause he actually hasnt got the trouble in the first place see hes got new system hes going to develop to cure this old error and hes going to say all the time have i interrupted anything you were saying well this is not germane to it so would only compound the arc break see he hasnt interrupted anything so again he has cleaned clean in other words hes put his finger on the wrong error you see that this kind of situation could develop auditor says the whatsit see the auditor says whats happening or what are you doing and the pc says well im just sitting here looking at statue oh whats thewhat else is in view there as youre looking at the statue what else are you looking at there in the statue he isnt looking at anything elsethere isnt anything else there dont you see so the pc says well uh mmmm uh mm uh uh uh uh uh im just looking at the statue auditor sees dirty needle knows that cut comm line turns on dirty needle now says in some way have i cut your communication line hell nohes forced the communication line not cut it not only that but hes invalidatedthe sensation is that thewhat the pc has said has been invalidated you would be surprised how well something runs when you say to pc whats happening or what are you doing the pc sayssaid im sitting here looking at statue now the auditor who doesnt have an eye cocked on his meter at this moment you know an auditor should be walleyedone eye on the pc and one eye on the meter and noticesand you can you actually can get nicely walleyed you look at this thing out of the corner of your eyeyou can see whats happening to meter even while youre apparently looking straight at the pc as matter of fact it drives my pc nuts sometimes when she gets all tangled up in something or other shell notice something like this and growl about it you know but you didnt see that on the meter well of course i have seen that on the meter it looks to the pc like this you see pc absolutely certain that you arent looking at the meter not so not so at all ive seen everything that meter has done see i tell you how you do iti tell you how you do it you take the iris you see and it has an inner reflective quality see and you actually look at the reflection of the meter on the inside of the iris thats actually the way you do it anyway joke but you actually can see this now youve got to establishwhat are you trying to do well actually youre trying to get tone arm action seethats what youre trying to do because that is the most visible action of success if youve done everything else successfully you get tone arm action so you say well what are you trying to do youre trying to get tone arm action dont say im trying to clear somebody im trying to heal somebodys broken leg or im trying to do this or trying to do that scientology levels i ii and iii youre trying to get tone arm action the significance of how you get tone arm actionoh bleaaaah matter what you do with pc its all got to be done thoroughly at level iv you understand that you can destimulate and put present time back where it belongs and dust the case off and let the case live dont you see you can do very remarkable things at levels i ii and iiidont make mistake and on level iv youre going to find all the somatics again it isnt that you havent blown charge off the case at largeyes you have at levels i ii and iii but lot of it was destimulated charge you make it possible for somebody actually to run iv at levels i ii and iii but the significances are the pcs actual gpms the pcs ris the terminals and oppterms and that whole chain of actual goals back to time immemorial contains every possible reason why the pc is batty except one except one how did he get so batty that he started doing this in the first place well actually thats merely decision its just sort of how do you make matter see well he easily comes out of that you want to know why the pc has pictures hes probably got some gpm to make pictures you see you want to know why thewhy the pc is getting less powerful well he has some gpm to be less powerful i mean thats asee thatsyou want to know why the pc is terrified of height well hes got an ri or gpm to make him terrified of height dont you see i mean anything wrongor if the guy has broken leg why youre going to haveyoure going to have some ri someplace or another that tells him to break his leg you get the idea i mean thetheyreall the explanations are there theres sense in looking for explanations anyplace else on case you understand and thats very discouragingbut amongst us pros we cani mean its very discouraging to the pc after hes just gotten rid of this and he feels fine about it and all is going along well to actually realize that back on the track the real reason is still resident but if we didnt recognize that as auditors we would not be honest with our own technology because we know that to be true hes got stuff back on the track dont you see now youve got to put case in shape so the case will sit there and run this highpowered stuff at level iv and level iv is the scientologist level you can talk all you want to about how easy it is perhaps to run raw meat and all that sort of thing it isit is too but remember this at levels i ii and iii it practically takes an educated pc and very well educated auditor to run level iv and the pc wouldnt know what to do with it if he got there so youve got two different brands of action going on here see youve got three gradients of one brandscientology i ii and iiiand youve got another brand of stuff and that other brand of stuff depends utterly on skill at i ii and iii but level iv is the scientologist level i dont think after looking it over for long long time is i frankly dont think in spite of thisi know this is quite revolutionary statement but this is actually based merely on observationis i dont think its my own opinion after all the evidence is in that anybody will make ot except trained auditor now thats the onlythe only person i know of in the first place his confront is up to this stuff in the second place he knows what to do in the third place youre dealing with things that pc would have to be educated into the nomenclature of before he could even run the process how are you going to communicate to pc actual gpm well you could say actual goals problem mass whats that going to communicate these are totally unknown factors these arethese are factors adrift in the whirlwind you see nobodys ever heard of these things before and as far as somebody being able to become conscious of and concerned without his confront as an auditor rising without an understanding of the various put togethers of these thingsplooey i just dont think it can happen see i think thats the basic barrier on the track the basic barriers to development of mental science if you specialized 100 percent on total effect and total result by reason of mental sciencesee total that was your goaland you were not going to make fully trained pro out of everybody you were going to do it to see at the same time if you hadif you had body of professionals over here which were barring out everybody else from becoming professionalsthe same modus operandi that the medicos use that the psychiatrists try to use other people try to use you know they say us educated people see and we hold the holy sepulcher you know and worship saint pavlov this kind of stuff do you see all right they bar all these fellows out and then these other fellows that are supposed to be the fellows who have the effect created on them dont you seetheyre the patients or theyre the recipient of the technologyand then all of these birds who are the pros you see they have all the knowhow and these other fellows over here why theyre the recipients of the knowhow but they dont get any of the knowhow and so forth and i think thats very effective system from everfor ever keeping anybody from getting anything or getting anywhere so your scientology levels i ii and iiiparticularly levels i and iiare very adaptable to handling far in excess any requirement that the public at large has for psychotherapy its wildly in excess you just learn few of these things im trying to teach you and youll find its just wildly in excess staff auditor here is having ball on this stuff i mean caseoh poof nothing to that see got to remember hes saying the raw meat casetheres nothing to what making the case feel better making the case feel happier curing the lumbosis getting the case over this getting the case over that yeah ah but theres different mission which mental science could fulfill entirely different mission which is total sweepup of the total case how tough and how educated and how understanding do you think pc has to be in order to stand up to the number of randomities which can occur at level iv because dont kid yourself they can occur well let tell you in two or three instances now people have been carefully audited in hgcs at this particular level and in two or three of those cases even though they had gpm or two cleaned up they got couple of ris out of place couple of ris out of placeyou ought to have ten goals out of place sometimes ten gpms smeared around backwardsyoud know what creak was man well we had couple of ris out of place so we had an awful arc break and we want our money back from the organization oh slap my wrist theyre going to run into that continually so whywhy say it doesnt exist we could be hopeful and say well wouldnt it be nice if it didnt exist but actually what you have for the first time is really body of pros who by the nature of the technology as far as i can survey the technology have level of technology applicable to them who were possessors of level of technology which is applicable to the general public in the fields of mental and physical healing now this is riches that you probably hadnt really totally looked at when you finally get through and get it all summed upsummed up the characters that are going to make it are scientologists as other people arent going to make it i know ive done the research vanguard on this as pc because it would have killed anybody elsebut i personally cant see anybody going through onetenth of what ive gone through in the last two weeks see what on the general public level oh i can see you characters going through it see seen doors go out of plumb and out of plane and walking down floors which are suddenly tipping like the deck of rolling ship somebody skipped gpm or two on you you know theythey went for some everybody got brilliant at this particular point and you had gpm called to catch catfish you see and they did goal oppose list for the next earlier gpm and they got to be horse and the pc said brightly oh thats the next goal yes to catch catfish opposes to be horse and the auditor says well i dont know if quite true seereasonable you know its i dont know if it would be quite true its uhi guess it would be all right well well go ahead and find the items in it you see and the next thing you know why corners of the room are going at fortyfive degree angles to the pc and their chin is over here foot and half from the bottom of their face you see and if doctor would examine them at that moment theyd say an advanced ease of coronary thrombosis you see the pcs heart is leaping you seeair bubbles coming out of his bloodstream like these divers in fish tanks you know good well actually that takes an awful level of understanding that takes an awful level of determined pushahead it takes terrific amount of education to know whats happening to you youd say well huehhh theres something wrong in the bank i didnt feel like this on tuesday lets see what in the name of common sense were we doing on tuesday prrooo didnt feel like thewhat did we do on monday hrrooooh and finally after few sessions of wrestling around and it gets worse and it gets horrible and now youve got half the bank found in the wrong gpm you see whyauditor gets enough suppress off and the pc gets enough momentary itsa on the bank and between the two of them why they suddenly find out that to be horseto be horse was an actual goal but not an actual gpm and that to catch catfish goal oppose list is not complete and that they havent got gpm that theyve been running items out of that in addition to jumping couple of goals you see they didnt jump couple of goalsthey just missed them all see then all of suddensnap snap pop tick bangand coronary thrombosis and the room is all level and you meet the guy that afternoon and hes saying yabbledeeyabbledeeyabbledeeyabble everythings fine everything is fine and so on he hasnt even found the next goal yet they just found out why you see hes fine everythings fine and you say well how about that you can just see now some medical attendant in some organization who wasnt in the know you know hed be coming up there with little black bag now mr smith how is your coronary thrombosis this afternoon the pc says coronary thrombosis what coronary thrombosis you mean actual goalosis it takestakes level of nerve thats another comment that we can make on this definition of the common people see were talking about level i yeah common people but youre talking aboutyoure talking about way upstairs stuff when youre talking about level iv dont kid yourself nowdont kid yourself all youve got to do is make bum error on the present time gpm and start running one that aint it and your pcs had it and so have you andbecause you wont have snowballs chance of getting anyplace the pc will go into the creaks half dozen banks should be there do you know howhow far the mistake can be do you know how wide the mistake can be for present time gpm how wide that mistake can be you can get the fourteenth gpm from present time registering as the present time gpm and then every day or so find new gpm thats closer to the present time that is now incontrovertibly the present time gpm slightest argument about it every day find another one and finally discover that when you found that first one that you were sure was it and that checked out on the metermeter rocket read present time gpm rocket read see why well actually you merely found the gpm in which the pc was most firmly stuck so of course it looks like present time gpm that looks like present time to himso of course it registers nothing to that and in addition to that gpms are timeless by construction because of the ri balance they float in time like goals so of course these gpms will register as any place it takes considerable trick to date one and after ive dated gpm i always say maybe you know done terrific job of dating with the greatest care in the world everything proved out perfectly that this gpm was at trillions one hundred to trillions ninetyone proved it conclusively well i will learn out of that that probably it is not the present time gpmmaybe because these thingsthese things of course are constructed to be instantaneous go back to your early material on gpms theyre instantaneous they havent got any time in them so of course you cant date them worth nickel so of course you can make mistakes of this particular character well i know one case that has had gpm that people have been tryingits perfectly valid gpmthat people have been trying to run items out of now for couple of years sounds like long time doesnt it they havent found any yet i think they got the top oppterm once its probablyits probably fifteen twenty gpms from present time it isnt suzie ive gotive got several pcs that dont really know theyre on my critical list you know but i watch thisi watch this and i watch people trying to list for something and find something there and so on there you cant run it its just this you cant run gpm that is not the present time gpm theres only one way that gpms can be safely programed and thats find the present time gpm without any doubt whatsoever and then doubt it and get its top terminal and oppose it and run thenow im giving you different kind of programing hereand you run that all the way back to the beginning of trackfinding ris and gpms in proper sequenceall the way to the beginning of track without skipping single pair of ris without repairing anything and without missing single goal as you go got it and when you get it all the way back to the beginning of track and you get the first postulate that the pc ever madelet call that to your attention thats prime postulatewhen you run this out of the pc dont be startled if you see the rafters kind of go errrrrwah when you got that then you go back and repair it go back and run it all again and find out if there was anything missing but listenif you try to repair it before then you wont make it ive got the later data on this you cannot repair gpm on the run you just find the ris for the next gpm you should be in its too horrible for words or you pull ris out of implants or you pull ris from elsewhere you can always repair and find new ris for gpm you just completed so you dont run them from the top to the bottom and then go back to the top and repair them because you never go back to the top and repair them the only thing that happens is you find ris out of the next one without the goal see its in horrible mess so of course you cant take any chances with this thing the odd part of it is that if you do it right it runs off like welloiled dream it is the most invariable process anybody ever heard of it is just like swiss watch it just runs off perfectlyruns off just exactly according to r4m2 its just perfecti mean theres nothing to it like falling off log but you make one mistake and now you have five hundred thousand words required of written material to take care of the repair you got it i mean to do the process itself is very very easy you make one mistake and you got complications its nothing for instance to throw away three sessions just be cause you made stupid boob in one you just cant find out whats happening it just ooh bleah whoomy god and youll find out it is some stupid boob error and then you get errors and then you lose the error you knowand then you find what the error was but then you lose the errorand you find out that wasnt the error but something else was the error you got the idea it can get horrible but the repairs of it are quite feasible providing theyre gone at sensibly but there is way to run them there isnt much to running them you can run them very rapidly i find an ri every ten minutes of auditing routinelyracketapacketapacketapacketapacket takes about an hour and half to find goal on pc next goal theres nothing much to this but its precision line of auditing and it is line of auditing to be done by somebody who hasnt got tremendous grip on auditing itself and who is still trying to find out which is the tone armoh thats the tone arm wonder i couldnt find the goals list on the pc its kept in the tone arm isnt it ive heard you know you cant do auditing like that so you wind up of course with scientology levels i ii and iii which is your professional address to the situation you wind up with level iv if you think youre going to go out and find goals on the general public you might as well just forget it youre notthats all oh you can find some goals you can find some implant goals you couldyou could mess around with this theyd say what do you know this is unbelievable and so forth you might even do something accidentally you might even do something but what youll pay for it in terms of pc you cant handle in terms of pc who will chicken out in terms of pc whose confront and education dont even vaguely compare with what he is doingdo not make it worthwhile you have now terrific processes at levels i ii and iii so youd better learn all there is to know about itsa and what makes itsa and all this and be able to just sit there coldknowing nothing much about the pc you should be able to sit there coldplug in your emeter give pc the cans and turn on thirtyfive divisions of tone arm in your first two and half hours on any raw meat pc in any place now why cant you and itll be lack of or noncomprehension of some of this data like the itsa maker line see what is this line well now you get fouled up as to what this line is and youre not going to get ta divisions you know what this line is why its like breeze now lets get back on that i was just trying to get your frames of reference in with regard to where this technology fits naturally this same itsa maker is whats banging in at the gpms its the same thing youre controlling in level iv but all level iv is done with formal auditing you try to do this other type of auditing and youre going to lay an egg youre going to let the pc itsa his own gpms whathow many telegraph poles do you want this pc to be wrapped around plenty but if you are doing level iv without complete command of the pcs communication cycles and communication lines you will also wrap him around telegraph pole now let show you some misways of handling this situation one is just not understand what it is and the other is have some wild preconceived idea oreven some scientology datum magnified out of all proportion magnified out of all proportion to its actual relationship such as pcs never answer the auditing command so there of course you can never trust this itsa maker line see you can never trust it so therefore you transpose the itsa maker line over to your meter so you do nothing but ask the meter what is going on with the pc never ask the pc you have now effectively shut off the pcs itsa maker line from audfrom the pc as thetan to his own bankthat line thats the itsa maker line see and youve cut that line by doing what by trying to read it all out from underneath the pc now the meter actually can operate as sort of thetan you and the meter can be sort of substitute thetan you realize that you got bank sitting across the table from you and you by putting in whatsits can kick things thatin the bank that read that the pc isnt perceiving well this is absolutely vital at iv which is why ive spent some time talking about ivbecause all of iv and gpms are subitsa the itsa maker line playing over the tops of these things sees bunch of black alpsbut the meter and the auditor can undercut that bank since they are not influenced by those direct and immediate bumps and the significances in them so they can undercut these things and find out what goal it is because it rocket reads while the pc is still wondering what goal it is yes but you can get too much of that kind of thing too very very easily you can say well and the meter know and the pc doesnt know so therefore theres sense in paying any attention to the pc so we cut his itsa maker and we find session by session his rfactor drops on his bank we try to do it all very mechanically we should do it mechanically but we do it mechanically by cutting his line now wed have to have wild idea of what this line is in order to pull such goofs as this we say to the pc we say well give megive goal now on this list and the pc gives you goal on the list and so forth and youre asking the pc is it an actual gpm youre asking via the meter seeis it an actual gpm or is it an implant gpm or something and the pc pipes up and he says you know i think this is an implant gpm i can see the helatrobus implant areas yeah i think its an implant gpm now heres the way to cut the rug right out from underneath the pc see is say all right thank you thank you is it an actual gpm is it an imp all right heres another way to cut the rug out from underneath the pc oh i think he saysyoure asking these questions of the meter and the pc answers them seeand the pc says i think its aits an actuali think its an implant gpm because i can see the helatrobus implant areas i mean theyre right here i can see them and the auditor says oh all right well is it also an actual gpm and the pc says ii dont think so i really dont think it is all right you mind if i check it on the meter go ahead all right is it an implant gpm is it an actual gpm i get read here also its an actual gpm what do you think about that well it could be yeah as matter of fact it probably is oh thats what that damn big black mass is floating over therethats it you understand but we know of the existence of this itsa maker line you see we know of the existence of the line between thetan were auditing and his bank we know of the existence of that line now watch the first one again is it an actual gpm is it an implant gpm pc says you know i think this is an implant gpm i can see the helatrobus implant grounds here oh yes well thank you thank you is it an actual gpm an implant gpm now what in effect have you done what have you in effect done youve cut the itsa communication line you have not permitted an itsa to flow on it you have invalidated the thing that he is looking at and you have cut his communication line to his own bank now dont sit around afterwards and wonder why you have an arc break you know thats how many lines are cut by this simple stupid action and yet you say its the most obvious action in the world and you say well level iv is very mechanical process and you should do it just bangbangbang see and all right youre doing it bangbangbang what gets in your road this itsa maker line from the pc to his own bank that gets in your road terribly and youve also heard that you mustnt let him wander around on the backtrack because hell overrestimulate himself and you wont get any tone arm action see so every time you find him looking at the backtrack drop your emeter see get his attentionget his attention over on you and you wont get any ta youll just have arc breaks galore all the time so just start inspecting the number of things you could do with careless action of that particular character you just refuted what he said is what it looks like in the first place but youll be surprised the nuances that can exist with this sort of thing now it isnt for you simply to be careful careful careful from here on out not to commit these crimes that is the wrong approach you just know what it is and know how to handle it even nitroglycerin expert gets so he takes pint of aflask of the stuff and shoves it in his hip pocket and goes out for ride on rocky road in an old ford and he never gets blown up its always somebody who wanders in carefully and stumbles over the cork that somebodys left around see thats the person that gets blown up see you just move yourself up into the category of the nitroglycerin expert thats all youre handling very deadly stuff all rightknow what it is examine it get familiar with it and you wont go on being careful all the time not to cut the pcs itsa lineyou just wont and on occasion you may find good reason to do so you know whats going on now all sorts of thingsthings we used to call intuition an intuitive sensecan suddenly be born in you just like that you suddenly develop the facility of seeing that the pc is looking at something you dont just neglect the whole existence of this itsa maker line you just dont neglect the whole existence of the bank and just keep running it on the meter running it on the meter see you glance up sideways with this walleyed look one eye on the meter and the other on the pc you seewith the reflection of the retina this is done and you noticeyou notice that the pc is introverted and you will know exactly what hes doinghes looking at piece of the bank so you wont keep wondering if the pc has said everything he wanted to say about something youll have developed the facility of taking look at the pc and see that hes looking at something and leave him alone until hes through looking at it and hell be sitting thereand actuallyactually its quite visible the pcs sitting there and hes looking at you and hes rather foggyeyed most of the time let us say since hes somewhat introverted and you say all right now is this your item or is that the problem that you were worried about at that time or whatever the hell it is youre asking him it doesnt matter see and youre saying this to him is that your item and the pc goes sort of uh yeah yeah i think it is see and you just get so you can tell you hear you just get so you can tell when that inspection is taking place and not go yeaowyeaowyeaow barkbarkbark ebaebaeba yelpyelpyelp yapyapyapyapyapyapyap why do i say that because some auditors remind of terriers or something of the sort of thing what do they do its actually just likeif you visualized piece of string over here from thetan to his bankit almost seems to the pc as though the second he starts to put this piece of string down to his bank the auditor reaches over grabs the end of it very hastily and puts it out here on the auditor this is where it ought to be now what did you think about that wheres thewhywhy arent you itsaing anything got ahold of the piece of string see why arent you itsaing anything now ill putput yourput this piece of string down on some part of your bank and tell something about it im not going to let it go you just put it the pc goes oh my godwhats happening to you see whats happening well whats happening to him is is the itsa maker line is being carefully held outcarefully pulled out from any possibility of bank inspectionand the pc is being given whatsits thats the actual situation it isnt that the pcit looks to the pc and he will say that the auditor is asking whatsits and hes not being permitted to answer thats what he usually feels is happening and that actually is usually not what is happening the auditor is perfectly willing to have him answer but the auditors putting in whatsits while not permitting the pc to look for the answer in the bank the auditors carefully keeping this string from thetan to bank pulled out so that the bank end of the string is over here on top of the emeter or into the session and of course your pcs out of session all the time all the time all the time whats the definition of session see its only willing to talk to the auditor just willing you know not talking to the auditor just willing and its really notand that definition could be revised and made betterits not just interested in own case but passing this inspection line over his own casenot passing it over the auditor of the session now one of the things that you get as an auditor is when youve grabbed this line inadvertentlyand oh count on the fact that youre going to make two or three blunders with this per session when you are complete expert see actually professperfection on this is unobtainable because youre going along at mad rate and youre trying to push along through and get goals list finished by the end of the session or youre trying to sort out service facsimile little list that you have in front of you dont you see and actually in level ivlevel iv particularlyyour nulling is done bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark there are very few auditors can talk as fast as the meter can respond on nulling you just get it out of your mouth and youre reading the next one see theres that tenthofasecond pause to let the meter read didnt readthat tenthofasecond told you so youve said it very fast and very rapid man i tell you good auditora good auditor can take cracking awful big list and just mow it down man and youre going down this listand all of sudden why the pc says hey ii thought of anotheri thought of anotheri thought of another item its cat whisker see something like this and youre intent on going down the list and the pcyou dontyou dont really get the pcs lift of his head you see and his going to tell you see and if you just missed it entirely youd get hell of an arc breakbut you pick it up just little bit late you see its just little bit crude and crummy and you realize youve slid over the last ten nulling items without the pcs attention on the list or something wildits usually the last two or three dont you see youve goofed it up one way or the other well matter how perfect you are youre going to goof it up sometimes or another pcs going to be sitting there and youd swear he was bright bushytailed right up in pt answering the end of session and then my god he was examininghe was examining his session goals and you were trying to ask him about his gains youve overridden the pcs comm line its how adroitly you can wiggle out of what you get into that is the mark of the expert its not staying out of everything most of my auditing is highly swift and effective simply because it is very brassy i know i can get pc out of anything i get the pc into and i know im not going to get the pc into any more than i can possibly help so therefore it just adds up to to hell with it and i just know the factors i am dealing with and i shift those things round in sessionclick click click bing bang so this particular pair didnt quite mesh over here in the corner and the pc said rrrrrr and ill trace it back to some auditing error i just made two seconds ago and so forth patch the thing up in hurry and im off and away see one thing i do that i hope you will be able to acquire someday is spot the birth of an arc break upwards to an hour and half before it happens please develop that facility knowdont be so reasonable the pc is sort of saying well i dont know well you kept looking at the meter and so on and so on i dont really know whether this item was less yeaownyawhawhawhawhaf and you start to see some of this kind of stuff and you all of suddennot be unnecessarily cautiousbut you suddenly recognize it for what it is youve chopped up this auditing comm cycle somehow or another somewhere it is missing somewhere something has gone wrong something has goofed somewhere and right thenspot it and pick it up right now without nulling fifteen more new additional lists you see and holding up the pc for the next five sessions you know get that quick recognize an arc broken pc and recognize how slightly an arc break registers when it is actually beginning to form and pick it up thendont arc break the pc in order to find out well there are several ways to do that one of them is not arc break pcs as ive just told you that is next to impossible your own auditing enthusiasms will cause you to arc break pcs my god i pulled one the other day you would have gotten an infraction sheet for and so on i saw very clearly that on list an item had rocket read and blown down which was not the right item it was the very exact item which the pc was madly listing for and the pc was actually tending to go into strain on an overlist of trying to get this item on the listand i said you just put this item down on the list just before this could it be it and the pc said why yes i guess so put it on the list and immediately was little bit nattery about the pen scratching and i took the item right back off the list and put it back on the other list and continued the pc and we got another oneand the item that was on that list if accepted would have missed two ris it came up two lists later as the right item and the one which was the right item was very resistant it was one of thesewell ill saytell you what the item wastorture very resistant item youd call the thing and it wouldntwouldnt fire itd start to fire itevery once in while you find some kind of goofball situation like this and you call it and itblhblhblhit doesnt quite fire and it wont let go and it goes ssshhhk it looks like its up against springs and ordinarily you say thatsthats not the right itemits slightly misworded or something in this particular case after wed listed enough charge off the pc continued to assert that was the item and suddenly i called it and it fired like mad and blew down in other words it had to be unburdened bit by listing before the thing fired this is very peculiar thing happens the tops of gpms are very hard to run they dont fire well and so onthe tone arm tends to stay high you get four pairs deep into gpm and its running just like river of hot butter seetheres nothing to it those first few sometimes are quite resistant so whats the auditor trying to do the auditors trying to be too confounded helpful and it was helpful to point of actually evaluating and putting an item on the pcs list for him well thats absolutely forbidden seeabsolutely forbidden and yet there i sat with my big blue eyes wide open and wanted to help the pc so bad that i just called attention to the fact that wed had firing blowing down item on the previous listkkkkkkk now that arc break could have gone into considerable proportions but recognizing that the arc break had succeeded after an auditing action seeimmediately after the auditing actionpicked the item up and put it right back where it came from the arc break wentpheeeewthat was that it didnt even get chance to form see see there was just that beginning of the critical cycle beginning of attention on the auditor now this is not important and im not talking to you about arc breaks or beefs im allowed good big juicy mistake every thousand hours of auditing thatsi insist on being allowed that but the point im making is hereis apparently it was wrong item that was causing the arc break actually that really wasnt the beginning of the arc break that pc was very introverted inspecting the bank now lets look at this inspection line exactly what happened to the pcs line from pc to bank see just look at that line lets see how mucked up things got from the standpoint of that line this line being invisible to the auditor dont you see youve got to synthesize whats going on and youll rapidly learn how to do that if you realize that its simply line scanning over things in the bank it isnt just unit area by the waythink think thinking you know that its an actual line its between this bright spot called thetan the real beingness of the beingwhether its parked in his head or hes extravagantly detached on reverse flow exteriorizationwe dont care where he is he is looking from that bright spot he is that bright spotand he is looking at thing he is looking at thing its asits as real as pencil dont you see and the bank is all laid out geographically and it has numbersa finite number of things in it as far as types of things in ita finite number and that line is stretched from where he is to one of those things well what happened when i said this item appeared on two lists back what happened to the itsa maker line the line from the pc to his own bank what did i do with that line apparently i picked up the line and put it on the auditortook it off the bank suddenly and put it on the auditor now that was sudden change or shift of attention wasnt it well we call it shift of attentionactually it was sudden shift of the target of this line heres the line deeply engrossed in inspecting the bank see all of sudden auditor picks that line up and puts it over on the auditor and then moves it back two lists ago in the gpm just done two lists ago heres two shifts of attentionsudden shifts of attentionand then puts it over here someplace to recognize that an item has been missed because of course this other item was being suggested as substitute for the right item so there must have been realization of thatbut by this time the pc must have been pretty confused so the pc then in defense of this confusion picks up the inspection lineputs it on the auditor and says your pen is making too much noise see that what can be itsaed around here with certainty something about the auditor can be itsaed with certainty because the auditor has inhibited anything that should have been itsaed being itsaed you got it now theres probably dozen different ways that an auditor can accomplish these things there are probably thousands of different wayswe probably havent dreamed them all up if you dont learn this well we give you the assignment of finding out how many ways each one of the communication auditing cycle lines can be cut by new academy student i think you will find out they run probably thousands per linetheyre probably fantastic numbers its easy to find out how to handle them right thats the easier part of it how many ways can they be cut enormous numbers you can refute you can invalidate the itsathe thing being itsaedyou can refute the communication line on which it is traveling like dont talk to now because i am busy writing your auditors report this is done in various ways dont talk to now because im busy trying to keep track of the auditors reports its ait can come about as very studious action sort of little tiny frown at the pc and then an enormously industrious writing you see of one character or another and reading over the meter and the pcs going on talking dont look at the pc and keep on doing this and so forth eventually the pc begins to realize that youre not really writing anything that has anything to do with him and accommodatingly follows the auditors order and the pc nearly always follows the auditors orders one way or the other you would be surprised how obedient pcs are the bank is 100 percent under the control of any auditor at any time and the pcthe greatest percentage of the timeis doing exactly what the auditor apparently wants but get that apparently now the auditor can say put your attention on the ceiling and point to the floor now the pc will do what the auwhat he thinks the auditor apparently wants now if the gesture is more forceful than the voice the pc will look at the floor you say look at the ceiling and the pcthe greater than b b greater than dont you seewill have tendency to well hes saying look at the ceiling but he wants to look at the floor see he gets confused doing this but he obeyshe obeys you might say the most forceful apparent order auditors main goofs are made up in giving apparent orders that he doesnt intend to give he doesnt intend to give these orders at all for instance you would never tell pc now stop inspecting your bank and put it on the emeter that would be idiotic because thered be itsa and thered be ta if you asked this thing and yet what is this apparent order whats the apparent order there take your attention off your bank and put it on the emeter seethats the apparent order the pc will nearly always follow an apparent order now the bank is very idiotic and is always under the auditors orders and will do what the auditor says therefore it takes the auditors whatsit and guidance of the pcs inspection line of the bank you seethe itsa maker lineit takes both of those activities in order to get bank inspected see so the auditor and the pc have got to be working very close together and if the auditor cuts this linethis is going back to the original thesis explaining some of the things in there seenow if the auditor cuts this line from the pc to his bank of course hes now apparently brought the bank in on top of the pc and done other things which are undesirable but he usually is giving orders he doesnt intend to give nobody is going to argue with the goodwill or the good heart of an auditor the only thing i ever find any fault with is occasional knuckleheadedness that knuckleheadedness can be pretty gorgeous i just gave you an example of it and yet any auditor is suddenly liable to this sort of thing well ill give you another example ill have to run out all of this invalidation of my auditing after this lecture but i did this inadvertently the other day in sessiondont think you wont this wouldnt happen to you once in blue blue blue moon that the pc can hear the pencil squeaking thats why you use special type of pencil that doesnt squeak so im busy writing the list and the ballpoint ran out of ink this wouldnt happen to you again in long time see ballpoints do run out of ink and you always have spare ballpoint around dont you so i hastily reached over to where the other ballpoint was handy and picked it up and at this moment there wouldnt have been any slightest squawk you see there wasnt tremble in the session see and i picked up the other ball point brought it over here and it had just enough ink in it to write one more item we still didnt have too much randomity going in the session you see auditor beginning to sweat just little bit about this time i laid aside this ballpoint but the other ballpoint was over on another table barely within the auditors reacha different color ballpoint see barely withinbut there was ballpoint over thereover the top of pile of paper so as not to disturb the pcs attention very carefully reached over to pick up this ballpoint and i said well im going to win after all on this you see and had to stretch just little bit out of the auditing chair and went out of the auditing chair happen to you once in blue moon i dont think ive done goof like that for ages and ages concatenation of silly circumstances one on top of the other and what do you think happened to the pcs itsa line well the pcs whole motion was not to arc break but to keep the auditor from falling out of the chair and got motion and locked up bunch of effort in the middle of the session you know of trying to pick the auditor up when the auditor went down it took couple of minutes to undo all this and we went on going at aat rate because i recognized that something had happened there that had to be undone all right thats very unsmooth but unlookedfor happenstance well if i can do them man so can you so the thing to know how to do is pick it up at once straighten it out at once and get the show on the road again without any more nonsense because frankly anything is liable to happen to you in an auditing session an auditor who feels absolutely serene and secure that all is going to go well from here on outor if an auditor has allergies to anxieties or unpredictable circumstances occurring in sessionhe ought to go to an old ladies home or something and retire because its going to happen the things that have happened to auditorssome guys halfway through screaming grief charge of one kind or another and somebody hears him down the block and the relatives come up screaming up to the door pounding on the door trying to get in to find out how bill is being murdered or joe is being shot or something see this has happened happened happened now how does an auditor keep his aplomb handle the situation repair the shift of attention of the pcwhat does he do how many things can he do to straighten it out well actually theres lot of things he can do to straighten it out in the first place he audits smoothly so that when he does audit he gets lots of ta got that thats marvelous cushion on which to operate see when something does happenwhen it bothers the pc but not otherwiseyou know occasionally water tank can fall off the roof and come right down through the shingles and the pc says oh and goes on and saying and then ithen ithen i said to agnes see youll learn thisthis goes all the way up to level iv dont you ever fool with case that is running nicely see case is running like welloiled dream youve got the pt goingyoure going down the line the only trouble thats going to occur from there on is actually goofs you make case is running finedont patch up case dont patch up case thats running well case you want to patch up is ease that isnt running well and you only patch it up when it isnt running well so if the roof has fallen in or the auditor has reached out of his chair for pencil that was out of reach and fallen on the floor the first thing you must learn to observe is did it move the itsa maker line all that much did it affect or influence the pc thats the first thing you learn because if it didnt youre not going to repair it because look your effort to repair something that did not upset the pc can itself disturb the itsa maker line and all other communication lines to such degree that you can cause an arc break because what are you doing youre cleaning clean youre handling an arc break that didnt occur how did you feel about the water tank falling off of the roof and coming down through the shingles and so forth oh did it do you realize it might be considerable mistake to ask the pc how he felt about the water tank falling through the roof many auditors are so consciencestrickenthere is nothing like having conscience to be an auditor see because an auditor gets so consciencestricken sometimes he gets so worriedwell ive gotten worried youve gotten worried about cases you were runningbut gets so worried it causes the pc into go into just spin of worry gets so worried about the case that hes putting in whatsita whatsit all the time on the pc hes askthe pcs saying well whats wrong whats wrong whats wrong whats wrong whats wrong whats wrong the pc isnt doing an itsa the pc doesnt have his communication line into his own bank everything hes got communication line from where he is to where the auditor is wondering what does the auditor think is wrong what does the auditor think is wrong hes trying to itsa the auditors confusions or banks well that isnt what the pcs for that isnt what the pcs supposed be doing dont you see so it goes this nonsensically if the pcs itsa maker line from the thetan to the bank is there and is functioning and your ta is moving if fire engine comes through the front window and it didnt seem to interrupt the session as far as you could tellnot by asking the pc but just by casual observationyou simply ask the next auditing question because case repair also interrupts various sections and portions of the auditing cycle in other words theres substitute for auditing but auditing and you only repair auditing when it isnt occurring if you havent got any auditing occurring you better find out how youre going to get some auditing occurring you cant get any auditing occurring well repair the case and get some auditing occurring but its in more or less that order not the order of there sits case lets repair it now lets see i know this easethis case had georgie burns for you see an auditor in 1958 and ive been audited by georgie and uhhuhhuhhuhhuh and georgie has this horrible habit of saying yip all the time in the session every time she acknowledges she also says yip and i know that was very annoying to my pc so the first thing to do is to repair georgie burnss auditing in 1958 all this without any investigation of the case at all well thats repairing the case before youve gotbefore you find anything is wrong with the ease you see and you only repair cases when somethings wrong with them the case is running well with good ta why move the ease around thats the way to stop ta why because you pick up this itsa maker line move it out of the area its in and move it into some other area and you suddenly bog the pc down you get him into areas he cant itsa or he isnt able to itsa or theres nothing there to itsa or theyre all cleaned up oryou get the idea so this pcs sitting therei can see it now you seethe pcs sitting there happily inspecting his bank and hes running service facsimile youre getting about forty fifty ta divisions per two and half hours of session ta flying beautifully this explains the pcs fantastic penchant for burning dinners see and its gotits all going along fine and all of sudden why some auditing supervisor saysin the hgc or something says oh have you taken care of that pcs lumbosis well you know she came in here originally to get her lumbosis fixed up and the auditor being very nice and sweet and obedient about the whole thing turns around and starts working on the lumbosis at eight ta divisions per session lumbosis isnt going to resolve thats shift of the whole program of the case well get that as broad shiftit would be tremendous error wouldnt it now lets move it down to very short error auditor is sitting there the pc is looking in an introverted fashion at field of cows you know and he says cows ive seen cow in this lifetimecows cows yes cows and so forth and cows and so on cows i wonder what this countryside is like here cowscows ta moving ta starting to move the last whatsit the auditor got in on the case you seethe last whatsit the auditor got on the case was how would baking bread make others wrong and finds out that the pc is inspecting all these cows he says now lets get back to what we were talking about there getting ta action see inspecting cows lets get it back to what we were talking about there and we were talking about baking bread making others wrong baking bread making others wrong youve got the auditing question now taclank dead still what happened well actually the auditor thought the pc was probably being non sequitur trying to push the pcs attention seethis line this itsa maker lineover to baking bread but hes got ta action and it was just around the corner that the pc was going to cognite that bread and milk you see go hand in glove together big cognitions about to occur and hed been ranch cook see hed been ranch cook but never never never had they ever had any milk to make bread with this is right around the corner if that attention line is just let go just thatta moving everythings fine the auditor all of suddenone way or the other by thousand different mechanismssuddenly picks up that attention line puts it on something else you see tano motion why theres nothing there to make any motion you see this is something like guys sweeping street see and you walk up to him and you say give that broom all right sweep the street well you got my broom you got my broom well you dont want that broom down on the pavement justbrooms suppose to be over herebe over here on the curb now all right weve got it here on the curb now sweep the street yeah but1 got to have my broom i mean you know how can i give you anyhuhhuhhuh how can i sweep the street with youwith the broom so forth now look now look i know whats best with this broom i know whats best with this broom after all this is street cleaning department property and it must be preserved and were supposed to keep it over here on the curb and so forth now sweep the street you can see the nervous wreck that becomes the street cleaner thats what youre actually doing to pc pick up the pcs attention line one way or the othergrab it hold on to it and then tell him look at the bank now yeah here give that line yeah yeahletsletslets give some itsa wheres your itsa now well i uhi uhso forth and i think it has something to do with this facsimile oh oh bbbzzzthe facsimileoh hohohohono we got to look at something else now give some itsa whatsit whatsit whatsit uhuhgivegive that line give thatgive that communication line now but dontdontdontdont start moving any attention lines inside your bank now and give some itsa see whatsit whatsit whatsit dont look whatsit well you can figure many ridiculous examples on how an auditor can do this as soon as you get these things taped all of sudden auditing just isjustits just very relaxing and on level iv it is very very industrious but youre doing an excellent job the whole way of directing the pcs attention youre getting that line directed because the materials of iv permit that direction its very precise direction if its not precisely directed god help you its something like shooting sixteeninch guns you see without any pointers everything gets blown up if you dont point them in the right direction but this is the essence of the auditing you were doing and any real trouble youre having with auditing theres some misconception of these various communication lines or what youre doing with the pcs itsa maker line or something like this tell the guy to itsa something then not let him look at anything to itsa hed go berserk he itsas somethingdont accept it say it must be something else something like this keep this rattledybang going up somehow or anotheryou get ta and you get auditing done and everybody goes around the bend all right but i know youre not doing any of the things which i have been remarking i know were all agreed that im the only one thats making any auditing mistakes lately so you go ahead and do good job huh all right thank you very much
