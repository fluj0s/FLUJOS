latinos reported earning less than 30000 year while those who are bilingual or english dominant were more likely to earn over 30000 year and particularly more likel to earn annual incomes of 50000 or

television dvertising revenues20 there is evidence however that the market is responding to demographic changes and rapi dly reducing the gap between the audience share and the advertising share of spanish language programming while advertising revenues for all media grew by only 22 in 2002 they grew by 255 for the two major spanish language companie s univision and telemundo21 according to

entering the market the majority of advertising targeting the hispanic market is in spanish at the same time there are strong market forces propelling consolidation in the us media sector see crs report rl32026 market dynamics and public policy issues in the video programming industry and crs report rl32027 market structure of the video programming industry and em erging public policy issues these forces exist for spanish language media outlets as well as english language outlets univision has asserted that its merger with hbc is in the public interest because it gives it the size and scope needed to compete with english language media giants for national advertising dollars opponents of the merger argued that the merger of two dominant spanish language media companies reduced the numbe r of independent spanish language voices available to spanish speaking viewers and listeners and potentially raises barriers to competitive entry by other companies offering spanish language programming the high horizontal and vertical concen tration in the spanish language media industry creates several poten tial threats to the congressional goals of competition localism and diversity of voices just as is the case for english language cable channels24 successful launch of new cable ne twork depends on that network being carried by major multisystem cable operators msos andor

example the popularity of the univision broadcast network can be used by univision to help obtain cable and satellite carriage of telefutura and other univision channels as well market advantage that independent spanish language programmers lack the need for such leverage has created market incentives for all producers whether of english language programming or of spanish language programming to consolidate but it also means that it is much more likely that univision will be able to launch new spanish language cable networks th an will independent program producers unless those program producers give the mso or satellite systems substantial equity interest25 for effective competition to univision to develop competitors w ill have to increase their relatively small audience shares telemundo which owns the second largest spanish language television network and major spanish language television station group but nonetheless is distant second to univ ision asserts that the most effective way to reach potential viewers to inform them of its new programs is by advertising on other spanish language outlets especially radio outle ts that have large audiences that claim appears to be supported by telemundo spending 74 of its 2002 advertising budget on radio26 most of the major spanish language tele vision and radio stations in the largest hispanic markets are owned by univision or entravision which is 30 owned by univision telemundo has lleged that entravision sta tions have refused to accept advertising from telemundo to promote its programming t hus depriving it of access to the most efficient means to inform viewers of its programming27 as explained in crs report rl3202628 one of the market dynamics driving consolidation is the efficiency gains from being able to market programs across multiple media outlets firms have integrated to improve the coordination of these program marketing efforts if some competitors ar denied access entirely or in part to the dominant media outlets which ma have upwards of 80 of the audience share then they will only have access to inferior marketing outlets when company is trying to reach and inform the spanish speaking community in the us about its product even media product if it is denied access to dominant media outlets it may be placed at significant competitive disadvantage while univision for example has obligation to allow its competitors to piggyback ff the popularity of its programming given its market dominance refusing to accept advertising may have anticompetitive consequences entravisions refusal to air telemundo advertisements if practiced by all univision related media outlets could result in the dominant televisionradio combination denying its television competitors access to majority of spanish speaking radio listeners and television viewers absent rules that prohibit such conduc t consolidation that extends dominant firms reach potentially denies key access to competitors
