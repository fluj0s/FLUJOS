lesser majorityof the remaining electors would be necessary to elect president objections in the congress to particular electoral votes or slates of votes from state have not been frequent occurrences during the congressional vote count the joint sessions of 1873 and 1877 are the most notewor thy exceptions since 1887 and the adoption of codified procedures in federal law concerning the giving and counting of electoral votes there has been only one objection raised in congress to an electoral vote 1969 and that objection to the vote of socalled faithless elector was not sustained and the vote was counted as cast even more rare is an objection that is sustained and electoral votes from state not counted although this did happen in 1873 with regard to the election of 1872 in the case of the electoral votes from arkansas and louisiana found not to have been given by the electors selected on election day and properly certified and in the case of three of the votes from georgia given for candidate who had died before the votes were given early objections to votes focused on whether state had not yet completed all the technical requirements for statehood and also included objections which focused on whether votes were given on the correct day whether votes from states that had been in insurrection should now be counted whether electors were the persons elected on election day whether returns were validly certified whether substitute electors were properly chosen or whether electoral votes were properly cast by ballot the question of the majority necessary to elect when votes are not counted or are not given from state has never been the subject of an express ruling and decision of the congress has never been an issue determinative of the outcome of presidential election in the vote count in congress and was not expressly addressed in the 1887 electoral vote count legislation the legislative history of the act of 1887 evidences divergence of opinion on the question in congress the practice in congress has not been consistent with evidence of lowering the whole number of electoral votes in many of the cases when votes were not received by the congress from electors but with some evidence of keeping the whole number the same in the instance when congress rejected votes given from state in 1872 even in this case however there was inconsistency in reporting the whole number used and the majority employed as reported in the senate journal and at the national archives and records administration as compared to the reporting in the congressional globe and in the journal of the house of representatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl307691 see now 3 usc 1 et seq for brief discussion and walkthrough of the role of congress in the electoral vote count

surveys certain aspects of the historical congressional practice in counting the presidential electoral votes in congress the twelfth amendment to the united states constitution amending article ii section 1 of the constitution provides for the president of the senate the vice president of the united states in the presence of the senate and house of representatives to open all of the certificates given by the presidential electors in the various states and that the votes shall then be counted the person receiving the most votes for president will be elected president if that person receives majority of the whole number of electors appointed similar procedure is used to elect the vice president subsequent to and pursuant to the constitutional provisions congress has enacted statutory provisions further detailing practices and procedures in the giving and in the counting of electoral votes for president and vice president1 questions have arisen as to the practice in the congress of rejecting electoral votes from electors in state the kinds of objections that have been raised to electoral votes the disposition of such objections and whether if electoral votes are rejected by congress or are not given by the electors in state those votes not given or not counted are then to be deducted from the whole number of electors appointed such that different and lesser majorityof the remaining electors would be necessary to elect president in researching the legislative material for this report each electoral vote count for president and vice president conducted in the congress since the ratification of the 12th amendment in 1804 was examined the actual floor debates and discussion involved in the electoral vote count were reviewed as well as the publication of the electoral vote counts in the congressional record congressional globe annals of congress andor the journal of the house of representatives or the journal of the senate for evidence of the practice of the joint session of congress in dealing with the electoral vote count specific attention was paid to the inclusion or exclusion from both 1 the electoral vote count andor 2 the whole number of electors appointed of those electoral votes that either were not given or were rejected by the joint session additionally the nature and disposition of objections that were made to the counting of particular electoral votes were examinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs2 2 24 stat 373 ch 90 february 3 1887 3 john w burgess the law of the electoral count political science quarterly volume 3 issue 4 633 653 at p 651 december 1888 4 id at 650 citing 17 congressional record 820 january 21 1886 whole number and majority used much of the congressional practice reviewed occurred prior to the passage of the socalled electoral count act of 18872 which sought to codify and regulate procedure for the counting of electoral votes in the congress it should be noted that the particular issue of the necessary majority to be used when certain electoral votes were not given or were not counted was not specifically addressed in the 1887 act contemporaneous analysis and commentary on the 1887 act in fact expressed criticism of the law precisely for failing to resolve this particular question in an article in the noted journal political science quarterly published in 1888 year after the passage of the electoral count act john w burgess provided the following criticism among several others of the law furthermore provision is made in the law as to whether when the vote of state is rejected it is to be deducted from the whole number of electoral votes to which all the states are entitled in determining the majority necessary to choose the president3 as discussed in that article and as evident from the legislative history of the 1887 law there was clear answer to that question in the legislation and there existed differing and conflicting views expressed during its enactment by members of congress as to whether the socalled denominator in determining the majority of electors appointed stayed the same or was reduced when electoral votes were not given andor not counted one senator believed the provision allowing the houses of congress concurrently to reject electoral votes given was subject to abuse and manipulation since the whole number of electors would remain the same upon rejecting some electoral votes preventing any candidate from receiving majority and thus allowing the house of representatives rather than the people through their electors chosen to select the president when the bill was in the senate mr evarts pointed out the fact that this provision would enure to the undue advantage of the house whenever the loss of the vote of the state affected the election since the house could by throwing out the vote of the state bring the election into its own hands this condition of things could easily be manufactured of course and house so disposed could easily be enabled to defeat an election by the electors and substitute its own choice therefor4 this view and the perceived potential for manipulation was challenged however by senator hoar who believed that the whole number of electors would not stay the same but would be decreased when electoral votes given were not counted by the congress thus effectuating an election of the president without resorting to the contingent election in the house of representatives this view of course could present its own opportunity for possible manipulation and mischief as congress action in decreasing the number needed for majority could elect different person president than if all the votes were counted and includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs3 5 id at 650 citing 17 congressional record supra at 821 6 id at 650mr hoar suggested that this contingent election in the house could not happen since if the votes from state should be thrown out they must be deducted from the whole number of electoral votes in calculating the majority necessary to choice the result of this might be the election of another candidate by the electors but it could not be to bring the election into the house of representatives5 as noted by the author in 1888 however the issue was far from resolved at that time either from the law passed by congress or by prior practice in congress but the assertion of mr hoar that when the votes of state are thrown out they are to be deducted from the whole number of the electoral votes in calculating the majority necessary for choice was not at the moment and is not now the fixed and certain law of the land it was only his conjecture while mr evarts an equally weighty authority in the interpretation of constitutional law held as we have seen the contrary view6 it is thus apparent that there existed lack of authoritative precedent for congress to consider as fixed law or practice before 1887 similarly it appears that the congress itself in adopting the 1887 act did not have unified sense or understanding concerning this question and did not definitively decide the issue of which majority of the whole number to use when electoral votes were not accepted or received furthermore the actual history and practice in congress subsequent to the passage of the 1887 act provides further answer to the particular question of the majority used as this question has not arisen in the 20th century counts of electoral votes this report purports only to record the practi ce in the congress regarding such questions as which majorit was used as well as the questions of the nature and disposition of objections to electoral votes the decision not to count an electoral vote given that is to sustain an objection to an electoral vote and to reject that vote appears to be very rare in congressional practice additionally it is uncommon although not without precedent for an elector to fail to give vote because of illness or other absence or incapacity at time when replacement elector could not be appointed there are thus few instances from which to determine consistent pattern of congressional practice further complicating the task of attempting to glean some congressional precedent out of past practice is the fact that the issue of which whole number of electors appointed is to be used to determine the necessary majority when votes are not counted or not given has apparently never been one on which the outcome of the presidency was determinative nor was it ever an issue specifically in contention and ruled upon by the congress in practice in the congressional electoral vote count the electoral votes counted usually corresponded to the number used as the whole number of electors appointed this was because in most cases they were actually the same since electoral votes were missing and electoral votes were rejected in several instances however the total number of electoral votes counted was considered announced or recorded as the whole number of electors even though some electoral votes were not given electoral votes from timetotime have not been presentedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs4 7 the announcement in the joint session in 1820 was different than normally given because of contingency in the vote count and an alternative vote count with respect to controversy over the electors from missouri see

website httpwwwnaragovfedregelctcollecfronthtmlgeneral for 1820 compare to reduced whole number and majority needed in 1816 election it is not precisely clear which congressional documents and records the archives used as the basis for publishing these numbers 10 congressional globe 42nd cong 3rd sess 1306 february 12 1873 11 journal of the senate 42nd cong 3rd sess 345 february 12 1873 12 see note 10 supra 13 united states government national archives and records administrat ion supra 1872 election as noted in note 9 supra it is not clear which congressional documents were the basis for the national archives reporting of these numbersto the congress from an elector who for one reason or another did not show up at the prescribed state location at the prescribed statutory time to cast his vote in many of those instances of votes not given by an elector in 1809 1813 1817 and 1865 for example it appears that congress did not include the missing or potential electoral vote in the whole number of electors appointed and thus reduced the socalled denominator lowering the number of the majority needed to be elected this however was not consistent pattern even with respect to votes not presented to congress by electors in 1820 three electors did not give their vote for president because they had died although it is not apparent from the official record in congress what whole number of electors appointed was used7 congress in the joint session counted only 232 electoral votes including disputed votes from missouri8 while the recorded whole number of electors published by the national archives and record administration included the three electors who had died and did not vote thus indicating that congress kept the whole number of electors at the higher number of 235 of which 118 was the majority needed to elect9 in the one instance that we have identified where both houses of congress concurrently rejected votes that were given from states electors in 1873 the whole number of electors of which majority was needed appeared not to have been reduced as announced in the joint session10 interestingly even in this instance there was not consistency since the tally in the senate journal reflects that the whole number was reduced11 while the congressional globe indicates that the presiding officer in the joint session the vice president expressly announced the whole number of electors as the higher number 36612 the published records of the national archives and records administration uses the lower number of votes counted 352 similar to the senate journal13 the question of which majority to use did not appear to be an issue in public recorded contention at this time nor was it subject to any specific ruling on the public record and in any event grant would have been elected by either measurement finally it may be noted that in 1881 socalled alternative language was adopted for the 1880 election count whereby if the votes from state in which the electoral votes were being questioned were allowed one total would be reported and if they were not allowed another total would be reported the language adopted in 1881 and the table of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs5 14 11 congressional record 1386 1387 february 9 1881electoral votes published in the congressional record might provide an inference that if the votes of the one state which were cast on the wrong date were rejected the whole number of electors and thus the majority needed to elect would have remained the same that is there was specific indication made by congress in the table published or in the result announced that if the votes of that state were rejected that such action would have lowered the required majority14 objections to votes raised as noted above objections in the congress to particular electoral votes or slates of votes from state have not been frequent occurrences during the congressional vote count the joint sessions of 1873 and 1877 are the most noteworthy exceptions since 1887 and the adoption of codified procedures in federal law for the giving and the counting of electoral votes there has been only one objection raised in congress to an electoral vote in 1969 the objection raised in1969 to counting the vote of socalled faithless elector was not sustained in the house and senate and the vote was accepted and counted even more rare than an objection to an electoral vote is an objection that is sustained resulting in electoral votes from state not being counted this however did happen in 1873 with regard to the election of 1872 in the case of all of the electoral votes from arkansas and louisiana and with regard to three of the votes from georgia early objections to votes focused on the fact that state had not yet completed all the technical requirements for statehood and thus its electoral votes should not be counted this was the objection in 1817 to the votes from indiana and in 1821 to the votes in missouri since their electoral votes would not change the outcome of the election however they were counted in 1837 the same issue arose with regard to michigan when it was decided to tally its electoral votes in alternative totals and to count the votes from michigan if they did not change the result of the election another objection in 1837 was noted this was that certain electors should be disqualified because of federal employment however clear evidence was not before the congress regarding these individuals and it was decided to count their votes in 1857 the electoral votes from wisconsin were objected to because they were given on the wrong day because of severe snow storm on the day appointed for giving the votes but those votes were eventually counted in 1869 issues arose over whether states that had been in insurrection against the union were now qualified to vote under reconstruction requirements and objections to the votes from louisiana on those grounds were not sustained and the votes were counted while votes from georgia objected to on the same grounds were allowed in an alternative tally in 1873 objections to votes in three states were sustained while objections regarding two others were not objections to three votes from georgia which were given for candidate after that candidate had died were sustained and those votes were rejected additionally the electoral votes of arkansas were rejected where it was found that the electors were not the persons elected on election day and that the returns were not validly certified similarly the votes from louisiana where it was alleged that the electors were not chosen according to law and not properly certified were rejected objections to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs6 votes from mississippi as not properly given by ballot were not sustained and those votes were accepted objections to the electoral votes from texas in the nature that the substitute electors were not properly chosen and not properly certified by the governor were not sustained and those electoral votes were counted in the election of 1876 in the wake of postcivil war reconstruction policies and requirements several duplicate certificates from competing and different slates of electors were given from number of states purporting to be from the official state authorities because of the confusion the lack of clear congressional precedent or guidelines in such cases and the number of objections to both slates of electors from many states congress established commission to look at all of the competing claims and to provide decision on which slates should be accepted objections were then entertained with respect to the slate of electors chosen by the commission it should be noted that in all of the numerous objections made electoral votes from state were rejected or discarded in 1877 and all the states providing presidential electors were included in the count by the congress

number of possible electoral votes from the states16 objections to any electoral votes were noted 1809 in the election of 1808 the total possible number of presidential electors was 176 the number voted and counted before the joint session of congress was however only 175 as one elector from kentucky was not able to be present to cast his vote at the statutory time for the meeting of electors17 the whole number of votes was announced as being 175 of which 88 make majority18 the vote not received from kentucky was thus not counted in the total of electoral votes nor considered in the whole number of electors lowering the majority of electors needed from 89 to 88 one member of the house observed after the tellers counted the votes and upon handing them to the presiding officer that one set of credentials appeared to be defective the governors certificate not being attached to it19 action was taken on this observation however and the votes were all included earlier in the house petitions from several massachusetts citizens were introduced to examine the way in which the presidential electors were selected in massachusetts consideration of these petitions was strongly objected to by mr randolph however who argued that the constitution prescribes that the states are to appoint electors in the manner prescribed by the state legislatures and if we attempt to put our hands on this power we might as well in my apprehension arrogate to ourselves the appointment of president and vice president if we do away with the decision of the electoral body which is as independent of us as we are of them the constitution is in my opinion verging on dissolution20 the matter was then tabled but taken up again few days later where although it was argued that congress

apparently entitled to appoint 8 electors25 but cast only 7 electoral votes only 7 votes from ohio were counted and used in the whole number of electors 217 as opposed to 218 1817 the total number of electoral votes counted for the 1816 election was 217 and the whole number of votes was announced as 217 the necessary majority for election being 10926 while mention was made in the formal record of missing electoral votes or electoral votes not given it appears that 4 electoral votes were not given as three federalist electors chosen in maryland and one of the delaware electors did not see fit to attend27 the full number of all the electors would thus have been 221 with majority being 111 but those 4 electoral votes not given were not counted as part of the whole number by the congress and the majority needed to elect was reduced to 109 there was an objection raised by representative taylor of new york regarding the electoral votes of indiana which apparently had not as yet been formally admitted into the union at the time of giving its electoral votes28 the inclusion or omission of the indiana votes would not have changed the result of the election the joint session dissolved as the senate withdrew and the house proceeded to debate the issue after long debate in the house and in the senate the whole matter was indefinitely postponed and the votes from indiana

apparently included as part of the whole numberof electors appointed in the records of the national archives and record administration keeping the whole number of electors appointed at 235 and the majority needed to elect at 11832 one elector from state new hampshire carried by james monroe cast his electoral vote for another person john quincy adams while several electors cast votes for different vice president than the candidate carrying their state these socalled scattering votes were not objected to and were counted and recorded33 the electoral votes from missouri were objected to on the grounds that missouri was not state at the time of giving its electoral votes and had not qualified to be state at the time of counting those votes34 since the counting or the omission of missouris votes would not have affected the election of monroe resolution was agreed to in both houses before the vote count that the number of votes received would be one number if missouri were counted and would be another number if missouri were not counted an objection to the missouri votes was then raised in the joint session by representative livermore of new hampshire on the same grounds that missouri was not state in separate sessions of the house and the senate the objection was not carried and the vote count reported in congress reflected the alternative or contingent counts agreed upon earlier35 1825 it was announced that the whole number of electoral votes which had been given for president of the united states was two hundred and sixtyone of which none of the

seatons register showed that the number of electors appointed by the states was 288 of which majority was 14540 only 286 electors voted however as two electors from maryland did not cast votes41 while it was announced that the whole number of electoral votes which had been given for president of the united states was 286 of which andrew jackson had received 219 it appears that the use of the higher number of total electors appointed by the states as the necessary majority 145 of 288 was arguably contemplated since that number was published in the chart by the tellers although it was not expressly announced perhaps since jackson clearly won majority of either 286 or 288 the archives shows the number of electoral votes given as 286 and the majority of that as 144 there were objections

were unable to meet in the state capital to give their votes for president and vice president on the day prescribed by law but rather met the next day on the fourth of december 185650 the electoral vote count brought forth an objection to the counting of the votes from wisconsin because they were not provided on the day prescribed by law this question and the issue raised it was noted was not definitive as to the election of the president since james buchanan had large enough majority to win whether or not the votes from wisconsin for his opponent were counted and included in the whole number of electors the objection to the wisconsin electors vote was raised in the joint session by representative letcher and the presiding officer ruled that debate was not then in order51 the objection was raised again by representative letcher after the tellers reported and also by representative orr52 the presiding officer ruled that the objection was not in order53 after spirited debate concerning whether votes of the congress could be taken in the joint session and on the power of congress to decide upon the validity or invalidity of vote54 the joint session dissolved to discuss the issue of the votes from wisconsin in each chamber the opinions on the matter in the congress have been described as hopelessly irreconcilable and specific final resolution of the question was never made55 1861 the whole number of votes announced for the 1860 election by the tellers was 303 and the majority necessary for choice was 15256 the 303 votes corresponded to the actual votes given and to the number of potential electoral votes from all the states there being electoral votes objected to and electoral votes not given by electors 1865 the total number of electoral votes counted and

president and the whole number of electors appointed and the corresponding majority needed to elect was as announced lowered by one vote the whole number lowered from 234 to 233 and the majority necessary to elect from 118 to 11759 the major issue dominating the vote counting in 1865 was the electoral votes from states considered in insurrection against the laws constitution and government of the united states60 specifically those of tennessee and louisiana joint resolution was adopted before the vote count designating that certain states in insurrection were not entitled to representati on in the electoral college for the choice of president and vice president61 the electoral votes of those states including louisiana and tennessee were not counted as part of the votes given or the whole number of electors62 1869 the whole number of electoral votes cast for president and vice president was again stated in the alternative similar to other occasions in the past that is the number of votes cast including the votes of the state of georgia is 294 of which the majority is 148 excluding the votes form the state of georgia it is 285 of which the majority is 14363 ulysses s grant received 214 electoral votes and would be president in either case the house and senate had adopted joint resolution earlier in the year concerning the manner in which states that had been in insurrection could be allowed to participate in the presidential election and appoint electors64 under this scheme louisiana was allowed to cast its votes and the votes of georgia whose status as complying with reconstruction was still pending before the senate were allowed to be cast in the alternative form whereas mississippi virginia and texas were not allowed to cast votes65 on february 8

votes67 an objection was also raised to votes of georgia by mr butler on grounds that the votes were given on the wrong day and that georgias representation in congress was still pending while the house voted not to accept georgias vote the senate found that the objection was out of order as resolution had previously been agreed to by the house and senate treating the electoral votes of georgia in the alternative68 an objection to the electoral votes of nevada as not being properly made by ballot was ruled not in order as it was not timely made69 1873 in the joint session as reported in the congressional globe the presiding officer the vice president announced for the 1872 election that the whole number of electors to vote for president and vice president of the united states as reported by the tellers is 366 of which majority is 184 of these votes 349 have been counted for president 70 the implication from this announcement is that the whole number of electors was kept at the higher number that is 366 possible electoral votes from the states even though 17 of those votes 8 for louisiana 6 for arkansas and 3 electoral votes from georgia given to horace greeley who had died before the vote were excluded by congress it should be noted however that the senate journal reports different result and different whole number of electors reported that is the lowered number of 352 excluding only the 14 electoral votes from louisiana and arkansas but including in the whole number the 3 votes from georgia received for greeley71 while the journal of the house of representatives represents the higher number of whole number of electors appointed at 36672 in the same manner as the congressional globe the lower number of 352 and the lower majority is also published by the national archives and records administration as the number of electoral votes counted and the majority of those needed to elect apparently from the original senate journal73 an objection was raised by

was raised by senator trumbull to the votes cast from mississippi in that the certificate did not indicate that they were given by ballot as required and further objection was raised by mr potter that there was indication that one of the electors was properly replaced according to state law the house and senate concurred that the votes from mississippi should be counted76 there were two objections raised to the electoral votes from texas one being that substitute electors were improperly chosen representative dickey and the other that the governor of the state had not certified the electors senator trumbull the house and senate both agreed to accept and count the votes from texas notwithstanding the objections raised77 an objection was raised by senator rice from arkansas that the electoral votes of arkansas not be counted because the persons certified by the secretary of state were not the persons elected as electors at the presidential election in november and that the returns were not certified according to law78 the senate agreed to the objections to exclude the vote from arkansas and while the house voted to accept the votes79 under the rule then in force the votes were not counted80 there were seven objections raised to counting the electoral votes of louisiana81 based on arguments that there was canvass and counting of the votes in louisiana that the certificate was not made according to law that electors were not chosen according to law which findings were arguably made earlier by the senate committee on privileges and elections82 both the house

houses of congress agreed to appoint members to commissi on to settle disputes over duplicate certificates received from several states84 the commission comprised five members of the house of

from any state objections were to be made in writing and then the question as to the validity of the returns was submitted to the commission the commission would make its decision on the returns and then report the decision to each house the two houses would then resume the joint session for the counting of electoral votes upon objection by at least five senators and five representatives the two houses could vote to exclude the electoral votes deemed valid by the commission if the two houses failed to concur in doing so the decision of the commission stood as reported florida conflicting certificates were received from florida and three objections were made an objection was made to the certificate signed by ml stearns as governor appointing electors for hayes the grounds for the objection were as follows 1 that the electors were not appointed as the legislature directed 2 that another set of electors were appointed as the legislature directed 3 that the manner of appointing the electors was by the votes of the qualified electors which gave title to another set of electors which could not be set aside by any other person 4 that the pretended certificate signed by m l stearns as governor was untrue and obtained by fraud and conspiracy and 5 was made out and executed in pursuance of the same fraudulent conspiracy 6 that the stearns certificate and lists if they ever had any validity were annulled by subsequent lawful certificate of the successor to governor stearns by act of the legislature declaring the other slate of electors valid85 further objection was made to single elector alleging that he should be disqualified because he held the office of united states shipping commissioner at the time of his alleged election as an elector86 an objection was also made to the certificates received from the attorney general and governor drew successor to governor stearns appointing electors for tilden on the grounds that they were not authenticate d properly and

commissioners had made wrong report had refused to receive competent and material evidence in support of the allegation that the four electors had been appointed fraudulently had refused to recognize the action of the courts or other departments of government of the state of florida tending to show that the stearns certificates were fraudulent and finally had violated the constitution of the

votes for hayes93 louisiana three certificates were received from the state of louisiana two appointing electors for hayes and one appointing electors for tilden94 an objection was raised to the two certificates certified by william p kellogg as governor appointing electors for hayes the objection stated that kellogg was not the lawful governor and the certificates were objectionable for the reasons that on november 7 1876 there was law of louisiana directing the manner of appointment of electors that the appointment of the electors certified by kellogg was fraudulent and that the electors certified by john mcenery the lawful governor of louisiana should be counted95 the objection also included references to specific electors who should be disqualified because they held office at the time of their election96 second objection was made to the certificates on the grounds that at the time of the election louisiana did not have republican form of government that there was

would not be counted until it was determined whether the counting or omitting to count such votes will essentially change the result of the election150 the tellers reported as follows the tellers report that the whole number of electors appointed to vote for president of the united states is 369 of which majority is 185 were the votes of electors of the state of georgia cast on the second wednesday of december 1880 being the eighth day of said month to be counted the result would be for james garfield of the states of ohio for president of the united states 214 votes and for winfield s hancock of the states of pennsylvania for president of the united states 155 votes if not counted the result would be for james garfield for president of the united states 214 votes and for winfield s hancock for president of the united states 144 votes in either event james garfield has received majority of the votes of the whole number of electors appointed151 the inference from the tellers statement as well as the chart published in the congressional record is that the whole number of electors would stay the same that is at the higher number of 369 of which 185 was the majority even if the votes from georgia were not counted but that in any event garfield would have received the majority of either number and thus was elected there was express indication in the record in 1881 that had the votes from georgia not counted the whole number and the majority of that number would have been reduced accordinglyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30769crs23 152 16 congressional record 1532 february
