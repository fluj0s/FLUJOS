report witness tampering 18 usc 1512 section 1512 applies to the obstruction of federal proceedings judicial congressi onal or executive it consists of four somewhat overlapping crimes use of force or the threat of the use of force to prevent the production of evidence 18 usc 1512a use of deception or corruption or intimidation to prevent the production of ev idence 18 usc 1512b destruction or concealment of evidence or attempts to do so 18 usc 1512c and witness harassment to prevent the producti on of evidence 18 usc 1512d obstruction by violence 18 usc 1512a subsection 1512a has slightly different elements depending upon whether the offense involves killing or attempted killing 18 usc 1512a1 or some other us of physical force or threat 18 usc 1512a2 in essence it condemns the use of violence to prevent witness fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22783crs2 1 18 usc 2 whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids abets counsels commands induces or procures its commission is punishable as principal b whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states is punishable as principal 2 18 usc 373b cb it is an affirmativ defense to prosecution under this section that under circumstances manifesting voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent the defendant prevented the commission of the cr ime solicited renunciation is not voluntary and complete if it is motivated in whole or in part by decision to postpone the commission oftestifying or producing evidence for an inve stigation and sets its penalties according to whether the obstructive violence was homicide an assault or threat auxiliary offenses and liability subsection 1512k ma kes conspiracy to violate section 1512 separate offense subject to the same penalties as the underlying offense the section serves as an alte rnative to prosecution under 18 usc 371 that outlaws conspiracy to violat any federal criminal statute section 371 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and conviction requires the government to prove the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the scheme by one of the conspirators subsection 1512k has specific overt act element and the courts have generally declined to imply one under such circumstan ces regardless of which section is invoked conspirators are criminally liable under the pinkerton doctrine for any crime committed in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy accomplices to violation of subsec tion 1512a may incur criminal liability by operation of 18 usc 2 3 4 or 373 as well section 2 treats accomplices before the fact as principals that is it declares that thos who command procure or aid and abet in the commission of federal crime by another are to be sentenced as if they committed the offense themselves1 as general rule in order to aid and abet another to commit crime it is necessary that defendant in some way associate himself with the venture that he participate in it as in something he wishes to bring about that he seek by his action to make it succeed it is also necessary to pr ove that someone else committed the underlying offense section 3 outlaws acting as an acce ssory after the fact which occurs when one knowing that an offense has been committed recei ves relieves comfor ts or assists the offender in order to hinder his or her appr ehension trial or punishment prosecution requires the commission of an underlying federa l crime by someone offenders face sentences set at one half of the sentence att ached to the underlying offense or if the underlying offense is punishable by life imp risonment or death by imprisonment for not more than 15 years and fine of not mo re than 250000 the elements of misprision of felony under 18 usc 4 are 1 the principal committed and completed the felony alleged 2 the defendant had full knowledge of that fact 3 th defendant failed to notify the authorities and 4 defendant took steps to conceal the crime the offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 3 years andor fine of not more than 250000 solicitation to commit an offense under subsection 1512a or any other crime of violence is proscribed in 18 usc 373 to establish solicitation under 373 the government must demonstrate that the defendant 1 had the intent for another to commit crime of violence and 2 solicited comma nded induced or otherwise endeavored to persuade such other person to commit the crime of violence unde r circumstances that strongly corroborate evidence of that intent section 373 provides an affirmative statutory defense for one who prevents the commission of the solicited offense2 offenders facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22783crs3 the crime until another time or to substitute anothe r victim or another but similar objective if the defendant raises the affirmative defense at tr ial the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by preponderance of the evidence c it is not defense to prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be conv icted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission because he was incompetent or irresponsible or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecutionpenalties set at one half of the sanctions for the underl ying offense but imprisonment for not more than 20 years if the solicited cr ime of violence is punishable by death or imprisonment for life subsection 1512a violation opens up the prospect of prosecution for other crimes for which viol ation of subsection 1512a may serve as an element the federal money laundering and racketeering statutes are perhaps the most prominent examples of these the racketeering statutes rico outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an inte rstate enterprise through pa ttern of predicate offenses section 1512 offenses are rico predicate offenses rico violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more that 20 years or imprisonment for life if the predicate offense carries such penalty fine of not mo re than 250000 and the c onfiscation of related property the money laundering provisions among other things prohibit financial transactions involving the proceeds of predi cate offense rico pr edicate offenses are by definition money laundering predicate ffenses money laundering is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years fi ne and the confiscati on of related property obstruction by intimidation threat s persuasion or deception 18 usc 1512b the second group of offenses w ithin section 1512 outlaws obstruction of federal congressional j udicial or administrative ac tivities by intimidation threat corrupt persuasion or deception in more ge neral terms subsec tion 1512b bans 1 knowingly 2 using one of the prohibited forms of persuasion intimidation threat misleading or corrupt persuasion 3 with th intent to prevent witnesss testimony or physical evidence from being truthfully presented at official federal proceedings or with the intent to prevent witn ess from cooperating with author ities in matter relating to federal offense it also bans any attempt to so intimidate threaten or corruptly persuade the conspiracy accomplice rico and money laundering attributes are equally applicable to subsection 1512b offenses obstruction by destruction of evidence or harassment 18 usc 1512c 1512d subsection 1512c proscribes obstr uction of official proceedings by destruction of evidence and is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years subsection 1512d outlaws hara ssing federal witn esses and is misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year both enjoy the conspiracy accomplice rico and money laundering ttributes that to apply to all section 1512 offenses obstructing federal courts 18 usc 1503 the omnibus provision unlike section 1512 section 1503 does not to pply to the obstruction of congressional or administrative proceedings it condemns obs tructing pending judicial proceedings for conviction the government mu st prove beyond reasonable doubt 1 that there was pending judicial proceeding 2 that the defendant knew this proceeding was pending and 3 that the defendant then corruptly end eavored to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice offenders are punished according to the nature of obstruction murder and mans laughter are punished as t hose crimes are punished whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22783crs4 committed in violation of sections 1111 and 1112 attempted murder attempted manslaughter or any violation involving ju ror called to hear case relating to class or b felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years and all other offenses by imprisonment for not more than 10 years conspiracy to violate section 1503 can only be prosecuted under the general conspi racy statute sec tion 1503 offenses are rico predicate offenses and consequently money laundering predi cate offenses those who aid and abet section 1503 offense are lia ble as principals and are punishable as if they committed the offense themselves an individual who knows that another has committed section 1503 offense nd nevertheless assists the ffender in order to hinder his capture trial or punishment is in turn puni shable as an accessory after the fact and an individual who affirmatively conceals the commission of section 1503 by another is guilty of misprision retaliating against federal witnesses 18 usc 1513 section 1513 prohibits witness or informant retaliation in the form of killing attemptin g to kill inflicting or threatening to inflict bodily injury damaging or threatening to damage property and conspiracies to do so it also prohibits economic reta liation against federal witnesses but only witnesses in court proceedings and onl on criminal cases its penalty structure is comparable to that of section 1503 section 1513 offenses are rico predicate offenses and money laundering pr edicate offenses nd the provisions for conspirators and accomplices apply as well obstructing congressional or admini strative proceedings 18 usc 1505 section 1505 outlaws obstructing cong ressional or federa l administrative proceedings crime punishable by imprisonmen t not more than 5 years not more than 8 years if the offense involves domestic or in ternational terrorism the crime has three essential elements first there must be proceeding pending before department or agency of the united states second the defendant must be aware of the pending proceeding third the defendant must have intentionally endeavored corruptly to influence obstruct or impede the pending proceeding section 1505 offenses are not rico or money laundering predicate offenses conspiracy to obstruct administrative or congressional proceedings may be prosecu ted under 18 usc 371 and the general aiding and abetting accessory after the fact and misprision statutes are likely to apply with equal force in the case of obstruction of an administrative or congressional proceeding conspiracy to obstruct to defraud 18 usc 371 section 371 contains both general conspiracy prohibition and specific obstruction conspiracy prohibition in the form of conspiracy to defraud pr oscription the elements of conspiracy to defraud the united states are 1 an agreem ent of two more individuals 2 to defraud the united states and 3 an overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the scheme the fraud covered by the statute reaches any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing obstructing or defeating the lawful functions of any depa rtment of government by deceit craft or trickery or at least by means that are dishonest the scheme may be designed to deprive the united states of mone or property but it need not be so plot calculated to frustrate the functions of governmental entity will suffice criminal contempt of court the final and oldest of the general obstruction provisions is contempt contem porary federal contempt deri ves from statute rule and inherent or auxiliary authority criminal contempt comes in two forms direct andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22783crs5 indirect direct contempt involves misconduct in the pr esence of the court and is punished to ensure the decorum of the cour t and the dignity of the bench indirect contempt consists of those obstructions committed outside the presence of the court direct contempt may be summarily punished indirect contempt may not court may punish as criminal contempt dis obedience or resistance to its lawful writ process order rule decree or command criminal contempt may be punished by imprisonment or by fine or both the sixth amendment right to jury trial limits the term of imprisonment which court may summarily impose to maximum of six months contempt of congress contempt of congress is punishable by statute and under the inherent powers of congress cong ress has not exercised its inherent contempt power for some time the statutory cont empt of congress provision 2 usc 192 outlaws the failure to obey congressional s ubpoena or the refusal to answer questioning at congressional hearing the offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year and fine of up to 100000 obstruction of justice by violence or threat several other federal statutes outlaw use of threats or violence to obstruct federal government activities one 18 usc 115 prohibits acts of violence against j udges jurors official s former officials and their families in order to impede or retaliate for the performance of their duties it makes assault kidnaping murder and attempts and conspiracies to commit such offenses in violation of the section subject to the penalties imposed for those crimes elsewhere in the code it makes threats to commit an ssault punishable by imprisonment for not more than 6 years and threats to commit any of th other offenses under the section punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years another 18 usc 1114 protects federal officers and employees as well as those assisting them from murder manslaughter and attempted murder and mans laughter committed during or account of the performance of their duties the sections coverage extends to government witne sses other provisions protect federal officers and employees from kidnaping and assault committed during or on account of the performance of their duties but their coverage of those assisting them is less clear beyond these general prohibiti ons federal law proscribes the murder kidnaping or assault of mbers of congress supreme court justices or cabinet secretaries and number of statutes outla w assaults on federal officers and employees responsible for the enforcement of partic ular federal statut and programs obstruction of justice by bribery 18 usc 201 section 201 outlaws offering or soliciting bribes or illegal gratu ities in connection with judicial congressional and administrative proceedings bribery is quid pro quo offense it condemns invitations and solicitations to corruption th penalty structure for bribery is fairly distinctive imprisonment for not more than 15 years fine of the greater of three times the amount of the bribe or 250000 and di squalification from holding any federal position of honor or trust thereafter mail and wire fraud the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes have been written and constructed with such sweep that they cover among other things obstruction of government activities by corruption they reach any scheme to obstruct the lawful functioning in the judicial legislative or ex ecutive branch of government that involves 1 the deprivation of money prope rty or honest services and 2 the use of the mail or wire communications as an integral part of sche congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 usc 1346 which defines the scheme tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22783crs6 defraud element in the fraud statutes to in clude scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest serv ices some courts have sa id that honest services fraud in the public sector typically occurs in either of two situations 1 bribery where public official was paid for particul ar decision or action or 2 fa ilure to disclose conflict of interest resulting in personal gain prosecutors may favor mail or wire fraud charge over or in addition to bribery charge if for the reason than that under both fraud sections offenders face imprisonment for not more than 20 years rather than the 15year maximum found in section 201 obstruction by extortion under color of official right 18 usc 1951 extortion under color of official right occurs when public offici receives payment to which he is not entitled knowing it is bein g provided in exchange for the performance of an official act liability may be incurred by public officers and employees those in the process of becoming public officers or empl oyees those who hold themselves out to be public officers or employees their cocons pirators or those who aid and abet public officers or employees in extortion under color or official right the payment need not have been solicited nor need the official act for which it is exchanged have been committed the prosecution must establish that the extortion obstructed delayed or affected interstate or foreign commerce but the impact need not have actually occurred nor been even potentially severe violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years obstruction of justice by destruction of evidence other than subsection 1512c there are three federal statutes which expressly outlaw the destruction of evidence in order to obstruct justice 18 u sc 1519 prohibits destruction of evidence in connection with federal i nvestigation or bankruptcy proceedings 18 usc 1520 prohibits destruction of corporate audit r ecords and 18 usc 2232a prohibits the destruction of property to prevent the g overnment from searching or seizing it obstruction of ju stice by deception in addition to the obstruction of justi ce provisions of 18 usc 1503 and 1512 there are four other general statutes that ou tlaw obstructing the gove rnments business by deception three involve perjury 18 us c 1623 that outlaws false swearing before federal courts and grand ju ries 18 usc 1621 the older and more general prohibition that proscribes false swearing in federal official matters judicial legislative or administrative and 18 usc 1622 that conde mns subornation that is inducing another to commit perjury the fourth 18 usc 1001 proscribes materi false statements concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of federal executive branch agency and to somewhat more limited extent with the jurisdiction of the federal courts or congressional entity
