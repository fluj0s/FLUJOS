usbacked south vietnam in 1975 us vietnam relations remained essentially frozen until the mid1990s since then bilateral ties have expanded remarkably to the point where the relationship has been virtually normalized indeed since 2002 overlapping strategic and economic interests have compelled the united states and vietnam to improve relations across wide spectrum of issues congress played significant role in the normalization process and continues to influence the state of bilateral relations v oices favoring improved relations have included those reflecting us business interests in vietnams reforming economy and us strategic interests in expanding cooperation with populous countryvietnam has over 85 million peoplethat has an ambivalent relationship with china others argue that improvements in bilateral relations should be conditioned upon vietnams authoritarian government improving its record on human rights the population of over 1 million vietnamese americans as well as legacies of the vietnam war also drive continued us interest economic ties are the most mature aspect of the bilateral relationship the united states is vietnams largest export market the final step toward full economic normalization was accomplished in december 2006 when congress passed and president bush signed hr 6111 pl 109432 extending permanent normal trade relations pntr status to vietnam for years the united states has supported vietnams marketoriented economic reforms which many credit with vietnams extraordinary economic performance from 19872007 annual gross domestic product gdp growth has averaged over 7 si nce the early 1990s poverty levels have been halved to less than 30 in 2008 the two countrie s launched bilateral investment treaty bit talks and the bush administration announced that it would explore whether to add vietnam to the generalized system of payments gsp program which extends dutyfree treatment to certain products that are imported from designated developing countries since 2002 the united states and vietnam have expanded political and security ties symbolized by reciprocal summits that have been held annually since 2005 vietnam is one of the largest recipients of us assistance in east asia estimated us aid in fy2008 surpassed 100 million much of it for healthrelated activities in september 2007 the house passed the vietnam human rights act hr 3096 which would freeze some nonhumanitarian us assistance programs at existing levels if vietnam does not improve its human rights situation since 2006 arrests of dissidents and other developments have increased concerns about human rights vietnamese leaders have sought to upgrade relations with the united states due in part to worries about chinas expanding influence in southeast asia and the desire for continued us support for their economic reforms many argue however that there is little evidence that hanoi seeks to balance beijings rising power also some vietnamese remain suspicious that the united states longterm goal is to end the vietnamese communist partys monopoly on power through peaceful evolution strategy

2007 vietnams economy has been buffeted by economic difficulties that have increased social strife and raised concerns about the countrys economic stability in 2007 and the first half of 2008 the country experienced soaring inflation and acute downward pressure on the countrys currency the dong the problems caused by inflation were particularly onerous as the prices of some food items rose by over 50 leading workers in number of factories to go on strike demanding higher wages although the increase in the inflation rate has halted and perhaps reversed the yearonyear rise in prices is still over 20 it was 267 in october some economists have said vietnams stilldeveloping institutional and financial infrastructure has contributed to or even caused many of the problems vietnams growing trade and budget deficits continue to cause concern including among credit agencies which in 2008 have downgraded the outlook on vietnams sovereign rating from stable to negative although restrictions on international financial transactions have limited vietnams direct exposure to the global financial and credit crises the secondary effects have created new pressures on vietnam which is heavily dependent on trade and foreign direct investment inflows some selected figures illustrate vietnams vuln erability to the global slowdown and collapse in commodity prices exports are equivalent to 80 of gdp about 60 of vietnamese exports go to the united states the european union and japan and oil revenue accounts for 30 of the governments revenue 6 for 2008 gdp growth is expected to be just over

for the vcp and the government to maintain social stability to spur economic growth the vietnamese government took number of steps in the fall and winter of 2008 including announcing 6 billion stimulus package lowering some corporate tax rates cutting interest rates and allowing the dong to depreciate against the us dollar in march 2008 vietnam the worlds secondlargest exporter of rice imposed restrictions on rice exports in order to lower prices in its domestic market the us secretary of agriculture criticized this move by vietnam and other commodity exporters saying they were

have seen signs that prime minister dung and other reformminded leaders are losing ground in the ongoing battles they reputedly have with more conservative minded officials9 the reformers are generally thought to have been ascendant since 2000 when prolonged logjam over the future of economic reform was broken in favor of new consensus to deepen vietnams integration with the global economy and to push through new series of marketoriented economic reforms 10 additionally the ascendancy of the reformers has coincided with hanois moves to upgrade relations with the united states its increased willingness to discuss human rights disagreements its loosening of restrictions on the vietnamese press and its more aggressive drive to root out corruption which the vietnamese communist party vcp sees as one of the greatest threats to its legitimacy among the indicators that the conservatives may be pushing back the arrest and sentencing of thanh nien journalist nguyen viet chien for abusing his position by reporting on corruption at high levels in the government decision by the 160person vcp central committee in may 2008 to give greater authority over the economy to the 14member politburo presumably diminishing the prime ministers role and an escalating land dispute between the catholic archdiocese of hanoi and the hanoi peoples committee hanois communist party organ in which the hanoi authorities have broken up sitins by catholics protesting the citys plans to redevelop land that the church was forced to turn over to the government decades ago 11 much of the western speculation has pitted the reportedly growthoriented dung against the more conservative vcp general secretary nong duc manh who may place higher priority on social and political stability

vietnam is oneparty authoritarian state ruled by the vietnamese communist party vcp for the past several years the vcp appears to have followed strategy of permitting most forms of personal and

generating interest in the relationship include growing trade and investment flows the large ethnic vietnamese community in the united states the legacy of the vietnam war increasing interaction through multilateral institutions and shared concern over the rising strength of china us goals with respect to vietnam include developing more amicable relations bringing the country more into the mainstream of nations opening markets for us trade and investment furthering human rights and democracy within the country and maintaining us influence in southeast asia the array of policy instruments the united states employs in relations with vietnam includes trade incentives foreign assistance cooperation in international organizations diplomatic pressures and educational outreach

reforms 2 pursue good relations with southeast asian neighbors that provide vietnam with economic partners and diplomatic friends and 3 repair and deepen its relationship with china while simultaneously buttressing this by seeking great power counterweight to chinese ambition 16 there are number of strategic and tactical reasons behind vietnams efforts to upgrade its relationship with the united states some speculate that vietnamese policymakers seek counterweights to chinese ambitions in southeast asia vietnam also needs favorable international economic environmentfor which it sees us support as criticalto enable the countrys economy to continue to expand additionally the vietnamese undoubtedly hoped to smooth the way for president bushs trip to hanoi in 2006 when vietnam

vietnam joined the wto in january 2007 the 20052006 period also marked time of positive bilateral discussions of human rights issues ultimately the pace and extent of the improvement in bilateral relations likely is limited by several factors including hanois concerns about upsetting beijing us scrutiny of vietnams human rights record vietnamese conservatives hi storical wariness of working

from august 1991 to december 1992 in early 1993 the committee issued its report which concluded that there was compelling evidence that pows were alive after the us withdrawal from vietnam and that although there was conspiracy in washington to cover up live pows the us government had seriously neglected and mismanaged the issue particularly in the 1970s the committees televised hearings

subject to annual presidential and congressional review under the us trade act of 1974s jacksonvanik provisions which govern trade with nonmarket economies20 the decision to extend pntr status to vietnam was debated in the context of vietnams bid to enter the world trade organization wto which occurred in january 2007 under wto rules it was necessary for the united states to extend pntr in order for it to enjoy the benefits of the trade concessions that vietnam grants to all wto members the united states was major player in vietnams accession process hanois bilateral wto accession agreement with washington was the lastand according to most observers the most difficultof the 28 bilateral agreements vietnam completed vietnams entry into the wto did not establish any new obligations on the part of the united states only on the part of vietnam however vietnams accession to the wto requires the united states and vietnam to adhere to wto rules in their bilateral trade relations including not imposing unilateral measures such as quotas on textile imports that have not been sanctioned by the wto 21 thus vietnams accession required the united states to terminate the

has cracked down harshly on anti government activity as shown by the wave of arrests of political dissidents in the winter and spring of 2007 see below in another recent case during the summer of 2007 monthlong protest in ho chi minh city by farmers complain ing about allegedly improper seizures of their land was broken up by authorities after the protestors began attracting the support of some political dissidents the government also has periodically targeted various ethnic minority gr oups most prominently the montagnards in the countrys central highlands where clashes between protestors and government security forces have flared periodically since 2001 furthermore in its effort to control the internet the central government has stepped up repression of socalled cyber dissidents for alleged offenses such as critic izing the signing of landborder agreements with china and calling for greater political accountability and political competition after the united states and vietnam reestablished relations in the mid1990s the clinton and early bush administrations generally appeared to assign human rights including religious freedom lower priority than improving economic ties and securing full accounting for us personnel listed as prisoners of warmissing in action powmias in 2003 the bush administration began to take more assertive position after determining that the previous approach had yet to translate the increased recognition of problems into tangible steps to improve the human rights situation32 the administration chose not to hold human rights dialogue with vietnam in 2003 and 2004 and in 2004 designated vietnam as country of particular concern cpc in the state departments international religious freedom report in 2006 citing many positive steps taken by the vietnamese government the state department lifted the cpc designation for vietnam since 2004 according to several reports there have been indications that human rights conditions have improved for most vietnamese including those in the central highlands and northwest highlands regions but given continued reports of repression and harassment there is considerable disagreement about how significant and how pervasive the improvements are not to mention how lasting they will be for years the state department and the us agency for international development usaid have discussed ways to take advantage of the vietnamese governments new approach toward ethnic minority areas by crafting smallscale aid initiative in the central highlands33 both agencies are acting in response to the

appeared and publicly called for peaceful democratic change the government responded by arresting many participants with estimates of the number ranging from dozens to hundreds the arrests which appear to have peaked between march and april 2007 may have been part of strategy to decapitate the dissident organizations some of which have connections to vietnamese americans it is unclear how much support these groups have within the broader population or to what extent the groups reflect and influence ongoing debates that are believed to be taking place within the vcp according to some

permission to do so meaning that these groups activities technically are illegal the state departments 2004 designation of vietnam as cpc principally was because of reports of worsening harassment of certain ethnic minority protestants and buddhists when the vietnamese responded by negotiating with the bush administration and adopting internal changes the two sides reached an agreement on religious freedom in which hanoi agreed to take steps to improve conditions for people of faith particularly in the central highlands the may 2005 agreement enabled vietnam to avoid punitive consequences such as sanctions associated with its cpc designation the agreement was faulted by human rights groups on number of grounds including the charge that religious persecution continues in the central highlands vietnam was redesignated cpc in the 2005 and 2006 religious freedom reports in november 2006 the state department announced that because of many positive steps taken by the vietnamese government since 2004 the c ountry was longer severe violator of religious freedom and had been removed from the cpc list the announcement which came two days before president bush was due to depart to hanoi for the apec summit cited dramatic decline in forced renunciations of faith the release of religious prisoners an expansion of freedom to organize by many religious groups and the issuance of new laws and regulations and stepped up enforcement mechanisms over the course of 2006 as part of the bilateral usvietnam human rights dialogue vietnam released number of prominent dissidents the bush administration had identified as prisoners of concern vietnam also reportedly told the united states that it would repeal its administrative decree allowing detention without trial the us committee on international religious freedom among others has disputed the administrations factual basis of the decision to remove vietnam from the cpc list arguing that abuses continue and that lifting the cpc label removes an incent ive for vietnam to make further improvements 34 blumenauer quits the us vietnam caucus oregonlivecom may 27 2007

earlier in the decade attempts have been made since the 107th congress to link us aid to the human rights situation in vietnam number of measures entitled the vietnam human rights act have been introduced with most proposing to cap existing nonhumanitarian us assistance programs to the vietnamese government at existing levels fy2007 in the case of the most recent version of the bill hr 3096 if the president does not certify that vietnam is making substantial progress in human rights 35 hr 3096 would grant the president national interest waiver that allows him to exempt any programs that are deemed to promote th goals of the act andor to be in the national interests of the united states in addition to the aid cap the bill would require the executive branch to produce annual reports on vietnams human rights situation and would authorize funds to promote democracy in vietnam and to overco the jamming of radio free asia proponents of the vietnam human rights act argue that additional pressure should be placed on the vietnamese government to improve its human rights record critics have argued that the bill could chill the recent warming of bilateral political and security ties and could weaken vietnamese economic reformers in ongoing domestic battles inside vietnam in effect hr 3096 establishes twopart test for determining whether us assistance programs would be covered by the cap 1 does the program constitute aid provided to the vietnamese government as opposed to the private sector and nongovernmental organizations 2 does the program constitute nonhumanitarian aid the act defines nonhumanitarian assistance as sales or financing under the arms export control act and any assistance under the foreign assistance act of 1961 exceptions are explicitly made for disaster relief food aid refugee assistance and hivaids assistance under these conditions it ppears that for fy2007 us aid programs that would be frozen by hr 3096s provisions appear to total less than 20 million and probably total less than 10 million many of the existing us militarytomilitary programs with vietnam such as the imet program would be frozen at july 31 2007 markup session the house foreign affairs committee reported favorably hr 3096 to the full house by voice vote the action was taken after the bill was amended as introduced the bill would have prohibited nonhumanitarian assistance to the vietnamese government unless human rights policy changes were made the amended version which the house passed on september 18 2007 4143 roll 877 softened this provision to freeze the bill has not seen action in the senate in october 2008 an alternative vietnam human rights act s 3678 was submitted in the senate it would prohibit increases in many forms of us nonhumanitarian assistance to vietnam unless such increases are matched by additional funding for human rights programming or b vietnams human rights cond itions are certified as improving like hr 3096 s 3678 would

foreign executives on corruption in various countries under manhs leadership the government appears to have attacked corruption in much more systemic fashion than in the past including passage in november 2005 of new anticorruption law that aims at increasing government transparency however pervasive and highlevel corruption is widely considered to be endemic as revealed by the breaking of
