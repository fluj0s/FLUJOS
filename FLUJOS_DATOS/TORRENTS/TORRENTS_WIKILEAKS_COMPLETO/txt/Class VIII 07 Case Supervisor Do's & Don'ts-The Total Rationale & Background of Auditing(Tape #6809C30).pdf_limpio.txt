6809c30 class viii tape 7 case supervisor dos and donts the total rationale and background of auditing thank you very much and what lecture number is this seven thats right we can still count and what is the date thirty of september 1968 nobody in the sea org can ever remember day by the way our weeks go round and round and round and we can always tell you the date but seldom the day we have to go look for an almanac well very good where we got to the other evening on processing processing in england we have to give this in both accents dont you see fortunately i dont have to give these lectures in french fellow came along side the ship today and asked if he could come aboard for five minutes in french and i told him je pc pc go very handy thats the totality of my french it means i dont speak french and then it adds the colloquialism at all well anyway we we got up to the line where we had some processes or processes as distinct from the subject right and i feel very good today because i ive actually had some good wins the provisional viiis were busy auditing in sea org qual today and they were going down the line with tremendous pocketapocketapocketa and making mince meat out of cases left right and center and doing very beautiful job of it i shouldnt have this but in the sea org qual there were student folders to amount to anything there was just one i think and the student got away with it the standard line was just pocketapocketapocketa anyway the goal line running very nicely now theres piece of line although im going to talk to you about processes im going to talk to you about what you have to do to keep line in case supervisor must not operate by talking to the auditor or talking to the preclear his folders before they come to him must go through an examiner and after the session must go through an examiner so theres an examiner bit form an examiner form in the folder before he does his cs every time and theres an examiner form in the folder after the session this way you cut down the misses now today there was fantastic number of cases very large number of cases audited probably the output of saint hill hgc london hgc angeles hgc went through the hands big quantity went through the hands of sea org qual today done by two auditors the difference between standard tech and hunt and punch you know the hunt and punch on the typewriter it makes difference and in three of these cases it was possible because the examiner line was in and in very nicely and smoothly all the examiner ever does you see is just put the pc on the cans or the preot on the cans record the needle marks whether its before session or after session examiner form records the state of the needle the position of the ta and what the pc says and thats all he writes that down well in three out of very large stack of folders the pc in actual fact had been audited over ptp in three of them which is caught by the examiner although the rudiments were flown although the pcs indicators seemed to be in although it all seemed well at the end of session between the time of the student leaving the session which must have been minutes at the very longest and his reporting to the examiner why his needle slowed down and his ta went up little bit cause he was audited over present time problem and then from his comment of course it was obvious that he was audited over problem he could also have been audited over other things and his comment would have reflected this dont you see so it is very simple the pc says something like oh well that was great review session that was fine review session except of course it didnt handle what i came in to have handled or he says something like this you know and you know at that moment that he has something he thinks should be handled see which is some peculiar thing hes got three legs or something in his estimation and it is simply wideopen invitation to get case supervisor or somebody to fall on his head see or for the auditor to fall on his head but the usual is done but in this particular instant why the auditor was actually able to fly the needle on rudiments while the fellow was sitting there with hidden standard or ptp dont you see all of which is very very easy this is very easy to detect this from his attitude from the fact that the end of the session to the examiner something happened to the fn do you see something happened to the ta it would also detect false report on the part of the auditor in this case there were false reports involved there was simply the pcs comment was well you know to this effect it was great session and i feel much better you know but it didnt handle what i came in to have handled or something of this sort you see and you just detect from these facts that something is out now you know something is out but you also have detected slightly resistive pc and what the hell is this he goes in to sessions he gets an fn but it doesnt hold aha aha aha now its explained why this fellow was three months on ot2 dont you see now its explained why he has review folder eight inches thick see it all goes together see and you got review folder eight inches thick hes got hes got something out he has been audited over out ruds or he has been this or he has been that well theres several things which case supervisor can do at this moment and which the auditor then does several things one he can get an assessment of the seven types of cases now he can find out what is wrong now of course if the auditor is an eager beaver and goes and flies all of these now he makes it difficult to run chain because it is past an fn already you see what i mean cause all hes done is key out former therapy see well thats gonna key in right away but now hes put an fn in the road an fn to that degree is in the road what you want is strike or bd do you see just want to assess this thing you dont you dont assess this conversationally you merely make the statement and make the strike the pcs itsa it doesnt exist dont you see now youve got it now youve got it you can put in an rfactor say im going to do an assessment here to assist case supervision and you dont have to say anything im just going to go over this browbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowbow teyowbowdow teyowbowbow bd mwumewmempow pop very good thank you very much now of course the second examiner report isnt going to tell you very much because the pc says well i came all the way over here just to get this fellow sittin here and saying something to but he may be very obliging and get something out of it but that isnt the point you want to find what you are going to blast down on to make this cease to be resistive case and now you put together the standard action for that particular case you dont just fly it with itsa see you do something former therapies man lets get these things listed within an inch of their lives do you follow lets get these former therapies lets find out all about that lets find out theradies similar to them in the past lets find out the thing misunderstood in those earlier therapies lets get this out of the line up alright now physical illness weve got to determine how ill if hes quite ill and so on were not going to audit him at all were not going to audit him thats all until we get some advises on the subject of his physical condition now it doesnt mean that if hes physically ill he has to be turned over inevitably and forever to the mo the medical officer you see but it does mean it does mean very definitely that this is an outness and that we are auditing uphill because physical illness makes such severe ptp that it physiologically has to get some point of resolution oddly enough there are things you can do to knock out physical illness there are quite few things that you can do to knock out physical illness most of them are under the heading of secondaries and engram running and now again were not knocking about running an engram by saying do you have an engram good thats floating needle thank you crap what happened to the auditor who could run engrams you see im sure this will go out im sure this will go out time and time again that somebody will come around and say oh we never run engrams by chains anymore thats old hat you might as well say well auditing is old hat its hot fast precise operation now you can solve physiological illness on the basis of engram running very simply very easily you actually can solve physiological illness not by auditing against the specific but simply by running the chain which is offering itself to be audited not by doing recall release of it lets get rid of this damn thing see there is will be some chain in restimulation im not going into the vast difficulties of how you find this and so forth and im not laying you out rote process im trying to talk to you about the theory of what you do well what do you know its elementary in actual fact but the physical illness the fellow has is on the engram chain in which he is sitting now as you look at this from diagnostic point of view it wont make any sense at all if you try to figure out what engram chain hes sitting in he is sitting in the engram chain which is giving him the illness this is too simple dont you see hes manifesting the chain hes sitting in now the point is is his reality up to running it now trying to run chain of secondaries on somebody just that action trying to run chain of secondaries on somebody your liable to get into something that is quite hot in order to put the pc down the track into this chain of secondaries it is it just he just flies out of it the charge its too charged an area yet you can find chain that the person is sitting in of secondaries and he sort of goes down the track and hell come back us the track to the one that was too hot to handle he inevitably is sitting in what is wrong with him you see one of these wild things now ill give you one of these terribly difficult case supervisor problems you have difficulty with case in auditing the case somebody missed on 5a miss on 5a is quite catastrophic you miss on 5a your guy will probably wind up in ethics or blowing and so forth within about 48 hours its the most positive thing you ever hear of you run 5a wrong bongo its quite something because its very powerful process you see so you run weak process wrong and it wont do very much to the pc but you run powerful process wrong and god help you alright fellow walks in his 5a was out but the examiner was clever enough to notice and put small note on the end of the examination because the examiner also also can make some remark that the case supervise the examiner doesnt say anything he doesnt say anything to the pc but he can tell the cs any damn thing he wants to as note on his report form like pc came in in wheel chair you know of some interest sometimes youll hear this resounding name george alouicious gulch and it really sounds like something and so on and its little kid five years old see and so your case supervision is affected by this because you would tell the auditor to simplify the auditing command and you might even simplify the auditing command for the auditor do you follow just so it communicates oddly enough though we are auditing currently i think an eight year old and were auditing him with the full business he apparently understands it all and the funny part of it is before level 0 was run he couldnt talk english its all very mysterious people had to sort of pidgin english you know anything that was done all of sudden they ran 0 and well what arc break what major change occurred in your lifetime dadadada yoppitybopbopbop deya bababa and the thing of this is its the most adult session you ever saw in your life its the funny the early part of the folder you see is is kiddiewiddie makey signie you know and the suddenly level 0 and beyond there its certain they ran an awfully good level 0 so anyway the essence of the thing in this particular instance fellow walked in he had two wrong 5a items so just as bonus the case supervisor noticed that he had very bad burn on his arm so i simply told the auditor to run the engram chain of the burn on his arm hed just burned his arm so obviously he was sitting in it and in addition to wrong power so we corrected the power found the ran the burn and ran it in chain and wound up to the case complication of what made him blow see when 5a went out he apparently burned his arm also so he got back to sort of service fac thing ran the engram down the chain to period of about six years ago which possibly was when he started blowing interesting alright now he is sitting in the engram which is affecting him physiologically now theres several ways to go about this sort of thing if fellows on ot 3 what do you do you run down his present life and he cant couldnt find any and had one body thetan or something stupid like that and you just find the this lifetime injury hes naturally mushed it all together find this lifetime injury and ta or ta meter read or meter read to hell with it push him into it make him run it run him on down the track and run an incident 1 itll go straight to incident 1 and itll go long fall bd long fall bd bowbowbowbow now the pc if hes very status happy or something is liable to come out of this explaining how this has nothing to do with him and that there wasnt anything there anyhow and that there wasnt anything there anyhow and so on his reality level isnt up to it his grades actually were never run you can just keep up this process and all of sudden his reality level hey wait minute how can i keep running that same incident only its different incident every time and i only had one and ive now run three i dont get any pictures because when i went clear i ceased to mock up pictures but i got these pictures is there some possibility i am haunted now itd be lead pipe cinch to take care of this physiological psycho somatic illness on somebody with an unflat 3 but i can expect over the years that all sorts of oddities and peculiarities will become invented as they have in the immediate past so that the method of finding body thetans consists of getting him to scan over his body scan over his body scan over his body and scan on the right side of his body the left side of his body top of his body bottom of his body and nothing reads so he doesnt have any body thetans i dont know who the hell invented that but it walked in sideways and became standard operating procedure it isnt its for the birds now as you run pc on this this is review approach to bird who cant manage 3 youve got to be sure that his grades were actually run now thats thats important the rehab of his grades before you start anything like this that brings his reality up the amount of charge off is proportional to the reality of the pc so get the charge off whenever you can however you can run some chains of this particular character of one kind and another kind and there it is the pc is liable to keep on explaining to you how its all physiological and he ought to be have his head cut off in surgery or something actually the bird is dramatizing r6 which is full of medical doctors and they carve away on body and oh man the body finally comes down to nothing but raw meat and then skeleton and the doctors are all so pleased you know just like they look you know that is actually totally in r6 part of the 35 and three quarter day implant which is all pictures you normally dont get to this section of it because i have moved you up to the beginning of it and it all goes pfffet you dont get full dress rehearsal of this if you did god help you its killer youd only get it by dropping into the middle of it but every once in while you have the body thetan of space man standing up on top of cliff and jumping down and jumping up again or you have an odd picture womans head in pit with little baby along side the head these these are r6 pictures and theres just tons of them theres actually thousands of them and this type of odd picture shows up something like this well actually you try to run this too much on well the the guy who hasnt been up through the grades doesnt have enough charge off to see em anyhow he can be the effect of them but he doesnt have enough charge off to see em do you see he can sort of have it all keyed in but hes not really there and hes not looking at the picture so you normally can run these fellows perfectly safely now if you really knew all there was to know about everything under the sun moon and stars in the way of pictures in the bank you dont have to be an expert this way fortunately but you would recognize something about it actually you can recognize it very easily by dating it the date of r6 is seventy five million years ago so you just say this stuck pictures at seventy it seems to you that it might be something at seventy five million years ago if it is why somethingll happen and if it isnt you wouldnt get read on the meter if it is and its some other date why great but that would be little bit tricky to fool with because its thirty five and three quarter day engram duration actually the duration can be much longer in the matter of duress so its bit touchy but the probability is of it being in restimulation is very poor but the fellow can be the effect of it for instance there is cyclical illness which is dictated in the various r6 implants fellow was forced to get sick at the age of five followed multiples of five and hes supposed to get sick from this and from that and from the other thing measles and you know hes supposed to have and thats certain they predict his health in other words when hes fifty hes supposed to something or other what theyre trying to do is make body cave in see problem r6 was trying to solve was overpopulation with some 250 billion inhabitants on this planet the average through this federation was 178 billion hundred and seventh eight billion beings per planet they didnt eat very much they werent badly keyed in but they reproduced too badly and somebody thought he had this as problem so he tried to cut out the whole population naturally what he struck at was the second dynamic so where you see aberrated second dynamic youre looking straight at r6 aberrated second dynamic youre looking at the pc having gone through r6 or body thetans through r6 second dynamic exaggeration of great aberration on overindulgence of so forth youre just looking at r6 now running engrams can run into this zone or area but the probability of them doing so person who doesnt have enough charge off to do so is very remote now the incident in common to all thetans body thetans all kinds of thetans as thetantype thetan is of course the incident 1 and when you clip the 1 that separates them out from the mass every time but sometimes up the line they get impacted together on some other type of incident it can be quite deadly actually occasionally because cluster of them exerting pressure and so on can really knock somebodys block off but theres something else that isnt totally understood about this by auditors and that is simply this that is doesnt have to be cluster to knock your block off it can be just one and then you get the phenomenon run this little tiny body thetan he turns out to be great big body thetan very fascinating but people who are below 3 of course have all the phenomena of body thetans now if you were red hot in running engrams however you would move your pc on down the track into something he could run so therefore if you are very very good and you are very hot on the subject of engrams engram running and so on all you have to know is that if it goes more solid you go earlier to similar incident now i show you how you can really goof on this going earlier to similar incident you can start taking him down chain of head injuries and he dives sideways into being spanked and all of sudden youre running chain of spanks and you get an fn on spanked and say well that finished the head injuries so therefore i nuts head injuries arent flat you have to go back and pick up that then the other thing is the criterion of when to stop running an engram and go earlier is not new material i dont know who sold people on this new material thats just one of the junior indicators new material shows up its real engram and its running but thats junior indicator its not going to hurt the pc if new material shows up you run the engram until the guy comes uptone or goes fn it is whether or not whether or not the thing goes solid now look if its going solid hes running it disowned its body thetans incident that hes running so you get the hell out of there boy and go earlier and sooner or later youre going to pick up one of his own you get the idea and all of sudden the thing will go fn because he separates out from the body thetan dont you see so this is the criteria on which you judge the running of engrams dont think that person got body thetans just because he got to section 3 hes had em the whole way now this funny business can show up the guy has been out of valence all the way from arc straightwire straight on through to the end of ot2 and when you get him on 3 he can be sitting there bright eyed without single damned grade run all the grades have been run on bthetans thats possible it isnt general but it is possible so sometimes when you find somebody on 4 that you cant rehab anything on it isnt necessarily true that it didnt fn at the time theres fn now because that guy isnt there anymore now you get this odd phenomena what the hell do you do well the ruds were out and lot of other things must have been out to keep him driven out of valence during that period but of course the person the ruds were out on at that time probably isnt there anymore anyhow so the best thing about it is is to detect it and you take your life in your hands is it gonna be an overrun or is it going to be the original run but that which you cannot rehab to fn has not gone fn that which you cannot rehab to fn has not gone fn it after all of your trials and everything and running your session with ruds very definitely in all of this all the way down the line if you still cant get an fn it never did have an fn but this is validity which occurs mainly after section 3 is flat the greatest validity of that remark is after section 3 is flat now you get this crazy combination could theoretically occur the grade was run on him he hits 3 he goes out of valence and youre trying to rehab it on body thetan which he didnt get rid of which you get the crazy combinations but in all such cases this is matter of charge in all such cases this is matter of charge its charged case the case is too heavily charged in order to approach any part of reality and so he cant get reality on body thetans he cant do this he cant do that he will natter and talk about well it seems real to him and do you really mean valences and you know there couldnt be such thing as this and so on well hes not necessarily cluster but the probability is that hes out of valence the probability is that he has had very severe this lifetime injury which has driven him altogether into one piece the action involved is great i mean it you pick up an incident to run it on this fellow when dropped penny on his little finger and thats not the kind of incident you dont necessarily rule out operations but how savage an operation see how much how much stuff how how violent was this thing how long was he under anaesthesia you know thats the sort of thing that youre asking you want severe engram and an auditor who has hard time confronting also has hard time asking for real smashers very often they sort of detour themselves you know they say to the fellow now do you have very severe injury on the track someplace or another and the fellow says severe injury well yes i did have i had an automobile accident and i once dropped box on my toe well well take up this box on your toe that auditors sitting in an automobile accident of his own automobile accidents are rather to be very serious to run because theres automobile train accidents like crazy in r6 they have lots of automobile accidents and trains running through it and more automobile accidents and helicopter crashes and theres lots of accidents so these things are liable to be hung up through r6 so you dont run this type of incident therefore the available charge on the case is of vast importance to you as an auditor how much charge can you find on the case and where do you follow now you get so fascinated with fns that when case is quite very resistive you want to find an area which will audit for while without fning see i love goodol nine hour run on an engram see now lets lets weve the pc the pc has got an engram chain that goes down to having been medico in ancient egypt and hes got all the overts on the line of killing pcs or something of this sort or killing anybody who came in cause they did mental consultation they werent pcs they were pdeads predeads boy cause they had the right to kill so alright what do we do what do we do here well lets run it lets get down that chain lets get down that chain lets release this area but lets release it by erasure see now maybe theres something earlier than where itll eventually go fn but weve gotten charge off the case you understand charge off the case now dont pull gag like this as the cs says find this is an important operation see because its hungup 3 is what youre solving here guys all hung up in 3 he didnt find any and hes got psycho somatic illnesses and he sneezes and goes hu am hm all the time but he didnt find anything in i and so on and yea yea alright well you get something like this dont you see and the case supervisor says find this lifetime injury by which he means an injury not by dropping pin on his fingernail and he prefers an injury to an operation because an operation is liable to take him straight back into r6 an automobile accidents liable to take him back there too and so on so if its just good wholesome injury you know somebody dropped safe on his head or something like that and we run this and we dont much care at the moment its happening and we begin this operation the case which has the smallest amount of reality when we begin this operation we dont much care if theres any needle or tone arm action to amount to anything were gonna run it its gonna get more solid cause were running bthetan see and were gonna run it and so on and then soon as he detects it more solid just find an earlier similar incident now you as an auditor can goof you can go over into some other chain your own confront goes down and you say this is too damn gruesome blood spattering all over the place and the pc is sitting there sort of nattering and you find an earlier similar incident now you want similar similar incident earlier now you can run this back life after life after life actually one of these is very likely to wind up 750 trillion years ago now we dont care where it goes thats not your purpose you just want the earlier similar incident see now when you finally get this earlier similar incident that blows to fn it will blow him out of all of the bthetan crisscross see its very neat operation and then you right away run an incident 1 got it and very possibly his reality will still be so damn bad that he will you know he sits there the meter blows up you know long falls blow downs latibowsee all the rest of it thats just great and hell come up to say well that didnt do anything and the terrible draft thats all just awfull bad you know and so on yap yap yap yap yap see you dont care anything about that lets find another type of accident or just ask for another incident 1 do you see if incident 1 didnt fn that time ask for another incident 1 now in this way by finding these various chains and going down them you are actually running an unlimited method of releasing charge off case it fns on chain by erasure well you obviously cant do anything but plow him in if you run more on that particular chain now by chain similar incident its having safes dropped on his head that is the chain which can go into having objects dropped on his head but thats the chain its chain of objects dropped on his head now objects blowing him up or dropped on his foot is another chain now you can erase that to fn too do you follow so its the number of incident 1s that you can run in the final analysis cause thats the key charge and all of sudden this fellow says wait minute now you can do all kinds of goofy things lot of goofiness can come in people can come in and say the right way to find body thetan is to have the individual scan his hands or wahwhehwo or person with lots of body thetans has needle which hiccups or something you know poof poof poof poof poof thats its just dont buy any of those things see what im telling you here is the straight dope you want to go down the chain that you start out on until you get down to some area that will run run it to fn dive down the bank with the guy and run an incident l when youve got the incident 1 run and it didnt fn bongobingo try to find another incident 1 run it and another one and run it and another one and run it and just have yourself just little old ball now if you dont know this about engrams you might as well quit it is the earliest incident of the engram which holds the remainder of the engram in place so you can start late in the engram and it doesnt give ta action or erase you can start late in secondary now ill give you an idea of how do you start late in secondary you try to run the secondary out of the fellow of his house being foreclosed and its all taken away from him and for some peculiar reason best known to man or beast it just doesnt run it goes more solid faster than it should well as an auditor you ought to have some psychiatric treatment because youve disobeyed the first law the first law of anything is the first inkling of anything the first incident the first the first the first the first part of the first you get it theres not only the first or the earlier but the first part of the first you understand you want the instant he first had an inkling that he was going to lose his house and you will find more lousy incidents running than you can shake stick at another thing is an incident that is running eventually doesnt change its material but comes uptone so if you use the criteria that the material didnt change in the incident and therefore the incident is unerasable i dont know where that came from either that is just beyond the only its almost casual statement in old dianetic running and that is simply this that the earlier the incident the earlier the incident the more basic charge flies off the later incident you see that early charge ooh boy is that important see its the quality of the charge now and the earlier the charge is the more quality it has see although you can say any charge off will increase the cases reality thats true but the earlier that charge is and the more close it is to the standard aberrative factors of the thetan and those are represented in the grades youll wake up someday to realize that the grades the subject of the grades are the things that aberrate thetan and theyre put together in that order because they are the things which can be contacted in that order do you see its very tricky those are all the things that aberrate thetan now you can slide over into chain of engrams new chain of engrams after youve got this lets get therapy engrams all of sudden weve got therapy engrams my god hes been operated on chopped up bisected and finally you get down to basic in space opera where they used to take him apart and leave him on bench for week because he was bad see and this is the basic on being operated on see something like that you can soar right on down through these cases now were really talking about resistive case when were talking about case that wont run on 3 this guy is out of valence this guy has his identity all mixed up hes got his engrams all mixed up his memory is somebody elses hes got everything and anything disowned right so to solve this so as to get him to get rid of his body thetans not to solve his total reality because that comes at 7 you saw down through this line of anything that would make bunch of thetans group together get the theory see its just bunch of thetans are going to scrunch see so the thetans go scrunch together what would make bunch of thetans go scrunch well psychiatric treatment one of the nastiest chains i ever saw in my life i picked up some couple of psychiatrists on planet which is remote from here had gotten hold of girl and messed her all up and of course she was already group of thetans and then they fixed her up second dynamicwise and every other damn way that you could possibly think of and then put her in some kind of tub and gave her electric shocks in tub and there was burning electrode in the tub they had ball they had ball and when the girl kicked the bucket for some how or another by some carrier method i dont know how got here only of course as being cluster which is longer even possible to pick up or run body all this cluster could do was just make people sick and it obsessively attacked people and those things are around now when you run the engram chain you will run down to point where they became cluster and itll go down some chain all of sudden youve got that and youve got what we call melazzo the second you run the mutual engram the whole key of it is the mutual engram to them they lot of them just go bingobango bllthth leaving some on whom you have to now run incident 1 to make them blow see thats the common sequence of this thing because these clusters can be so vicious and so hard on body one is apt to think that all pressures this is another one thats been introduced sideways in boy people have been so god damned busy thinking it isnt even funny it is fascinating you know i find more of these damn additives you know like if the person has pressure on his body he must have cluster it doesnt follow brother it doesnt follow one thetan can give plenty of pressure on body and to give you some idea of how much how much horrible action can be thrown into body or how much action or stress can be put on body by thetan last year i busted my back my arm and my knee they healed up very rapidly but it was all in doing things that were beyond the my arm and my knee they healed up very rapidly but it was all in doing things that were beyond the ability of body to stand pick up or resist see i could resist em all right you you get the idea so the guy himself can bust himself up and youll have the experience up around 7 some place of trying to investigate like mad what the hell is this horrible pressure on my shoulder i must have another body thetan i this i that dadada oh my god wows you know and find out that somebody someplace in your vicinity day or two before simply made loud noise or something of this sort and at that moment you protected the body from it to move it over sideways and you havent let go of it yet you idiot its its goof things like this somebody was way up the line came down with terrible lot of nasal trouble and so on and ive forgotten exactly what they told but it was just that they hadnt owned their immediate environment yet and it sort of backed up and were at the present moment holding onto their their nostrils holding onto their nostrils and here you had here you had an advanced ot section person who was ill holding on to her nostril she found this out herself and let go of her nostrils and miraculously in about three seconds about set of operations worth of sinusitis cleared up see the medicos would have had ball with it so dont think that guy also cant do this very reactively down in the vicinity of 3 and 4 or down in the vicinity of service fac or down in the vicinity of bmbmbm all thats really wrong with thetan you know is thetan concentrates his actions onto just one of thetans abilities so thetan whos in good shame has got all of these abilities but some guy starts specializing in only this fixed ability he cant do anything else hes weak as cat in all other directions so that you get i think it was jung to mention infamous names well i dont know that jung is infamous freud broyer the rest of these guys theyre just bandits but jung i think it was had poltergeist phenomena all he had to do was sit down in the room and bookcase or something would split down through the center see well any thetan can split up bookcases hell i mean thats easy but he didnt know he was doing it and it caused lot of trouble in other words he was totally reactive on the basis and totally nonrecognizing improvement in case is mostly meant walking it up the line to advanced realities and awarenesses hes going in the direction of truth now so the handling of case the handling of case whatever process or process youre involved with is to get charge off and there is certain main line charge which you must get off and those are the grades and the fastest way to get that charge off and the most valuable charge to get off are of course the exact grade processes and once youve done those thats it boy thats it lets say you start in and run chain of engrams and this is the one variable you run chain of engrams and then you come along and you try to run the chain of engrams thats gonna be an overrun right away thats gonna be an overrun nothing but because youre on the same chain the guy erased to become an engram release he got onto the same chain well youre not likely to get on to it very easily unless you coax the bird onto it and you say that chain wasnt flat and you get what the content of the engram was and then try to run the engram again now youre liable to get into trouble now the reason why engrams run so easily out of this lifetime and so badly in this lifetime is the fellow has very few back track associations he has some but he has very few back track associations with body thetans so theoretically the further back track he gets the less thetans hes got you get out of this lifetime why you maybe only got half dozen thetans or something like that that are carried along with the guy do you see so that its little bit difficult to run an engram in this lifetime so dont be surprised when your chains rather rapidly go out of this lifetime and your engrams suddenly run because youre running the guys own engrams do you see but your best bet is to find one in this lifetime and try to get it run because that splits up this but you can never the less separate him out from the mass and increase his reality but you see what youre trying to do see what the design of the bank is is what im trying to show you here now you start main line processes and let us say we have released the guy now on pr pr 4 source with those commands and on that subject and we start to run it again we are in trouble boy we are in trouble because were right exactly where he went release and it now constitutes an overrun and that is now going to be mess right now you ask what in the name of common sense is an s and d but the isolation of source well isnt it funny you can run quite few s and ds on somebody you can run at least w and an s and u s d on them and as guy goes along and gets pts from some other quarter you can run another s d one of your sins is running too many s and ds and trying to run s and ds on people that dont need s and ds now thats the main sins running too many s and ds and running s and ds on people who are not pts i mean those are auditor case supervisor sins you show big fat folder thats got forty two s and ds in it and somebody was nuts boy all they were doing was hanging him up with wrong items so of course he got more and more frantic about it because they never did find the suppressive so that was misalignment of source so theyre giving him wrong sources and these wrong sources will hang up and hell keep these mocked up very nicely thats why you straighten out lists lot of work to straighten out lists quite skilled operation actually but in the net gain of this that is the subject of one of the power processes every time you ask fellow how he is youre running conditions when you say to him how does it seem to you now and so forth why youre running some the subject certainly of 5 this is the elementary actions do you follow but you try to run the process itself again uhhhhh murder and sudden death now i have seen the remark in review folder and i hope i never see it again mid ruds have been overrun on the case ive also seen the remark ruds have been overrun on the case well this could mean only that the auditor didnt quit when he got an fn in that session on that chain of arc breaks that would be an overrun but arc breaks run all the way they run all the way from the minus scale to ot8 the phenomena of arc breaks as long as youre in this universe and as long as youre alive the phenomena of arc and u holds true and you get up around ot8 someplace it doesnt matter much but the net result here is that the case supervisor and the auditor they have problem and that is the case which is resistive you have find some charge to take off the case without overrunning the case and thats why when you take resistive case assessment and you the auditor flies the needle on each one of the subjects and thinks hes doing something hes just cut the case supervisors throat or if he lets it be itsad hes just cutting the case supervisors throat because its liable to fn now you have the the rather touchy business of instead of being able to dive in on this therapy chain and take off bd bd fall bd you know bongbong another incident fall bd fall fall fall you know bd long fall bd fall another incident you see instead of being able to do that youre already going past an fn youre liable to get protest on the thing it isnt keyed in it isnt available now do you get what the difference is so actually to this degree you are prospecting for charge so its just great to fly the needle on everything thats just great only as long as the case is running well now lets take the case that he got his review his case supervision was quite competent his auditing was quite competent and he goes to the examiner and his free needle has packed up between walking the way from the auditing session to the examiner and he says it was great review but it didnt handle the pain in his left lumbosis you know now you have resistive case thats what you know because the normal action not the usual action cause these are all usual actions the normal action that you would take with case didnt fly it the needle fned and so forth but on those things theres something sitting around some place that isnt released now your problem is when this happens on lower grades youve got all the phenomena of 3 to kick the pc in the head naturally hes got problems naturally hes got not necessarily problems but hes got all kinds of oddities do you follow so our problem here now what do we do well you do resistive case assessment to find some area of charge and then you set it up for the auditor to discharge that area and when he gets that area discharged hes gonna get some change in this case we have to know what area the case is really hung up in now case which is out ruds let give you some idea case which is out ruds christ we can put in ruds cleeeeaar back to the beginning of the universe and we can put in arc breaks until hell wont have it oh yes one of the ways you trigger this you see is to ask him for serious arc breaks similar serious arc breaks he isnt gonna fn on that right away and hell look this over one of the ways of doing this is some version of well its just its itsa hes gonna do it by itsa youre going to go earlier so youre doing these little scales all the way see youre doing these little scales well you bleed them for charge you always do arcu cdei and now if you really want to start bleeding down on arc breaks or something you ask for one that ordinarily doesnt come up thats side panel incomplete cycles of action if you were to find pc who said in an arc break hes rather resistive pc see and you found that he had hell of time with reality hard to get case change out of him and he says he says something like this hell they didnt let finish it oh well you just start running incomplete cycles of action and tracing back earlier incomplete cycles of action and earlier cycles of action and theyre all arc breaks and do your scale on them too of course the arc break is actually the incomplete cycle of action because that causes an arc break now also overruns cause an arc break so what has been overrun tends to cure arc breaks now if you run what has been overrun while being alert for arc breaks you can get more charge off you can play it against itself now if youre very clever when somebody says prep check 3 or something like this as case supervisor your ears are right straight up and very alert to catch any arc break that shows up you see on section 3 has anything been suppressed babababababambambam was there an arc break there yes starts to run just little bit too long dont you see and so forth well catch the arc break now if it flies on an arc break can you finish the prep check well unfortunately but on prep checks on 3 youre peculiarly liable to get off into an arc break chains and its one that you should know its standard datum everything im giving you is standard datum the rundown then of rudiments the rundown of secondaries and the rundown these are chains chains chains and the rundowns of engrams can be done on any case below 3 they can be done on any case above 3 so therefore these are very fruitful areas where you look for charge you got it you want to increase pcs reality you just generally remove charge from the case if you want to increase his reality in removing charge from case you remove the highest quality charge you can get do you follow so the processes then are little ladder that goes up this which have exact rungs and then theres this sort of bigger rope that you can climb up on both sides now one of these little rungs they handle that whole subject they key out that whole subject the guy feels great on this whole subject see but there is still all kinds of this on the case now if you understand this if you understand what youre doing you understand the mechanics of this thing you wont get wrapped around telegraph pole by somebody telling you something stupid or silly it is always better to audit against an understanding of what the devil youre handling and thats why i like to teach you not against rote there is rote there is rote in standard tech the like of which you never heard of but i want to tell you what is going on you dont have to figure it this is why what rote there is is there now if its itsa and earlier incident itsa and with arc breaks scale that you can assess each time youve got totally unlimited process and similarly on green forms you are very soon going to if you run too many green forms on somebody youre very soon going to have done too many s and ds youre going to have done too many remedy bs there is whats the trouble with green form you can do as many green forms as you like as long as you dont do too many lists on them cause those lists that very soon runs into an overrun because listing is sort of process and it has limitation but if all items of the green form were simply itsaed or earlier run with itsa and the arc break with the arcu cdei if earlier runs see itsa or earlier itsa its itsa or earlier itsa itsa or earlier itsa any earlier similar incident i dont care what what came up on the green form see horse chestnuts we dont care good horse chestnuts horse chestnuts horse chestnuts good is there any earlier similar horse chestnuts see thats your thats your bible therefore i dont like to give you whole bunch of canned questions about what you say on green form you can ask the pc about this subject and it doesnt become rote process and therefore it doesnt have an opportunity to get overrun do you follow so youre asking about this subject the subject is what is important now when you run green form and then you try to run five or six processtype questions or qs and as big additives of this particular character you wrap the pc around telegraph pole so the only thing you are asking him for the only only only thing you are asking for on green form is the subject of the green form and earlier similar thing on the subject of the green form horse chestnuts itsa itsa itsa fn earlier horse chestnuts itsa itsa itsa itsa fn earlier chestnuts earlier earlier fn now your only liability in this particular instance the thing didnt read in the first place so you have to be alert at every turn for one false read and two suppressed read theyre both he sides of this coin ill give you an actual example the other day fellow went into session and didnt like the auditor and asked for missed withhold it didnt read so as long as it didnt read he didnt say anything the idiot and the auditor said thats clean and went on by the thing and pc at the end of the session fell on his head naturally now exactly what was wrong there was missed withhold suppressed but by looking at it you dont have to ask suppressed every time but by looking at the pc you see theres something there learn to look at the pc you say horse chestnuts and pc yeah horse chestnuts you say on horse chestnuts has that horse chestnuts been suppressed bwooom see mmmm alright good tell about that anything and all of sudden youve got chain that has never come up in view and tells you why the green forms never succeed on this pc the subject is suppressed now the other reason the green forms dont succeed on pcs when they dont there are two other reasons one is because somebody overruns the lists that were called for on the green form the other one is that the thing has falsely been reading for time immemorial he had he was out in lower walla walla and some auditor had new emeter he didnt know how to run and hed heard that youre supposed to ask for missed withholds or withholds and he asked for withholds the same time he hit the tone arm with his thumb and the fellow said well youve got withhold it read and the pc says uuuuuuoo dooo he had to think about it well what was that what is it there must be one there so the question goes live and five six seven eight years later the question is still live and the pc is around the bend trying to answer this thing that never read in the first place you got it thats true of any read all you know as class viii when an emeter reads is that the emeter read the chances are it read in response to what you asked the pc the chances are in favor of that but thats all you know about it now if theres anything the least bit odd about the pcs response anything the least bit off you check that read you check for false reads and youre sitting there and the pc has been going natter natter natter do you have present time problem oh yes everyone is so mean to and theyve stolen my shoes lately and oh natter natter natter natter do you have missed withhold thats clean oh christ learn how to audit thats what i always think when i see one of these damned things for christy sake learn how to audit you know critical pc missed withhold now that it didnt read doesnt mean anything because you might not have made an impingement on the pc to the you know he might not even have heard you it might be suppressed now if the pc gives the manifestations of missed withhold and the missed withhold question doesnt read you ask suppressed naturally youve got to work with reads youre not phonograph record at class viii all you know is that the meter read on something it read on passing car it read on the moon going into another phase the chances are it read on what you said but the chances are simply slightly in favor of that do you follow now the other thing is is when the meter doesnt read what you know is that the meter didnt read and the chances are in favor that that is or but it is not anything you can take for granted and if the manifestations this pc comes into session oh yes ah ah ah i hai crying and you say do you have an arc break thats clean thank you very much oh boy youre not going any place from there on boy i dont know what youre doing behind the wheel of car but youre not drivin the chances are very greatly in favor of having an arc break its not inevitable maybe shes just like that but well you say do you have an arc break it didnt get read has anything been suppressed on arc breaks has anything been suppressed i dont care how you say it you want to get the suppress off the arc break if there is suppress on it and it goes zooomp or do you have an arc break that reads now you can get into this kind of fire fight do you have an arc break has anything been suppressed do you have an arc break that reads and its protest read so the pc says oh i dont think so alright has anything been protested didnt read anything been suppressed read do you have an arc break read im afraid youll have to answer the question what youve done is prove that the meter read do you see so in moments of doubt you either prove it read or prove it didnt read see you are the guy driving the meter and it is very very remarkable instrument there is meter and i think it sells for 595 pesetas or dollars i think the dollar has dropped below the peseta now anyhow well after all macnamara did his best and in his best he got us war with viet nam and ran the country into deep debt and as reward he was made the head of the world bank anyway did you know that i think the most remarkable things happen on this planet its just time we got busy you know how anybody could sit around and watch this one the guy runs the country into debt by spending threequarters of its income on military activity that didnt have anything to do with the price of fish and as reward they make him the head of the world bank which is the one loaning the money to the country in order to pay for the war you didnt notice that going on all these things happen all the time so its actually time you got busy see so what you know in driving this thing is that its damn good instrument the 595 kerputnicks medical meter that is sold currently reads only on body motion and passing cars i know ive taken one ive tested one ive tried to run somebody on it i tried to do something with it and it does nothing but run body motion it is very remarkable meter very very very remarkable because the thing reads more on the think than it does on the body and it reads so little on the body that it doesnt even get in your road its very remarkable meter by the way the name of it is very proper its really an electro psychometer and psych in the dictionary means soul and anybody who calls anything else an electro psychometer would be telling lie if he used it on body or on disease do you get the point its an electrical means of measuring the spirit thats exactly what its name says electra psychometer its called for short emeter somebody has come along and put on the recent labels of it electrometer theyre trying to shorten the name down but the proper name is an emeter or an electro psychometer now its very remarkable instrument but like all instruments it wont operate without being operated and you as an auditor have got to have confidence in the instrument confidence in what it says and youve got to know what it says and it says there was charge there of some kind now the charge could have been restimulated by the environment or the charge by the environment suddenly impinging on the pc he had bite by fly in his left ankle or it is by your question and some fidgety pc thats leaping all over the place all the time it could be body motion i dont let my pcs leap all over the place i dont know why you let yours my pcs always sit very still quite remarkable ive never had pc move in session to amount to anything and i thought oh wow i was holding them anyway if pc keeps knocking the hands together give him one hand electrode be clever you dont have to strap him up but the point is you know the meter read the tone arms quite reliable on anything very reliable there is slight thing that meter will have to warm up sometimes during session but the tone arm is very very very reliable what its doing actually is measuring the density of the mass in association with the thetan is really what its doing its the amount of resistance in the mass which is connected to the thetan so actually you can lean on wall and get the tone arm reading on the wall quite interesting tone arm doesnt just read on the body it reads on what the thetan is connected to with regard to it actually if you the male and female figures there have been worked out carefully and it might be of interest to you that they are taken from the united state army ohms resistance on dead bodies and the first work that was done on this they went around battle fields for something or in morgues or some place measuring dead bodies and so they worked out pattern of how you went about this so i extended their work little bit and got these positions but dead bodies go from five to twelve five hundred so when you have that read you are then only reading on the body and youre not now reading on the thetan when it flies you have lost connector do you see and its the liveness is the float of the thetan but the tone arm position is the density of the body not the density of the thetan now when the tone arm position is high it is because theres lot of thetan impinged on the body there could be lot of thetans impinged on the body which we learn in 3 or lot of thetan when youre going to start going above 3 they sometimes start driving you out of your mind every time you go on the meter youre about 45 or something stupid like this and then you find out finally what youre leaning on but the main point here is that youre dealing with highly reliable instrument the efforts to curtail or to injure the distribution of the emeter or forbid its use or something like this are quite cunningly slanted and because the emeter is very important fortunately almost anybody can build one if you know the exact circuit and you dont let somebody depart too far from that circuit why theyre very easily manufactured and they give you they give you the done but you have to know what dope youve got if the read is above three it is not body read it has to be thetan or mental mass to push it up there and that can be composed of one or more beings and oddly enough when overruns occur anywhere along the line why the tone arm goes up and that is what causes the thing the guy has been too long at it the guy did it once too often and that is the basic reason for the height of ta now if you go too frantic on this subject why youll have bad time ive seen cses and auditors go absolutely frantic theyve got to get the ta down in the next two minutes there is reason to get it down in the next two minutes two or three session are perfectly adequate for somebody but all you do is keep clicking charge off and overruns and so on there is fast way to get it down its just the indications of overruns indications of list indications of bpc but it doesnt always stay down it then goes up this is the lick and promise locate the bpc on the thing and something like that and you start blowing the meter down but the main thing that you are interested in is getting it down so that it rides in normal range well how do you get it there well now to get it down youve got to have someplace to take charge off the case correct well the way you take charge off the case to find overruns and rehab em now you take one of these fat folders that comes from the ching wong tao organization and because they couldnt get all the books translated into chinese or something they dont know some of the hot dope and theyve been listing folders and theyve got folders which are six inches thick and so on you actually could start taking charge off to get tone arm down just by going back and finding the over lists and calling them to view and indicating them and finding the item and so on and so on itll do things for the case too it isnt necessarily whats got the tone arm up dont bet on the idea that you have to find out what the tone arm is up on in order to take the tone arm down you can drive yourself nutty this way too what is making this tone arm go up what is this thing what is this thing what is this magic thing that we are looking for oh there must be some clue to this it must be some specific overrun some place hell i wouldnt try my wits on it id just find an early overrun that would shoot the later one do you ever get tired of doing something good is there an earlier time now ill show you real one its the velocity of the question this is not necessarily something youd with off on pc but im just showing you mechanics you could say to this pc you could saydid you ever get and theyd choose something see serious arc break this thing here on the whole track on the whole track did you ever kill anybody well you best believe you know naturally well good now were going to find the chain of killing people how far back do you thing thats going to go before it fns now ill give you an even worse one and this you shouldnt use its out of 7 trace back moments of guilt to basic dont use that but you can take something like the persons feeling guilty now you could make little little list you make up see then that doesnt shoot the whole thing to glory thats why you make up these little lists see it catches some side panel if youre gonna run down but theres charge on it see you make up this little list and youre going to have murder battle anything you could think of see with five or six words you know armies wars see something like that then you assess what reads and wars read good were gonna go down the war chain it read so it must be charged we already have now where do we pick up the clue of this is from the itsa of former sessions we get track of this this fellow says this fellow says im just being drafted fills with horror thats just in passing itsa see well theres certainly something about armies soldiers battles see theres going to be something someplace and he gives you whole chain you could run see now we didnt evaluate for him because he said it see we found this in his itsa see weve heard it in his itsa so we take this and then we expand this out so that is catches more area and we find what part of that area it reads and then we dont fly it with glimpse we run its see christ change pcs left and right now lets take one like this girl has got very bad arc breaks she says when actually its moment of loss somebody has has left her and doesnt love her anymore and this reads as an arc break and so on well you can run it as an arc break by specifying what the arc break chain is about which is love now where the hell do you supposed that would wind you up now theyve told you the arc breaks about love so you just start running earlier arc breaks on the subject of love this is very heavy subject because its right along side of affinity and you can run awful lot of chains do you follow youre now in the business of finding things to audit but you dont bother ever to do this unless youve got guy you could do it for practice but you dont bother to do this unless youve got guy who isnt running well then you get the assessment resistive cases you find the zone or area in which he is apparently hung up or thats hot and then you find something associated with that that you can run lot of charge off of and you go right on down the bank on this and you blow it and youre gonna change your guy you see how its done thats the formula therefore you can do this as cs unless youve got auditors of course that just take the list and fly the needle on the whole list and you can get lot of charge off the case now you get lot of charge off the case on something the guy is hung up on his psycho somatics disappear and so on see now the guy is not in hospital his sickness is ptp to him to some degree but it turns out its physically ill hes physically ill alright if he is physically ill you have to make up your mind what youre going to do about this physically illness now is it something that has to be treated and can be treated or should be treated in order to knock it out do you see well theres funny funny thing about this you can get this treated and you usually better damn well had but at the same time youll find out it very often doesnt get well until you audit it ive seen ive seen penicillin hang up for six weeks until the chain was run that made the guy sick now because he was on penicillin he didnt kick the bucket do you see and it did do lot for him and it tended to straighten him out but he would up with wheeze or something dont you see now after youve done something for the acute state of this illness or its been treated in some fashion or another now you can go in and run the engram on it now youll go on down that chain what kind of sickness what sickness chain are you going down on now the trick about it is hes physically ill and if you start auditing down an illness chain youre liable to miss it completely because it isnt that he is physically ill its the fact that hes suffering from bullets in the back you know hes got arthritis and hes suffering from bullets in the back and so on well the trick of assessment in action there would be to find really what is this guy ill from well its to find out what is he sitting in and what is he sitting in now thered be several ways of discovering what he was sitting in and what do you know you could list it you dont list it to fn youve got one of these crazy lists you can make list of what kind of an engram is it itll obey the laws of listing if you want it to obey the laws of listing but there are whole bunch of questions which dont follow the laws of listing because theyre not list questions what has been overrun it doesnt go to one item its not one item list because its not trying to locate source of anything so you can say to the fellow you can say to the fellow something on the order of what are you what are you afraid of now you could list that to one item but you could simply ask him well have you ever been afraid of that before and run whole series of secondaries and so help pete the illness it liable to fall right out in your lap on that chain of secondaries now when youve run some secondaries another type of engram outflows and flies on secondaries so that youve got something else thats got to go down do you get the idea now that you can audit so fast weve got to figure out ways so that you can audit slow do you see how its done and do you see why now what ive given you is actually in this lecture the total rationale and background of auditing there isnt anything much lies along side of it and unless you add bunch of weird odd facts coming in such as that in order to find out whether or not person has body thetans you should scan the thing up and down nuts the way you find out if somebody has body thetans is can you run an incident 1 thats simple now if you can run an incident 1 but hes just mocking it up well that becomes an overrun so you better rehab it but if youre running an incident 1 which another thetan incident 1 and that gets overrun you rehab that too youre not in any danger but this is how you find out if there are body thetans because that is the mutual incident the mutual incident of all thetans is incident 1 quite trick to find it anyway i hope the information which i have given you will assist you to study the exact rote actions which you take because this is the rationale which makes the rote actions rote thank you very much
