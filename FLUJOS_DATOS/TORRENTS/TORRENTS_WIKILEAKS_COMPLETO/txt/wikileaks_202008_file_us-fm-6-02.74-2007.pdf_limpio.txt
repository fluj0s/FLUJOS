frequen cy range can provide both shortrange and longhaul communications however it is also greatly influenced by the earths atmosphere to communicate effectively in the hf spectrum it is necessary to understand radio propagation an d how the earths atmosphere affects this frequency range 2 propagation propagation describes how radio signals radiate outward from transmitting source radio transmitters antenna emits radio waves much like the wave motion formed by dropping stone in pool of water this ac tion is simple to imagine for radio waves that travel in straight line in free space the true path radio wa ves take and how the earths atmosphere affects thes waves is more complex 3 earths atmosphere the earths atmosphere is divided into th ree separate regions the layers are the troposphere the stratosphere and the ionosphere most of the earths weather takes place in the troposphere which extends from the earths surface to about 10 miles up the weather variations in temperature dens ity and pressure have great effect on the propagation of radio waves the stratosphere which extends from roughly 10 to 30 miles up has little effect on radio wave propagation the ionosphere which extends from 30 to approximately 375 up contains up to four cloudlike layers of electrically charged ions it is this region and its ionized yers that enable radio waves to be propagated great distances the ionos phere and how it affects radio wave propagation is discussed on page i3 4 types of propagation there are two basic modes of propagati on ground waves and sky waves ground waves travel along the surface of the earth and are used prim arily for shortrange communications sky waves reflected by the ionosphere are bounced or reflected back to earth and provide longhaul communications path as w ell as shortrange 0 to 180 miles or 300 kilometers km communication in mountainous terrain ground waves ground waves consist of three components surface waves direct waves and groundreflected waves 1 surface waves surface waves travel along the surface of the earth reaching beyond the horizon eventually surface wave energy is absorbed by the earth the effective range of surface waves is largely determined by the frequency and conducti vity of the surface over which the waves travel bodies of water and flat land have the least amount of ab sorption while desert and jungle areas have the greatest for given complement of equipment the range may extend from 200 to 250 miles over conductive allseawater path ov er arid rocky nonconductive terra in however the range may drop to less than 20 miles even with the same equipment if terrain is mountainous the radio frequency signal i2 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 6026afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a 20 november 2007 will be reflected rather than continuing along the eart hs surface thus significantly reducing range absorption also increases with an increase in frequency when tryi ng to communicate using surface wave energy use the lowest possible frequency 2 direct waves direct waves also known as aka lineofsight waves travel in straight line becoming weaker as distance incr eases they may be bent or refracted by the atmosphere this extends their useful range slight ly beyond the horizon transmitting and receiving antennas must be able to see each other for communications to take place therefore antenna height is critical in determining range any obstructi ons such as mountains or buildings between the two antennas can block or reduce the signal using co mmunications at higher frequencies reception is optimized by matching the polarizationantenna position of the radios 3 groundreflected waves groundreflected waves are the portion of the propagated wave that is reflected from the surface of t he earth between the transmitter and receiver b sky waves sky waves are radiated upward making beyond communications possible at certain frequen cies radio waves are refracted or bent returning to earth hundreds or thousands of miles away depending on frequency time of day tod and atmospheric conditions signal can bounce several times before reaching receiver near vertical incident sky waves nvis are useful for shortrange nonlos communication at dist ances up to 200 miles nv is are reflected off the ionosphere at steep takeoff angles at such steep takeoff angles however some of the hf energy penetrates the ionosphere and is lost usually the hf band is used for sky wave propagation radio communicati ons that use sky wave propagation depend on the ionosphere to provide the signal path between the transmitting and receiving antennas understanding sky wave propagation requires knowledge of the effects of the ionosphere and solar activity on hf r adio propagation and familiarization with the techniques used to predict propagation and lect the best frequencies for particular link at given time using sky waves can be tricky since the ionosphere is constantly changing several different co mputer programs are available to aid in the prediction of frequencies for the best propagati on figure i1 shows the different propagation paths for hf radio waves 20

charged particles or gases in the earths atmosphere extending from approximately 50 to 600 km 30 t 375 miles above the earths surface ionizationthe process in which elect rons are stripped from atoms and produce electrically charged particlesresults from solar radiation when the ionosphere becomes heavily i onized the gases may even glow and be visible this phenomenon is known as nort hern and southern lights b why is the ionosphere impor tant in hf radio this blanket of gases is like natures satellite making most beyond s radio communications possible when radio waves strike these ionized layers depending on frequency some are completely absorbed others are refracted so they return to the earth and st ill others pass through the ionosphere into outer space absorpti on tends to be greater at lower frequencies and increases as the degree of ionization increases figure i2 shows the angle at which sky waves enter the ionos phere aka the incident angle i4 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 6026afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a 20 november 2007 figure i2 incident angle c incident angle is determined by waveleng th such as frequency and the type and orientation of the transmitting antenna like billiard ball bouncing off rail radio wave reflects from the ionos phere at the same angle at wh ich it hits the ionosphere thus the incident angle is an important fact or in determining communications range communications with distant station r equires greater incident angle while communications with nearby station requires lesser incident angle d the incident angle of radio wave is crit ical if the incid ent angle is too nearly vertical and the electromotive force of the transmitted signal is relatively small in that direction the radio waves will pass through the ionosphere w ithout being refracted back to earth if the incident angle is too grea t the radio waves will be absorbed by the lower layers before reaching the more densely ioni zed upper layers in turn the incident angle must be sufficient to bring the radio wave back to earth yet not so great that it will lead to absorption 6 layers of the ionosphere within the ionosphere there are four layers of varying ionization as illustrated in figure i3 since ionization is caused by solar radiation the higher layers of the ionosphere tend to be more electrically dense while the lower layers protected by the outer layers experience less ionization of these layers the first discovered in the early 1920s by sir edward victor appleton was designated for electric waves later d and f were discovered and noted by t hese letters the letters b and c will be used to designate future discoveries 20 november 2007 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 602 6afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a i5 figure i3 layers of the ionosphere b the d layer is the lowest region affecting hf radio wave s ionized only during the day the d layer reaches maximum ionization when the sun is at its zenith but dissipates quickly toward sunset c the layer reaches maximum ionization at noon it begins dissipating toward sunset and reaches minimum activity at dnight irregular cl oudlike formations of ionized gases occasionally occur in the yer these regions known as sporadic can support propagation of sky waves at the upper end of the hf band and beyond sporadic regions appear and di sappear quickly and at irregular intervals therefore they are difficult to predict for this reason sporadic communications cannot be depended upon to support mission essential communications i6 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 6026afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a 20 november 2007 d the f layer is the most heavily ionized region of the ionos phere and therefore the most important for longhaul communications at this titude the air is thin enough so the ions and electrons recombine very slowly and this layer retains its ionized properties even after sunset in the daytime the f layer consists of two distinct layers f1 and f2 the f1 layer which exists only in the daytime and is negligible in winter is not important to hf communications f the f2 layer reaches maximum ioniza tion at noon and remains charged at night gradually decreasing to mini mum just before sunrise g during the day sky wave reflection from the f2 layer requires wavelengths short enough to penetrate the ionized d and layers but not so short as to pass through the f layer generally frequencies from 8 to 20 mhz will be reflected back to earth during daytime hours and frequencies between 2 and 8 mhz will be reflected at nighttime hours for nvis nighttime communications the most effective frequencies normally range between 2 and 5 mhz 7 factors affecting atmospheric ionization the intensity of solar radiation varies periodically thereby affecting ionization solar radiation intensity can be predi cted based on the tod and season and equipment adjustments made to limit or optimize ionization effects b ionization is higher during spring and summer because the hours of daylight are longer sky waves are absorbed or weakened as they pass through the highly charged d and layers in effect reducing the communication range of most hf bands c because there are fewer hours of daylight during autumn and winter less radiation reaches the d and layers lower frequencies pass easi ly through these weakly ionized layers therefore signal s arriving at the f yer are stronger and reflected over greater distances d another longer term periodic variati on results from the 11year sunspot cycle shown in figure i4 sunspots generate bursts of radiation that cause higher levels of ionizationthe more the greater the ionization during periods of low sunspot activity frequencies above 20 mhz tend to be unusable because the nd f layers are too weakly ionized to reflect signals back to ea rth at the peak of the sunspot cycle however it is not unusual to have worl dwide propagation on frequencies above 30 mhz 20 november 2007 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 602 6afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a i7 figure i4 11year sunspot cycle in addition to these regular variat ions there is class of unpredictable phenomena known as sudden io nospheric disturbances that can affect hf communications as well sudden ionospher ic disturbancesrandom events due to solar flarescan disrupt sky wave communication for hours or days at time solar flares produce intense ionization of the d laye r causing it to absorb most hf signals on the side of the eart h facing the sun f magnetic storms often follo w the eruption of solar flar within 20 to 40 hours charged particles from the st orms have scattering effect on the f layer temporarily neutralizing its reflective properties 8 frequency and path optimization because ionospheric conditions affect radio wave propagation communicators must determine the best way to optimize radi frequencies at particular time the highest possible frequency that can be used to transmit over particular path under given ionospheric conditions is the ma ximum usable frequency muf frequencies i8 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 6026afttpi 3248comdtinst m20007a 20 november 2007 higher than the muf penetrate the ionosp here and continue into space frequencies lower than the muf tend to refract back to earth b as frequency is reduced the amount of absorption of the signal by the d layer increases eventually the signal is comp letely absorbed by the ionosphere the frequency at which this occurs is called the lowest usable frequency the window of usable frequencies therefor lies between the muf and lowest usable frequency c the frequency of optimum transmission f ot is nominally 85 percent of the muf generally the fot is lower at night and higher during the day d in addition to frequency the route t he radio signal travels must also be considered in optimizing communications received signal may be comprised of components arriving via several routes incl uding one or more sky wave paths and ground wave path the arrival times of t hese components differ because of differences in path length the range of time differences is the multipath spread the effects of multipath spread can be minimized by selecting frequency as clo as possible to the muf higher frequencies are generally less susceptible to atmospheric noise so communications can also be improved by choos ing frequencies as close as possible to the muf 9 propagation prediction techniques since many of the variables affecti ng propagation follow repet itive cycles and can be predicted techniques for effectively determining fot have been developed b number of propagation prediction computer progr ams are available see appendix h one widely used and effective program is voice of america coverage analysis program voacap which predicts system performance at given times of day as function of frequency for given hf path and specifi ed complement of equipment c of course since computerized pr ediction methods are based on physical calculations and historic data they cannot account for present conditions affecting communications such as ionospheric changes caused by random phenomena interference and noise 20 november 2007 fm 60274mcrp 3403enttp 602 6afttpi

channel automatically without operator assistance typically ale systems make use of recently measured radio channel characteristics stored in memory matrix to select the best frequency the system works much like telephone in that each r adio in network is assigned an address similar to call sign when not in use each radio receiv er constantly scans through its assigned frequencies listening for calls addressed to it 2 ale linking sequence to reach specific station the radio operator simply enters an address just like dialing telephone number t he radio consults its memory matrix and selects the best available assigned frequency it then sends out brief di gital message containing the identification id of the destination w hen the receiving stati on hears its address it stops scanning and stays on that frequency t he two stations automatically conduct handshake to confirm that link is established and they are ready to communicate see figure iii figure ii1 ale linking

station and they each return to the scanning mode c ale can also be used for group of stat ions using the ale net call at the same time in this situation each receiving st ation answers back to t he calling station in certain sequence which is set up during the ale programming net calls must be used somewhat judiciously as all called stati ons need to be in the same propagating region as the calling station d an hf communications network usua lly has number of channels assigned the ale system has link quality analysis l qa process that allows the radio to evaluate each of these channels to dete rmine the best channel to place call at prescribed intervals station can be programmed to measure the signal quality on each assigned frequency by listening to the sounding signals from the other stations in the network the quality scores are stored in matrix listed by the other stations as id versus channel when call to certain station is initiated the radio checks the matrix to determine the best qualit frequency for the call to that particular station it then attempts to link on that frequency if t he link cannot be established on that frequency it will try again on the next best frequency and so on until link is established if link is not establis hed after trying all the assigned frequencies the radio will prompt the operator that link could not be established sometimes when using the hf spectrum communications bet ween any two points may not be possible in these cases it is important to be persist ent in attempts to communicate and consider using another station as relay to get message across f in the sample lqa matrix for the st ation headquarters hq table iii the channel numbers represent progr ammed frequencies the numbers in the matrix are the

across all radios in the network these setti ngs are determined by considerations such as type of radios in the network and the number of radios in the network due to the number of different data devices and types of data this document does not cover the use of data in an ale network to show contrast between vendor equipment sample ale communications plan for an anprc150 c radio is incl uded in appendix f example radio programming application and sample communications plan for an anarc220 radio is included in appendix g example hf communications planning system hfcps 2 ale parameters the following lists some of the ale param eters provided to users different equipment may contain more or fewer parameters 1 address this parameter assigns unique ca ll sign or address to each radio the self address is the address assigned to the radio you are programmin g the format is three to fifteen alphanumeric characters individual addresses ar assigned to all other radios in the network 2 all call this parameter determines if the r adio will respond to an all call an all call attempts to link with all the ale stations using broadcast format an all call does not expect response and does not designate specific address the letters all should not be used as self or individual address 3 amd allowed this parameter enables or disables the abilit of the radio to receive amd messages if this is turn ed off your radio will not receive and store amd messages sent to it this parameter does not exist in all vendors equipment 4 any call this parameter det ermines if the radio will respond to an any call an any call attempts to link with all ale stations in the same manner as with the all call except the individual stations are expected to respond at one of 16 random intervals for linking purposes the letters any should not be used as self or individual address 5 auto display amd this parameter enables or disables the ability of the radio to display received amd message on its front panel if this is turned off your radio will not display amd messages sent to it but will store them in memory for this feature to work the amd allowed parameter must be enabled 6 scan set aka channel group or scan list this parameter g roups individual channels together for use in an ale network the number of scan sets that can be created is dependent on the equipment used 7 key to call this parameter enables or disabl feature that allows the operator to simply key the microphone to place an ale call to the last address calle d this is like last number redial on telephone 8 activity timeout aka link timeout or return to scan timeout this parameter returns the radio from linked state to scan if the radio has not been keyed or has not received an ale signal for specified period of

an ale call depending on the equipment used the existing traffic can be an ale handshake voice or data 10 lqa in call this parameter enables or di sables feature that forces the radio to do an lqa before attempting an ale call 11 maximum scan channels aka call duration this parameter is used in ale to determine the link call time to stations within the net the calling stations call needs to last long enough so the receiving stations have time to complete their scan cycle this parameter must be set for the worst case radio in the network for example all radios scan five channels except one which scans 10 all radios in the network must set max scan channels to 10 12 maximum tune time this parameter sets t he length of time the calling station waits for the target station to tune its antenna coupler and power am plifier and respond to the call this parameter must be set for the slowest radio tune time in the netwo rk if all radios in the network tune in 4 seconds except one which takes 6 seconds all radios in the network must set this parameter to 6 seconds 13 net address this is list of the addr esses in network the net address requires all radios to be programmed identically the order of all addresses in the network including your self address must be the same in all radios 14 scan rate aka scan minimum dwell 1scan rate this parameter sets the rate that the frequencies will be scanned all radios in the network must be set at the same scan rate 3 channel parameters in addition to the ale param eters the radios have to be programmed with channel parameters depending on the equipment used these parameters may include channel number frequency both receive and transmit power emission modulation type aka emission mode automatic gain control agc channel bandwidth

operations require frequency and network management at theater levels fo r interoperability combined operations will also require frequency and network management if allies us hfale compatible radios inside the borders airspace or territorial waters of foreign countries us forces have independent authority to use radio frequencies they are subject to existing international agreements the us department of state and theater commander coordinate these agreements with allied governments before obtaining rf spectrum authorization abroad it is i mperative that the commander keep in mind the principle of effective and efficient use of the spectrum in addition to other principles of international spectrum authority for example conge stion of radio spectrum in the republic of korea rok has become so significant that it has beco increasingly difficult to assign new soleuser frequencies the rok ministry of information and communications as the assignment authority for all rf requirements in the rok manages the rf spectrum in the ro k closely and requires strong justification for permanent frequency assignments b the lesson here is that commanders mu st be critical in reviewing requirements and requests for new frequency assignments every effo rt should be made to share existing resources and to ensure that the continued use of cu rrently assigned frequencies is absol utely necessary to accomplish the mission 3 frequency allocations assignments fr equency assignments are area dependent thus when units change their ao frequency planning must be addres sed early to
