resources science and industry division agroterrorism threats and preparedness summary the potential for terrorist attacks against agricultural targets agroterrorism is increasingly recognized as national security threat especially after the events of september 11 2001 agroterrorism is subset of bioterrorism and is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease with the goal of generating fear causing economic losses andor undermining social stability the goal of agroterrorism is not to kill cows or plants these are the means to the end of causing economic damage social unrest and loss of confidence in government human health could be at risk if contaminated food reaches the table or if an animal pathogen is transmissible to humans zoonotic while agriculture may not be terrorists first choice because it lacks the shock factor of more traditional terrorist targets many analysts consider it viable secondary target agriculture has several characteristics that pose unique vulnerabilities farms are geographically disbursed in unsecured environments livestock are frequently concentrated in confined locations and transported or commingled with other herds many agricultural diseases can be obtained handled and distributed easily international trade in food products often is tied to diseasefree status which could be jeopardized by an attack many veterinarians lack experience with foreign animal diseases that are eradicated domestically but remain endemic in foreign countries in the past five years food defense has received increasing attention in the counterterrorism and bioterrorism communities laboratory and response capacity are being upgraded to address the reality of agroterrorism and national response plans now incorporate agroterrorism congress has held hearings on agroterrorism and enacted laws and appropriations with agroterrorismrelated provisions the executive branch has responded by implementing the new laws issuing several presidential directives and creating liaison and coordination offices the government accountability office gao has studied several issues related to agroterrorism appropriations and user fees for agriculturerelated homeland security activities in usda and dhs have more than tripled from 225 million preseptember 11 baseline in fy2002 to 818 million in fy2007 agriculture now receives about 21 of the total nondefense budget authority for homeland security increasing the level of agroterrorism preparedness remains concern as do interagency coordination and adequate border

addressing agroterrorism 56 agroterrorism threats and preparedness agriculture as target of terrorism overview of agroterrorism the potential for terrorist attacks against agricultural targets agroterrorism is increasingly recognized as national security threat especially after the events of september 11 2001 in this context agroterrorism is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease with the goal of generating fear over the safety of food causing economic losses andor undermining social stability the response to the threat of agroterrorism has come to be called food defense1 an agroterrorist event would usually involve bioterrorism since likely vectors include pathogens such as viruses bacteria or fungi people more generally associate bioterrorism with outbreaks of human illness eg anthrax or smallpox rather than diseases affecting animals or plants the goal of agroterrorism is not killing cows or plants these are the means to the end of causing economic crises in the agricultural and food industries social unrest and loss of confidence in government human health could be at risk through contaminated food or if an animal pathogen is transmissible to humans zoonotic while agriculture may not be terrorists first choice because it lacks the shock factor of more traditional terrorist targets an increasing number of terrorism analysts consider it viable secondary target2 agroterrorism could be lowcost but highly effective means toward an alqaeda goal of destroying the united states economy evidence that agriculture and food are potential qaeda targets came in 2002 when terrorist hideouts in afghanistan were found containing agricultural documents and manuals describing ways to make animal and plant poisons3 agriculture has several characteristics that pose unique problems 1 the terms food defense food safety and food security refer to different issues food defense refers to protecting the food supply from intentional contamination that is agroterrorism food safety refers to avoiding accidental contamination by promoting safe food handling practices at processors or at home food security refers to having access to enough food to maintain proper nutrition and an active lifestyle avoiding starvation 2 peter chalk the us agricultural system target for alqaeda terrorism monitor march 11 2005

the countryside while some livestock are housed in facilities that can be secured agriculture generally requires large expanses of land that are difficult to secure livestock frequently are concentrated in confined locations eg feedlots with thousands of cattle in openair pens farms with tens of thousands of pigs or barns with hundreds of thousands of poultry allowing diseases to infect more animals quickly concentration in slaughter processing also makes large scale contamination possible the number of lethal and contagious biological agents is greater for plants and animals than for humans most of these diseases are environmentally resilient endemic in foreign countries and not harmful to humans making it easier for terrorists to acquire handle and deploy the pathogens live animals grain and processed food products are routinely transported and commingled in the production and processing system these factors circumvent natural barriers that could slow pathogenic dissemination international trade in livestock grains and food products is often tied to diseasefree status the presence or rumor4 of certain pests or diseases in country can quickly stop exports of commodity cause domestic consumption to drop disrupt commodities markets and can take months or years to recover the past success of keeping many diseases out of the us means that many veterinarians and scientists lack direct experience with foreign diseases this may delay recognition of symptoms in case of an outbreak and the ability to respond to an outbreak thus the general susceptibility of the agriculture and food industry to bioterrorism is difficult to address in systematic way due to the geographically dispersed yet industrially concentrated nature of the industry and the inherent biology of growing plants and raising animals in an attack the agricultural sector would suffer economically from plant and animal health losses and the supply of food and fiber may be reduced the demand for foods targeted in an attack may decline eg dairy beef pork poultry grains fruit or vegetables while demand for substitute foods may rise economic losses would accrue to individuals businesses and governments through costs to contain and eradicate the disease and to dispose of contaminated 4 may 2005 incident in new zealand over the supposed release of foot and mouth disease fmd was declared hoax after two weeks of extensive testing and quarantine of waiheke island httpwwwmafgovtnzmafnetpressoperationwaihekeindexhtm letter demanded money and changes to tax policies the response efforts may have cost the new zealand government about 716000 per day usd crs3 products more losses would accumulate as the supply chain is disrupted from farm tofork domestic markets for food may drop and trade restrictions could be imposed on us exports the economic impact would range from farmers to input suppliers food processors transportation retailers and food service providers significant threats to the currentlyheld notion of food security could affect our social order fear of food shortages moved further from american psyche as the united states from an agrarian society to the industrial and information age nevertheless food remains an important element of everyones daily routine and is necessary for survival scope of this report this report addresses the use of biological weapons against agriculture rather than terrorists using agricultural inputs or equipment in attacks against nonagricultural targets for example the department of transportation issued regulations for developing security plans to protect dangerous agricultural materials such as fuels chemicals and fertilizers against theft5 legislation proposed in 20052006 hr 3197 hr 1389 and s 1141 109th congress would have restricted the handling of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer that can be converted into an explosive another example is the concern over misuse of small aircraft particularly cropdusters to spread biological weapons6 this report focuses primarily on biological weapons rather than chemical weapons because biological weapons generally are considered the more potent agroterrorism threat this report also focuses more on agricultural production than food processing and distribution although the later is discussed for more on chemical and biological weapons see crs report rl32391 smallscale terrorist attacks using chemical and biological agents an assessment framework and preliminary comparisons by dana shea and frank gottron and crs report rl31669 terrorism background on chemical biological and toxin weapons and options for lessening their impact by dana shea federal recognition of agroterrorism even before september 11 2001 and the focus on terrorist threats that ensued references to agroterrorism andor agricultural bioweapons can be found in the government academia and the press for example the gilmore commission on terrorism in its first report to congress in 1999 noted that biological attack against an agricultural target offers terrorists virtually riskfree form of assault which has high probability of success and which also has the prospect of obtaining political objectives such as undermining 5 agricultural inputs as defined in 49 cfr 1718 are included in the security plans required in 49 cfr 172800 6 security issues and guidelines for agricultural aviation are discussed at httpwwwagaviationorgsecuritypagehtm crs4 confidence in the ability of government or giving the terrorists an improved bargaining position7 senator roberts from kansas also raised the awareness of agroterrorism with hearing of the senate committee on armed services in 19998 however as the 20th century ended agriculture and food production received less attention or sometimes was overlooked in federal counterterrorism and homeland security activities presidential directive in 1998 on protecting critical infrastructure did not include agriculture and food agriculture was added to this list only in december 2003 thus after what many observers claim to be slow start after september 11 2001 agriculture now is garnering more attention in the expanding field of terrorism studies and policies agroterrorism received heightened national attention in december 2004 when thensecretary of health and human services tommy thompson said in his resignation speech for the life of i cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do9 congress has held hearings on agroterrorism and while addressing terrorism more broadly has implemented laws and appropriations with provisions important to agriculture the government accountability office gao has studied aspects of food safety border inspections interagency coordination and physical security with respect to agroterrorism the executive branch has responded by implementing the new laws issuing several presidential directives creating terrorism and agroterrorism task forces and publishing protection and response plans the law enforcement community has recognized agroterrorism as threat highlighted by fbi and jttf joint terrorism task force sponsorship of an annual conference on agroterrorism10 the 911 commission national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states does not make any direct references to agroterrorism or terrorism on the food supply in its 2004 report11 however agriculture obviously would be affected along with other sectors of the economy by some of the commissions recommendations regarding coordination of intelligence information sharing and first responders an evaluation of those separate issues however is outside the scope of this report 7 advisory panel to assess domestic

and the food industry are very important to the social economic and arguably the political stability of the united states although farming employs less than 2 of the of the countrys workforce 16 of the workforce is involved in the food and fiber sector ranging from farmers and input suppliers to processors shippers grocers and restauranteurs in 2002 the food and fiber sector contributed 12 trillion or 11 to the gross domestic product gdp even though the farm sector itself contributed less than 112 gross farm sales exceeded 200 billion and are relatively concentrated throughout the midwest parts of the east coast and california figure 1 production is split nearly evenly between crops and livestock in 2002 livestock inventories included 95 million cattle and 60 million hogs farm sales of broilers and other meattype chickens exceeded 85 billion birds13 figure 1 geographic distribution of agricultural production agriculture in the us is technologically advanced and efficient this productivity allows americans to spend only about 10 of their disposable income on food both at home and away from home productivity increases over time have allowed the share of disposable income spent on food in the us to fall from 23 in 1929 to 10 in 2003 the united states has the lowest spending on food prepared at home 65 compared to the rest of the world which ranges from 1015 for most developed countries and 30 or higher for some developing countries14 12 usda economic research service agricultural outlook tables table 1 key statistical indicators april 2005 at

65 for corn 40 for soybeans and 32 for wheat if export markets were to decline following an agroterrorism event us markets could be severely disrupted since 21 of us agricultural production is exported 105 of livestock and 22 of crops the us exported nearly 60 billion of agricultural products 8 of all us exports and imported 47 billion of agricultural products 4 of all us imports making agriculture positive contributor to the countrys balance of trade15 the price of land is directly correlated to the productivity and marketability of agricultural products and the level of federal farm income support payments in 2003 farm assets exceeded 13 trillion with 11 trillion in equity16 land and other real estate accounts for 80 of those assets of the 938 million acres of farm land in the us 46 are in crop land 42 are pasture and range land and 8 are wood land17 agricultural production in the us is concentrated geographically and on subset of large farms although the number of farms in the 2002 census of agriculture totaled 21 million 75 of the value of production occurs on just 67 or 143500 of these farms this subset of farms has average sales of 1 million annually and averages 2000 acres in size livestock and poultry production are concentrated in different regions of the country and in large numbers cattle are the least concentrated of the major types of livestock

cornproducing states iowa illinois nebraska and minnesota produce 54 of the crop figure 5 potential economic consequences economic losses from an agroterrorist incident could be large and widespread first losses would include the value of lost production the cost of destroying diseased or potentially diseased products and the cost of containment drugs diagnostics pesticides and veterinary services second export markets could be lost if importing countries place restrictions on us products to prevent possibilities of the disease spreading sanitary and phytosanitary rules in international trade agreements would be important for maintaining export markets third multiplier effects could ripple through the economy due to decreased sales by agriculturally dependent businesses farm input suppliers food manufacturing transportation retail grocery and food service tourism can be affected of access to certain destinations within the country is limited or perceptions of food or personal safety falter fourth federal and state governments could bear significant costs including eradication and containment costs and compensation to producers for destroyed animals depending on the erosion of consumer confidence and export sales market prices of the affected commodities may drop this would affect producers whose herds or crops were not directly infected making the event national in scale even if the disease itself were contained to small region for food types or product lines that are not contaminated however demand may become stronger and market prices could rise for those products such goods may include substitutes for the food that was the target of the attack eg chicken instead of beef or product that can be certified to originate from outside contaminated area eg beef from another region of the country or imported beef for example when canada announced the discovery of mad cow disease bse or bovine spongiform encephalopathy in may 2003 farmlevel prices of beef in canada dropped by nearly half while beef prices in the united states remained very strong at record or near crs9 record levels when cow with bse was discovered in the united states in december 2003 us beef prices fell but less dramatically than in canada19 consumer confidence in government may also be tested depending on the scale of the eradication effort and means of destroying animals or crops the need to slaughter perhaps hundreds of thousands of cattle or tens of millions of poultry could generate public criticism if depopulation methods are considered inhumane or the destruction of carcases is questioned environmentally for example during the united kingdoms footandmouth fmd outbreak in 2001 euthanizing thousands of cattle and incinerating the carcasses in huge open air pyres provided poignant television images and difficult public relations situations for the agriculture ministry dealing with these concerns can add to the cost for both government and industry depending on the disease and means of transmission the potential for economic damage depends on number of factors such as the disease agent location of the attack rate of transmission geographical dispersion how long it remains undetected availability of countermeasures or quarantines and incident response plans potential costs are difficult to estimate and can vary widely based on compounding assumptions drawing on the fmd outbreak in the united kingdom in 2001 price waterhouse coopers estimated that the economic impact was 1389 to 4477 for each of the 26 million head of livestock cattle sheep and hogs on which indemnities were paid in the uk these impacts exceed the value of the animals because of the number of industries affected by the outbreak ranging from feed suppliers to tourism applying the loss ratios from the uk incident to the larger us livestock industry price waterhouse coopers estimates that 75 million animals 53 million cattle 14 million hogs and 800000 sheep might be destroyed in similar scale outbreak in the united states the resulting economic impact could range from 104 billion to 336 billion using the range of impacts estimated from the uk20 2002 national defense university study estimates that limited outbreak of fmd on just 10 farms could have 2 billion financial impact21 study by the usda economic research service ers outlines the

united states department of agriculture usda on african swine fever suggested that if the disease were to become entrenched in the us the 10year impact would be at least 54 billion23 the impact in todays dollars could be much higher however not all assessments agree that the economic consequences of an agroterrorist attack would be large and widespread december 2004 report by the congressional budget office cbo concludes that the nations economic loss from an agroterrorist attack would probably be small primarily because the food and agriculture industry is well adapted to the prospect of disruptions from weather pests and occasional health incidents24 the cbo report also suggests that the food industrys experience recalling contaminated lots and the existence of commodity support programs to sustain the incomes of some agricultural producers might keep economic losses within the realm of industry experience and current public plans for detection and response25 such conclusion likely overstates the capacity of traditional farm commodity programs to respond to the scale devastation possible in agroterrorism the purpose of farm commodity programs is to support farm income when prices and production vary within normal yeartoyear cycles they were never envisioned to compensate for losses due to agroterrorism or even widespread pest and disease outbreaks the federal farm commodity support programs subsidize about 25 agricultural commodities such as corn wheat soybeans rice and cotton these supported commodities represent about onethird of gross farm sales the list of commodities that normally do not receive direct support includes meats poultry fruits vegetables nuts and nursery products these nonsupported commodities account for about twothirds of gross farm sales26 and are possibly more likely to be the targets of an agroterrorist attack thus the food products more vulnerable to attack meats fruits and vegetables do not have existing federal farm income support programs food processors or 22 kenneth h mathews and janet perry the economic consequences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and food and mouth disease outbreaks in the united states

and issues for congress by jim monke crs11 retailers beyond the farm gate do not receive any commodity support payments any federal assistance to producers or processors stemming from an agroterrorist attack would likely come from the emergency transfer authority available to the secretary of agriculture27 for producers and through supplemental emergency appropriations enacted by congress for producers and possibly processors making disaster payments to individuals who do not normally receive commodity payments is technically more difficult than supplementing regular program payments in the end despite the cbo suggestion that the economic effects of agroterrorism might fall within the realm of normal experience numerous federal agencies state agencies and private corporations continue to prepare for agroterrorism based on the assumption that an attack could exceed the typical experience with naturally or accidentally occurring outbreaks brief history of agricultural bioweapons attacks against agricultural production are not new and have been conducted both by nationstates and by substate organizations throughout history28 at least nine countries had documented agricultural bioweapons programs during some part of the 20th century canada france germany iraq japan south africa united kingdom united states and the former ussr four other countries are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programs egypt north korea rhodesia and syria29 despite extensive research on the issue however biological weapons have been used rarely against crops or livestock especially by state actors examples of state actors using biological weapons against agriculture include germanys use of glanders against allied horses and mules in world war i the alleged use of anthrax and rinderpest by japan in world war ii and the alleged use of glanders by soviet 27 for pest and disease emergencies the secretary of agriculture has longstanding authority to transfer money from the commodity credit corporation ccc to the animal and plant health inspection service both for eradication and control and indemnities to producers 7 usc 7772 and 7 usc 8316 between 168

weapons against agricultural targets has remained mostly theoretical consideration with the ratification of the biological and toxin weapons convention in 1972 many countries including the united states stopped military development of biological weapons and destroyed their stockpiles although individuals or substate groups have used bioweapons against agricultural or food targets only few can

us used agent orange to destroy foliage affecting some crops among possible terrorist events chemical attacks against agricultural targets include 1997 attack by israeli settlers who sprayed pesticides on grapevines in two palestinian villages destroying up to 17000 metric tons of grapes in 1978 the arab revolutionary council poisoned israeli oranges with mercury injuring at least 12 people and reducing orange exports by 4032 congressional responses hearings on agroterrorism from 1999 to 2006 congress has held five hearings entirely devoted to agroterrorism or agricultural biosecurity four in the senate and one in the house each by different committee or subcommittee the first congressional hearing on agroterrorism was in october 1999 called by senator pat roberts of the subcommittee on emerging threats in the senate committee on armed services the hearing was titled the agricultural biological weapons threat to the united states and had both closed and open sessions with different witnesses33 four years later on november 19 2003 the senate committee on governmental affairs held an open hearing titled agroterrorism the threat to americas breadbasket

expanded agricultural security activities and security upgrades at usda facilities sections 331335 address criminal penalties for terrorism against animal enterprises section 336 and violation of the select agent rules section 231 expanded fda authority over food the bioterrorism preparedness act responded to longstanding concerns about whether the food and drug administration fda in the department of health and human services hhs had the authority to assure food safety fda was instructed to implement new rules for 1 registration of food processors 2 prior notice of food imports 3 administrative detention of imports and 4 recordkeeping39 proposed rules began being issued in early 2003 the final set of rules was published in december 200440 registration of food processors the act required fda to establish onetime registration system for any domestic or foreign facility that manufactures processes packs and handles food all food facilities supplying food for the united states were required to register with the fda by december 12 2003 21 cfr 1225 to 1243 registering involved providing information about the food products brand names and general food categories facility addresses and contact information restaurants certain retail stores farms nonprofit food and feeding establishments fishing vessels and trucks and other motor carriers were exempt from registration requirements however many farms had difficult time determining whether they needed to register based on the amount of handling or processing they performed registration documents are protected from public disclosure under the freedom of information act foia the registry provides for the first time complete list of companies subject to fda authority and will enhance the agencys capability to trace contaminated food critics argued that registration created record keeping burden without proof that facilities will be able to respond in an emergency prior notice of imports as of december 12 2003 importers are required to give advance notice to fda prior to importing food 21 cfr 1276 to 1285 electronic notice must be provided by the importer within specified period prior to arrival at the border within two hours by road four hours by air or rail and eight hours by water with prior notice fda can assess whether shipment meets criteria that can trigger an inspection if notice is not given the food will be refused entry and held at the port or in secure storage some critics are concerned that the 39 for greater detail about these rules please see crs report rl31853 food safety issues in the 109th congress by donna vogt 40 fda fda actions on new bioterrorism legislation at httpwwwcfsanfdagov dmsfsbtacthtml crs15 administrative cost of compliance may raise the price of food others have argued that perishable imports are subject to increased spoilage if delays arise or that certain perishables especially from mexico are not harvested or loaded onto trucks before the twohour notification period however implementation of the new system generally has not caused delays and most shippers have been accommodated to facilitate compliance fda and the department of homeland security dhs bureau of customs and border protection cbp integrated their information systems to allow food importers to provide the required information using cbps existing system for imports in december 2003 the two agencies agreed to allow cbp officers to inspect imported foods on fdas behalf particularly at ports where fda has inspectors administrative detention upon enactment of the act fda obtained the authority to detain food imports under certain conditions fda procedures for making detention were issued on june 4 2004 21 cfr 1377 to 1406 to use the authority the agency must show credible evidence that shipment presents serious health threat food may be detained for 20 days and up to 30 days if necessary the owners must pay the expense of moving any detained food to secure storage perishable foods eg fruits vegetables and seafood are to receive expedited review maintenance of records fda published proposed rule for record keeping on may 9 2003 and issued corrected final rule on february 23 2005 21 cfr 1363 to 1368 people or companies that manufacture process pack transport distribute receive hold or import food with the exception of farms restaurants and certain others must establish and maintain records for up to two years in the event of suspected food safety problem the regulation provides fda access to records including the facilitys immediate supplier and the immediate customer companies can keep the information in any form and use existing records the rule limits access to records that may contain trade secrets and prevent disclosure of such confidential information if records are reviewed fda is allowed to reduce the recordkeeping requirements for small businesses and to exempt farms restaurants and fishing vessels not engaged in processing tighter security for biological agents and toxins in december 2002 the usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis issued regulations to reduce the threat that certain biological agents and toxins could be used in domestic or international terrorism aphis determined that the select agents on the list have the potential to pose severe threat to agricultural production or food products the select agent regulations 9 cfr 121 for animals 7 cfr 331 for plants establish the requirements for possession use and transfer of the listed pathogens the rules affect many research institutions including federal state university and private laboratories as well as firms that transport such materials the laboratories have had to assess security vulnerabilities and upgrade physical security often without additional financial resources some have been concerned that certain crs16 research programs may be discontinued or avoided because of regulatory difficulties in handling the select agents extensive registration and background checks of both facilities and personnel were to be conducted in 2003 however due to delays at the fbi in processing security clearance paperwork provisional registrations were issued to laboratories that had submitted paperwork by established deadlines homeland security act pl 107296 the main purpose of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 november 25 2002 was to create the department of homeland security dhs primarily by transferring parts or all of many agencies throughout the federal government into the new cabinetlevel department in doing so the law made two major changes to the facilities and functions of the us department of agriculture the homeland security act transferred personnel and responsibility for agricultural border inspections from usda to dhs specifically from the usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis to dhs customs and border protection cbp and possession of the plum island animal disease center in new york from usda to dhs transferring agricultural border inspections section 421 of the homeland security act authorized the transfer of up to 3200 aphis border inspection personnel to dhs as of march 1 2003 approximately 2680 aphis inspectors became employees of dhs in the bureau of customs and border inspection cbp because of its scientific expertise usda retains significant presence in border inspection as described below historically the aphis agricultural quarantine inspection aqi program was considered the most significant and prominent of agricultural and food inspections at the border because of this prominence aqi was one of the many programs selected for inclusion when dhs was created some drafts of the bill creating the new department would have transferred all of aphis including for example animal welfare and disease eradication to dhs concerns from many farm interest groups about the impact this might have on diagnosis and treatment of naturally occurring plant and animal diseases prompted legislative compromise that transferred only the border inspection function and left other activities under usda dhscbp personnel now inspect international conveyances and the baggage of passengers for plant animal and related products that could harbor pests or disease organisms they also inspect ship and air cargo rail and truck freight and package mail from foreign countries although the border inspection functions were transferred to dhs the usda retains significant presence in border activities aphis employees who were not transferred continue to preclear certain commodities inspect all plant propagative crs17 materials and check animals in quarantine aphis personnel continue to set agricultural inspection policies to be carried out by dhs border inspectors and negotiate memoranda of understanding to assure that necessary inspections are conducted aphis manages the data collected during the inspections process and monitors smuggling and trade compliance usda is also statutorily charged in section 421e2a of pl 107296 to supervise the training of cbp inspectors in consultation with dhs this separation of duties is designed to allow for consolidated border inspections for intelligence and security goals but preserve usdas expertise and historical mission to set agricultural import policies adding agriculture specialists under the cbp crosstraining initiative in 2003 also known as one face at the border cbp inspectors from the former customs immigration and agriculture agencies were to be trained to perform inspections in all three areas equally without specialization customs immigration and agriculture however due to criticism from usda inspection unions and the agricultural industry dhs created another class of inspectors called agriculture specialists agriculture specialists work mainly in secondary inspection stations in passenger terminals and are deployed at cargo terminals the cadre of agriculture specialists include former aphis inspectors who decided not to convert to cbp generalist inspectors plus new graduates from the agricultural specialist training program before dhs was created aphis trained its inspectors in nineweek course that had science prerequisites the initial dhs crosstraining program announced in 2003 had only 1216 hours for agriculture in 71day course covering customs immigration and agriculture this difference in training was one of the reasons dhs was forced to add the agricultural specialist position dhs now has an eightweek 43day training program for agriculture specialists the course is taught by cbp and aphis instructors at usda training facility in frederick maryland agriculture specialists also receive two weeks of law enforcement training and can exercise law enforcement authority similar to regular cbp officers however cbp does not necessarily allow agriculture specialists to use the full extent of their law enforcement powers41 the first class of agriculture specialists graduated in july 2004 regular cbp officers receive about 1216 hours of agricultural training during their multiweek program at the federal law enforcement training center fletc in georgia the agriculture module was developed by aphis and provided to dhs although dhs is training new agriculture specialists the future size of the agricultural specialist corps is not certain given the eventual attrition of former aphis inspectors also details are not available as to how these inspectors will be deployed and how many ports of entry will be staffed with agriculture specialists 41 agriculture specialists do not carry firearms like regular cbp officers cbp is still deciding whether agriculture specialists will carry mace batons or firearms crs18 compared with the aphis deployment prior to dhs without agriculture specialists primary agricultural inspections the first line of defense for agricultural security may be conducted by crosstrained inspectors with limited agricultural training congressional agriculture committees have been concerned about whether enough attention will be devoted to agricultural inspections by dhs and whether the united states will be as safe from the introduction of foreign pests as it was under the previous inspection system inspection statistics from the fall of 2003 indicate that 32 fewer insect infestations were found under dhs than in the previous year under aphis aphis officials cite unfilled agricultural inspector positions and difficulty in adequately crosstraining former customs and immigration officers to conduct agricultural inspections42 the fy2007 dhs appropriations act supports the crosstraining initiative under one face at the border hrept 109699 the conferees recognize the benefits of crosstraining legacy customs immigration and agricultural inspection officers as part of cbps one face at the border initiative and direct cbp to ensure that all personnel assigned to primary and secondary inspection duties at ports of entry have received adequate training in all relevant inspection functions report by the government accountability office in may 2006 found that only 21 of agricultural specialists always receive urgent alerts for agricultural inspection priorities in timely manner moreover the number of canine units inspection dogs beagle brigade has declined from 140 to 80 since the transfer to dhs and 60 of 43 canine teams that were tested failed proficiency test in followup memorandum the gao analyzed survey of morale among agricultural specialists and found many more negative responses than positive comments see gao studies below for more information about inspection statistics and the new border inspection arrangement that combines the previously separate customs immigration and agriculture inspections please see crs report rl32399 border security inspections practices policies and issues plum island animal disease center section 310 of the homeland security act transferred the plum island animal disease center to dhs prior to june 1 2003 plum island was usda facility jointly operated by aphis and ars agricultural research service this transfer includes only the property and facilities of plum island both aphis and ars personnel continue to perform research and diagnostic work at the facility but dhs also may conduct other research at the facility as well plum island and dhss plans for new national bio and agrodefense facility are discussed later in this report under laboratories and research centers 42 chicago sun times shortstaffed port inspectors missing insectinfested food aug 6 2004 crs19 animal enterprise terrorism act pl 109374 the animal enterprise terrorism act pl 109374 nov 27 2006 was enacted to expand criminal consequences for damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise the bioterrorism preparedness act pl 107 188 sec 336 contained less extensive penalties for animal enterprise terrorism pl 109374 prescribes penalties and restitution in title 18 of the us code for varying levels of economic damage and personal injury involving threats acts of vandalism property damage criminal trespass harassment or intimidation the act covers enterprises that use sell or raise animals or animal products for profit or educational purposes with this broad definition the law applies to both bioterrorism from foreign sources and ecoterrorism from domestic animal rights activist groups gao studies since 2002 six reports from gao have found gaps in federal controls for protecting agriculture and food findings from the first four reports are summarized in testimony for the senate hearing on agroterrorism on

found numerous vulnerability assessments and working groups had been prepared to prioritize and oversee activities efforts at interagency coordination were also underway but some were seen to be in the early stages with more coordination necessary the report also cited lack of veterinarians trained in foreign animal diseases and response capacity lack of rapid diagnostic tools and lack of rapid vaccine deployment and protocols in the conference agreement for the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 hrept 108792 conferees expressed concern over agricultural border inspections and research at plum island following the transfer of these activities in 2003 from usda to dhs they requested gao report on interagency coordination between usda and dhs regarding agriculture inspections the conferees are aware of ongoing concerns within the agriculture sector that the transfer of these responsibilities border inspection and research may shift the focus away from agriculture to other priority areas of dhs in order to ensure that the interests of us agriculture are protected the conferees request the government accountability office to provide report on the coordination between usda and dhs hrept 108792 accomplishments in interagency coordination that gao cited in the 2006 report49 include training of both agricultural specialists and crosstraining of regular border protection officers agriculture specialists now have access to classified data systems allowing better targeting of agriculture inspections dhs also created agriculture liaisons in district field offices to assure agriculture issues are heard and improve operations at ports of entry however problems in coordination or inspection performance were cited in several areas dhs had not developed performance measures for agriculture inspections but was still using usdaaphis measures which did not reflect all dhs activities staffing and related staffing performance measures were also lacking agriculture specialists are not always notified of urgent inspection alerts issued by aphis survey suggests only 21 of agriculture specialists always receive alerts in timely manner the number of canine units inspection dogs beagle brigade has declined from 140 to 80 since the transfer to dhs and 60 of 43 canine teams that were tested failed an aphis proficiency test several financial management issues also were problematic while user fees were less than program costs dhs was unable to provide aphis with information of actual costs by type of activity and usda was sometimes slow to transfer user fees to dhs 48 gao much is being done to protect agriculture from terrorist attack but important challenges remain gao05214 mar 8 2005 49 gao management and coordination problems

29 were concerned that the agricultural mission is declining an estimated 64 thought their dhs managers did not respect their work and 29 expressed concern about working relationships with nonagriculture inspectors executive branch responses shortly after september 11 2001 usda created homeland security staff in the office of the secretary to develop departmentwide plan to coordinate agroterrorism preparedness plans among all usda agencies and offices efforts have been focused on three areas food supply and agricultural production usda facilities and usda staff and emergency preparedness51 the homeland security staff also has become the departments liaison with congress the department of homeland security dhs and other governmental agencies on terrorism issues the white houses national security council weapons of mass destruction wmd preparedness group formed by presidential decision directive 62 pdd62 in 1998 included agriculture especially in terms of combating terrorism many observers note that as latecomer to the national security table usda has been invariably overshadowed by other agencies in addition to the following presidential directives and actions many departments and agencies in the executive branch have undertaken efforts to improve preparedness for agroterrorism many of these actions are discussed later in this report under countering the

directive 5 hspd5 called for national response plan nrp to coordinate federal bureaucracies capabilities and resources into unified alldiscipline and allhazards approach to manage domestic incidents both for terrorism and natural disasters the national response plan developed by dhs was unveiled in december 200455 the nrp addresses agriculture and food in two annexes at the end of the plan the first is in terms of emergency support the emergency support function esf annexes to the nrp seek to coordinate federal interagency support by describing the roles and responsibilities of departments and agencies usda is the coordinator and primary responding agency for esf 11 the agriculture and natural resources annex which addresses provision of nutrition assistance by determining nutrition assistance needs in disaster areas obtaining appropriate food supplies arranging for delivery of the supplies and authorizing disaster food stamps control and eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases assurance of food safety and food security including food safety inspection at processing plants distribution retail sites and ports of entry laboratory analysis of food samples food borne disease surveillance and field investigations and protection of natural and cultural resources and historic properties the nrp also contains incident annexes that more specifically address hazard situations requiring special attention the incident annexes describe the overarching policies situations general operating procedures and responsibilities most relevant when responding to particular

national response plan december 2004 updated 2006 httpwwwdhsgovnrp crs24 the 10page food and agriculture incident annex56 was first published in july 2006 about 18 months after the nrp was first released the annex identifies roles for federal involvement particularly when first responders at the state and local levels are overwhelmed by multiple incidents for example it establishes usda and hhs as the primary agencies for coordination and notification when incidents and outbreaks affect food and agriculture but law enforcement agencies are to be notified immediately through the fbi if the incident appears to be intentional hhs is the coordinating agency for food inspected by the fda beyond the farm gate all domestic and imported food except meat poultry and egg products animal feed and animal drugs usda is the coordinating agency for food inspected by the food safety inspection service fsis such as processed meat poultry and egg products and for coordinating the response to animal and plant diseases and pests epa is identified in the annex to provide expedited assistance for approving particular types of pesticide applications and to provide technical assistance for decontamination and disposal efforts dhs appears to be involved to the extent that other parts of the nrp are activated by the agriculture and food incident especially when law enforcement investigative or border inspection activities are involved the annex mentions the importance of laboratory networks for detection diagnosis confirmation and investigation of an incident particularly through the dhs integrated consortium of laboratory networks icln the capacity of the icln derives from established laboratory networks such as food emergency response network fern the laboratory response network lrn the national animal health laboratory network nahln and the national plant diagnostic network npdn each of these networks discussed later in this section feeds its industry and

these programs include the ars research on foreign animal diseases at the plum island animal disease center in new york the physical facility is now managed and operated by dhs and the ars southeast poultry research lab in athens georgia three major usda laboratories are consolidating operations in new bsl3 agriculture facility in ames iowa called the national centers for animal health these include the ars national animal disease center nadc the aphis national veterinary services laboratories nvsl and the aphis center for veterinary biologics cvb the complex will be usdas largest animal health center for research diagnosis and product evaluation the nvsl is especially visible because it makes the final official determination for the presence of most animal diseases when samples are submitted for testing usda also cooperates with other federal agencies on counterterrorism research and preparedness including the ars and aphis partnership with the us army medical research institute

networks several laboratory networks have been created for animal plant food and general bioterrorism issues the primary goals of these networks are to improve the diagnosis and detection of deliberate or accidental disease outbreak primary examples are the cdcled laboratory response network lrn the usdafunded national plant diagnostic network npdn and its sister group the national animal health laboratory network nahln and the joint fdafsis food emergency response network fern laboratory response network lrn67 the laboratory response network created by cdc is national and international network of about 140 laboratories equipped to respond quickly to acts of chemical or biological terrorism emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats and emergencies the network includes federal labs cdc usda fda state and local public health labs military labs food labs environmental labs veterinary labs and international labs in canada the united kingdom and australia national plant diagnostic network npdn68 the national plant diagnostic network is collective of land grant university plant disease and pest diagnostic facilities organized by usda the national network is led by five regional labs cornell florida michigan state kansas state and california at davis and one support lab texas tech the npdn facilitates the initial detection positive identification national notification and coordinated response to pests and pathogens by intentional accidental or natural means by using common communications and laboratory testing protocols the network allows efficient timely and secure exchange of plant disease information national animal health laboratory network nahln this network created by usda and the american association of veterinary laboratory diagnosticians augments federal resources with extensive state and university laboratories to allow better detection and response to animal health emergencies these labs provide timely and consistent methods and meet epidemiological reporting standards the usda national veterinary services laboratory nvsl serves as the central reference laboratory state and university labs perform nonemergency surveillance testing provide surge capacity during outbreaks assist with epidemiologic investigations and conducting followup surveillance 67 centers for disease control and prevention

important network albeit not laboratory network is the extension disaster education network eden69 eden is sponsored by usda and links extension educators from various states and disciplines to share

universities and will receive 15 million the house appropriations committee addressed agroterrorism research in report language for the fy2004 homeland security appropriations bill the centers for excellence program appears to fit the type of research the committee suggested agroterrorism research the committee is familiar with potential agrobioterrorism vulnerabilities from animal and plant diseases to food chain introductions while some agroterrorism research is already being done by the department of agriculture the committee is aware of the need for more such research particularly in the areas of threats to field crops farm animals and food in the processing and distribution chain the homeland security act of 2002 provides for coordination of research between the department of homeland security dhs and other relevant federal agencies in various areas of research because the department of agriculture usda already possesses mechanisms authorities and personnel to carry out needed agrobioterrorism research the committee expects to see effective coordination between the usda and the dhs to move such research forward in an effective and expeditious fashion the committee expects usda to coordinate with dhs to identify research gaps and develop plan to include research priorities for proceeding to fill such gaps 69 extension disaster education network httpwwwedenlsuedu

federal funding for agroterrorism preparedness broadly including appropriations and user fees both within usda and dhs however some general activities that support agroterrorism preparedness such as certain intelligence and warning functions performed by the fbi and cia often cannot be identified exclusively as agriculture spending and thus cannot be included in this report however items that can be identified specifically to agroterrorism preparedness within the budgets of usda and dhs are included the presidents annual budget request to congress includes governmentwide crosscutting budget analysis of homeland security issues as mandated by the homeland security act of 2002 pl107296 section 88971 the budget request includes details on the most recently passed appropriations law and the previous fiscal year comprehensive details on agroterrorism funding are difficult if not impossible to compute while appropriations bills are being debated in the house and senate legislative language

classifying spending on agroterrorism and homeland security requires judgements about which programs are relevant especially when some have dual purposes72 this subjectivity introduces discrepancies when agencies refine criteria or definitions or change the way activities are characterized in their homeland security mission in such cases the most recently available data are used to update prior year data examples of dualuse programs for agricultural homeland security are animal and plant health programs these programs such as border inspection and disease surveillance existed before september 11 2001 and would be needed at some level due to natural and accidental disease outbreaks however the scale and scope of these programs have been expanded primarily due to agroterrorism for budget and accounting purposes all or part of dualuse activities may be counted as homeland security spending depending on each agencys criteria for example gao reports that the animal and plant health inspection service aphis attributes 100 of an activitys budget authority to homeland security if any of the following questions apply73 is this new activity or program focus as result of 911 has the bulk of the program activity changed as result of 911 does the activity address international pest or disease outbreaks or other acts of agrobioterrorism was the activity initiated with homeland security supplemental funds did aphis receive enhanced homeland security funds for the activity is the activity needed in order to comply with one or more homeland security presidential directives or the bioterrorism act of 2002 by year and source prior to september 11 2001 usda spent between 4560 million in regular annual appropriations to combat terrorism primarily through border

httpwwwobpausdagovbudsumfy08budsumpdf crs43 possible pathogens in an agroterrorist attack of the hundreds of animal and plant pathogens and pests available to an agroterrorist perhaps fewer than couple of dozen represent significant economic threats determinants of this level of threat are the agents contagiousness and potential for rapid spread and its international status as reportable pest or disease ie subject to international quarantine under rules of the world organization for animal health also commonly known as the oie the office international des epizooties74 widely accepted view among scientists is that livestock are more susceptible to agroterrorism than cultivated plants much of this has to do with the success of efforts to systematically eliminate animals diseases from us herds which leaves current herds either unvaccinated or relatively unmonitored for such diseases by farmers and some local veterinarians once infected livestock can often act as the vector for continuing to transmit the disease facilitating an outbreaks spread especially when live animals are transported certain animal diseases may be more attractive to terrorists because they can be zoonotic or transmissible to humans75 in contrast number of plant pathogens continue to exist in small areas of the us and continue to infect limited areas of plants each year making outbreaks and control efforts more routine moreover plant pathogens generally are more difficult to manipulate from technical perspective some plant pathogens require particular environmental conditions of humidity temperature or wind to take hold or spread other plant diseases may take longer time than an animal disease to become established or achieve level of destruction that terrorist may desire animal pathogens the agricultural bioterrorism protection act of 2002 subtitle b of pl 107 188 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act created the current official list of animal pathogens that are of greatest concern for agroterrorism the list is specified in the select agent rules implemented by usda aphis and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of the department of health and human services hhs the act requires that these lists table 5 be reviewed at least every two years 74 the oie is an international organization created in 1924 with 166 member countries it is wellrespected information clearinghouse for animal diseases and health member countries report diseases that occur on their territory and the oie disseminates the information allowing other countries to take preventive action the oie also analyses scientific information on animal disease control provides technical support and develops normative documents that are recognized by the world trade organization for international trade and sanitary rules see httpwwwoieint 75 some of the biological pathogens of concern to agriculture are discussed in crs report rl32391 smallscale terrorist attacks using chemical and biological agents an assessment framework and preliminary comparisons by dana shea and frank gottron crs44 the select agent list for animal pathogens draws heavily from the enduring and highly respected oie lists of highconcern pathogens the select agent list is comprised of an aphisonly list of concern to animals and an overlap list of agents selected both by aphis and cdc of concern to both animals and humans76 oie list prior to the agricultural bioterrorism protection act the commonly accepted animal diseases of concern were all of the oies list diseases and some of the list b diseases in 2004 the oie replaced its lists and b with single list77 that is more compatible with the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement sps of the world trade organization wto the new oie list classifies diseases equally giving each the same degree of importance in international trade78 many of these oielisted diseases are included in the select agent list table 5 the oies list diseases were transmissible animal diseases that had the potential for very serious and rapid spread irrespective of national borders list diseases had serious socioeconomic or public health consequences and were of major importance in international trade list b diseases were transmissible diseases considered to be of socioeconomic or public health importance within countries and significant in international trade in creating the new list oie reviewed its criteria for including disease and the disease or epidemiological events that require member countries to file reports nearly all of the former list and list b diseases are included in the new single oie list select agents list the regulations establishing the select agent list for animals 9 cfr 121 set forth the requirements for possession use and transfer of these biological agents or toxins they are intended to ensure safe handling and for security to protect the agents from use in domestic or international terrorism aphis and cdc determined that the biological agents and toxins on the list have the potential to pose severe threat to agricultural production or food products the 23 animal diseases listed exclusively by aphis in 9 cfr 1213 the left column of table 5 include 20 of the oielisted diseases and three other disease agents akabane camel pox and menangle considered to be emerging animal health risks for terrorism the much larger oie list includes other diseases that are not listed as select agents however the select agent list was created to account for the additional risks perceived to be posed by terrorism 76 for descriptions of the diseases listed in table 5 see the united states animal health associations gray book at httpwwwvetugaeduvppgray_bookfadindexhtm and the oies technical

q fever eastern equine encephalitis tularemia and venezuelan equine encephalitis analysis the select agent list designates and regulates pathogens not diseases by regulating access to and handling of highconsequence pathogens the overlap list is more comprehensive than diseaseonly list because certain pathogens crs46 may not cause disease per but may cause symptoms such as food poisoning or central nervous systems responses some of select agent pathogens receive more attention than others for example foot and mouth disease fmd is probably the most frequently mentioned disease when agroterrorism is discussed due to its ease of use ability to spread rapidly and potential for great economic damage in testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee on november 19 2003 dr thomas mcginn of the north carolina department of agriculture described simulation of an fmd attack by terrorist at single location only after the 5th day of the attack would the disease be detected by which time it may have spread to 23 states by the 8th day 23 million animals may need to be destroyed in 29 states79 on the other hand the causative agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease is considered dangerous enough to be select agent even though mad cow disease is less likely to be terrorists choice than other diseases with bse infection is not certain symptoms take years to manifest and the disease may not be detected all making credit for an attack more doubtful widespread animal diseases like brucellosis influenza or tuberculosis receive relatively less attention than fmd hog cholera or newcastle disease however emerging diseases such as nipah virus hendra virus and the h5n1 strain of avian influenza zoonotic diseases that have infected people mostly in asia can be lethal since vaccines are elusive or have not been developed plant pathogens the agricultural bioterrorism protection act of 2002 subtitle b of pl 107 188 also instructed aphis and cdc to create the current official list of potential plant pathogens the federal government lists biological agents and toxins for plants in 7 cfr 3313 table 6 the act requires that these lists be reviewed at least every two years and revised as necessary80 prior to the act there was not commonly recognized list of the most dangerous plant pathogens although several diseases were usually mentioned and are now included in the aphis select agent list the list of seven biological agents and toxins in 7 cfr 3313 was compiled by the plant protection and quarantine ppq program in aphis in consultation with usdas agricultural research service forest service cooperative state research education and extension service and the american phytopathological society the listed agents and toxins are viruses bacteria or fungi that can pose severe threat to 79 shrg 108491 agroterrorism the threat to americas breadbasket senate committee on governmental affairs nov 19 2003 pp 10 and 65 httpfrwebgateaccessgpogov cgibingetdoccgidbname108_senate_hearingsdocid f91045waispdf 80 the list originally included soybean rust phakopsora pachyrhizi and plum pox plum pox potyvirus which were later removed for example when soybean rust became endemic in the southern united states access as select agent became less important crs47 number of important crops including potatoes rice corn and citrus because the pathogens can cause widespread crop losses and economic damage they could potentially be used by terrorists other plant pathogens not included in the select agent list possibly could be used against certain crops or geographic regions examples include karnal bunt citrus canker and soybean rust all of which currently exist in the us in regions quarantined or under surveillance by usda as with other agents the effectiveness of an attack to spread such disease may be dependent on environmental conditions and difficult to achieve table 6 plant diseases in the

threat the goal of the us animal and plant health safeguarding system is to prevent the introduction and establishment of exotic pests and diseases to mitigate their effects when present and to eradicate them when feasible in the past introductions of pests and pathogens were presumed to be unintentional and occurred through natural migration across borders or accidental movement by international commerce passengers conveyance or cargo however system designed for accidental or natural outbreaks is not sufficient for defending against intentional attack consequently the us system is being upgraded to address the reality of agroterrorism different analysts and agencies have various ways to outline response for agroterrorism the national research council outlines threepronged strategy for countering the threat of agroterrorism81 deterrence and prevention detection and response recovery and management 81 national research council 2003 p 4159 crs48 even though foreign terrorist attacks on crops or livestock have occurred in the united states government agencies and private businesses have not taken the threat lightly biosecurity is an increasingly prominent among food manufacturers merchandisers retailers and commercial farmers many agribusinesses have prepared response plans or added security measures to protect their product and brand names ranging from input sources to processing and retail distribution networks deterrence and prevention primary prevention and deterrence interventions for foreign pests and diseases include international treaties and standards such as the international plant protection convention and those of the oieworld organization for animal health bilateral and multilateral cooperative efforts offshore activities in host countries portof entry inspections quarantine treatment and postimport tracking of plants animals and their products every link in the agricultural production chain is susceptible to attack with biological weapon traditionally the first defense against foreign animal or plant disease has been to try to keep it out of the country agricultural inspectors at foreign preclearance inspections and at the us borders are the first line of defense82 smuggling interdiction efforts can act as deterrents before biological agents reach their target dhs and usda already conduct such inspection and quarantine practices but continued oversight is necessary to determine which preparedness activities and threats need more attention offshore activities include preclearance inspection by aphis of us imports before products leave their port of origin aphis has personnel in at least 27 host countries although many of these inspections programs were built to target unintentional threats they are being augmented with personnel and technology to look for intentional threats various us intelligence and law enforcement agencies collect information about biological weapons that could be used against us agriculture building and maintaining climate of information sharing between usda dhs and the intelligence community is necessary especially so that agriculture is not overlooked compared to other infrastructure and human targets once inside the us many parts of the food production chain may be susceptible to attack with biological weapon for example terrorists may have unmonitored access to geographically remote crop fields and livestock feedlots diseases may infect herds more rapidly in modern concentrated confinement livestock operations than in open pastures an undetected disease may spread rapidly because livestock are transported more frequently and over greater distances between 82 for more discussion of current border inspections practices and data on past agricultural and other inspections programs see crs report rl32399 border security inspections practices policies and issues by ruth wasem et crs49 farms and to processing plants processing plants and shipping containers need to be secured andor tracked to prevent tampering an important line of defense is biosecurity the use of preventive security measures against pathogens on farms biosecurity includes farm management practices that both protect animals and crops from the introduction of infectious agents and contain disease to prevent its rapid spread within herd or to other farms biosecurity practices include structural enclosures to limit outside exposure to people and wild animals and the cleaning and disinfection of people clothing vehicles equipment and supplies entering the farm usda promotes such practices for poultry in program called biosecurity for the birds83 most farm specialists agree that livestock farmers are increasingly aware of the importance of biosecurity measures particularly since the fmd outbreaks in european cattle and the avian flu and exotic newcastle infections in us poultry more farm operators are restricting visitors or requiring them to wear boot covers or other protective clothing to guard against bringing in disease regardless of the reason for following biosecurity measures terrorism or accidents these precautions help prepare farms against diseases detection and response in the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108199 the conference committee made the following observation about agroterrorism preparedness the conferees agree that emergency preparedness related to field crops farm animals and food processing and distribution is of critical importance and that the agriculture and food sectors are part of the critical infrastructure requiring heightened attention and protection given the integral roles of state and local governments and the private sector in detecting deterring and responding to acts of agroterrorism the conferees expect the department of agriculture and the department of homeland security to coordinate efforts in assisting states particularly by providing financial and technical support to initiatives oriented toward interstate cooperation in joint preparedness initiatives the conferees are particularly interested in those states that have developed or are currently developing coordinated interstate initiatives hrept 108401for pl 108 199 because biological attacks on crops and livestock may not be immediately apparent existing frameworks for detecting identifying reporting tracking and managing natural and accidental disease outbreaks need to be upgraded to combat agroterrorism appropriate responses are being developed based on specific pathogens targets and other circumstances that may surround an attack the exact methods for control and eradication operations are difficult to predict past experience and simulations have shown that daytoday decisions would be made using decision trees that include factors such as the geographical spread 83 usdaaphis biosecurity for the birds biosecurity tips 6 ways to prevent poultry disease httpwwwaphisusdagovvsbirdbiosecuritytipshtml crs50 rates of infestation available personnel public sentiment and industry cooperation response procedures are outlined in the aphis plant protection and quarantine ppq emergency programs manual84 and the aphis veterinary services vs federal emergency response plan for an outbreak of footandmouth disease or other highly contagious diseases85 the national response plan nrp also discusses usdas role in responding to terrorist attacks or other disasters in an outbreak damage is proportional to the time it takes to first detect the disease if foreign disease is introduced responsibility for recognizing initial symptoms rests with farmers producers veterinarians plant pathologists and entomologists but farmers sometimes are reluctant to voluntarily test crops or livestock for fear of economic loss or professional stature cooperative extension service agents at state universities are receiving additional training on recognizing the likely symptoms of an agroterrorism attack effective detection depends on heightened sense of awareness and on the ability to rapidly determine the level of threat eg developing and deploying rapid disease diagnostic tools lessons from disease outbreaks including the 2001fmd outbreaks in europe and 200306 spread of h5n1 avian flu globally show that the speed of detection diagnosis and control spell the difference between an isolated incident and an economic and public health disaster the capacity to respond however is not always as strong as desired in recent years the number of veterinarians with experience to recognize many foreign animal diseases has declined success in eradicating many animal diseases in the united states has reduced the opportunity for new veterinarians to see such diseases also the number of large animal veterinarians in private practice and within aphis has declined the american veterinary medical association predicts that 7 of usda positions for large animal veterinarians may go unfilled and 45 of such positions nationwide86 in light of this trend aphis has initiated efforts to increase training for foreign animal diseases and create registries of veterinarians with appropriate experience the national veterinary medical service act pl 108161 provides new veterinarians with loan repayment assistance in exchange for practicing areas with veterinary shortages and for being tasked by the government in emergency situations87 84 usdaaphis plant protection and quarantine 2002 emergency programs manual at

crs51 dhs and usda have worked to improve the coordination of their response plans to secure the food supply particularly following the announcement of hspd9 the departments are cooperating on research funding detection technology surveillance partnerships with private industry and state and local response coordination88 examples of the publicprivate partnerships for detection include the food and agriculture information sharing and analysis center isac and the food and agriculture sector coordinating council scc both discussed earlier in this report numerous simulation table top exercises have been conducted by both federal state and local authorities to test the response and coordination efforts of agroterrorism attack examples of such simulations include the silent prairie exercise in washington february 11 2003 the silent farmland exercise in north carolina august 5 2003 and exercise high stakes in kansas june 18 2003 the last line of defense and the costliest is the isolation control and eradication of an epidemic the more geographically widespread disease outbreak the costlier and more drastic the control measures become officials gained valuable experience from recent agricultural disease outbreaks such as avian influenza in the us canada and asia89 fmd in the uk and citrus canker in florida each one of these epidemics has required the depopulation and destruction of livestock and crops in quarantine areas indemnity payments to farmers and immediate suspension of international trade of all lines of defense mass eradication is the most politically sensitive and difficult actions taken in each of these outbreaks have met with varying degrees of resistance from groups opposed to mass slaughter of animals citizens concerned about environmental impacts of destroying carcases or from farmers who fear the loss of their livelihood during the 2001 outbreak of fmd in the united kingdom the public was clearly opposed to the large pyres of burning carcasses the disposal of millions of chicken carcasses in british columbia canada during 2004 also caused significant public debate thus scientific alternatives are needed for mass slaughter and carcass disposal90 judicial roadblocks also can interfere with eradication and control efforts for example sciencebased measures tree removal within certain perimeters to eradicate citrus canker in floridas residential neighborhoods were challenged and delayed in the courts the disease continued to spread and before it could be eradicated was spread very widely by hurricanes in 2005 88 dhs fact

httpfsskstateeduresearchbooks carcassdispfilescarcass20disposalhtml crs52 federal authorities when foreign animal disease is discovered whether accidentally or intentionally introduced the secretary of agriculture has broad authority to eradicate it or prevent it from entering the country91 the use of these authorities is fairly common as shown recently by the import restrictions placed on h5n1 avian fluinfected countries federal quarantines and restrictions on interstate movement within the us are also common for certain pest and disease outbreaks such as for sudden oak death in california and citrus canker in florida in addition to federal authorities most states have similar authorities at least for quarantine and import restrictions in fact the initial response to many outbreaks is at the state or local level if an outbreak spreads across state lines or if state and local efforts are inadequate federal involvement quickly follows state and local officials usually consult with federal authorities and often seek federal assistance if an animal disease outbreak is found in the united states the secretary of agriculture is authorized among other things to stop imports of animals and animal products into the us from suspected countries 7 usc 8303 stop animal exports 7 usc 8304 and interstate transport of diseased or suspected animals 7 usc 8305 seize quarantine and dispose of infected livestock to prevent dissemination of the disease 7 usc 8306 compensate owners for the fair market value of animals destroyed by the secretarys orders 7 usc 8306d and transfer the necessary funding from usdas commodity credit corporation ccc to cover costs of eradication quarantine and compensation programs 7 usc 831692 similar authorities cover plant pests and diseases 7 usc 77017772 however the capacity of local law enforcement may be stretched too thin in fullscale agroterrorist attack study by the us department of justice says that agroterrorism events are more likely to be handled as crime scene investigation with law enforcement having primary responsibility rather than public health 91 the plant protection act pl 106224 title iv sec 402 june 20 2000 and the animal health protection act pl 107171 title x sec 10402 may 13 2002 provide broad regulatory and eradication authorities to the secretary and to aphis these acts replace patchwork of similar laws dating back many decades by combining authorities into unified framework 92 for more information on ccc transfers for plant and animal health programs see crs report rl32504 funding plant and animal health emergencies transfers from the commodity credit corporation by jim monke crs53 response93 quarantines of 6mile radius combined with statewide roadblocks to enforce stopmovement orders would require many officers and much equipment to be redeployed from other assignments and coordinated among many jurisdictions of different levels national veterinary stockpiles nvs hspd9 calls for national veterinary stockpile nvs containing sufficient amounts of animal vaccine antiviral or therapeutic products to appropriately respond to the most damaging animal diseases affecting human health and the economy and that will be capable of deployment within 24 hours of an outbreak at senate agriculture committee hearing in 2005 dr james roth veterinary professor at iowa state university highlighted rift valley fever nipah virus and avian influenza as candidates for the stockpile because the agents are contagious and can cause serious illness or death in humans safe and effective vaccines for these three diseases can be developed in short time frame this preventive measure would effectively reduce the serious threat these diseases pose to both public health and animal agriculture animal vaccines can be developed for small fraction of the cost of developing human vaccines vaccinating animals for zoonotic diseases effectively protects the human population from infection and reduces the need to vaccinate people94 the nvs received 3 million in fy2005 and 3 million in fy2006 the administration requests 8 million for fy2007 as part of the food and agriculture defense initiative recovery and management some activities such as confinement and eradication start in the response phase but continue throughout the recovery and management phase longterm economic recovery includes resuming the husbandry of animals and plants in the affected areas introducing new genetic traits that may be necessary in response to the pest or disease rebuilding public confidence in domestic markets and regaining international market share confidence in food markets by both domestic and international customers depends on continuing surveillance after the threat is controlled or eradicated communication and education programs would need to inform growers directly affected by the outbreak and inform consumers abo the source and safety of their food the social sciences and public health institutions play complementary role to the agricultural sciences in responding to and recovering from agroterrorism 93 us department of justice national institute of

equilibrium level of production andor product quality resources would be devoted to acquiring plant varieties with resistance characteristics and breeds of animals more suitable to the new environment this is the goal of the national plant disease recovery system npdrs mentioned in hspd9 and being initiated by aphis national plant disease recovery system npdrs hspd9 calls for national plant disease recovery system npdrs capable of responding to highconsequence plant disease with pest control measures and the use of resistant seed varieties within single growing season to sustain reasonable level of production for economically important crops the primary resources for this recovery system are the us national plant germplasm system in conjunction with federal state university extension and industry scientists planning includes finding or developing seed varieties that resistant to certain diseases and pesticide control measures that prevent slow or stop highconsequence plant diseases from spreading the npdrs received 2 million in fy2005 and 2 million in fy2006 the administration requests 6 million for fy2007 as part of the food and agriculture defense initiative issues for congress appropriations the annual appropriations process provides an opportunity for legislators to influence homeland security activities separate from writing authorizing legislation or conducting oversight hearings in addition to the primary purpose of appropriations laws providing or limiting funding appropriators may also use committee report language to request reports from federal agencies or make statements and stipulations about future counterterrorism activities usdas budget request for fy2008 calls for significantly increased spending on several agroterrorism preparedness programs the food and agriculture defense initiative requests an fy2008 appropriation of 340 million nearly double the 177 estimated for items in the initiative for fy2007 table 4 using ombs more comprehensive analysis of homeland security funding for agriculture cited on previous pages the requested fy2008 increase in homeland security funding for agriculture is 54 up from 340 million estimated for fy2007 to 524 million requested for fy2008 table 2 the fy2008 dhs budget request does not include any individual line items for agriculture ongoing border inspection and science and technology activities are mentioned but specific allocations or requests are mentioned crs55 these budget issues and past appropriations for agroterrorism are discussed earlier in this report under the heading federal funding to respond to agroterrorism legislation increasing the level of terrorism preparedness remains concern not only for agroterrorism but also for other forms of terrorism several bills were introduced in the 109th congress to authorize funding or otherwise improve the level of preparedness or coordination of response to an agroterrorist attack these bill are listed in table 7 and discussed in the context of several issues below the 110th congress may consider similar bills regarding coordination and response activities context from the 109th congress two complementary bills addressing agroterrorism preparedness were introduced by senator akaka s 572 the homeland security food and agriculture act 109th congress and s 573 the agricultural security assistance act 109th congress versions of both bills were introduced in the 108th congress both bills addressed different aspects of agroterrorism preparedness and coordination s 572 would have amended the homeland security act of 2002 by giving additional responsibilities to the department of homeland security for agroterrorism preparedness s 573 which subsequently was incorporated into project bioshield ii s 975 109th congress would have tasked the secretary of agriculture with various studies and programs and authorized funding for state and local preparedness public awareness programs and biosecurity grants for farmers s 573s 975 also would have established agriculture liaison position in the department of homeland security and department of health and human services another agroterrorism preparedness bill s 1532 the agroterrorism prevention act 109th congress was introduced by senator specter it would have authorized funding for public awareness onfarm biosecurity guidelines and state and local preparedness assistance and bolstered laboratory and other response capacity s 1532 also would have addressed criminal penalties for agroterrorism and coordination for agricultural issues in the intelligence community s 3898hr 6086 national reportable conditions act 109th congress would have directed dhs in coordination with usda and several other agencies to develop list of diseases conditions and events that represent threat to humans animals food production and the water supply commission of public health professionals veterinarians animal and food specialists and environmental and utility and laboratory workers would have advised the secretary the bill would have created coordinated notification system to single government agency pl 109374 the animal enterprise terrorism act was enacted in 2006 to enhance criminal penalties for terrorism against animal enterprises not only for agroterrorism as discussed in this report but also for what is sometimes called eco terrorism against animal research facilities or types of livestock production the law prescribes penalties and restitution in title 18 of the us code for varying levels of economic damage and personal injury involving threats acts of vandalism property damage criminal trespass harassment or intimidation crs56 table 7 bills in the 109th congress addressing agroterrorism bill in 109th congress

coordination the bills from the 109th congress sought to provide more concrete congressional instructions and budget authorizations for agroterrorism preparedness however similar results could occur if the presidential directive hspd9 is implemented successfully the presidential directives facilitating agroterrorism preparedness and subsequent administrative actions did not exist when senator akakas bills were introduced in the 108th congress while congress certainly has oversight authority of federal agencies and may ask questions about implementation of hspd9 public law outlining and directing the implementation of an agroterrorism preparedness plan would establish the statutory parameters for such plan and as practical matter might result in enhanced oversight by specifically identifying executive branch entities responsible for carrying out particular components of such plan usda programs to bolster preparedness in the 109th congress s 573 was referred to the agriculture committee but the most of the text was incorporated subsequently into title 27 of s 975 project bioshield ii 109th congress which is referred to the health education labor and pensions committee the bills would have authorized such sums as necessary subject to annual appropriations for state and local vulnerability assessments emergency response plans geographic crs57 information systems and grants to state and local agriculture health officials the bills also would have created awareness programs and grants for farmlevel producers to improve biosecurity measures these farmlevel activities would have included development and dissemination of onfarm biosecurity guidelines and on farm biosecurity improvement grants up to 10000 per farm s 1532 the agroterrorism prevention act 109th congress would have authorized funding for usda and dhsfema to assist states in developing response plans it also would have authorized funding for public awareness the dissemination of farmlevel biosecurity guidelines and mandated further development of national veterinary stockpile and national plant disease recovery system largely as mentioned in hspd9 responsibilities of dhs the homeland security food and agriculture act s 572 srept 109209 109th congress would have amended the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 by giving additional biosecurity responsibilities to the department of homeland security the bill was reported favorably by the homeland security and governmental affairs committee in september 2005 it would have given leadership role to dhs for agriculture security preparedness and disaster response s 572 109th congress would have authorized an agriculture security program in dhs that would advise and consult with federal state local and other agriculture officials regarding agroterrorism preparedness it would have given the secretary of dhs authority to execute responsibilities mentioned in hspd7 and hspd9 and tasked dhs with coordinating much of an agroterrorism response by communicating equipping and otherwise facilitating emergency response providers dhs also would have become the lead responder by coordinating with the department of transportation the environmental protection agency department of agriculture and department of state dhs would have coordinated task forces to identify and recommend best practices for state response plans the bill also would have created grant program to help state and local agricultural specialists prepare for agroterrorism by funding conferences and agroterrorism response exercises the congressional budget office estimated that implementing s 572 would cost 8 million in 2006 and 53 million over fiveyear period of this total 48 million would fund additional staff and expenses in the current dhs directorate for preparedness and 5 million would be for grants to state and local agriculture officials interagency coordination shortly following enactment of the homeland security act and the 2003 transfer from usda to dhs of agricultural border inspections and the plum island agricultural research facility concerns over dhs dedication to these agricultural functions began rising moreover concern over coordination between established agencies and dhs is not unique to agriculture nonetheless the issue of improved coordination between federal agencies with various jurisdictions which agency has primary responsibility and encouraging agencies to seeking adequate consultation from other stakeholders has been raised in many venues and proposed legislation crs58 for example the agricultural security assistance act s 573 109th congress would have established agriculture liaison position in the department of homeland security specifically with the federal emergency management agency fema and in the department of health and human services the bill among other things would have given leadership roles for preparedness and response particularly with first responders to dhs s 1532 the agroterrorism prevention act 109th congress would have instructed dhs hhs usda intelligence agencies interior epa and other agencies to coordinate response plans conduct vulnerability assessments and expand monitoring and surveillance for agroterrorism the bill also mentioned enhanced intelligence systems and cooperation tracking systems for agricultural products laboratory
