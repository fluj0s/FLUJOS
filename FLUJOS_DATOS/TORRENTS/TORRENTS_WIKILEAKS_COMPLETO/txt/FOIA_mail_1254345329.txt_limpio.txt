from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to michael mann mannmeteopsuedu phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re attacks against keith date wed sep 30 171529 2009 cc gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov at 1606 30092009 michael mann wrote and osborn and briffa 06 is also immune to this issue as it eliminated any combination of up to 3 of the proxies and showed the result was essentially the same fair to say this tim mike yes youre right figs s4s6 in our supplementary information do indeed show results leaving out individual groups of two and groups of three proxies respectively its attached i wouldnt say we were immune to the issue results are similar for these leave 1 2 or 3 out cases but they certainly are not as strong as the case with all 14 proxies certainly in figure s6 there are some cases with 3 omitted ie some sets of 11 where modern results are comparable with intermittent periods between 800 and 1100 plus there is the additional uncertainty discussed on the final page of the supplementary information associated with linking the proxy records to real temperatures remember we have formal calibration were just counting proxies im still amazed that science agreed to publish something where the main analysis only involves counting from 1 to 14 but this is fine since the ipcc ar4 and other assessments are not saying the evidence is 100 conclusive or even 90 conclusive but just likely that modern is warmer than mwp so yes it should be possible to find some subsets of data where mwp and modern are comparable and similarly for some seasons and regions and as youve pointed out before if any seasonregion is comparable or even has mwpmodern then it will probably be the northern high latitudes in summer time i think you published on this suggesting that combination of orbital forcing landuse change and sulphate aerosols could cause this for that seasonregion is that right so this yamal thing doesnt damage osborn briffa 2006 but important to note that ob 2006 and others support the likely statement rather than being conclusive cheers tim
