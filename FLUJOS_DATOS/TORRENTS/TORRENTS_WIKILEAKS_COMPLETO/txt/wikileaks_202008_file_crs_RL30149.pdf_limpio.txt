minimum tax that is it was tax that was paid in addition to the regular income tax the tax rate for the addon minimum tax was 10 and the tax base consisted of eight tax preference items the most significant of which was the portion of capital gains income that was excluded from tax under the regular income tax since its enactment in 1969 the individual minimum tax has been significantly modified numerous times in 1971 in 1976 in 1977 in 1978 in 1982 in 1986 in 1990 in 1993 in 1997 1 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the individual

in 2006 in 2007 and in 2008 for example the tax reform act of 1976 added new preference items to the addon minimum tax base and increased the tax rate to 15 another major change occurred under the revenue act of 1978 which created the predecessor of the current alternative minimum tax amt this was an entirely new tax which was assessed on taxpayers regular taxable income increased by certain itemized deductions and the excluded portion of capital gains income capital gains income was dropped as preference item under the addon minimum tax the tax rates on the alternative minimum tax ranged from 10 to 25 the alternative minimum tax was payable to the extent that it exceeded the sum of the taxpayers regular income tax liability and his addon minimum tax liability between 1978 and 1982 individuals were subject to both the addon minimum tax and the alternative minimum tax citing the need to simplify the system and focus the tax on highincome taxpayers congress in provisions contained in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 repealed the addon minimum tax expanded the tax base of the alternative minimum tax and changed the amt tax rate to 20 the tax reform act of 1986 substantially changed the alternative minimum tax it increased the tax rate to 21 changed the basic exemption amount broadened the tax base and revamped the alternative minimum tax credit it also introdu ced phaseout of the amt exemption amount for taxpayers whose amt taxable income exceeded certain limits for taxpayers filing joint returns the amt exemption was reduced by 25 of the amount by which the taxpayers amt taxable income exceeded 150000 112000 for single taxpayers and 75000 for married taxpayers filing separately trusts and estates by far however the most significant change affecting the amt was indirect and resulted from modifications in the tax treatment of capital gains income under the regular income tax under pre1986 law 60 of longterm capital gain was exempt from regular income taxes the excluded portion of the gain however was taxabl as tax preference under the amt since the 1986 act repealed the exclusion for longterm capital gains income and capital gains income was taxed in full under the regular income tax it was longer taxed as tax preference item under the amt this change substantially reduced the number of taxpayers subject to the amt the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 increased the amt tax rate from 21 to 24 the revenue reconciliation act of 1993 made two major changes in the amt first it increased the amt exemption amounts from 40000 to 45000 for taxpayers filing joint returns from 30000 to 33750 for taxpayers filing single returns and from 20000 to 22500 for married taxpayers filing separately estates and trusts second it created twotiered tax rate structure for the amt 26 tax rate is applicable to the first 175000 of taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income in excess of the exemption amount and 28 on alternative minimum taxable income in excess of 175000 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 established that the maximum tax rate applicable to capital gains income under the regular income tax would also apply to capital gains income under the amt the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1998 allowed the nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset an individuals regular income tax in full for tax year 1998 only even though the personal tax credits might be larger than the amount by which the taxpayers regular income tax exceeded his tentative minimum tax in addition it repealed

reduced the additional child tax credit by the amount by which an individuals amt exceeded his regular income tax liability another legislative change in the amt occurred in the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 which extended through december 31 2001 the existing law tax provision that allows individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their nonrefundable personal tax credits regardless of the amt the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 permanently allowed the child tax credit the adoption tax credit and the ira

adds back various tax preference items to his taxable income under his regular income tax this grossed up amount then becomes his tax base for the amt next the amount of the basic exemption is calculated and subtracted from the amt tax base twotiered tax rate structure of 26 and 28 is then assessed against the remaining amt tax base to determine amt tax liability the taxpayer then pays whichever is greater his regular income tax liability or his amt tax liability finally the amt tax credit is calculated as an item to be carried forward to offset regular income tax liabilities in future years tax preference items that are added to the amt tax base include taxexempt interest on certain privateactivity bonds and excess depletion deducti ons also for most types of property placed in service before 1987 the excess of accelerated depreciation over straightline depreciation is considered tax preference item and is added to the amt tax base in addition to the tax preference items certain adjustments are made to deductions that were allowed under the regular income tax calculation of taxable income for instance for certain assets depreciation rates under the amt differ from the depreciation rates under the regular income tax in some cases the differences will be positive and increase the amt tax base while in other cases the differences will be negative and decrease the amt tax base another major adjustment to the tax base for the amt involves itemized deductions that are allowed under the regular income tax for purposes of the amt taxpayer cannot claim deductions for miscellaneous expenses for tax payments to state local or foreign governments and for medical expenses except to the extent they exceed 10 of adjusted gross income as opposed to the 75 floor under the regular income tax also deductions for investment interest expenses are limited to net investment income

development costs must be capitalized and amortized rather than expensed and the excess of the fair market value over the amount actually paid on incentive stock options must be included in the amt

it can still affect his regular income tax liability the reason is that after 2008 some personal tax credits under the regular income tax are limited to the amount by which regular income tax liability exceeds amt liability these credits include the dependent care credit the credit for the elderly and disabled the hope scholarship and lifetime learning credit and the dc homebuyers credit thus taxpayer who has regular income tax liability of 5000 and 1000 of these affected personal tax credits will effectively see these regular income tax credits reduced by 300 if his amt liability is 4300 5 the tax increase prevention act of 2007 allows taxpayers to offset their amt liability by the full amount of their personal tax credits this was extended through 2008 by eesa this provision however expires after 2008 the final step in the process involves calculating the amt tax credit multistep operation essentially the amt credit is designed to prevent those preference items that represent tax deferrals depreciation for example from being taxed one year under the amt and again later under the regular income tax the amt tax credit can be carried forward to offset regular income tax liabilities in future years g3g15g22g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 many analysts have voiced concern over the expected increase in the number of uppermiddle income taxpayers who may be subject to

covered by the amt would occur because of the combined effects of inflation and recent legislative changes to the regular income tax under the regular income tax the tax rate structure the standard deductions the personal exemptions and certain other structural components are indexed so that they do not lose their real inflationadjusted value over time this preven ts real income tax liabilities from increasing solely due to the effects of inflation the structural components of the amt however are not indexed for inflation this lack of indexation means that over time real amt tax liabilities will increase because of inflation induced increases in items of nominal income and expense the end result would be that the gap between tax liabilities under the regular income tax and the amt will shrink and many taxpayers could end up subject to the unindexed amt or experience reductions in their nonrefundable tax credits under the regular income tax the potential problems of an indexed regular tax and an unindexed amt have long been recognized by tax analysts in 1997 approximately 605000 taxpayers or about 1 of all taxpayers were subject to the amt in 2006 35 million or about 4 of all taxpayers were likely subject to the amt preliminary estimates indicate that by 2010 when the effects of both inflation and the legislative changes contained in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 are taken into account the number of taxpayers falling under either the amt or amt limits on their tax credits under the regular income tax would grow to 31 million if the egtrra provisions are made permanent then by 2017 51 million taxpayers would be affected by the amt 7 the individual income tax rate reductions and the marriage penalty tax relief provisions of the 2001 act absent periodic amt patches would have increased the number of taxpayers subject to the amt indeed many taxpayers in the middle income ranges will find that the amt will take back much of the tax reductions contained in the 2001 and 2003 acts when filing 2009 returns table 3 shows what the take back effect of the amt would have been in 2008 for hypothetical family that files joint return and has 75000 of income the take back as calculated here is the amount of the tax cut from egtrra and subsequent modifications that would have been lost because the amt was not also modified by egtrra for example assuming amt patch in 2008 family of four would have to pay 5800 in federal income taxes this is less than the 6515 that would have been due had egtrra never been enacted but 1087 more than if this family were not subject to the amt 8 in addition any future reductions in the federal income tax burden without modifications to the amt would likely increase the number of taxpayers subject to the amt or subject to amt limitations on their personal tax credits in the fy2009 budget the bush administration proposed making the egtrra tax cuts permanent the amt however is patched only for 2008 but not in later years the cost of the patch for the 2008 tax year was 618 billion9 thus in years 7 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the

alternative minimum tax poses dilemma under an income tax system designed to be consistent with economic theory there would be need for an alternative minimum tax an economically ideal income tax would correctly measure taxpayers change in net worth for the tax year in these circumstances where there is erosion in the tax base there would be need for an alternative minimum tax all taxpayers would already be paying what legislators have determined is their fair share of taxes as assessed by the regular income tax given this economic theory suggests that efforts might be better made to reform the regular income tax so as to bring it more in line wi th an economically ideal income tax then the alternative minimum tax could be eliminated it is unlikely however that the tax base of the regular individual income will be broadened to the point where there would be place for an alternative minimum tax if in this environment congress wants to preserve all of the social and economic incentives in the tax code while maintaining the concept that everyone should pay at least minimum level of income tax and wants to limit the number of taxpayers subject to the amt then it faces modification of the tax modifying the system involves two primary issues inflation and amt coverage it has been suggested that the most important ch ange that could be made would be to index the structural components of the alternative minimum tax for inflation this would allow consistent separation of the two tax systems to be maintained over time it would also substantially reduce the number of taxpayers projected to be affected by the amt in the future the second issue concerns the coverage of the amt originally the amt was intended to cover only highincome taxpayers tax incentives and preferences produced the greatest deviation in income tax payments at the high end of the income distribution thus highincome taxpayers were able to significantly lower their income tax burden changes to the tax code since the amt was first introduced primarily the 15 maximum tax rate on dividends and long term capital gains income under both the regular income tax and the
