american law division summary one way that federal law re gulates groups par ticipating in election activities is by requiring them to report information on ch things as their contributions and expenditures reporting requirements are imposed on political organizations by the internal revenue code irc and political committees by the federal election campaign act feca some of the requirements are similar in which case entities are generally subject to either the ones in the irc and report to the internal revenue service or those in feca and report to the federal election commission included in the entities that report to the irs are those colloquially known as 527s or 527 groups this report compares the timing of election activity reporting requirements under the irc and feca and discusses hr 1204 which would amend the timing of the ircs reporting requirements section 527 of the internal revenue code irc provides taxexempt status to political organizations while the federal election campaign act feca regulates political committees the definitions of the two terms are s imilar but they do not perfectly coincide1 the term political organization includes entities intending to influence federal state nd local elections along with the selection of nonelective offices the term political committee is narrower covering only those entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20918crs2 2 for further discussion of the di fferences between the two terms see crs report rs22895 527 groups and campaign activity analysis under campaign finance

political organiza tions are required to report taxrelated information to the internal revenue service irs3 other information such as disclosure of contributions and expenditure s is reported to either the irs or the federal election commission fec depending on whether the political organization is also political committee those that are political committees report to the fec while political organizations that are not political committees report to the irs section 527 political organizations include the entities colloquially known as 527s or 527 groups that have been controversia l during recent election cycles these groups which benefit from section 527 taxexempt stat us seemingly intend to influence federal elections in ways that may place them outside the feca definition of political committee4 because these groups are not re gistered as political committees under feca they are required to report inform ation to the irs instead of the fec the following chart compares the
