october 2002 mr arthur harvey filed pro suit against the usda in the us district court for the district of maine alleging that multiple provisions of the final rule were inconsistent with the ofpa and the administrative procedures act4 the district court ruled in favor of the usda ie gr anted summary judgment on all nine counts brought by harvey5 harvey subsequently appealed th case to the first circuit and was supported by number of public interest groups that filed friends of the court or amici curiae briefs the first circuit sided with harvey on three counts and remanded the holdings to the district court for further action6 in brief the court found that nonorganic ingredients not commercially available in organic form but used in the production of items labe led organic must have individual reviews in order to be placed on the national list of allowed and prohibited substances synthetic substances are barred in th processing or handling of products labeled organic and dairy

national list d notice and comment sunset review within five years and 6518k technica l advisory reviews l required consultations and reviews m required evaluations the three holdings did not invalidate ofpa provisions but rather qualified or invalidated agency regulations thereby affecting the implementation of the national organic program on june 9 2005 the distri ct court issued an order pursuant to the circuit courts instructions that established twoyear time frame in which the secretary of agriculture was to create and enforce new rules for the implementation of the national organic program in compliance with the circuit courts ruling under the order the secretary was to issue new regulations within year june 9 2006 but has an additional year to start enforcing them june 9 2007 the phasein impleme ntation was selected by the court in an effort to prevent c onsumer confusion comme rcial disruption and unnecessary litigation the rulings in harvey and subsequent requirements for new regulations however were superceded in part as result of amendments made to the ofpa by the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act pl 10997 7977 on june 7 2006 the usda published revise d final rules based on harvey and the amended ofpa8 the amendments made in the appropriati ons measure address many of the legal concerns eg lack of authority for agen cy action observed by the first circuit9 the following paragraphs examine each holding where the court determined that provision of the final rule was inconsistent with the ofpa and then discuss the effect of the applicable provisions from the appropriations act each s ection ends with the usdas latest regulatory action count one alleged exemption for nonorganic products not commercially available court action plaintiff challenged the portion 7 cfr 205606 which permits the introduction of nonorganically produced agri cultural products as ingredients in or as substances on processed products labeled as organic when the specified product is not commercially available in organic form th regulation lists five specific products cornstarch gums kelp lecithin and p ectin and also allows for any other nonorganically produced agricultural produc t when the product is not commercially available in organic form the ofpa however requires all specific exemptions to the acts prohibition on nonorganic substances to be placed on the national list following notice and comment and periodic review10 harvey claimed that 205606 provided blanket exemption to the ofpas review requireme nts and allowed ad hoc decisions to be made regarding the use of synthetic substances the usda on the other hand maintained that the regulation does not blish blanket exemption but rather only permits the use of the five products specifica lly listed in the section the court found thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22318crs4 11 70 fed reg 38090 12 upon initial publication of the ruling there was some confusion as to whether count three applied to products labeled both as organic nd made with organic specified ingredients or food groupss harvey intended prohibition on the use of synthetic substances only in products labeled as organic thus harvey filed motion for clarification and the court amended its decision by adding footnote to make clear that synthetic substances are not banned from products labeled as made with organic see harvey 396 f3d at 39 n 2usdas interpretation plausible however because the district court did not clarify the regulations meaning the circuit court so found harveys interpretation potentially credible accordingly the court remanded th count to the district court for entry of declaratory judgment that would interpret the regulation in manner consistent with the national list require ments of the ofpa declaratory judgment stating that 205606 does not establish blanket exemption to the national list requirements in statut for nonorganic agricultural products that are not commercially available wa s issued on june 9 2005 the usda in compliance with the order issued notice in the federal register clarifying the meaning of the regulation on july 1 200511 however because of the potential for confusion the order states that the clarified meaning of 205 606 will not become effective and enfor ceable until two years from the date of the judgment june 9 2007 congressional action in the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act congress amended 7 usc 6517d titled procedure for establishing national list to authorize the secretary of the usda to develop emergency procedures for designating agricultural products that are commercially unavailable in organic form for placement on the national list for period of longer than 12 months the amendment does not define what an emergency procedure would entail thus the secretary would appear to have the authority to describe the terms parameters and to select the substances subject to it while this amendment creates an expedited petition process for commercially unavailable organic agricultural products it does not appear to alter the ruling described above administrative action the new rule published on june 7 2006 did not clarify the conditions of emergency procedure however it clearly restated that the five listed substances were the only nonorganically produced pr oducts that could be used as ingredients in organic products subject to agen cy restriction when that ingredient is not commercially available in organic form count three use of synthetic substances in processing court action plaintiff challenged 7 cfr 205600b and the portion of 205605b that permits synthetic substances as ingredients in or as substances on processed products beled as organic12 section 205600b provides that synthetic substances may be used as processing ai d or adjuvant if they meet six criteria 205605b lists 38 synthetic substances specifi cally allowed in or on processed products labeled as organic the court found that 7 usc 6510a1 and 6517cbiiihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22318crs5 13 processing is defined as cooking baking curing h eating drying mixing grinding churning separating extracting slaughtering cutting fe rmenting distilling eviscerating preserving dehydrating freezing chilling or otherwise ma nufacturing and includes the packaging canning jarring or otherwise enclosing f ood in container 7 cfr 2052 14 handling operation is defined as any operation or portion of an operation except final retailers of agricultural product that do not process agricultural products that receives or otherwise acquires agricultural products and proce sses packages or stores such products 7 cfr 2052 15 see 7 usc 6519f for listing of laws 16 harvey 396 f3d at 39 17 see 71 fed reg 32804 see also usda qa on harvey v johanns final regulation available at httpwwwamsusdagovnopnewsroomharveyfinalqas06_04_06pdfforbid the use of synthetic substances during the processing13 or handling14 of product unless otherwise required by law15 the court noted that the ofpa contemplates the use of certain synthetic substances during the production or growing of organic products but not during the handling or processing stages by allowing the use of certain synthetic substances as processing aids the court c oncluded that the regula tions contravened the plain language of the ofpa the circuit c ourt reversed the district courts grant of summary judgment and remande d the count to the district court for entry of summary judgment in harveys favor on remand the district court ordered the secretary of the usda to publish new rules implementing the circuit courts judgment within one year of the date of the judgment june 9 2006 but allowed the secretary to exempt nonconforming products placed in commerce as organic for up to two years after the date of the judgment june 9 2007 congressional action the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act amended 6510a1 and strikes 6517cb iii provisions that th first circuit relied upon to emphasize that synthetics were not allowed during the pr ocessing or handling of product before the amendment 6510a 1 barred person on handling operation from adding any synthetic ingredient during th processing or postharvest handling of covered product the amendmen t added the phrase not app earing on the national list after ingredient thereby apparently allowi ng the use of synthetics on the national list during proce ssing or postharvest handling of covered product secti on 6 517c establishes guidelines for placing substances on the national list and in subsection b sets forth specific requirements with regard to the types of substances that may be exempted for use in production and handling specifically subpart iii of 6517cb states that the substance is used in handling and is nonsynthetic but is not organically produced emphasis added this provision wh ich the court noted specifically requires the exempted substances be nonsynthetic sic was deleted by the amendment16 as there longer appears to be any general prohibition though there are other requirements that must be met against the placement of synthetics on the national list for use during the processing or handling of covered product the first ci rcuits ruling in count three is likely moot administrative action the usda determined that there was need to revise 205600b and 205605b because congress suffi ciently addressed the contradiction and approved the necessary legislative changes17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22318crs6 count seven conversion of dairy herds to organic production court action plaintiff challenged the final rules exception to the ofpas requirements for dairy herds be ing converted to organic produc tion pursuant to 7 usc 6509e2 dairy animal whose milk or milk products will be so ld or labeled as organically produced must be raised and handled in accordance with the ofpa for not less than the 12month period immediately prior to the sale of such milk or milk products section 205 236a2 of the final rule however allows whole dairy herds trans itioning to organic production to use 80 organic feed for the first nine months and 100 organic feed for the final three months ie 8020 rule the court found the ofpas requirement for single type of organic ndling for twelve months and the final rules bifurcated approach in direct conflict th court determined that nothing in the ofpas plain language permits the creation of an exception permitting more lenient phased conversion process for entire dairy herds nd consequently found th regulation invalid the circuit court reversed the district cour ts grant of summary judgment and remanded the count to the district court for entry of summary judgment in harveys favor on remand the district court orde red the usda to promulgate regulations implementing the circuit courts decision within one year of the date of th judgment june 9 2006 and to start enforcement by june 9 2007 congressional action in the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act congress amended 7 usc 6509e2 by adding an exception to the general feeding requirement listed in the provision ie raised and handled in accordance with the ofpa for not less than the 12month period immediately prio r to sale the new provision titled transition guideline allows crops and fora ge from land included in the organic system plan of dairy farm that is in the third year of organic management to be consumed by the dairy animals of the farm during the 12month period immediately prior to the sale of the organic milk or milk products generally crops or forage intended to be sold or labeled as organic can not have prohibited s ubstances applied to them for the three years immediately preceding harvest of the crop ccordingly while this amendment allows feed for dairy animals to come from land that is still transitioning to organic status it would not appear to allow dairy cows to be fed prohibited substances or genetically modified organisms cong ress amendment to 6509 likely made the courts ruling in count seven moot administrative action the secretary revised 7 cfr 205236 to create two exceptions to the general rule that milk labe led as organic must come from cows under continuous organic management for less than 12 months first animals may consume crops and forage from the producers land that is in the third year of organic management ie the transition guideline second pr oducers converting entire herds to organic production who were still using th 8020 feed rule before the publication of the new regulation may continue to do so provided that milk may be labeled as organic by this method after june 9 2007 this exception allows period of transition to occur in accordance with the courts order for enforcement of new regulations by the same date
