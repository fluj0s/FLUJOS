accountability summary public charter school is publicly funde d elementary or secondary school that is operated according to the terms of charter or contract granted by public chartering agency charter schools are gran ted charters for fixed number of years and the terms of school charter typica lly include provisions granting autonomy in the operation of the school in exchange for adherence to specific accountability requirements to retain or renew its charter school must adhere to the accountability requirements in its charter wh ile continuing to attract enough students to function as viable school public charter school may be accountable for variet of actions or outcomes to number of concerned tities both internal and external to the school this report focuses on accountability relationships external to the school such as those involving students fa milies commun ities and the broader society particular attention is given to fede ral accountability requirements currently 40 states and the district of columbia have char ter school laws and charter schools operate in ll of those states charter schools are held accountable for results as outlined in charter agreements and as required by federal and state law chartering agencies and state educationa l agencies charter schools also are held accountable through market mechanisms such as parental satisfaction with the result that many have waiting lists while others have been forced to close because of insufficient enrollment the elementary and secondary edu cation act esea contains numerous accountability provisions and these apply to public charter schools as well as to traditional public schools the esea is expect ed to be considered for reauthorization during the 110th congress and existing accountab ility requirements will likely be closely examined as part of the pro cess with respect to charter schools accountability issues that will likely be exa mined as part of reauthorization include how federal accountability requirements are being applied to ch arter schools and whether charter schools are any more effectiv or efficient in educating students than traditional public schools this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184contents introduction 1 aspects of charter school accountability 1 to whom 1 for what 4 how 4 charter school

charter or contract granted by public chartering agency the terms of ch arter typically provi the charter school operator with increased autonomy in how to operate the school often including exemption from or flexibility in the application of many of the state or local regulations otherwise applicable to public schools in exchange for greater accountability for results or outcomes ch arters usually are granted for limited time period typically ranging from less than five ears to as many as 15 in order to retain or renew its charter school must adhe re to the accountability requirements written into its charter and also must continue to attract enough students to continue functioning as viable school this report examines public charter school accountability with focus on the federal role in examining charter sc hool accountability however we first consider to whom for what and how charter schools are held acc ountable and then examine how charter school accountability is being carri ed out in the states we then provide an overview of the federal role in ch arter school accountability and describe how accountability provisions in the elementary and secondary education act esea apply to public charter schools aspects of charter school accountability to whom to whom charter schools are accountable is complicated question concerning multiple types of accountability and involvi ng relationships between variety of actors first accountability may be inte rnal or external to charter school1 internal accountability concerns relationships opera ting within the school such as between school governing board and teachers and might i nvolve the adherence to school guidelines and procedures or to sp ecified curriculum external accountability concerns relationships between the school nd outside actors in regard to externalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs2 2 us department of education office of the under secretary evaluation of the public charter schools program ye ar one

charte r schools commonwealth charter schools and horace mann charter schools horace mann charter sc hools first must be approved by local school committee but both types of school s receive their charter from the state board continuedaccountability charter schools are accountable both to the broader society through relationships between the school operator the governing board public chartering agencies and other government entities and to individuals through relationships with students and parents in this report we focus on external accountability key entity involved in holding charte r schools accountable is the authorized public chartering agency forty states and the district of columbia have charter school laws and each allows different agen cies to grant school charters agencies authorized under state laws to grant school charters include local boards of education or school districts state boards of education state boards for charter schools chief state school officers independent school boards intermediate school districts county and municipal governments vocationaltechnical school districts public colleges and universities community colleges and private colleges and universities in some states only local boards of ducation or school districts may charter schools while in others only the state board of education or ch ief state school officer may grant charters in other states the state board of education can approve charter on appeal of decision by local board or district in about quarter of states multiple agencies may grant school charters while in some others interdependent approval is required usually by both the local and state boards of education2 characteristics such as the number and type of public chartering agencies in particular state are significant in the pplication of school accountability according to the us department of educations ed evaluation of the public charter schools program the administration of account ability requirements appears to depend partially on the size of the charte ring agency the study reports that in general where the chartering agency is larger nonlocal agency responsible for all or multiple charter schools particularly state agencies there is evidence of sound capacity to monitor accountability3 in massachusetts for example the state board of education is the sole chartering agency and also is the agency responsible for enforcing accountability requirements4 this is held to simplify the accountab ilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs3 4 continued of education 5 ed charter school accountability p 57 6 ed evaluation of the public charter schools program p 44 7 ibid p 45 8 ed charter school accountability pp 67process because there is clear line of accountability between the school and single wellresourced accountability agency in states with multiple independent chartering agencies the study reports it can become more difficult to monitor accountability throughout the state local boa rds or agencies that charter only few schools generally are less we ll equipped to adequately monitor performance as chartering agencies have matured howev er they have shown improvement for example in michigan state with multiple chartering agencies central michigan university has undertaken efforts to imp rove its processes for approving and reviewing charter schools after having been criticized for being too lenient5 as the number and type of entities aut horized to charter schools vary across states so do the accountability relations hips between charter schools and their chartering agencies while in some inst ances charter schools are directly accountable only to the chartering agency charter schools are accountable to more than one agency in most states6 in the majority of the states where only local educational agencies leas are authorized to ch arter schools ed s found that both the chartering agency and the state educational agency sea were identified as being responsible for charter school accountability7 in states with multiple chartering agencies and which allow for the treatment of charter schools as independent leas accountability relationships may involve charter school being accountable both to its chartering agency under the terms of its charter and also to the sea for certain statewide requirements in addition to the charter schools themselves most states also require chartering ag encies to prepare and submit reports on charter school accountability charter schools are considered by so as having direct accountability relationship with parents and the community that typically is not present in conventional public schools by the necessity of their direct support in order to continue to operate8 this is in part because in contrast to students being assigned to particular schools on the ba sis of their place of residen ce as is normally the case with traditional public schools parents of charter school st udents have actively decided to enroll their students in school of choice and thus may have greater investment in that school others howev er might suggest that with respect to accountability to the community when school s are chartered by appointed boards or other unelected bodies such as co lleges and universities the accountability relationship to the community may be rather limited according to some the existence of ch arter schools as choice for parents may have the effect of making both charter and conventional public schools more directly accountable to parents by providing them with more school choices creating competition between schools nd resulting in only the best performing schools beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs4 9 however under esea title ia states and leas are required to make publicly available report cards depicting the success of leas and public schools to include charter schools at meeting esea accountability requirements discussion of requirements for school report cards may be found in crs report rl31487 education for the disadvantaged overview of esea title ia amendments under the child left behind act by wayne c riddleable to attract and retain students others remain skeptical that sufficient objective information is available to allow parents to make informed decisions9 in addition to the accountability relationships desc ribed above charter schools also are accountable to variety of ot her actors such as teachers unions financial donors and community interests but whose roles are not central to this discussion for what charter schools may be held accountable for activities specific to the terms of their charter this may include the provision of high quality education to students often measured in terms of meeting or exceeding state standards as measured according to state assessments or in rms of performing better than other public schools at educating similar students it ma include developing and adhering to high quality and innovative educational cu rriculum that might not otherwise be available in conventional public schools it also may in clude providing educational opportunities that meet the needs of st udents being illserved in their current environment such as disadvantaged or atrisk youth charter schools also may be held accountable for adhering to gene rally accepted financ ial and management practices in addition to the terms of ch arter school may be held accountable for satisfying parents or attracting and retainin g enough students to justify the continued operation of school charter schools also may be held accountable for activ ities of general nature and not specific to any schools charter such as adherence to federal state and local statutes and regulations that are not subject to waiver as well as statewide standards and assessment goals such activities represent types of accountability that apply to all public schools conventiona l and charter alike ac tivities for which all schools are to be held accountable are likely to be those that are d eemed by society as essential to the successful operation of public schools some would argue that the accountability requirements writte n into schools charters should specify results or outcomes that are more demanding than those required of conventional public schools others would argue that satisfy ing the terms of schools charter and attracting sufficient student body are th sole criteria by which charter schools should be measured how the method by which charter school is held accountable depends on state law and in general begins even before th school commences operations through the charter review and approval pr ocess this consists of reviewing and basing the granting of school charter on items such as schools proposed mission education plan and curriculum how the school w ill be innovative how the school will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs5 10 massachusetts department of education the massachusetts charter school in itiative 2001 p 33financed its facilities plan and specific acc ountability requirements in few states chartering agencies have dopted rigorous charter approva l processes to help ensure that those schools granted ch arters are ready to succeed as charter schools operate they can be held accountable through variety of means to include requiring charter schools to prep are and update accountability plans and submit annual reports requiring chartering agencies or other public entities to conduct periodic site visits and to revi ew reports and other information provided by charter school operators and publishing information about charter schools such as gains ordeclines in students academic achievement whether there is waiting list or open seats in the school and whether the school obtains accreditation as schools charters come up for renewa l chartering agencies are responsible for conducting some degree of review depending upon the terms of state law subject to the outcome of this review th chartering agency can renew or revoke schoolss charter typically the review process informs the decision of whether to renew or revoke schools charter in some states agencies othe r than those granting school charters also have role in acc ountability such as by setting and enforcing state academic content standards and accountability requirements chartering agencies can use variety of methods and proce sses to review the schools they charter in some instances chartering agencies have created or contracted with school inspection organizations such as in chicago colorado and massachusetts the latter patterns its review proce ss on the british school inspection model 10 charter school accountability in the states the manner and degree to which charter schools are held accountable vary from one state to another and are influenced in part by federal require ments in general charter schools must be held to accountability requirements that are the same or more demanding than those for conventional public sc hools like all public schools charter schools must participate in statew ide assessments that measure the progress of students toward meeting the states acade mic proficiency standards some state charter school laws specify that school di strict accountability requirements also apply to public charter schools located within certain districts however the authority through wh ich public charter schools are held accountable under state accountab ility provisions and the administration of corrective action differs in each state some anal ysts note that the accountability requirements written into school charters can be vagu or not substantive despite accountability being one of the central tenets of the char ter school concept this critique is widelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs6 11 center on reinventing public education expanding charter school accountability the education

that charter sc hools dopt generally accepted accountability principles for educati on gaape 13 it is eds policy to treat charter school s which are not part of conventional leas as separate leas such charter schools are thus subject to sea oversight regarding their progress in meeting state performance standards and on statewide assessments 14 ed evaluation of the public charter schools program p 4447 15 ibid p 57 16 ibid p 58recognized and has resulted in calls for improvements in charter school accountability processes for example the center on reinventin g public education notes that many government agencies do not have clear acc ountability processes in place for charter schools and that chartering agencies need to improve their methods of overseeing charter schools11 some charter school advocates concerned about current weaknesses in accountability syst ems propose that charter schools adopt transparent charter school accountability pr inciples modeled after the generally accepted accounting principles gaap employed by privatesector firms12 while in general the chartering agen cy is responsible to some degree for ensuring that charter school adhere s to the accountability requirements of its charter in the majority of states multiple agencies have some role in charter school accountability to include the sea which is required under esea title ia to annually review the progress of each lea r eceiving title ia funds in meeting the states performance standards described in its state plan13 eds evaluation of the public charter schools program found that only in six states is the chartering agency reported as the sole entity responsible fo r charter school accountability in 10 states responsibility for charter school accountability re sides at the state level while in 22 states agencies at multiple levels of government are responsible14 only in few instances have charte r schools been sanctioned for failure to adhere to academic accountab ility requirements as previously stated most accountability problems have been for fina ncial or managerial reasons eds evaluation of the public charter schools program reveals small number of charter schools being sanctioned becau of poor student academic assessment levels one school closed two not re newed and one placed on pr obation out of 837 schools chartered by 48 agencies that were included in the study15 the report does note however that in states in which the aut hority to charter schools is limited to either state or local entity charter schools are more likely to be sanctioned for accountability purposes for an reason not just student performance than are charter schools in states in which multiple entities are authorized to charter schools16 thus eds preliminary findings are that char tering agencies that are responsible for many schools are better quipped to monitor the accountability of charter schools than are chartering agencies responsible for few schools and that charter schools in states with single level of charter authority state or local are more likely tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs7 17 for additional information on federal funding for charter school

charter school law charter school accountability under esea title ia legislative history as the 107th congress considered reauthoriz ation of the esea the senate passed hr 1 after incorporating provision into title ia that would have required minimum amount of rigor in the accountability requirements that states applied to charter schools it stated each state plan shall provide an assurance that the states accountability requirements for charter schools as defined in section 5120 such as requirements established under the state s charter school law and overseen by the states authorized chartering agen cies for such schools are at least as rigorous as the accountability requirements established under this act such as the requirements regarding standards assessments adequate yearly

senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31184crs8 18 esea title ia section 1111b1this provision was dropped prior to enac tment of the nclba it would have explicitly required each state to adopt acc ountability requirements for charter schools that were at least as rigor ous as those established under hr 1 while this provision specifically addressed acc ountability requirements for charter schools it does not appear that absent it accountability require ments for charter schools could have been any less rigorous than those otherwise app licable to public schools in the state in lieu of the senate proposal the conference committee decided to add the following language to the title i accountability requirements accountability for charter schools the accountabi lity provisions under this act shall be over seen for charter schools in accordance with state charter school law section 1111b2k additionally the following language was incorporated into the conference report charter schools are public schools and therefore subject to the same accountability requirements of this act as they apply to other public schools including sections 1111 and 1116 as devel oped in each state however there is intent to replace or duplicate the role of authorized chartering agencies as established under each states charter school law in overseeing the acts accountability requirements for the charter schools that they authorize authorized chartering agencies should be held accountable for carrying out their oversight responsibilities as determined by each state through its charter school law and other applicable state laws this should be done in ways that do not inhibit or discourage the approval or over sight of innovative high quality charter schools the provision at section 1111b2k nd the language in the conference report address concerns th at absent the provision there might have been some ambiguity as to the role of authorized chartering agencies visàvis seas in overseeing esea accountability requirements for charter schools during the esea reauthorization neither the house nor the senate proposed to amend substantively any of the accountability provisions of the public charter schools program esea accountability requirements under the esea as amended by the nc lba distinction is made between conventional public schools and public char ter schools in the
