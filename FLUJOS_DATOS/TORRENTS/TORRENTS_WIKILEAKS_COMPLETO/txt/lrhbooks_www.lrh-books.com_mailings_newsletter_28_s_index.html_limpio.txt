processing l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture decision cause and effect contained in the route to infinity lecture series becoming what you agree with an article by l ron hubbard from the route to infinity lectures reality is another thing and rather frightening to realize that the only reality you know is that realitythe only reality you know in common with other people let put it that way is that reality on which you and they have agreed this is an old one in dianetics very old one were all sitting here and all of sudden this cat walks in we all saw cat we agree that thing is cat fellow walks up and he says that wasnt cat that was cadillac you say it wasnt it was cat reality is the majority opinion well its rather pointless argument because all reality is established by is the majority opinion one for you to think about all the reality there is really is the majority opinion so you get into minority on reality and people start really fighting you they say he must be crazy he doesnt agree with us well their reality might be entirely psychotic reality in that it was not good for their beingness theyve all decided not to be you see they say well well justwhats real here is notbeingness nothing exists thats real we have all agreed that nothing exists the united states right now is on the very astonishing basis of we have all agreed the atom bomb does not exist well it doesnt exist theres only one unfortunate thing about that is they are not joined in that agreement with russia the atom bomb would practically cease to exist if everybody in the united states and everybody in russia or even the majorities in both places were in perfect agreement that the atom bomb didnt exist or if they were even in agreement that it was not athat it was not threat it would cease to be threat that would be real thing then wouldnt it the mest universe well enough people agreed hard enough one time about the mest universe to make various things in the mest universe and thats the long and short of it and thats why you got mest universe thats reality but if you go around searching for what people say you must face and call realityin other words if you go around obeying this thing well the only thing thats wrong with you can be healed and so forth if you just face reality now if you will just pay twentyfive dollars an hour and face reality well all be nuts excuse i mean well all be rich thats wrong too because the patient would be poor that is your standard therapeutic advice however face reality in other words agree with everybody becoming what you agree with well i dont know how sick you can get reading dale carnegie but its not well because to some slight degree you become that with which you agree if you agree that the desert is dirty place you will become dirty blunt as that you become to some degree that with which you agree and the only way you can escape it is to go uphigh enough up the tone scale so that you are creating an illusion for yourself i saw cartoon one day wonderful cartoon wonderful cartoon it said doctor i just go on day after day facing the same grim reality he had learned to face reality 100 percent and he was sick man your illusions what youve got to teach man to learn if you are going to teach him to learn anything is youve got to teach him to face his own illusions to hell with his reality everybody has got reality throw it overboard you start agreeing with every reality that you run into and you will have good time now in dianetics you go out in the society and you wonder why you have gone out of communication just little bit its because you dont any longer agree with their reality youve said their reality is too mest because you see reality is on this gradient scale too going out of communication and youve seen society which is perfectly willing to be in chaos whats this this thing is in chaos its solid chaos its going in all directions this way and so on and its going all so furiously and so fast and with so much force that it became solid and so there it is solid chaos and you get the society as it goes down the tone scale it approaches that chaos and when you get living culture which has gone down the line to where it doesnt care about this and it doesnt care about that and it says this is that and so on and so on and so on its getting too close to being dead culture and you being little higher up the tone scale say hey i dont want to be that dead that second youve gone out of agreement with it so your reality goes out of it and you go out of communication with it aesthetic beingness and you can say just bluntly that there will be as much communication as there is affinity there will be as much agreement as there is communication there will be as much affinity as there is communication they just interact interactany of the three points so youve got this whole band if you want to go up tone scale youll finally arrive at the beingness which is an aesthetic beingness and there alone is enough horsepower to come right around and actually create or disintegrate matter i snuck up on you with that one but thats what you do l ron hubbard from the lecture

to these lectures without the data from those lectures the route to infinity i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true my wife and i have been scientologists for over 25 years for variety of reasons we got stalled on the bridge i was at clear my wife at ot iii although we had the purpose and intention to move up the bridge it just wasnt happening as any scientologist would agree this creates serious failed purpose i started listening to the route to infinity lectures while in my car driving to and from sales and service calls and key datum that ron repeats frequently began to sink in from my own duplication of lrh it was as follows the mest universe is reality only because we all agree to it but that it is really an illusion and shabby one at that ones own universe is the actuality as thetan slides down the scale he reverses this concept so that his own universe becomes seemingly insignificant illusion the mest universe becomes the reality and that the actuality is lost to that thetan somewhere around the fourth lecture the datum finally sunk in and i cognited on what he was saying that the reason i was so pressed back having my intention blunted etc was because i believed that i could survive only if i agreed with mest until it would permit to survive when i got home i put aside all of the problems i was facing located myself in the room i was in and then created the illusion that i was in fact quite successful in anything i wanted to be that had all of the space i needed and could enjoy the game of life and get up the bridge less than two weeks later i pulled in the money to get going on the bridge again and to do it full time this year i have moved from stalled clear to ot iv my wife has completed ot iv and v and in less than two months we will be going to flag for vi and vii now from this viewpoint i see that i was imprisoned in structure of my own making unable to get out even though i was holding the key in my hand which i had forgotten about and i wasnt even aware that i held anything in my hand without the data from those lectures i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true i share this data with you with the hope and postulate that you can use the data in these lectures and if you are stuck trapped or blunted on your progress up the bridge i cannot recommend this data highly enough mt ot iv order your set now by clicking here or by phone 800 7221733 removelink 2003 bridge publications inc all rights reserved
