principal way to protect most commercially harvested wood from decay such wood has been used to build play structures picnic tables decks gazebos fences and walkways ar senic and chromium can be released from the preserved wood since december 12 2001 the federal insec ticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra scientific adviso ry panel sap group designed to provide balanced expert assessment of pesticiderelated issues to the administrator of the us environmental protec tion agency epa has recommended inter alia that ccatreated wood be coated and reco ated annually to reduce release of and exposure to arsenic and that biomonito ring study of children normally exposed to ccatreated wood should be conducted however epa does not believe there is any reason to remove or replace ccatreat ed structures on february 13 2004 the sap released its final report on epas draf t preliminary probabilistic risk assessment of the potential risks to children associating with ccatreated playsets and decks the agency says it will carefully consider the sap recommendations and revise the draft risk assessment as appropriate on march 19 2004 epa announced in the federal register the availability of the preliminary risk assessment for the reregistration eligibility d ecision this notice covered both occupational and environmental assessments on may 27 2005 epa released preliminary results from studies that showed that all of the 12 commercially available sealants tested reduced dislodgeable arsenic from ccatreat ed wood for up to 12 months of natural weathering while sealing can reduce the amount of arsenic getting into childrens skin the epa study results do not reveal the magnitude of that reduction epa has announced timeline of major pending actions including making available the final report of the sealant study end of 2005 the cca probab ilistic risk assessment end of june 2006 and the cca rere gistration eligibility decision end of september 2006 the wood treating industry by ja nuary 1 2004 voluntarily converted to nonarsenical preservatives for residentia l uses including copper boron azole cba and ammonia copper quaternary ammonia cq whose availabilities and costs are approximately those of cca in the past labeling had been on all cca products stating that use of cca would be allowe d for the affected residential uses after december 31 2003 wood treated prior

continuing study of the entire range of cca uses disposal of extant ccatreated w ood export and possible import of cca treated wood and wood products determination of the best ways to reduce arsenic exposure from extant wood and possible adverse effects from nonarsenic wood preservatives are continuing concerns health effects of cca high pressure was used to inject cca into wood while some people such as construction workers wood treaters or fi refighters might touc h inhale or ingest cca itself or ccatreated sawdust or smoke from fires the largest concern was possible exposure of children to cca which slowly leaches from ccatreated wood2 copper an essential nutrien t of relatively low toxicity is the component in cca causing the lowest level of concerns about safety or health as such epa did not conduct an exposure or risk assessment for copper chromium leaches from ccatreated wood mostly as chromium iii criii one of few forms of the element there may be trace amounts of chromium vihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32412crs2 3 azole also is used as an antifungal drug in humans eg fluconazole diflucan is brand name for this compound and keto conazole nizoral is brand name concern has been raised by some about the potential for azole compounds losing antifungal potency in humans because of its use in the environmentcrvi more toxic form of the element the rarity of crvi in cca leachate led epa to conclude that the toxicity of criii was the most appropriate toxicity endpoint the low toxicity of cr iii led epa to conclude that it was unnecessary to present shortterm intermediateter m or lifetime risks of exposure to cr iii arsenic is known human carcinogen and is acutely toxic the degree of carcinogenicity and toxicity depends highly on degree and route of exposure epa has over several years been tr ying to assess the risk of exposure to arsenic from cca treated wood wood preservatives overview untreated lumber cut from most commercially harvested tree species is subject to attack by insects and marine organisms or decay caused by fungi and bacteria decay or insect hazard generally is greates t where the wood is subjected to moisture especially in hot and humid climates or aquatic environments to protect untreated wood the lumber is placed in cylinders filled with the preservative solution and the preservative is pressurized until it penetrates the wood most commonly copper usually deri ved from recycled sources from the preservative deposited in the wood renders it useless as food source for termites and fungi the american wood preservers ins titute estimates that cca increases the life of wood products exposed to the environm ent from 7 to 12 times which is about 20 to 50 years representing significant re duction in need for replacement wood by enabling wood to last longer ccatreated wood is better positioned to compete with stone concrete brick or other longlived building ma terials expanding the market for wood the most common pressuretreated w ood preservative has been cca more recently copper boron azole cba has been used cba was introduced in 1982 and does not contain arsenic introduced very recently ammonia copper quaternary ammonia acq like cba provide s arsenicfree protection to wood3 in the past cca was prevalent and lowcost with the voluntary industry transition to nonarsenical wood preservatives cba and ac q have become more widely available at cost approaching that of cca in th past the industry saw decline during 2002 in production of cca pr oducts for re sidential uses of 25 with corresponding shift to alternatives labeling was required on all cca products stating that use of cca would be allowe d for the affected residential uses after december 31 2003 cedar redwood plastics tals and concrete continue to be available as construction materials that do not require the use of wood preservatives these wood and nonwood alternatives genera lly cost more than pressuretreated woods up to twice the cost of pr essuretreated woodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32412crs3 4 epa the wood preservative industry vari ous consumer groups and others agree that consumers should be informed of the presence of cca wood preservative especially so that steps are taken to limit exposure to cca ch steps include coating the wood not burning the wood not using the wood for kitchen count ertops or where it may become component of food and properly disposing of sawdust and scraps some others hold that an outright ban is needed 5 cpsc denies petition to ban cca pre ssuretreated wood playground

unpainted or uncoated cca wood tended to have gr een tint caused by chemical reactions that took place between the wood nd the preservatives ingredients as practical matter virtually all pressuretreated wood before 2004 was treated with cca there has been some interest in requiring labeling or banning of cca wood already in use beyond pesticides national environmenta l group petitioned epa in december 2001 to ban all residential uses of cca cpsc was petitioned in may 2001 by the environmental working group nd the healthy building network to ban cca wood for play structures4 on november 4 2003 cpsc announced that it had denied the petition noting that cca manuf acturers and epa had previously agreed to phase out cca treatment of wood for most consumer uses by the end of 20035 for regulatory purposes wood preservatives are considered pesticides and are regulated under the federal in secticide fungicide nd rodenticide act fifra establishing maximum levels of pesticides in or on food and regulating the sale distribution and use of pesticides in the united states are the responsibilities of epa under fifra the agency also is respons ible for ensuring that older pesticides continue to meet current science and re gulatory standards to this end epa reassesses the science and uses of older pesticides in reregistration program and determines whether changes are needed to sure the safety of c ontinued use of older pesticides those initially registered befo re november 1 1984 the agency presently is reassessing cca under the reregistra tion program in preparation epa is conducting two risk assessments one fo cuses on workers an occupational risk assessment and the other focuses on children draft probabilistic risk assessment for children was released in novemb er 2003 for scientific peer review on february 12 2002 epa nnounced voluntary deci sion by industry to move away from cca as preservative of wood for consumer use with the regulatory requirement of having only noncca pressuretreat ed wood manufactured for consumer use after december 31 2003 the agency describes its reregistration review process as having three major parts reliance on sound science epa reports that it is conducting review of ccarelated public hea lth and environmental studies is consulting with other federal entities and will use external peer review in its ongoing risk assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32412crs4 6 differences exist among some state and foreign governments in the ways they regulate use and disposal of cca wood california for example re quires that all ccatreated public play structures be coated and while most states allow ccatreat ed wood to be handled similarly to other discarded wood products nnesota does not switzerland vietnam and indonesia have banned arsenictreated wood while japan denmark sweden germany australia and new zealand have either restri cted it or proposed restrictions differences also exist as to what types of produc ts may be made of ccatreated woodinvolvement of stakeholders the agency reports working closely with wood treaters cca product regi strants retailers other federal entities trade associations nd public interest groups and consulting with foreign and state governments6 that have taken regulatory actions on cca to unders tand their scien tific assessments and reasons for their regulatory standards participation by the public epa reports that by making its assessments public opening co mment periods and conducting public meetings it seeks to maintain open dialogue with the public toward the goal of comprehensive and balanced regulatory decisions the agency reports that it was especially concerned about two major issues relating to ccatreated wood making cca safety and health information readily available to consumers and determining the potential risks to children from play structures treated with cca epa starte d an assessment early in 2001 focused on the potential exposure of children to cca treated wood play structures by early 2001 the agency was concerned that its consumer awareness program which was started in 1986 wa s not informing the public as well as intended epa therefore met in summer 2001 with represen tatives of the wood preservative industry registrants makers or users of cca regist ered with epa major retailers and public interest groups to expand the cca consum er awareness program which included labeling on all pieces of ccatreated lumb er instore displays and additional information packets available to the public by may 30 2001 epas office of pesticid programs opp had developed an internal draft assessment of risks associated with ccatreated wood the scientific advisory panel met in oct ober 2001 to discuss issues re lated to childrens exposure to cca from wood and on february 12 2002 the agency announced the voluntary action by industry to move away from cca preservatives recommendations of an independent panel fifra as amended by the food qua lity protection act of 1996 provides for the establishment of the fifra scientific advisory panel sap to provide advice information and recommendations to epa s administrator regarding the impact on health and the environment of pesticiderelated regulatory actions the sap provides scientific peer review of the epa

october 2001 the sap reported recommenda tions in memorandum in december 2001 to the director of epas office of pe sticide programs the saps report was not reviewed for approval by epa and doe s not necessarily represent the views of the agency or of any other agencies in the federal government epa received the recommendations and s reported that it has consider ed them the panel offered several conclusions nd recommendations including the following7 while the sap noted the need for additional studies especially of performance of different types and brands of coatings the panel found the evidence already sufficiently strong to recommend that epa should inform the public that certain coatings can substantially reduce the amount of cca that can be leached or dislodged from wood reductions of 70 to 95 in dislodgeable arsenic were seen in cca wood with coatings such as polyurethane and subjected to natural weathering the sap found evidence that wate r repellents adde d directly to the cca treatment solution reduced the amount of leachable or dislodgeable cca while the panel to that point f ound evidence that any particular coating was clearly superior or infe rior to any other confidence was highest for polyurethane as it re sulted in 70 to 95 reduction in dislodgeable arsenic in wellcont rolled field study realworld application allowing for effects of use and shortterm controlled laboratory study the sap recommended reapplication of coating every year although polyurethane still provide d up to 95 reduction after two years of exposure biomonitoring study

landf ills with hazardous waste management permits zardous waste landfill has double liner leachate and gas collection systems and piping of leachate to wastewater treatment plant in 1980 epa exempted cca wood from hazardous wast status as such unless state says otherwise16 cca wood may be disposed like other wood waste for example it may be put into construction and demolition landfills or burned in wastetoenergy facilities or made into mulch if the wood were now to be reclassifi ed as hazardous especially with the projected growth in disposal of cca wood concerns would exist regarding increased costs availability of suffi cient hazardous waste manage ment facilities and illegal dumping while epa continues to exempt cca wood from hazardous waste status the agency says that treated wood should neve r be burned in open fires fireplaces or stoves food should not come into direct contact with the wood hands should be thoroughly washed after contact with wood wood should be coated on regular basis nonarsenical alternatives be considered and epas consumer safety information sheet precautions should be followed17 legislative proposals the following bills relating to arsenic in
