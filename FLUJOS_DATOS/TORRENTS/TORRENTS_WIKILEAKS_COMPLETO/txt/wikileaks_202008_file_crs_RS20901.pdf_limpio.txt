summary the number of infants abandoned by their birth parents in public places appears to have increased in recent years prompting legislatures in 42 states to enact new legislation since 1999 for the most part th laws are intended to provide safe haven for birth parents to surrender their unharmed children and provide them protection from liability anecdotal reports suggest this issue may be growing in scope but comprehensive information is available the 107th congress passed the promoting safe and stable families am endments of 2001 pl 10733 which amended the definition of family preservation services to include infant safe haven programs legislation has been introduced in the 108th congress s 342 and hr 14 to ensure grantees under the abandoned infa nts assistance act of 1988 give priority to certain groups of children and to require additional reporting and evaluation elements an additional bill hr 77 has been in troduced and would require the justice department to collect and re port on data related to aba ndoned infants this report summarizes available information on the issue and on state laws that have been enacted it will be updated to follow any legislative action in congress scope of the problem 1 the only national data currently availa ble suggests that incidents of infant abandonment in public places increased during th last decade the department of health and human services hhs commissioned search of major newspapers between november 1991 and november 1992 and also between november 1996 and november 1997 and found published reports of 65 babies abandoned in public places during thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20901crs2 2 these numbers exclude international cases doublecounting of the same cases that were reported multiple times in the press and cases where homicide was certain hhs characterizes this research methodology as lessthanperfect and suggests that the increase between 1992 and 1997 in the number of babies abandoned in public places may also represent changes in the extent of reporting or in the number of newspapers in cluded in the lexisnexis data base which was the source of the information 1998 national estimates

were found dead in 19911992 compared to 33 who were found dead in 199619972 it is important to note that the term aba ndoned infants as the focus of recent state laws and congressional interest refers to babies who are abandoned in public pl aces such as public buildings or trash bins both hhs and the abandoned infants assistance resource center aiarc3 use the term discarded infants to distinguish these children from the larger population of abandoned infant s who are born in hospitals but not likely to be discharged in the custody of their biological parent because the parent is either unwilling or unable to care for them hhs estimates that this latter population was 17400 children in 1998 increased from 13400 children in 1991 according to reports from state child welfare agencies and hospitals4 another 11900 children in 1998 compared with 9700 in 1991 were classified as boarder ba bies or infants who remain in the hospital after they are medically ready to go home these children may eventually return to their biological familie s or be placed in foster care states are required to submit data to hhs on the number and characteristics of children in their foster care population incl uding their reason for placement into foster care which may include abandonment acco rding to hhs abandonment was cited as reason for entry for 5 of children of ll ages who entered foster care in 2001 among those children for whom reason for entry was indicated aba ndonment was cited for 5 of such children who entered foster care in 2000 and 6 in 1998 and 1999 these data do not provide detail on the circumstan ces of the abandonment such as where it occurred moreover abandonment may not be the only reason for entry into foster care as states may indicate multip reasons for placement nature of the problem since little is known about the number of in fants abandoned or d iscarded in public places information also is s carce about the characteristics of these children and their parents or the circumstances of their abandonment th abandoned infants assistance resource center cites research on mothers who have killed their newborns on the day

httpwwwagiusaorgpubsspib_iapdfbirth as the most closely comparable information5 using that body of research supplemented by media accounts of pub lic abandonments aiarc suggests that individuals who kill their newborns or pub licly abandon their infants are predominantly very young single physically healthy women who are not addicted to substances and who are pregnant for the first time typically they live with their parents or other family members and particular race ethnic or income group seems predominant these young women remain silent nd isolated during their pregna ncy have generally made plans for the birth or care of their child and receive prenatal care according to aiarc massive denial is characteristic the women are often insufficiently mature to consider the consequences of their acti ons reasons for killing or abandoning the baby include the father being married to some one else rape nonmar ital pregnancy and perceiving the child as an obstacle to personal achieveme nt says aiarc again it is worth noting the differences between the traits that are assumed to characterize mothers who kill or discard th eir infants and those who abandon their newborns in the hospital or ar not allowed to take them home according to research review from aiarc women who leave their ba bies in the hospital are older perhaps an average age of 27 have had other pregnancie s an average of four and are usually poor and dealing with such issues as homelessn ess abusive relationships hiv infection mental illness andor very often substance abuse6 state legislation the national conference on state legislatures ncsl has been tracking developments at the state level regarding abandoned infant legisl ation and reports that texas was the first state to enact such law in 19997 however some localities had adopted safe haven policies ear lier texas enacted its w after 13 babies were found abandoned in that state during 10month pe riod ncsl reports that another 24 states considered similar laws in 2000 and 15 enacted them twenty states enacted laws during the 2001 legislative session of which five had also considered such legislation in 2000 and bills had been introduced in another 11 of which two had considered bill in 2000 in 2002 seven states enacted abandoned infant legislation8 see table 1 next page in general state laws address the voluntar surrender of unharmed infants by parents or others who express intent to return for the child under these laws hospitals or emergency medical services pr oviders and in some states police and fire stations and child welfare agencies are required to take custody of the children without court order and immediately notify child protective services or law enforcement agency the

the cwla report stipulate th at the safe haven must do anything necessary to protect the childs physical health and safety9 in turn many states provide immunity from civil or criminal liability for worker s in these facilities who accept the infants using different legal mechanisms state laws either eliminate or reduce the threat of prosecution against the parent if the child is unharmed and voluntarily delivered to the health care provider or other signated safe haven state laws vary on the age of the child who may be surrendered unde r these provisions of states that enacted laws in 1999 through 2002 the maximum age for legal aba ndonment ranges from 72 hours to one year with most states requiring the child to be 72 hours or younger 15 or 30 days or younger 13 in general parents ma remain anonymous guaranteed in 27 states although some states have exclusions in the case of abuse and one stat requires the woman to provide proof of identity if available along with name and address10 in addition the evan b donaldson adoption institute reports that twenty states do not address parental provision of family medical history 11 require safe havens to attempt to elicit this information the remainder st ate that safe havens may re quest or parent s may provide this information additionally approximately twothir ds of state laws address termination of parental rights in some manner less than third of states require safe havens to provide information regarding reunification or parental rights to parents abandoning their children more than half provide procedure for bi ological parents to reclaim their children11 though few states collect any data to eval uate their safe haven programs the evan b donaldson adoption institute has co mpiled data from various news accounts of abandonments in texas there have been nearly 100 illegal abandonments and five abandonments at safe havens over the past two years since colorados law was enacted in june 2000 eight babies have been left ille gally and two have been dropped off at safe havens californias law was enacted in january 2001 and estimates of illegally abandoned babies range from 38 to 86 and legally abandoned babies from 19 to 20 lastly since floridas enactment of the law in may 2001 an timated 11 babies have been left at safe havens and 14 were illegally abandoned table 1 state enactment of abandoned

promoting safe and stable families pssf amendments of 2001 was signed into law in part this legislation amended the definition of family preservation services to include infant safe haven programs that provide way for parent to safely re linquish newborn infa nt at safe haven designated pursuant to state law states are therefore allowed to use pssf funds to support infant safe haven pr ograms the annual progress and services reports asprs submitted by states to hhs on june 30 2003 will be the first set of reports indicating how the states may have spent pssf funds on safe haven programs in the 108th congress the senate and house have passed similar bills s 342 and hr 14 to reauthorize several programs and identical provisions regarding the abandoned infants assistance act aiaa as of april 7 2003 the senate had requested conference on s 342 the keeping children and families safe act of 2003 this bill would prevent hhs from making grants unde r the abandoned infants assistance act unless according to the report language the gr antee agrees to give priority to abandoned infants and young children who are infected w ith or are perinatally exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus hiv have lifeth reatening illness or other special medical need or have been perinatally exposed to dangerous drug s 342 would also require hhs to 1 provide evaluations of project s carried out under aiaa 2 conduct study providing further information on abandoned in fants or young children and their parents and 3 evaluate and report on intervention methods before abandonments and effective methods for responding to the needs of abandoned infants and young children additionally hr 77 bill requiring the jus tice department to create task force to collect and report on infant abandonment was introduced and as of april 8 2003 was referred to the house judiciary committee and the house education and the workforce committee identical bills to hr 77 had been introduced in the 106th and 107th congresses hr 2018 was introduced yet not passed in the 107th congress and would have allowed states to use block grant funds under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program to support safe havens for infants nd would also have required hhs to provide further information on abandonments hr 2018 was referred to subcommittees in both the house ways and means committee and the house education and the workforce committee but action was taken httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20901crs6 issues the federal government plays an indirect role in child welfare issues which are primarily function of state g overnments as described bove considerable activity has occurred and is continuing in state legislat ures across the country where the debate over safe haven laws is primarily taking place advocates of these laws believe they will reduce the number of infant abandonments in dangerous settings preventing risk to the babies and possibly death if desperate birth parents have safe alternative eliminating the fear of prosecution enables and encourag these parents to act responsibly and consider the safety of their children even wh they feel they ca nnot care for the children themselves others argue that these laws encourage irres ponsible behavior may result in more abandonments and may induce abandonm ent by women who otherwise would have sought additional support and services more over by allowing bi rth parents anonymity important medical or other ge netic information may never be obtained and some of these children may be difficult to place for adoption pa rticularly if the pr ocess of terminating parental rights is difficult or prolonged thes laws also might interfere with the parental rights of fathers if they are unaware of the babys birth and s ubsequent and legal abandonment finally pregnancy preventi on and family preserva tion are not generally addressed in these laws nor do they provide for counseling or medical services to birth parents who may need them practical considerations include awareness of the safe haven ws and the extent to which pregnant women and their partners know about them likewise the effectiveness of these laws assumes that anyone workin g in facility required to accept abandoned babies is familiar with the laws provisi ons and the anonymity and protection from prosecution that it provides to participating parents advocates note the importance of public awareness campaigns and the need for adequate funding for such campaigns and for the training of hospital and other worker s who might be affected by these laws in addition some state safe have n programs may be in conflic t with existing laws such as those dealing with termination of parental rights tpr for instance most state child welfare laws require the state to search for the parents prior to the termination of parental rights however these types of searches may be hindered by the anonymity provisions in safe haven laws as stated above the federal role in these issues is indirect since child abandonment as either criminal or civil issue is governed by state and not federal laws however states are now permitted to use portions of their pssf funds on infant safe haven programs and legislation is cu rrently pending that would re quire further data collection and the dissemination of reports and evaluati ons regarding infant abandonment there is general agreement that little information is available on which to base policy decisions and that more information is needed about the number of children who are abandoned and the causes of these abandonments at the sa time there is cern that quality data collection in general is needed in the child welfare area and that focus on the relatively small number of children who are abandoned or discarded in public places should not detract from ongoing efforts by state child welfare agencies to collect and analyze information on the larger numbers of child ren who are abandoned abused or neglected including those who subsequently enter foster care
