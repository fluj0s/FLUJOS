the overtmotivator sequence lecture given on 3 april 1962 thank you what is this audience april the 3rd the 3rd of april 3 april by golly youre right one lecture saint hill briefing course 3 april ad 12 and i havent got anything to lecture you about because i got withhold female voice what is it male voices tell us well yeah i got withhold male voice whats itwhats it about are youare you interested audience yes well i havent prepared it or revved it up but iive been taping class iv audience aahhhh and i finally just tipped it overjust tipped it over on class iv and so forth and now i got it taped ive been fooling with this for some timewhat do you do with 3d criss cross items and that sort of thing and what do you know this is all im going to tell you this isnt lecture on the subject the only thing i was withholding is that the solution to what you do with 3d criss cross items of course is the resolution of what makes the overtmotivator sequence and ive suspected this for some time and i just got some processes and so forth here which undo the overtmotivator sequence i think its absolutely fascinating and the withhold in this lecture would be the fact that i out of my own interest and so forth would normally talk to you garrulously about this particular action because im terrifically interested in itthe overt motivator sequence how the hell did it ever get that way you know and can it be undone ive been asking that question for ages instead of having to run it cant you undo it because i know itd be junior phenomenon see and sure enough apparently you can undo it and so thats good piece of news so anyhow im not going to give you any more about that particular right now end of withhold iim delighted you see because if you think of running out all the things which you have done and from which you are suffering at the present time you see when you run these out one by one and selectively on the whole track it becomes one of these things like running out every engram on the whole track its just an impossible action its so long and arduous you take jim over there for instance or you take dick or somebody like this and you get all of these overtsyou get the idea we wont even mention peter you get these fantastic numbers of overts and if youre going to suffer from every overt you have ever committedsee thats impossible i mean mathematically on one lifetime youd be dead dozen lives over dont you see and if you got motivator for every overt for instance and so forth how could you live so ive been fooling around with lot of combinations that have to do with energy and mest universe ideas and ideas and that sort of thing and itscomes out rather well and apparently its very junior idea to prevent people from attacking and i have now told you about all there is to know about it even though i would love to go on discussing it for long time its just mechanism to do just that one thingnothing else thats it well end of withhold im terrifically interested in the class iv you have idea this has practically laid in my grave trying to get this thing done because you start going over the top of the whole goals problem mass and just not is the lot and sit around and look it square in the teeth and reserve aplomb in one way or the otherits something on the orderits something like living in the middle of the living lightning dont you know and like got my head kicked off on this one but thats about all it amounts to its fascinating isnt it and its justits just mechanism it is not even an axiom see its nothing because every way you look at it it cant be itd be impossible and there wouldnt be any way by which this could be you see if the only thing that ever affected anybody was you in the final analysisyou get this nowthen you would have perfect alibi for everything you had ever done to anybody dont you see that at once you have never done anything to anybody you see so therefore looking at that that makes it look pretty specious you know you say well thats female voice yeah thats kind of gag and now if nobody ever was affected by anything except what they themselves did do you realize you have never talked to anybody anyplace audience hmmm yeah see so from all these sides you know ive told you for years the overt actmotivator sequence was limited i knew it was limited but i couldnt find the entrance point of how the hell you ran it out and i imagine i must have tried at least oh i dont know fifteen hundred two thousand combinations trying to blow this thing down just as itself so thatthat isthat would runthat would run on case just nothing wouldexcept itself you look at it from numerous other angles and it becomes impossible if only you have ever affected you and nobody else has ever affected you numerous things then apply and amongst those things you wouldnt even be able to keep the same time track see theres lot of things wrong with the overtmotivator sequence ive known that these things werent reasonable but i knew at the same time that everybody had fallen for this malarkey and that everybody responded to it well if everybody responds to it and everybody has fallen for it and it processesyou ask fellow what hes done and this immediately relieves things and his withholds and all that sort of thingthese things are all pertinent to this and they all relieve dont you see i mean you can work with this you can operate with this so it doesnt wipe out all processes which do things with it dontdoesnt wipe out prepchecking you can sit down and prepcheck somebody you know thats fine but how about just knocking the whole ruddy computation in the ead and now i have just opened up nice wide open twelvepass express highway that does it is just mechanism to prevent people from attacking thats all and handled in that fashion in processing why it all becomes very explicableruns in other words like to kill you running it but i dont wish to leave you in mystery ill give you specific process what shouldnt attack what shouldnt you attack that should carry you well enough of course to keep in communication with the subject why you have to add attack you know and then because that wont be explicit to some people you will have to get synonyms for attack these are the usual complications which arise when you release process so if you do an overt assessment of the overt secondary scale itll probably give you better word for your one particular pc but it would be on the basis of should and shouldnt but this of course could be expected to be modified to could and couldnt and have and havent you see the variations these are the normal variations through which process goes but if you just got somebody to list who was sitting in whole bunch of motivators and overts and so forthjust list what they shouldnt attack just is as easy as that that you should remember was the leadin it might not be the final process that you run but that was the leadin on the research level which gave the result and made all of sudden the overtmotivator phenomena look of course as corny as christmas tinsel its just mechanism by which people have dreamed up ways and means to prevent other people from attacking that is all of course you dont want people attacking you so of course you tell them that you shouldnt be attacked and you tell them how you shouldnt be attacked and then you tell them what they shouldnt attack dont you see and what you overlook is at the same time theyre teaching you what you shouldnt attackthe same time youre doing this so eventually it looks like you have an overtmotivator sequence see the most sensible thing in the world is is theres certain things which you in human body shouldnt attack and the lesson which you learn from the physical universe that if you attack these things you get hurt and that is the basic mechanism and the learningness which underlies all the overtmotivator phenomena see well then if you dont believe take your fist sometime and start buzz saw up andoh and lets not be quite that violentlawn mower will doand hit the lawn mower in the blades while it is running well as far as thats concerned just find nice rough stone wall and haul off and hit it and you are immediately taught this lesson that you shouldnt attack it because it reduces your havingness of course so you teach yourself the lesson that you shouldnt attack and then this goes into philosophic wingding and the philosophic wingding comes after this fact you see after youve learned that you shouldnt stick your paws into lawn mowers orand shouldnt kick paving blocks and various thingswhen youve learned all these thingswhy of course youve learned the remainder that is what you do unto others will happen to you thats not true at all thats philosophic extrapolation from the fact of what you do you get recoils from and it comes back to the basic law of inertianewtons law of inertia its physical universe lawis what you hit hits back its as simple as that now you can build this up philosophically that if you say something critical of joe joe is going to say something critical of you and if you say something critical of joe why then you can be hurt by joes criticism but withhold is basically nothing more than your unwillingness to attack or your unwillingness to be attacked and thats all withhold is you can take any withhold persons gotif he gives you this withhold you could ask him well what shouldnt attack you about that and run that off and then what shouldnt you attack in this particular wayany phraseology you care to lose use your withhold is going to evaporate and your withhold system also takes care of it but there it is its quiteits justits quite fascinating im sure you will excuse my absorption with this particular scene in view of the fact that it is the single complication that makes your case awfully complicated you get so that you wont bawl out cops and you go around being good and all kinds of wild things accumulate as reason for this personally ive never learned this too well its not that ive been particularly bad in that particular thing but inobody has ever really taught i shouldnt attack i mean its been rather hard to grapple with the thing people have tried people have tried but ill give you little hysterhistorical notea little hysterical notehere which you might find amusing hasnt anything to do with the price of fish one of the points where this broke down was i was examining what on the track i felt worst about i wasnt getting audited i was trying to find out what i felt worst about seeyou know that i had done i was trying to bracket this thing this overtmotivator sequence you see and it was necessary that i do this and get studying it and ive been very reticent about this recently for this reason is it looked for while that doing anything to anybodys mind was the most destructive thing you could possibly do thats quite interesting i was studying that you know and i got the bad auditor and so forth and i went and looked at this even further and taking responsibility for somebody elses mind and that sort of thing it looked like it was pretty bad show see so that looked awfully bad for auditors well i wasnt trying to disprove this and you can get quite jolt out of this by running it on somebodywhose mind have you helped or something like that you know and you would think offhand that this would be what tangled up your wits you seewould be helping somebody or doing something with their mind and i went through little period there of looking this thing over and it had limited workability and it did make some sense one way or the other and fortunately proved to be not true at all it is the energy involved its the attack on the energy involved its the attacking of energy and its not even bad to attack energy its just that you have tried to convince people and people have tried to convince you that it was very bad to attack energy so you become allergic to energy the definition of being goodas long as i find myself talking about thisthe definition of being good is the definition of being overwhelmed you see person who is good is overwhelmed i first began this study nautically in this life it was naval study with and one thing iill hold something that bugs that i dont understand and ill put it in bullpen and ill put it over on the side and ill say this green puzzle doesnt fit with these pink pieces you know what is this thing you know well one of those things was the fact that every fighting man i ever had under was always in bad with other people at time when they needed fighting men and the only people that were getting any pats on the back with the shore patrols and so forth were people who werent worth damn i mean thatjust werent worth damn there was definitely something wrong here id have six or seven sailors out of couple of hundred you know and theydman action be engaged one of those fellowsi dont think the period could have been longer than about minute or thirty seconds or something like thathe was at the wheel correcting the course he was up on the gunnery platform correcting the training of the guns he was down studying the chemical recorder and he was handling the engine room telegraphs and while he was doing all this he was carrying on conversation with and on almost any ship i ever had in action thered not be more than four or five people on the ship that would help fight her you had this enormous supernumerary you see out there that always bugged because these boys were the boys who were always in trouble the people didnt like these fellows they were always in bad they werent particularly bad people but they were just always in trouble ive seen it now you know some fellow hedgod hed have hash marks and hed have gold chevrons and eagles you know clear up to his shoulder and hed come aboard you know reading horace or something you know hed walk aboard with his package of laundry or something or otherromantic thing you knowand check himself in at the gangway and go below and put away his book and his nice clean uniform and his record would be beautiful and hed always say yes sir and everything would be so nice and he was very pleasant fellow and not very obtrusive nice man you know and so forth and hed have all of the bonuses you know and hed have all of the stuff that anybody ever awarded anybody service record you know laudable terrific marvelous you know and youjust rave notices in this damn thing and in action you would just have to knock him out of your road that was all always be in your damn road go on up forward someplace and you know stand down there with the damage control party dont get in the road you know some totally ineffective function get him out of the road ammunition passermaybe youd get the ammunition there and maybe you wouldnt you see but thered justgawdthered just be dozens of these guys see just dozens of these birds drawing all the pay getting all the pats on the back and then here would be these madmenalways in trouble always upset when the ship was engaged it would have sunk without them see well theres something here see these werent necessarily bad men looking them over they werent criminals nothing like that but just nobody liked them this fact used to stick in my craw i used to study this i did an awful lot of studying of men and life and things like this and its something i didnt quite understand but the shore patrol just loved these other fellows i never knew what to do with themuse them for spare anchors or something like that it wasnt that i didnt have their loyalty and affection i did but action would be engagedthey would be just as calm as they always were now you study men under stress and men in various guises and men under various actions of this particular character and you find out that the world has built up series of superstitions about people and theyre not facts theyre superstitions they hardly even are dignified as findings your animal psychologist has categorized the whole lousy lot i mean hes got them all his textbooks are nothing else but the mirage of ought to be see theres facts in there its just bunch of ought to be he tells youeverybody beware of anybody who is active isnt that interesting beware of anybody who is active you will find in the civil defense manuals of the united states government in that area delegated tohapsychology that the whole provision that they have made is for anybody who gets active and if citizen were to start flying around and talking about what should be done or what shouldnt be done or blaming the government or saying anything like this he is the one you have the butterfly nets for and this is why you have psychological units in civil defense teams theyre the butterflynet people and theyre supposed to pick up these guys who get active and thats exactly what it says im not minimizing this or im not stretching it ori dont have to i mean its marvelous example of be good you see the whole us civil defense system is based on the idea that there is thing called the government which is composed of people which already is silly and theyre going to take over the country at the moment of an attack see they arent there now theyre not part of the people and theyre not human you see and theyre parked up someplace in canada along the dew line or down in mexico or out on some islandand they dont exist there now and at the moment of an attack nobody is supposed to do anything but be taken over by the government thats what youre supposed to do in an attack consider it absolutely fascinating its just as bad as eisenhowers design for the normandy landing i mean there was nothing worse than that i didnt know this until the other day im going to write book on it im going to call it the great myth you see i was pacific amphibious warfare officer before these normandy landings occurred and theres certain ways youre supposed to make landings well they didnt make them that way at normandyhaha they killed men instead so anyhow i didnt know it was that bad but this is some more of your the government knows all sort of situation and individual is going to do anything you got that individualwere not going to count on any individuals the government is going to do these things you get the idea the government is going to somehow or another cantotally disassociated from anything that is made out of skin and blood see this is all going to be attended to so the government teams are going to take over in certain zones of the city and so on and its all worked out and the only thing theyve overlooked is these people are people and apparently looking over the normandy beachhead landing schedule there werent going to be any people involved and there was going to be war involved i think this was interesting those two oversights that they made as early as 1941 i noticed something that probably nobody has noticed that i might comment on andthat war is the antithesis of organization and if you organize in some dim hope that when battle is joined that organization is going to prevail youre going to lose your war because then it breaks down to the being the person the man on the job and the other schedules never go off right they just never never go off right the fellow who is supposed to be there at 561well i can tell you from experience that he is never there till five hundred and sixtyone if he appears at all and if the whole intricate machinery depends utterly upon this man pushing button at 561 man youve had it because thislook this fellow is flesh and blood this fellow is dieable and war is the antithesis of organization war is chaos and the only thing that you can organize for is chaos and if youre going to organize it organize for chaos and thats the only way you can organize and if youre going to organize for chaos theres one thing that you must count on utterly the individual there can be great thirddynamic shadow which suddenly spreads out across the land and makes everything all right who are these beings that are going to take over the middle of these huge cities and set it all to rights after the bombs have landed see who are they well theyre human beings well by that very fact you can count on the fact that some of them are going to be missing now in space opera we very often tape this better than they do on planets very often very often they have relatively indestructible dolls relatively indestructible robots but theyre forced into building these things by this other factor the extreme destructibility of individuals and beings in areas of disaster and even in space opera these fellows disappear oh i love one of these its like thei dont know what battle that was i dont know what the union called it it was one of the first battles that grant fought the confederate general was johnstonvery early out in the west someplace or another but the only thing the poor confederates did wrong was draw up wonderful plan of battle the most marvelous intricate plan of battle you ever saw at these times these regiments were going to be there and this was going to be there and everything was going to be there and it was all going to be marked out this way and of course they do all this for battlefield nobody has been on yet dont you see they lost we got clobbered this normandy beachhead demolition teams had twenty minutes to knock out all the underwater obstacles on the whole of the normandy beach pfft in the pacific we used to spend three days and use certain tools but they didnt do it over there they had schedule and it ran offbzzzzzt and for seven minutes this happened and then seven minutes this happened part of this schedule is pinned to an actual event dont you see part of this schedule is pinned to anything having happened its only pinned to the clock do you see that you get how mad this will get after while see unless you pin something to an event and say seven minutes after this happens or has occurred then you start the next event well you can do that but you for sure cant say at 6 oclock this happens and then at 7 minutes after 6 this happens and at 15 minutes after 6 this happens and at 630 this happens well you can count you see on whatever is happening at 615 has probably not quite arrived and is probably taking place at 635 so the team that is route to do this thing at 630 runs into the team that hasnt done what it was supposed to do at 635 and uhoooooh dont you see what happens confusion is an untimed uncontrolled area well youve only got oneone guy youve only got one guy i dont care how many textbooks you write or how many psychologists you give degrees to youve in the final analysis only got one thing and that is being an individual being thats the only thing youve got now he havemay have responsibilities and he may have dynamics and he may have lot of other things but thats all youve got and dont forget it you know i can see some south american reformer some simon bolivar great guy simon bolivar doubt about it whatsoever and this is not what he did but i can see some lofty ivorytowered character and he says now lets see our people should do this and our people should do that and the government should do this and the government should do that and then all will work out to marvelous utopia yes so here is the schedule well man id let that poor fellow in on something he is working with the individuals he is working with and he is working with nobody else now every once in while somebody runs an ought to be on on organizations and i noticed from an essay peter wrote one day over telex spontaneouslyoh its snide piece of thing you cant mock up thetan but they run it on other people besides and people are always saying to well why dont you get some good people in central organizations thats hell of slam isnt it people on the outside why dont you get some good people in scientology you see wheres this fantastic reservoir called good people where is it well i can tell you the last one to have monopoly on it is the united states government or any other government they dont even know that it might exist but all of their actions are based on the fact that in some mysterious way good people are suddenly going to occur without anybody doing anything about it you know justjust from somewhere good people its as pathetic as the greeks sitting down at battle one time as it talks about in plutarchs lives sacrificing and making auguries until the right moment to repel the attack you know greeks are just falling in windrows on all sides of this dumb bunny and hes busy slitting the guts of birds to find out if its all right to make the attack you see that liver isnt all right give another bird slit him up that liver isnt all right man its whats known as being auguried to death even private commented on it and went down into history there isnt any such reservoir there isnt any such reservoir and thats basically what everybodys got on automatic at this particular time theyve basically got it all on automatic good people thats what they got on automatic everall the systems are geared for good people government selection military selections schoolteachers everything else anyanybody that you can think ofits all geared to the fact that from some mysterious reservoir someplace some good people are going to come along and pass some examinations and itll all be all right brother one of these fine days st louis or chicago or somebody the rest of their atomic plan by the way depends utterly on the fire engines coming from chicago to take care of st louis and the fire engines from st louis going to chicago to take care of chicago it never occurred to these dumbthatnever occurred to them that any elementary atomic planning would cause the bombing of st louis and chicago simultaneously so anyway they got it all figured out that from some mysterious reservoir why these minutemen of steel impervious to all excitement are going to show up and what are they going to do whats their first instruction with regard to people that to take anybody who is doing anythingsee any private citizen that isnt duly authorized you know isnt wearing the magic badge fifth fire brigade or something or the royal atomic defenders of the gasworks or something if he hasnt got the right badge and hes trying to say to people go down that street there because its still open if hes standing there at the corner doing this then the butterfly squad has orders to pick him up hes the man they want in the nearest hoosegow quick and that is what the psychologist in an atomic war is being trained to do to pick up the active person i consider this fabulous you know i studied civil defense in the united states and then my stomach gave out actually there are probably only about five thousand people in the united states that know anything about disaster relief and not one of those people has ever been called to the civil defense department which i consider very very interesting they were the people who handled civil defense in the various war theaters under chaos and so forth but these beautiful organizations man yeah george bill and pete will go in joes car three and half minutes after the first alarm from the south entrance of the building oh you know you can see it now they never get out of the car park just one of the things that happened bill didnt bring his car to work that morning see youre dealing with beings youre not dealing with punchedtape card systems and that sort of thing youre dealing with individuals and i dont care whether youre trying to make perfect government or if youre trying to make perfect civilization or more livable world or anything else the basic building block with which you build is an individual and there is other building block god isnt building block government isnt building block the society for the prevention of cruelty to uniformed cats isnt building block none of these things are building blocks it all comes down to the individual is he any good or isnt he and thats the other question is he competent or incompetent united states todaynot roasting the united states particularlyrecently passed rule that officer could be promoted until his wife had been passed on by the admiral well i suppose ive been an admiral few times in my past lives but i never went that far to make person honesti never had to go that far i didnt i never had to go that far you just look around theres this pretty girl its pretty girl all right and you used to say whhst you know like that you never had to pass law under congress that part of an officers fitness report was the availabilityi mean excuse methe niceness of his wife i can just see that wife now out there on the bridge of the destroyer steering like mad during the battle cant you i can see it now oh man how decadent can you get whats that got to do with it and yet ive seen officers and officials and organizational people promoted simply because they could slap better on the back and hold more liquor more asininely than anybody else around so of course they get promoted its competence if you want to get something done you depend on the competence of an individual not his socialness or whether hes good fellow its can he do his job that is all can he do his job now yes it is true that an individual can be so mean and so vicious and so something or other that he gets in the road of doing his own job never met one myself but im sure that can exist an individual is either competent or incompetent now when an individual ceases to be able to run his own life you always can have communism you can always have these group idiocies which take responsibility for conduct out of the hands of the individual and place it in the hands of some godawful godhelpus monster whereby everybody decides this everybody decides what hes supposed to do and what he isnt supposed to do and whether he can spit and whether he can breathe andand so forth but let ask the burning question whos going to tell him see you get the point this is thethis is the idea they never think they never think this one other step after youve destroyed all the individuals whos going to tell them they never think of that one its fascinating point its the automaticity of competencethe automaticity of this vast reservoir of competence which somehow or another is always going to rise up someplace one of the ways they meet this is theyve got everything all geneticized you know you raise good horses you know if you breed the right mares with the right stallions why you get an intelligent horse i dont think anybody has ever been able to make animal husbandry work but its still popular superstition if you make being horse so uncomfortable that thetanno selfrespecting thetanwill have anything to do with it youll have bunch of creep horses you will too you can see them at the horse show now misbehaving all right now the basis of the individual is his ability to observe and make decisions and to act and that is ability his ability to observe to make decisions and to act he has to be able to inspect and know what he is looking atwhat he is looking at he has to be able to make sensible summary of what he is looking at and he has to be able to act in accordance to what hes inspected now i dont care if you go into the field of study this is true of student this is true of soldier this is true of anybody if he cant observe and cant make decisions about what he observes why hes in bad shape hes in bad way very promptly well he couldnt help but be i mean if youif you knock out any one of those pointsall right he can observe and he can make decision but he iscant actin any way shape or form cannot act on his datayouve got fool now you take somebody who can observe all right and see what hes looking at but is unable to make decision before he acts hes nut now youve got somebody thats perfectly competent to make decisionperfectly competent to make decisionand perfectly competent to act but always does so without observing anything youve got catastrophe man thats catastrophe you got congress congress is always building manofwar you know in 1896 they were building square rigged lineofbattle wooden manofwar they actually appropriated money enough to build that thing they couldnt observe where they were they kind of slipped on the time track so anyhow you got these various things now the only way you could have good country from my point of view well you can have all kinds of systems doesnt matter how many systems you have the world is systemhappy right now my god the one thing we dont need is one more governmental system they havent got good one butand they probably could use onebut actually they havent got the fundamental on which you would build system and the fundamental youd build system on would be an individual i dont care how many communisms or engelsisms or something that you dream up youre never going to have utopia you can platoize day and night for years and never come up with utopia that would work unless you have individuals who are able to observe to decide and to act im sure that mussolini taking people who werethey had been pretty badly knocked around over long period of timehe was making his way but he was still having to make all the decisions in rome all the decisions had to be made in rome and the only trouble with fascist government in small town was they could maybe observe and they could maybe act but they had to telephone rome for the decision well the funny part of it is you see rome wasnt there to observe and rome wasnt there to act so this got prettylooking pretty weird and theira government like that gets pretty unwieldy nevertheless they were making their way forward until they finally got knocked in the head they got knocked in the head because individually they hadnt come up along the line into enough determinism yet to actually stand on their own two feet the mainthe main thing im trying to say is here is just theif you havent got the individual you have nothing and if you go in the direction of system if that system isnt designed to eventually make individuals then its system which will fail its the only kind of system that you dare embark upon you embark upon any other system that ends up in slavery or ends up in the total subjugation of individual ability to observe ability to decide and ability to actif you impede any one of those three things youre going to find yourself with slave society on your hands i dont care how many labels the thing has so the onlyonly system that is justified is any stopgap system which pushes people forward in this direction i know i myself am rather proud of the fact that the despatch traffic to from any central organization of five years ago consisted easily of five hundred pieces of paper for every one i get today isnt that interesting the volume used to be fantastic you know ron can i spit man iditd just be about that bad and that has just cut down and cut down and cut down and cut down because all the time were working in the directionwe have this tremendous advantage of course individuals are becoming more independent and more capable of observation and so forth i dont go on the basis that its all right for them to make terrible blunders and knock everybody in the head before they learn how to walk but i would incline slightly in that direction that it was better for them to make few mistakes than to be guided every minute of the time their cases are coming up the line everything is coming up from where i sit were making it just this way were getting more and more autonomy our communication lines are longer and longer we are acting oddly enough more and more in concert which is rather fantastic you know i mean the further apart we seem to be moving the more in concert we are seen to be acting and the more we get good individuals the more coordination and agreement we have isnt that peculiar the reason you have an organizational form and the reason i lay down organizational forms is basically one on experience and two to get agreement amongst organization members so that they can move forward but i myself in the early days was the first one to scoff at any need of organizational form as any oldtime staff member can tell you i used to say oh for christs sakes youre not going to make define that well yeah so theres an interim in which system can exist but that system gradually goes out of the way to the degree that individuals are brought up to being able to observe to decide and to act and its the only way you can make any progress from my point of view now i dare say if i were to talk to some professor of learnedology in spinbin u who had socialist penchant about it all i imagine that i wouldnt talk this way i would probably talk to make my point with him because i amuse myself with those jokers and he would be selling the great value of the system and i possibly would never even dare tell him what i thought or the truth because his realm is in the nevernever land of nowhere i well remember one debate that i had with such character he was one of the leading socialists of new york and before the evening was over in front of bunch of intellectuals he had admitted and declared and had now begun to stand up for this one interesting fact he had progressed from socialism is wonderful down to thisthis interesting fact that the only way that you could make socialism work was to kill every man woman and child in the world i finally got him to agree to this and was all set to go on forward on program to put it into effect when he suddenly found the garden path down which he had been led but he still had agreed that this was correct how he got there was of course just by total specious spuriousness you know making him agree by shades to agree by this to agree by that but it was all on this basis that you couldnt have an individual see obviously you see you have socialism why then obviously you couldnt have an individual if you had to have the socialism socialism must exist because you couldnt have an individual and then of course i led him on on this gradient scale and then finally he realized that the only way it would really work was to kill every man woman and child in the world and then it would really work you might really have socialism and he was quite sold on the program thats known as brainwashing by gradients but you see whereof i speak here now if we have systems which depend utterly on making people good we can never get out of the soup but we cant have systems which make everybody good if we mean by this blind acceptance of nowimsupposed to without inspection without decision but only by action if we totally concentrate on an actionan automatic actionand if we call that automatic action being goodsee you see an old lady crossing the street so youre being good you must help the old lady cross the street so now im supposed to help the old lady across the street you get the idea she just got through shooting her daughterinlaw in the guts you know and shes carrying the 45 in the bag but thats beside the point now im supposed to you see without observation youre supposed to act in certain set patterns that is what they call being good and the only way that is achieved is by overwhelming person with energy you overwhelm person you show him that he will get into too much actionmore action than he can standif he does not concur with this action in other words he chooses to have this minor act or actingness see he chooses this minor actingness in lieu of all of this rwooooooooowrwooooowr see of krwow see you know the way to make little johnny eat his peasis to take whip dont you see and to whirl it around in the air few times and hit him across in the behind and scream at him real loud well that is action he cannot confront isnt it so you get him to not confront this action in order to do the action of eating his peas see how that works there are other ways you go about this of total loss total ostracism youre going to be expelled from school if you dont studyif you dont studyoh i dont know what they study in school ive never been able to find out but if you dont study it why youre going to be expelled and your father and mother will never speak to you again and they wont feed you and youll be thrown into the gutter and socially you will be totally ostracized and thats what an f or g grade would mean when youre in the fourth or fifth grade see youre ostracized as matter of fact this even works on you see i use it simply on the basis of you better get rush on or something of the sort you dont take it that way you take it on ostracismron is mad at and so on i never feel that way at all its the outcreate of action which brings about the fixed actingness that we know as being good see we can create more action and energy than you can so therefore your only choice is to fit into this small actingness and energyness pattern you got the idea well you get into this on the basis of coordination you coordinate the actions of quite few people yeah you can snarl them into line and so forth it has certain workability but it only works up to the basis where they know it works or where they know it should work that way or something in other words itll only work in the direction of consulting their observation of things theyif they can now observe that this is workable or that they would do it anyhow and they would have decided to have done it anyhow and got on this actingness then perhaps you would be justified for while in saying rarararararara and im going to outcreate you until you do soandso and so forth you get the idea i can shout louder than you can so therefore youre going to do this actingness you get theyou get that ah but that is not the road the world follows the world follows total different one its regardless of whether this is reasonable or unreasonable or anything else man youre going to do it and youre going to be blind to everything else from there on we call it faith we call it discipline they used to take soldier who deserted from his post and stand him out in front of the rest of the troops and shoot him down or spreadeagle him on wheel and beat him to death or hang sailor over the gangway and slash him to death or just you know something like this on sundayyou never go to church on sunday three hundred years ago but what you didnt pass some guy in the stocks who had been doing something or other been drinking beer or something like that on saturday night or some other criminal action in other words there were various actions by which more energy was thrown at the individual than he thought he could confront this is the idea of making people good do you see so therefore he fixed in this pattern of action because it was choice of either fixing in this pattern of action or trying to face all of this unfaceable and unconfrontable energy do you follow thats being good now when you have totally disciplined nation you have total failure nation which would make everybody good and sacrifice every individual characteristic in it sacrifice everybodys observingness everybodys decidingnessyou got complete end product complete failure thats what youd wind up witha complete flop and theres where every old civilization goes and that is why they become old civilizations that is why they decay that is why they become decadent because people just become gooder and gooder and gooder by which we mean they observe less and less and they decide less and less you have this fellow walking down the middle of the street taking certain mincing gait and so forth not because he thinks its anything but because hes supposed to do it because his ancestors did it oh you can think of thousands of examples of this sort of thing and when you finally get totally decadent totally gone society it gets licked up by any chaos that hits it it can be overwhelmed by what well if everybody in it was trained to be good by being trained that they couldnt confront certain energy masses then of course any hostile energy mass that shows up can conquer it so an old civilization is set up by its own premises to become conquered and you have the cycle of civilizations and that is how they age and that is how they die now the way an individual ages the way he dies is to give up his power of observation and his power of decision and acts on the basis that he cannot do as much as he used to be able to do he cant stand as much as he used to be able to stand and he attributes this to advancing age he never attributes it to being able to stand less the source of advancing age is being able to stand less advancing age is not the cause of being able to stand less in other words aging is caused by lessening ability to confront action that is all its not because the person cant but he merely ages because he believes that he cant do you see how that goes its reverse look well if the way age is regarded at the present time doesnt solve old age which is that an individual gets less and less active the older he getsdo you see that one the less he is activeyou know the older he gets the less active he isif they follow that through uniformly let point out to you that this does not result in knockout of old age so it couldnt possibly be true if everybody believes this implicitly it couldnt be true because boy they really believe that one the medicos and everybody else believes that one the reverse is true that person gets as old as he is incapable of confronting energy whether its civilization or an individual or anything else you hear of somebody coming off the beaches at dunkirk with his hair turned white as snow yes well he aged well why did he age well he looked at lot of fury and ran away from it see why see how that is well now the age of the individual is established by his ability to regard action the concern of an individual with action is coaction or attack of action you can act with or you can attack an action or you can avoid the attack of an action in other words you eveneither have lot of energy which you are merely utilizing or youre attacking energy or being attacked by energy see i mean turning the band saw on and off and sawing up some lumber probably never made anybody insane yet but attacking everybody because they saw up lumber with band saws and going on considerable vendetta on the subject and then shooting all those people or something like that or being shot at in returnthat will cause an aberration because it singles one out from his natural ownership and responsibility of the universe an individual is first as big as the universe and then he selects out half of it to fight and so becomes half the size of the universe and then selects out half of the uthe remaining universe to fight and so becomes one quarter the size of the universe and then selects out half of the remainder to fight and so becomes oneeighth the size of the universe and i could go on and enumerate these steps but why should i when here you are your size in relationship to the universe is directly determined by only one thing is the amount of randomity you care to confront in the universe or the amount of attack you think youre subjected to or care to subject the universe to that determines your thetan size thats how big you are as thetan its how much you feel you can take on or how much you feel may take you on now lets look at the mathematics of civilization we have 100000 people in this particular civilized stratalets take some ancient civilization of great size100000 people in this civilization and at first we say to these 100000these 99999 people other than selfwe say to these fellows well i am as good as any of you and can take any one of you on and maybe even take on two or three of you or six or eight or twelve or fourteen who knows in fact im liable to take on anybody who messes up and they think this way equally see and theyre liable to take it out on you too you see butso on and then one day somebody breaks his neck or breaks his brain or somethingsome other vital partand he cant fight so he invents justice he getsand then he gets some othersome other fellows that are pretty weak and they band together and they invent this thing called justice and that isjustice consists only of this that when the one individualwhen the one individual errs all other individuals in the society are banded together against him and in the final analysis that is justice you go out here and you lay your hand on mans shoulder thats an assault so you have every member of the entire british isles collectively called the government issuing summons for your arrest that makes you versus the government right female voice right now look you were willing to take on one or two or three or four or five or six or when you were feeling good one morning maybe ten or twelve but now youre opposed with the idea of some tens of millions i love this gimmick the people versus john jones where the hell are these people well theyre collective nonsense that was dreamed up by bunch of birds who couldnt fight thats about the only thing you can say about it now we expect in group of men you will get leading order of hens im sorry to mix the metaphor butwe expect this we expect this you turn bunch of knights loose in tourney and theyre all going to wind up with champion and bird who disgraced himself and between the rest of them the rest are going to be stretched out on gradient scale of who can lick who but they very very seldom form council to go against all the knights of the realm this way until they get into an order of knighthood or something like that and they only get into orders of knighthood when lot of them have been licked and then you get orders of knighthood up to that time nobody bothers see do you see how this works but think over this proposition called civilization its rigged so that the individual if he commits fault finds himself pitted against every other being in that whole realm and that he conceivesi dont know really why he conceives this by the waybut he conceives this toomanyness so he is overwhelmed and he is good and he obeys the law of the realmnot because he thinks its good law not because he observes that it is right or not because hes decided upon it but he just obeys the law of the realm i used to always be able to put this into effect you race out down the highways and youre trying to bring law and order to an area you hang bunch of guys to the nearest trees see you just catch some birds that arebeen cutting purses or burning farms or something like that orit doesnt matter much where you get the bodies but hang them up on some scaffolds and trees very visibly you see and law and order spreads in all direction thats because you and maybe four or five men at arms are more than any robber band and you are law and order you get the idea and its just simply the matterits this equation you rob somebodywithout any reason we will hang you as soon as we can catch you you see thatsits simple simple equation simple arithmetic so they stop robbing people see people who would rob people tend not to rob people because they figure that guy and so forth will overwhump us you get the idea now when you get old and you get creaky and the climate of france and england has at last entered your bones to the point of arthritis you of course subscribe to justice and you invent this thing instead of you there with strong right arm you see you say well look the people will get after you see considerable police force but its the people who will get after you and youre being hung by the people i never really bought that sort of justice myany justice that i ever brought to an area was exactly this other type of justice as crude as that may be all right you robbed the coach were hanging you and guy would say well my laws and my rights and the magna charta and so forth and hed go right on talking right up to the time when you pulled the rope check but id always let them know that it hasnt anything to do this is peculiarity of mine we have peace in this area and were going to have peace in this area and were going to have lots of peace in the area not because you want it and not because the people want it but just because i say so and in that way may have escaped lot of motivators and overts because it was honest id always hated this other idea i knew there was something wrong with this other idea i couldnt quite figure out what was wrong with the other idea but isnt it masterly gimmick look it over as mechanism you do wrong and instantly you are going to have as your enemy several tens of millions of people isnt that muchness huh well all goodness is brought about by force whether individually delivered or delivered collectively and goodness is never brought about by philosophic persuasion three guys observe that they get lot of planting and hunting done as long as they dont knock each others heads off they observe that one day they knock each others around and they dont get so much hunting done the next day and they say thats stupid idea lets have some peace and declare war on somebody else well all right thats an incipient and quite proper civilization because its based upon the fact that they have observed they have decided and that is the way they act ah but you see law and order and justice actually are the best things and theyre the best principles and you should be very lawful person andor your father and i will hate you and wenow you see that policeman down the street well hell arrest you and there are thousands of them andi wouldnt say any duress had ever been brought against you to be good i mean one of the oddities of it is that man is basically good this is the oddity but that he gets synthetic bad valence he gets synthetic valence he gets mockedup baddy see and then he can get into this valence of being bad and after that youve had bad men its quite amazing if you dont believe this process somebody someday on the basis of bad valences youll find out these are the wildest synthetic valences you ever saw in your life they describe to him they are borrowed from him theyre his concept you realize every 3d criss cross item is either some life that you yourself lived or its oppterm is merely your ideas of somebody else there isnt somebody else in the whole bank do you see theres never somebody else its only you and your ideas of oppterms of any kind whatsoever now what does this all add up to well it adds up to the fact that if man is basically good the only thing wrong with him is his imprisonment in evil but the evil is false this is quite interesting if the evil is false what would happen if you set him free he becomes good ah then what witchcraft has been worked here we tell fellow he is evil and we convince him one way or the other that he shouldnt attack because other things are good and he is evil male voice hm and we just have another civilization mechanism and one of the ways of phrasing it is that everything done by you will be revisited upon you thats karma male voice hmhm youll pay for everything you have ever done thats karma and lot of people get the overtmotivator sequence mixed up with karma they are not the same thing the overtmotivator sequence means that you have to lay yourself open to feeling bad about something to motivator with an overt thats true too but do you know how its true it says theres an area you mustnt attack and that becomes the keynote and the whole swan song of people there are things you mustnt attack the only reason that wall is stably there for you and can trap you is because somewhere down deep you consider it sacred did you know you considered the wall sacred but you do you have certain sacred valences they mustnt be attacked youve convinced everybody they mustnt be attacked the priestess she walks up the temple steps and turns around to the multitude and she says peace and they serve her up for stew shes religious figure she shouldnt be attacked the toughest valences you are holding onto in 3d criss cross are the same woof and warp of this civilized structure they are merely mechanisms to prevent you from being attacked and thats why you have withholds the reason you withhold something is to prevent yourself from being attacked youve all done something at some time or another anyone has done something at some time or another in civilization where this civilization mechanism goes into effect you would be attacked if it were known see youd be attacked if it were known you know that i can think of dozens of police forces not only in this galaxy that would love to have my name and address right now as matter of fact they have it well come to think about it the shoe is slightly on the other foot but weve got matter here of theof the sacredness of beingness you got the idea good nonattackable beingness hoohoo thats the thing you see only trouble is we fall for the other unattackable beingnesses around us people are horrified when they hear giving the christian church whatnot every once in while we get fantastic comments on this subject ii dont see it myself although ive had ample obive had ample reason to believe that people get upset about this see i believe people get upset about this i dont believe you shouldnt attack it i think all mechanisms of slavery should be attacked now the basic mechanism by which people are persuaded not to attack is to show them that attacking will hurt them and that is the whole lesson they try to teach in war you go over parapet and across an open field up against machine guns and if youre damn fool enough to have meat body with you youre liable to get some holes in it you know the air is liable to start going through where the bullets went you see that thats bum thing youre doing you know youll get punished for attacking but you kick stone and youll get punished for attacking but why does stone hurt you well you must consider that it shouldnt be attacked you must consider that the mest universe should not be attacked well lookahere its here nobodys asised it so obviously its under the curse of attack see you mustnt attack it attacks you though doesnt it i think thats fascinating every once in while cliff falls on your head something like that but you mustnt attack it sounds to like wonderful mechanism for keeping universe going but now we move into the overtmotivator sequence having observed that if you attack into the teeth of spitting machine guns you get your guts full of leadhaving observed thisit is very easy you see that any evil act you do to others will be visited on you see after guys had the first lessonyou know he kicks the stone the stone hurts him hes charged the machine gun and the machine gun has shot himthenthat he will harm himself for knocking somebodys block off and the next thing you know there he is with withered arm didnt even hurt him actually this bird was totally defenseless goof and he walked along and he went pow you know and the other guys head fell right straight off you know the next thing you know the guys got withered arm you want to cure it as an auditor you run out the knocking off the other fellows head well ill be of gun his arm all of sudden works because youve created miracle theres further miracle that you could create how come it got withered just by knocking off somebodys head now it didnt even hurt his hand where did that mechanism come from and thats the overtmotivator sequence where did it come from it comes from this one mechanism of you attack things you will be hurt and if you can teach enough people that you have civilization but they will all be enslaved they will all be trapped and none of them will be able to clearly observe to clearly decide or to decisively act and they will all sooner or later go crazy now when i have said these few choice words ive described everything there is really wrong with the human mind there isnt anything else theres other outstanding phenomena in the final analysis once you know the basic phenomena of scientologythat is the asising and energy and pictures and what the universes composed of and the axioms and things of this particular characteryou get down to that as far as processing is concerned the only thing that youve got in your thetan bank at the particular moment that is giving you an awful lot of trouble is something you know you had better not attack the consequences of attack overweigh you so heavily that you will not attack it otherwise it will disappear if you attack it it will disappear thats one penalty but is the only penalty there are other penalties all other penalties are totally imaginary and at this stage of development of scientology can be considered so wholly and completely im not now giving you processes to run on this im trying to get you to understand this philosophicallyunderstand it on the head end that there is liability for attacking anything but there is tremendous liability for not attacking theres tremendous liability that sounds like were going to make lot of vicious people well if they all become vicious before they come good again on the other end ill just have to live through it and so will you because thats the way it is but there is obsessive attackpeople could longer control their ability to attacktheres all kinds of species of wildness and gyratingness and upsettedness and so forth theyre all misemotional and none of it under control overt attack never got anybody in trouble neverreally never did the only thing that you ever lose when you do that is some havingness or something like that thats about the only thing but if its havingness you dont want whats the difference well that doesnt erase the fact that the overtmotivator sequence you understandthat doesnt erase the fact that it works you can take it apart you can get withholds you can do all these things which you know how to do i have just been busily trying to get to the root of the structure and find out exactly how it stood and so forth to find out if it could be swept away when we reach into class iv with 3d criss cross items and i find out that it can be swept away and the residuals and so forth of the bank have as their common denominator things that must not be attacked reasons why one shouldnt attack reasons why one shouldnt be attacked reasons why one shouldnt attack others ways and means of restraining oneself from attacking others et cetera et cetera et cetera ad nauseam you understand and out of this you get all kinds of minor things like criticism and you get all this kind of thing and you also get overtmotivator sequence but its just one phenomena amongst many okay audience voices yeah yup thank you very much for staying over good night male voice thank you thank you
