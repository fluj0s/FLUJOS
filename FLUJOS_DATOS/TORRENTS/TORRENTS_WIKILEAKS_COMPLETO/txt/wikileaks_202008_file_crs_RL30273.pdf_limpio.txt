exports are controlled under the arms export control act aeca and the export administration act eaa the latter statute to expire august 20 2001 the more stringent aeca controls administered by the state department apply to encryption items classified as defense articles or services items not so classified are subject to regulation by the department of commerce doc under the extended eaa authorities doc requires licenses for certain commodities and software but allows other encryption items to be exported under license exceptions the us government has traditionally maintained that controls over strong encryption are necessary for national security foreign policy and law enforcement reasons industry has argued that federal regulatory policies insufficiently address rapid technological developments prevent manufacturers from marketing product s available abroad and harm us national interests by making strong us encryption unobtainable by legitimate users worldwide while most encryption was originally controlled under the aeca in late 1996 the president transferred jurisdiction over nonmilitary items to doc which at the same time eased controls over commercial encryption that used key recovery feature or was destined for financial institutions in 1998 the administration further relaxed controls over 56bit technology generally and stronger encryption destined for us subsidiaries insurance companies and other endusers retreating from earlier key recovery requirements further modifications were announced in september 1999 allowing license exceptions for the export of encryptio n of any key length after technical review to most endusers in all but terrorist countries draft regulations were issued in late 1999 following criticism by companies privacy groups and internet proponents doc expanded aspect s of its original proposal and issued new regulations in january 2000 regulations issued in october 2000 further streamlined controls over encryption exports to 23 countries including european mem ber states restrictive export licensing regulations have raised constitution concerns some arguing that they impose prior restraint on speech in violation of the first amendment federal courts have both upheld and dismissed first amendment challenges to export controls the outcome generally turning on whether the court viewed the encryption item and its export as essentially expressive or functional courts in california and ohio have allowed challenges to proceed holding that encryption source code is protected speech for first amendment

send and receive private messages1 it may also be used for authentication confirming the identity of the sender and data integrity ensuring that message has not been changed in transit contemporary encryption is generally based on an algorithm paired with key usually string of 40 to 128 bits which together protect messages from computerbased descrambling by outsiders keys may be secret or public under the former both the sender and the recipient share an identical key public key system involves related pair of keys one of which is published in public directory and the other remaining with the sender or recipient public key systems are useful for encrypting messages in large and open computer networks such as the internet where individual users may not have previous knowledge of one another key escrow or recovery systems make it possible for parties other than those who are party to an encrypted conversation or who encrypt data for storage to have access to the secure material this capability is viewed favorably by law enforcement since key access enables authorities to decrypt socalled real time messages without the knowledge or consent of parties to communication or to decrypt stored data for investigatory purposes key escrow or recovery systems may also be of general commercial benefit in the event key is lost stolen or destroyed the development and use of strong computerized encryption in the united states was originally limited to the federal government for military and intelligencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs2 2the discussion of the development of the

encryption algorithm that could be used as federal standard for storing and transmitting unclassified data known as data encryption standard des ibm reportedly responded with 56bit key and other modifications after discussions with the national security agency nsa the federal entity responsible for communications intelligence which had earlier taken considerable intere st in its project as stated in senate report nsa certified that the revised ibm cipher was to the best of their knowledge free of any statistical or mathematical weaknesses3 and recommended it for use as the new des critics suggested possible vulnerabilities in the shortened key and pointed out the inherent and continuing dilemma in the confrontation of governmental and business interests in the area one author states that since the des would eventually be manufactured commercially and installed on wide assortment of equipment sold abroad the nsa would not want to cut its own throat by permitting the foreign

impracticable to develop separate produ cts for the domestic and foreign market that export restrictions will hinder its longterm competitiveness given the increasing availability of strong foreign cryptogr aphy and the projected increase in demand for such products due to the increasing popularity of electronic commerce and that us interests are harmed by making increasingly strong us encryption unavailable to legitimate users worldwide7 at the same time the federal government argues that because of its national security and law enforcem ent responsibilities it should not

current export controls over encryption encryption had traditionally been treated as munition subject to cold war export restrictions imposed by the coordinating committee for multilateral export

opinion stated in summary that insofar as the proposed licensing requirement could be applied to persons who have connection with any foreign enterprise who disseminate technical data in circumstances in which there is more than belief or reasonable basis for believing that the data might be taken abroad by foreign nationals and used there in the manufacture of arms the licensing requirement is presumptively unconstitutional as prior restraint on speech protected by the first amendment 5 op off legal counsel 202 1985 32earlier federal appeals court had held that the application of mutual

courtcourt challenges have generally involved restrictions on the export of software containing encryption source code that is computer programming language describing an encryption program or an algorithm this original programming language must be combined or translated into object code which enables computer to read the encryptio n program33 distinctions are generally raised between the expressive and functional nature of the software at issue and between the act of exporting software containing encryption source code and the use of source code to communicate in his 1996 executive order the president expressly stated that the export of encryption software like the export of other encryption described in the order must be controlled because of such softwares functional capacity rather than because of any possible information value of such software34 at the same time it is argued that regardless of the functional capability of software the source code it contains is language by which cryptographers convey mathematical ideas to each other and as such merits the strongest first amendment protection bernstein cases in bernstein v dept of state californ ia federal district court ruling on government motion to dismiss held that source code constituted speech protected by the first amendment35 the court later ruled that aeca licensing requirements were an unconstitutional

reconsideration in light of docs new encryption regulations40 plaintiff since requested an advisory opinion from doc and in february 2000 the department reportedly notified him in writing that under the new regulations he may post source code for his encryption software on his internet web site41 the ninth circuit threejudge panel had reviewed the district court bernstein ruling novo and held that the twoprong test for facial challenges set forth by the supreme court in lakewood v plain dealer publishing co 486 us 750 1988 was met as explained by the court licensing scheme is always subject to facial challenge if as described in lakewood it gives governmen t official or agency substantial power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or disliked speakers and has close enough nexus to expression or to conduct commonly associated with expression to pose real and substantial threat of censorship risks 42 the court held that the first requirement was satisfied because the constraint on official discretion contained in the standard used by the commerce department to deny export licenses under the export regulations ear namely inconsistency with us national security and foreign policy interests43 was in the courts view little better than constraint at all44 the court discounted government arguments that the scheme was contentneutral finding that finding that the agencys boundless discretion as it was later described by the court made docs assurances that it would not discriminate on the basis of content irrelevant 45 the second requirement for facial challenges was fulfilled because in the courts view the regulations evidenced close enough nexus to expression the court determined at the outset that encryption software in its source code form and as employed by those in the field of cryptography must be viewed as expressive for first amendment purposes and thus is entitled to the protections of the prior restraint doctrine46 the court dismissed the governments argument that even admitting the expressive nature of source code its functional aspect that is by being compiled into object code it can be used to control the operations of computer withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs12 47id at 1142 48id 49id at 1144 50id at 114546 51id at 114647 the court stated that it had neither the power nor the capacity to engage in line by line revisions of the challenged regulations or to redefine terms within the regulations to do so would be to improperly invade the province reserved to the executive id at 1147 citations omitted 52id in his separate opinion the concurring judge stated that he recognized the validity of the dissents view regarding the funct ional purpose of source code and the first amendment continuedconveying information to the user obviated first amendment problems in this case47 it also dismissed the governments argument that because the regulations were laws of general application and did not narrowly and specifically target speech prior restraint analysis did not apply again relying on lakewood the court held that the commerce department regulations explicitly apply to expression and place scientific expression under the censors eye on regular basis distinguishing them for example from building permit requirement which would give officials only intermittent and unpredictable opportunities to regulate speech48 the court then held the regulations to be an impermissible prior restraint finding none of the elements needed to uphold the validity of licensing schemes as set forth by the supreme court in freedman v maryland 380 us 541 1965 to be present in this case as summarized by the court licensing scheme that imposed prior restraint on speech would survive under freedman if 1 any restraint on speech were for specified period of time 2 there was expeditious judicial review and 3 the censor bore the burden of going to court to suppress the speech and bore the burden of proof in any such judicial proceeding49 the court found that the requisite procedural safeguards were lacking because neither the executive branch process for resolving interagency disputes over export license applications nor the internal appeals process for license denials contained firm deadlines and further the licensing process did not afford judicial review to those whose export license applications were denied50 with respect to the scope of declaratory relief the government argued that the lower courts order was invalid since it applied not only to encryption source code but also to encryption object code commodities and technology agreeing with the government that the ear could be conceptua lly severed into component parts covering commodities software and technology the court nonetheless decided that the inte grated structureof the regulations did not permit it to sever the judicially uncontested portions of the regulations and let the lower court relief stand51 the dissenting judge in bernstein concluded that since the ear was law of general application directed at conduct the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for facial first amendment challenge the dissent emphasized that the majority and the district court had paid insufficient attention to the functional aspects of encryption52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs13 52continued implications of this approach and noted that the importance of this case suggests that it may be appropriate for review by the united states

was inherently functional device and that for purposes of first amendment analysis it was nearer to conduct than to speech53 referring to the ninth circuits 1996 decision in roulette v city of seattle 97 f3d 300 which had quoted lakewood the dissent stated that such an approach ignores the basic tenet that facial challenges are inappropriate unless at minimum the challenged statute is in lakewoods words directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression54 the dissent found that the conduct at issue here was the export of encryption source code noting that the overwhelming majority of individuals do not use source code as means of expression but rather as means of protecting their computer communications55 in such case export of encryption source code simply does not fall withing the bounds of conduct commonly associated with expression such as picketing or handbilling56 the dissent further maintained that the ear regulate encryption technology generally whether in the form of hardware or software and as such were directed at preventing the functio nal capability of encryption to be exported without license57 in the dissents view the fact that the regulations were not directed at expression was supported by the fact that the regulations did not prevent the print publication of scholarly articles containing source code58 while the dissenting judge found that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for facial challenge he acknowledged that first amendment claim with regard to the regulations as applied may nonetheless succeed in this case59 karn v dept of state first amendment issues also arose in karn v dept of state case brought in the us district court for the district of columbia in which plaintiff challenged the state departments disapproval of the export of diskette containing source code for encryption algorithms while allowing the export of book containing the same60 along with his first amendment claim the plaintiff sought judicial review of the state departments initial designation of the diskette as defense article for purposes of the aeca and also challenged the regulation on fifth amendment due process grounds while the court rejected the plaintiffs request for judicial review of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs14 61the court rejected plaintiffs initial request for judicial review on the ground that the 38h of the aeca 22 usc 2778h expressly precluded such review and that administrative procedure act apa judicial review provisions allowing challenges to agency actions on the ground that they are arbitrary and capricious could not be invoked as substitute 925 fsupp at 48 13 62the court found that by arguing that his fifth amendment substantive due process rights were violat ed by the departments action the plaintiff was in fact attempting to revive his earlierrejected apa claim through another vehicle an action that the court found would render the judicial review preclusion in 2778h absolutely meaningless 925 fsupp at 13 the court held that aeca regulation bore reasonable relationship to the governments stated purpose as required by the fifth amendment substantive due process standard applicable in cases where as here there was assertion that fundamental right was being infringed id 63the court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to claim that aeca regulations governing the export of technical data were an unconst itutional system of vague prior restraints given that the state department did not apply these regulations to him and there was thus causal connection between these provisions and the plaintiffs injury 925 fsupp at 1213 in this regard the court noted that while courts have departed from traditional rules of standing with respect to certain first amendment claims claims of facial overbreadth and vagueness are rarely entertained with respect to contentneutral regulations id at 13 the court also found that the department had in fact limited the application of its technical data regulations in response to united states v edler industries 1978 ninth circuit decision in which the court found the regulatory definition of technical data to be susceptible of overbreadth but interpreted the statute narrowly to avoid finding of unconstitutionality id regarding united states v edler see supra note 28 64id at 10 65id at 11 quoting obrien v united states 391 us 367 377 1988agencys classification decisions61 it allowed him to pursue his constitutional claims though it ultimately dismissed these as well62 with regard to first amendment arguments the court held that the diskette was contentne utral and met the first amendment test applicable to governmental regulation of such items set forth by the supreme court in united states v obrien the court also rejected plaintiffs prior restraint argument against the departments technical data regulations63 in the courts view the contentneutrality of the aeca regulations was clearly eviden ced by the fact that the government was not regulating the exports of the diskette because of the expressive content of the comments interspersed through the source code and or source code but instead are regulating because of the belief that the combination of encryption source code on machine readable media will make it easier for foreign intellig ence sources to encode their communications64 as summarized by the court challenged regulation will be upheld under obrien if it is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important or substantial government interest and the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest65 while the plaintiff did not expressly or impliedly dispute that the first two obrien conditions were satisfied he argued that the third element was lackinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs15 66925 fsupp at 11 quoting plaints opp 1516 67925

the cryptographic algorithms contained on the karn diskette are already widely available in other countries through the internet and other sources or are so weak that they can be broken by the national security agency66 the court held that the regulation was in fact narrowly tailored to meet its goal noting that this argument also implicated the second obrien requirement the court held that plaintiffs disagreement with the government essentially involved foreign policy dispute and thus not one into which this court can or will delve67 in the courts view classifying encryption items as defense articles reflected the presidents foreign policy judgment that proliferation of encryption products was harmful to the united states judgment that existed despite any argued availability or capability of the regulated items68 the court also rejected the plaintiffs request for judicial balancing of first amendment harms against national security interests and found that the plaintiff had not presented any arguments that the regul ation was substantially broader than was necessary to prevent proliferation of encryption products69 following issuance of the opinion and the 1996 jurisdictional shift the plaintiff sought and was denied an export license by the department of commerce he subsequently pursued his case in the district court which recently ordered an evidentiary hearing on his constitutional claims the hearing is limited to the question whether for the purposes of producing an operating encryption system material differences existed between the plaintiffs diskette and the corresponding source codes appearing in printed form70 junger v daley result that conflicted with the bernstein cases but comported with karn was reached in the 1998 decision of the us district court for the northern district of ohio in junger v daley which rejected first amendment challenge to doc regulations71 in april 2000 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed holding that computer source code was protected by the first amendment and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the plaintiff s constitutional challenge72 plaintiff junger was law professor who wanted to post encryption programs on his inter net site an action the doc treated as export the department had informed him that he would need export licenses for software programs but that chapter in one of his textbooks containing encryption code could be exported withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs16 73because plaintiffs claims of infringement of academic freedom and freedom of association were not pursued in briefs the court considered them waived 8 fsupp 2d at 723 the plaintiff also argued that the international emergency economic powers act ieepa under which the president had extended expired export control authorities in 1994 did not authorize the regulation of encryption exports because encryption was informational material category of goods that was statutorily excluded from regulation from ieepa the court held that this action was unreviewable because the ieepa committed any regulation of exports under it to the presidents discretion moreover the court noted the presidents decision to use ieepa to regulate trade was consistently held unreviewable by courts id at 723 74quoting the lakewood standard used by bernstein majority and referring to the roulette refinement cited by the bernstein dissent the court stated that for facial challenge to be allowed the disputed measure must not merely affect expressive conduct but must be directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonl associated with expression id at 718 the court found these requirements to be lacking since the exportation of the software was not integral to expression and that the expressive elements of software exportation were not directly or narrowly targeted all types of encryption devices were regulated and moreover academic discussion and descriptions of software in print media were allowed id at 718719 75 the court held that the obrien test was met because 1 an important government interest existed in controlling the export of encryption for national security purposes 2 the regulations were not designed to limit the free exchange of ideas but were imposed because of the encryptions functionality and 3 the regulations were targeted at precisely the activity that threatens the government legitimate interests 76 209 f3d at 485 77 id quoting turner broadcasting system v fcc 512 us 622 644 1994a license the plaintiff did not apply for export licenses for these items but instead brought first amendment challenge to the regulations claiming prior restraint on speech vagueness and overbreadth unconstitutional content discrimination and infringemen t of rights to freedom of association and discussion73 the court found that source code was inherently functional and thus its export was not sufficiently communicative to constitute protected conduct under the first amendment rejected plaintiffs facial challenges to the doc regulations on grounds of prior restraint vagueness and overbreadth74 and sustained the regulations under the intermediate first amendment scrutiny applicable to governmental restrictions deemed content neutral set forth in obrien75 on appeal the sixth circuit concluded that computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of informa tion and ideas about computer programming held that source code thus merited first amendment protection and allowed the plaintiff to procee d with his facial challenge of the doc regulations76 the court held out the possibility that intermediate first amendment scrutiny might apply stating that the functional capabilities of source code should be considered when analyzing the governments interest in regulating this form of speech but also noted that in such case the government must demonstrate that the recited harms are real not mere ly conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way77 while the court acknowledged that the governments national security interests might outweigh those of protected speech and require its regulation it stated that the record to date had not resolved the issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30273crs17 78209 f3d at 485 79hr 695 was reported without
