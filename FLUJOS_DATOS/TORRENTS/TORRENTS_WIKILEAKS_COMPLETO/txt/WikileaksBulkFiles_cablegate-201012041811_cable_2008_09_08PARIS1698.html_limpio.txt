08 d hotr washington dcusdao paris subj iir 6 832 0626 08 1 c summary frances new africa policy may have its most immediate impact on frances military presence in africa the french are planning to consolidate their military presence and want to orient it towards cooperation with africas subregional groupings eg ecowas sadc et and away from bilateral efforts they foresee their military presence coalescing into two hubs one on the atlantic ocean senegal or gabon and one on the indian ocean djibouti or french overseas department reunion island even these bases may eventually disappear if africans prove capable of maintaining peace and security another priority will be the renegotiation of frances defense agreements with eight african countries which now feature outdated provisions from the colonial era the french announced in june 2008 the set of priorities that will henceforth frame french economic assistance to africa the foreign ministry is creating fourth sousdirection akin to department office that will more closely match africas subregional groups and may also reconfigure french embassies in africa on large medium and small basis to align priorities with budget constraints end summary 2 c part i of this series ref described the franceafrique model that governed frances relations with subsaharan africa for most of the 20th century even before taking office in may 2007 president nicolas sarkozy believed that relations needed revision in response to globalization changing circumstances and the waning of the colonial and immediate postcolonial periods he sought more modern and transparent relationship ostensibly of equals that would allow both sides to conduct relations on businesslike and rational basis part ii ref b discussed frances first steps and missteps in implementing this policy and african reactions to it this message part iii focuses on frances military presence in africa and organizational changes likely to occur in conjunction with frances new policy post welcomes comments from colleagues at us missions in africa xxxxxxxxxxxx conclusion 36 c in saying that he would reform frances africa policy sarkozy has taken on task of formidable proportions which is less than to break once and for all from the colonial and postcolonial world and its mindset and to bring relations into todays era to do so he must overcome inertia and certain level of comfort on both sides that have accumulated over many years yet as in other areas of french policy he seems determined to move forward and has taken his first steps in our view this is positive development for franceafrique was becoming an increasingly creaky costly and potentially dangerous vehicle for dealing with continent rife with challenges less amenable to heeding its former colonial masters and inescapably engaged in global issues of all kinds from terrorism to the environment to drug trafficking to energy resource management and well beyond 37 c but will franceafrique and old habits ever completely fade one mod contact not known for sentimentality believes that certain parts of franceafrique will endure if for other reason than the common use of the french language and long intertwined histories prefacing his remarks by noting their lack of political correctness and their triteness he says that the relationship was for long time similar to parentchild relationship now the child is an adult capable of and deserving of more autonomy yet still welcoming our help and guidance what sarkozy is doing is kicking the fledgling out of the nest which is sort of the way he approaches lot of problems heavy dose of what you might call tough love not always dispensed lovingly eventually the nowgrown adult child will be replaced by something resembling cousin or nephew we will grow farther apart and less apt to look to each other reflexively but some familial bond will remain however much we may seek to deny it and familial bonds are always to be nurtured our job is to make sure that this inevitable drifting apart takes place positively on both sides does not completely extinguish the bond and most importantly does not turn into an estrangement that would be loss for everyone french africans and americans paris 00001698 009 of 009 please visit paris classified website at httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalfran ce stapleton
