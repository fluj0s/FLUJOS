personnel 3 personnel at danville 2 personnel at echo 2 personnel at 513th and 12 personnel at ft monmouth with issues to report activities summary of planned activities continue to conduct dib federation testing with other nodes attempt to federate cross domain significant issue the network appears to be very slow imagery products products collected products were collected because today was nofly day however we attempted to fe derate cross domain using dcgsa v31 and were able to pull down simulated data this proves that the high speed guards do work if the data has the correct lables summary success we were able to pull simulated data cross domain on monday we will attempt to pull some actual data additional comments status of dcgsa node connections there are total of 16 external nodes dcgsa v30 status is 6 nodes are green 5 are yellow and 1 red due to crash dcgsa v31 status is 10 nodes are green and 2 are amber dcgsn location dcgsn development integration lab spawar system center charleston sc pocs tk quigley personnel 4 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities continue to searchdiscoverretrieve data fr om other ddte nodes via their portals and query tools continue integration with the gsil nga team to return result from their nces federated search query validate node readiness for outbound nces query to be federated to the gsil aggregator and then routed to the dcgsa ddp on 31 july and 1 august once inbound queries results from the dcg sn dib are successfully returned to the gsil aggregator we intend to populate the ipl with nitf carrying populated imageremarks field which we will then keyword search from the gsil aggregator this will prove both dib and ipl nces 13 interoperability for content discovery and retrieval via our nces endpoint validate dod pki user authent ication to the dcgsn enterpri search with user soft certificates by 30 july complete and submit slick sheet for ec08 dvvip folders significant issues we continue to work through soap message formatting and header issues which we believe are causing the dcgsn endpoint to fa il when returning results from the query we observe the query federation to the data providers ipl dib and we see valid result sets returned from the dib search web service adapter these results are not properly returned to the gsil however due to an unknown error during the ifis results marshalling process unencrypted packet traces were taken today with two different message strings these traces will be analyzed to troubleshoot the issue the navy node has been unable to connect to the gsil tactical validation authority tva for crl validation and is awaiting response as to the availability of the ldaps service interface on the jeds slice also hosted by the gsil both these services are necessary to pki enable the navys web services imagery products products collected sample dib mdc entries from the fsp ipl nitf and sar imagery summary successes able to access portals of eight ddte nodes and see four others successfully searcheddiscovered metadata from five nodes and retrieved product from two data collection of the unencrypted traces as we ll as tests with additional required wssecurity fields were conducted for analysis inbound nces queries are being properly ac cepted and routed to the appropriate data providers who are properly returning result sets the dcgsn map server was restored to functi onality making the enterprise search portal application fully functional fedexed 200 copies of dcgsn slick sheet to nawc china lake lessons learned saml attribute statements must accompany inbound nces queries to the navy endpoint even though processing is performed the parsing engine of our search web services requires these headers timestamps are assigned by the 13 proxy in the local time zone where help is needed navy developers are working to troubleshoot and debug the existing issues required resources are allocated to this task and

activities despite today being nofly day the sbjitc finished up their data collection fame received new transcoder today that will facilitate their video broadcast to fielded prc117s imagery products products collected misbjitc team finished collection efforts for the live fly portion of ec08 around 3500 files total summary successes misbjitc who had collected 100 of their requ irements as of yesterday spent today with further collection efforts to support previously unplanned study into crossexploitation system interoperability fame is now in position to demonstrate th eir own previously unplanned demonstration of pushing video streams to fielded sources via the prc117 in another example of cooperation within the pilot the vpc group will attempt to push their cached warrior streams considered predator surrogate through to the ddte network where smart video can use it to demonstrate their capabilities on fresh video
