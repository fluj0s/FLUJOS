specialist in public finance government and finance division summary on september 22 2004 the office of fede ral housing enterprise supervision ofheo made public report that char ged fannie mae the governmentsponsored enterprise that plays leading role in the secondary mortgage market with not following generally accepted accounting practices in veral critical areas which allowed fannie mae to conceal losses reduce volatility in re ported earnings present investors with an artificial picture of steadily growing profits and meet financial performance targets that triggered the payment of large bonuses to company executives fannie maes initial response was to argue that ofheos char ges involved not impr oprieties but merely differing interpretations of highly co mplex accounting standards however on december 15 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec after finding inadequacies in fannies accounting policies and methodologies supported ofheo and directed fannie mae to restat its accounting results since 2001 shortly thereafter the companys ceo and cfo resigned in may 2006 fannie mae reached settlement with ofheo and the sec agreeing to pay 400 million in civil penalties undertake number of remedial steps related to inte rnal controls and oversight of accounting systems not increase the size of its mortga ge portfolio without ofheos approval and be enjoined from future violations of s ecurities laws in december 2006 fannie issued the restatement which reduced repor ted earnings for 20012004 by 63 billion this report will be updated as events warrant background fannie mae and freddie mac the two governmentsponsored enterprises gses that dominate the secondary mortgage market are huge and complex financial institutions that play key role in the financial system most home mortgage loans made each year are purchased by one or the other of the gses and either held in portfolio or repackaged and sold as mortgagebacked s ecurities mbs large quantities of gse bonds are held by insured banks pension funds and investors of all types although gse debt is not guaranteed by the government the governme nt sponsored status of fannie and freddie leads market participants to put faith in an implicit guarantee belief that the treasury will never allow either gse to default on its obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949crs2 1 see crs report rs21567 accounting and management pr oblems at freddie mac by mark jickling 2 report of the special ex amination of fannie mae may 2006 340 p available on the ofheo and fannie mae websitesthe savings and loan crisis of the 1980s was painful demonstration of the risks inherent in mortgage markets over thousand sls failed because their longterm revenues from mortgage loans fell below their cost of funds the interest they paid to savers when interest rate s are volatile holders of mort gages and mbs face variety of financial risks and these risks are now c oncentrated in the two gses although both institutions manage risk with sophisticated financial techniques far beyond the capacity of any sl the accounting problems at fannie mae and at freddie mac in 20031 raise serious questions the accounting irregularities to date have been portrayed as byproduct of managements wish to persuade investors that despite the volatile nature of the mortgage market the firms earnings are steady predictable and insulated from sudden changes other things equal high er volatility in earnings will drive investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate fo r the risk of holding gse debt which would lower the profitability of the mortgage portf olios both gses hold there has been indication that accounting has been manipul ated to conceal fundamental financial problems in the two firms as was the case at failing firms like enron and worldcom however given the size of the gses and th eir importance to the financial system there is clearly public interest in improving accounting transparency and rigor why fannie maes financial st atements were manipulated in may 2006 ofheo published its final repor t on its special examination of fannie mae2 major finding is that improper accounting practices were largely driven by managements desire to achie ve profit targets expressed as earnings per share or eps that would trigger maximum bonuses fanni mae had three compensation plans linked to eps figures two affected only small gr oup of top executives but another called the annual incentive plan d over 800 beneficiaries achieving the targeted eps numbers became an overriding goal at fannie mae accounting personnel received explicit instruc tions as well as c onstant exhortations regarding the importance of the figures the ofheo report presents numerous internal communications that discuss wh ich particular mani pulation would be best suited to hit the target in particular quarter or year it was also important not to exceed the target because bonuses were capped if earnings app eared likely to exceed the target figure ways were found to defer recognition of current earnings to future periods in summary fannie maes accounting syst ems and policies were designed to produce the results that management wante d and not to provide investors with an accurate picture of the firms financial condition the image management tried to project of firm whose financial results were predictable and stable was false in 2002 and 2003 when interest rates dropped to ve ry low levels fannie mae incurred large losses due to an increased rate of mortgage prepayments the ma gnitude of those losses although not large enough to threaten the safety and soundness of fannie mae provides evidence that the enterprises interest rate risk exposure during the period was significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949crs3 3 ibid p 48 4 office of federal housing enterprise oversight office of compliance report of findings to date special exami nation of fannie mae

inconsistent with the image of fannie mae as very lowrisk institution promoted by senior management3 the accounting issues the 2004 ofheo report4 identified and the rudman5 and may 2006 ofheo reports confirmed number of major accounting problems at fannie mae several dealt with the failure to comply with specific accounting rules and more general critique focused on weaknesses in the firms accountin g processes corporate culture the tone at the top and failure of the board of gove rnors to provide effec tive oversight these issues are summarized below derivatives accounting sfas 133 derivatives including futures contracts options forwards swaps and cap s are financial inst ruments whose value is linked to changes in some economic variable most often interest rates fannie mae uses derivatives extensively to manage interest rate risk derivatives accounting is governed by sfas 1336 under sfas 133 the fair value of all financial derivatives must be calculated markedtomark et at the end of each accounting period changes in fair value from the previous accounting period must be reported as current income unless the derivatives are used for hedging if deri vative is used to hedge an asset as in the example above the value of that asset the hedged item will move in the opposite direction to the derivatives value thus fall in the price of the hedged asset will be offset by gain in the derivative or vice ve rsa under sfas 133 the firm can recognize as earnings both the change in the derivatives value and the offsetting change in the hedged items if the gains and losses are closely correlated the net effect on reported earnings will be very small or zero ofheos 2004 report analyzed number of rivatives transactions in detail and found numerous specific practices that do not conform with sfas 133 common theme is the inappropriate use of shortcuts that produce the desire d result of perfectly effective hedges that will have impact on the bottom line ofheo found that fannie maes failures to follow sfas 133 were cons istent with the objectives of minimizing earnings volatility and simplifying operations7 the rudman report concludes that fannie mae deviated from the clear requirement s of sfas 133 in numerous and important respects and concurs with ofheos assessment of fannies motivation amortization of purchase discounts premiums and fees sfas 91 when fannie mae buys mortgages or mbs it does not pay the exact amount of unpaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949crs4 8 ofheo report of findings to date p 13 9 ibid pp 1012premium balance outstanding on the loans if the interest rate or coupon rate paid by the borrower is above current market interest rates the loan w ill sell at premium above the unpaid balance if the coupon rate is below curre nt market rates the loan is less valuable and will sell at discount to calculate th effective yield on the loan fannie mae must take these premiums and discounts into account loan bought at premium is less valuable than the coupon rate would imply and vice versa for loans purchased at discount under sfas 91 financial accountin g standards board fasb rule the amount of these premiums and discounts must be amortized or recognized over the estimated life of the purchased loans or mb s the amounts recognized appear on the income statement as an adjustment to current interest income ofheo found that fannie mae did not follow this standard in consistent manner but chose to apply it as needed to produce th financial results ma nagement wanted in the fall of 1998 as central banks struggled to c ontain global financial pa nic interest rates fell dramatically the drop in rates adversel affected fannie and freddie by accelerating the rate of mortgage prepayments the ffect of the speedup in prepayments on fannie maes earnings was 400 million expense which according to sfas 91 s hould have been recognized and charged against 1998 earni ngs however fannie chose to recognize only 200 million and deferred reco gnition of the other half the deferred 200 million became known with in fannie mae as the catchup ofheo claimed that fannie used inordinate flexibility in its handling of the catchup amount and used it as an accounting reserve or cookie jar that gave it wide discretion to report or defer amortization income in order to obtain the accounting results it wanted fannie adopted polices specifi cally intended to manage th catchup position as buffer to sudden changes in interest rates and the resultant vola tility of amortization accounts8 ofheo put forward two explanations for fannie maes failure to follow sfas 91 first management sought to create the impression that the companys operations were stable predictable and low risk sec ond the report analyzed fannie maes earnings in 1998 and concludes that if the full 400 million had been charged against earnings top executives would not have received bonuses linked to earnings per share target levels9 the rudman report found that the desire to meet the bonus target provides the only plausible explanation fo r the 1998 accounting maneuver classification of securities sfas 115 fannie mae holds large portfolio of debt securities mostly mortgagebacked bonds how these securities are valued affects earnings the value of bonds falls when inte rest rates rise and climbs when rates fall fluctuations in the value of bond portfolios should be reported in current income unless the bonds are to be held to maturity in wh ich case the price changes do not matter since they do not affect the interest and principal payments the holder receives sfas 115 requires firms to classify bond portfolios as either holdtomaturity htm or availableforsale afs bonds in the tter category must be revalued at every accounting period and changes in value reporte d as current income ofheo finds that fannie mae did not properly apply this rule but chose the classification that would produce the financial results it wantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21949crs5 10 ibid p

the way fannie maes accounting results are generated and reviewed individuals involved in the pr ocess were encumbered by heavy workload weak technical skills and weak review environment10 the rudman report is even more critical accountants were unqualified resu lting in haphazard implementation of accounting rules and failed to understand or carry out their roles in making accounting policy accounting system s are described as grossly inadequate11 the rudman report notes at th outset however that the re medial steps taken by fannie mae since 2004 essentially encompass all th recommendations that reports authors would have made12 the supplemental agreement on march 8 2005 fannie mae entered into supplemental agreement to correct further accounting problems identified by ofheo13 among the accounting issues and the relevant fasb standards are valuation of mortgage loans held in portfolio sfas 65 improper classification of securities as either hold to maturity or
