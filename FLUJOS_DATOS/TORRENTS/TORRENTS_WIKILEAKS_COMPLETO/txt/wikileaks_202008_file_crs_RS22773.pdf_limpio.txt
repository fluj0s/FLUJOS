controversy has arisen over the existence of socalled sanctuary cities the term sanctuary city is not define d by federal law but it is of ten used to refer to those localities which as result of state or local act ordinance policy or fiscal constraints limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities seeking to apprehend and remove unauthorized aliens supporters of such policies argue that many cities have higher priorities and that local efforts to deter the presence of unauthorized aliens would undermine community relations disrupt munici pal services interfere with local law enforcement or violate humanitarian principles opponents argue that sanctuary policies encourage illegal immigration nd undermine federal enforcem ent efforts pursuant to 434 of the personal respons ibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora pl 104193 and 642 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira pl 104208 states and localities may not limit their governmental entities or officers from maintaining records regarding persons immigration status or bar the exchange of such information with any federal state or local entity reportedly some jurisdictions with sanctuary polic ies take dont ask dont tell approach where officials ar barred from inquiring about persons immigration status in certain circumstan ces though this method does not directly conflict with federal requirements that states and localities permit the free exchange of information regarding persons immigration status it results in specified

hereinafter 2007 oig report at 44 defining sanctuary policiesand removal of aliens from the united states the impact of unauthorized immigration has arguably been felt most directly in the co mmunities where aliens settle the response of states and localities to the influx of illegal immigrants has varied on one end of the spectrum some jurisdictions have actively sought to deter the presence of illegal immigrants within their territory some jurisdictions have assisted federal authorities in apprehending and detaining unauthorized aliens including pursuant to agreements 287g agreements with federal immigration authorities enabling respective state or local law enforcement agencies to carry out various immigration enforcement functions2 more controversially some jurisdictions have sought to deter illegal immigration by imposing their own restrictions upon unauthorized aliens access to housing employment or municipal services3 moving toward the middle of the spectrum some states and localities communicate with federal immig ration enforcement officers under limited circumstances eg after arresting an unauthorized alien for criminal offense but for various reasons do not take more active role in deterring illegal immigration at the other end of the spectrum some jurisdictions have been unwilling to assist the federal government in enforcing measures that distinguish between legal and nonlegal residents of the community some of these ju risdictions have adopted formal or informal policies limiting coopera tion with federal immigration authorities4 this latter category of jurisdictions is sometimes re ferred to as sanctuary cities although this term is not defined by federal statute or regulation it has been used by some in reference to jurisdictions that may have state laws local ordinances or departmental policies limiting the role of local law enforcement agencies and officers in the enforcement of immigration laws5 the very existence of sanctuary cities has been the subject of considerable controversy supporters argu that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government and that local efforts to deter the presence of unauthorized aliens would undermine community relations disrupt municipal services interfere with localhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22773crs3 6 the modern sanctuary movement has

work opportunity reconc iliation act of 1996 prwora pl 1041938 and 642 of the illegal i mmigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira pl 1042089 prwora 434 proscribes any prohibition or restriction placed on state or local governments to send or receive information regarding immigration status of an individual to or from federal immigration authorities10 iirira 642 is broader in scope barring any prohibition on federal state or local governmental entity or offi cials ability to send or receive information regarding immigration or citizenship status to or from federal immigration authorities11 furthermore the statute states that person or agency may prohibit federal state orlocal government entity from 1 sending information regarding immigration status to or requesting information from federal immigration authorities 2 maintaining information regarding immigration status or 3 exchanging such information with any other federal state or local government entity 12 the constitutionality of the foregoing provisions was challenged by the city of new york the mayor of the city of new york had issued an executive order prohibiting any city officer or employee in most circumstances from transmitting information regarding immigration status to federal immigration authorities13 this executive order was in direct conflict with both prwora 434 and iirira 64214 the united states court of appeal s for the second circuit held in new york v united states city of new york that prwora 434 and iirira 642 on their facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22773crs4

is constrained by constitutional limitations when attempting to i nduce information sharing between state and federal authorities the cons titution limits congress to either adding financial incentives or conditioning federal funding on complian ce with information sharing mandates see state of new york 505 us at 167 19 one difficulty is estimating the precise number of jurisdictions is conflicting interpretations as to what constitutes sanctuary policy see 2007 oig report supra note 4 at viii noting conflicting views found in survey of federal immi gration authorities and local jurisdictions as to whether localities were fully cooperating with federal efforts to remove undocumented criminal aliens 20 id at viiido not violate the anticommandeering doctrine under the tenth amendment15 the anti commandeering doctrine prohibits the federal government from commandeering either states legislature eg by requiring that state enact particular regulatory standards16 or its executive officers eg by requiring that state officers directly participate in enforcing federal law17 to achieve federal goals while this might mean that congress cannot directly compel stat to collect and share information regarding immigration status with federal immigration authorities merely prohibiting states and localities from sharing with the federal government information already in their possession may be permissible according to the second circuit absent specific proof of greater interference with state and local functions18 state and local compliance with federal law although several localities re portedly have adopted form or informal policies limiting coopera tion with federal immigrati on authorities the precise number is unclear19 in 2006 congress required the office of the in spector general oig for the department of justice to study and report on whethe r states and localities receiving federal compensation for incarcerating criminal aliens we re cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts among other things the oig was required to determine whether any states or localities receiving compensati on were in violation of the information sharing requirements of iirira 642 in january 2007 report the oig stated that auditors were able to locate an official sanctuary po licy for only two jurisdictions that received at least 1 million in scaap state crimin alien assistance program funding the state of oregon which received 34 milli on and the city and county of san francisco which received 11 million and s designated itself as city and county of refuge we also located an ex ecutive order issued by the mayor of the city of new york limiting the activities of local law enforcement agencies and officers in the enforcement of immigration w however in each instance the local policy either did not preclude cooperati on with ice immigration and customs enforcement or else included statement to the effect that those agencies and officers will assist ice or share information with ice as required by federal law20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22773crs5 21 the oig report includes description of the methodology used to identify jurisdictions with sanctuary policies we were guided initially in our research by listings of sanctuary cities posted on the websites of several organizations later we focused our search on jurisdictions that received scaap funding of at least 1 million from the fy 2005 appropriation we searched the websites for those jurisdictions in an effort to locate policy statements affecting how local law enforcement agenci interact with ice in the effort to remove criminal aliens from the united states id at 41 according to the oig attempts to identify local polic ies limiting enforcing of immigration legislation revealed much anecdot information but little in the way of formal policies id 22 lisa anderson sanctuary cities draw fire light chi trib december 12 2007 at 6 23 some jurisdictions fear that active collection of immigration data would impair the delivery of services to the communityatlargethe oig report identified two jurisdicti ons receiving at least 1 million in scaap funding that had official sanc tuary policies but it concluded that neither violated federal law the oig estimate of jurisdictions with policies in direct violation of iirira 642 however is not comprehensive while the oig report indicated that few if any jurisdictions that received at least 1 million in scaap funding during fy2005 had formal policies violating iirira 642 the repor t did not identify for example whether any jurisdictions receiving less the 1 milli on were in violati on of federal law21 although iirira 642 prohibits states nd localities from barring the transfer or maintenance of information regarding immigration status it does not require entities to collect such information in th first place reportedly some states and localities seeking to limit assistance to federal immigration authorities have barred agencies or officers from inquiring about persons immigration stat us practice sometimes described as dont ask dont tell approach22 though this method does not directly conflict with federal requirements that states and localities permit the free exchange of information regarding persons immigration status it results in specified agencies or officers not possessing any information about persons immig ration status that they could share with federal authorities23 pending legislation in the 110th congress legislation has been in troduced to enforce the requirements of iirira 642 and induce states and loca lities to provide information regarding persons immigration status to federal immigra tion authorities s 850 and hr 1355 both entitled the scott gardner act mandate that the directors of state and local enforcement agencies collect and report to the secretary of homeland security immigration and dwi information as is collected in the course of the directors normal duties state and local compliance is cond ition to ensure continued funding under the state criminal alien assistance program scaap the bills also include mandate for state or local law enforcement officer who arrests an alien who has been flagged for ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22773crs6 dwi or an immigration offense in the nati onal criminal information center database to detain the alien until he may be transferred to federal custody hr 3494 the charlie norwood clear act contains provision mandating that state and local officers provide information to the secretary of homeland security concerning apprehended aliens who are believed to have committed violation of us immigration laws moreover the bill would also provide grants to state and local law enforcement agencies that have written policies to assist in the enforcement of the immigration laws of the united states hr 4192 the overdue immigration reform act of 2007 and s 2294 the immigration enforcement and border security act of 2007 would make compliance with iirira 642 requisite for state or locality to enter contractual relationship with the federal government to reimburse the costs for incarcerating or transporting undocumented criminal aliens hr 4065 the border enforcement employment verification and illegal immigration control act would amend iirira 642 by adding provision making states and localities that are in viol ation of 642 ineligible to receive any law enforcement grant administered by the department of justice there were several appropriations bills pending in the first session of the 110th congress that made federal funding contingent on compliance with iirira 642 the housepassed version of hr 3093 the comme rce justice scie nce and related agencies appropriations act fy2008 would have barred any funds made available by the act from being used in contravention of iirira 642 housepassed hr 2638 the department of homeland secu rity appropriations
