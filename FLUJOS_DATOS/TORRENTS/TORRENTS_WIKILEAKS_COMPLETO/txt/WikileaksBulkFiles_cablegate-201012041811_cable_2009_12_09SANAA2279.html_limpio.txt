tribal leader for saleh saudi involvement in saada comes not moment too soon ref riyadh 1617 b sanaa 2227 c sanaa 1617 d sanaa 1611 classified by cda angie bryan for reasons 14b and d 1 c summary president saleh believes the saudi governments military actions in saada will alleviate mounting domestic political pressure on him to demonstrate progress against the houthi rebels according toxxxxx with close personal ties to saleh and his inner circle xxxxx told econoff that saleh views saudi involvement in the war and the concomitant increase in direct saudi budget support to the royg as an incentive to prolong the roygs campaign in saada xxxxx also claimed that members of the saudi special office for yemen affairs in contrast to the saudi governments official support for the royg are privately very skeptical of salehs claims regarding iranian assistance for the houthi rebels the long absence from saudi arabia of crown prince sultan saleh skeptic who normally heads the special office has meant that the yemen file has largely been in the hands of king abdullah firm supporter of saleh according to xxxxx end summary saleh relieved by saudi involvement but still overwhelmed 2 c in the past month president saleh has told number of his top advisors that continued direct saudi involvement in the houthi conflict will alleviate domestic political pressure on the royg to produce tangible gains against the houthis according to xxxxx with close personal ties to saleh saleh also views continued saudi involvement as the key to keeping the tap of saudi budget support open saudi monetary support for royg military operations will be reported septel the greater financial incentives attached to direct saudi participation in the conflict mean saleh now has an incentive to prolong the conflict rather than seek mediated solution comment xxxxx comments on salehs thinking support similar accounts from other post contacts reported in ref b xxxxx speaks frequently with saleh xxxxx the chummy relationship between xxxxx that econoff also attended end comment 3 c like other saleh watchers ref c xxxxx characterizes the multitude of threats facing saleh as qualitatively different and more threatening to the regimes stability than those during any other time in yemens history saleh is overwhelmed exhausted by the war and more and more intolerant of internal criticism saudi involvement comes at just the right time for him xxxxx said largely unprecedented criticism of salehs leadership within the rarified circle of salehs closest advisors has increased in recent months even including longtime saleh loyalists such as office of the presidency aides xxxxx according to xxxxx these names add to the growing chorus of saleh loyalists that have shed their traditional aversion to disparaging the man they call the boss ref d saudis divided on confidence in salehs saada claims 4 c members of the saudi governments special office for yemen affairs committee normally headed by crown prince sultan are privately skeptical of salehs claims of iranian involvement and of his desire to regionalize the saada conflict according to xxxxx told econoff on december 14 xxxxx that saleh was providing false or exaggerated information on iranian assistance to the houthis in order to enlist direct saudi involvement and regionalize the conflict xxxxx said that xxxxx told him that we know saleh is lying about iran but theres nothing we can do about it now sanaa 00002279 002 of 002 5 c the prolonged absence from saudi arabia of special office chairman crown prince sultan ref who xxxxx claims is also highly skeptical of saleh left the yemen file in the hands of king abdullah who has greater confidence in salehs motives and leadership abilities committee members have kept their doubts about salehs leadership abilities private since the departure of crown prince sultan creating vacuum of yemen policy advice in the saudi government that resulted in the decision to intervene directly in the houthi conflict xxxxx king abdullah was much more receptive to salehs entreaties for direct saudi involvement than crown prince sultan ever would have been xxxxx 6 c riyadh comment we agree with xxxxx observation that saudi support is enabling saleh to weather increased domestic political pressure and continue his campaign against the houthis however xxxxx assumption that king abdullahs greater confidence in saleh is driving this support may be flawed we have seen evidence that the king has any particular regard for saleh beyond exasperation that borders on disgust senior saudi officials make secret of their distaste for saleh but see him as the devil they know aware of his growing weakness they view their support as essential to keeping yemens problems contained further contacts say second deputy pm and minister of interior prince nayif widely believed to advocate tougher approach to the yemen problem has been heavily involved in the yemen file in sultans absence some suggest that the border actions while temporarily propping up saleh may be indicative of saudi plans to take harder line towards yemen in the longer term end riyadh comment 7 u
