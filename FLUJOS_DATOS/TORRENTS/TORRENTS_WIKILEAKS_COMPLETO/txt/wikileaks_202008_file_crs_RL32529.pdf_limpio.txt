beginning to blur the ncaa in 1948 enacted rules to regu late recruiting and fi nancial aid related to student athletes two years later the ncaa adopted enfo rcement procedures originally modeled after the procedures used in the academic community5 over the years these procedures have been refined to produce process that generally requires the cooperation of the sc hool under investigation6 this is because the ncaa does not possess subpoena power or any other pow er to compel witnesses to appear to give sworn testimony as ncaa members the schools do not cede control of their athletic programs to the ncaa rather the schools agree to apply and enforce the ncaas rules consequently it is the sc hool not the ncaa that takes disciplinary action against studentathlete or school staff member if the school refuses to take such action then the ncaa moves against th school not the student athlete or staff member7 just as the fear of government action spurred colleges at the turn of the twentieth century to form the ncaa congress has to this day maintained an interest in the manner in which american college sports are governed8 one issue in which congress has expressed repeated concern is the due process or lack of it afforded by the ncaa to those the ssociation investigates for wrongdoing9 while ncaa bylaws contain detailed rules for investigating alleged wrongdoing critics of these procedures cite various instances that they view as arbitrary enforcement of some rules but not others10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs3 10 continued one of the most oftencited examples of

and multiple secondary violations may collectively constitute major violation ncaa bylaws articles 190221 190222the ncaa investigatory process the infractions process utilized by the ncaa11 involves the interaction between two entities the com mittee on infractions and the enforcement staff the committee on infractions which is com posed of ten individuals12 provides policy guidance to the enforcement staff and decides on the appropriate punishments for member institutions found to have violated ncaa rule s the enforcement staff on the other hand is comprised mainly of professional investigator s who handle most of the investigations themselves and present their findings to the committee on infractions what follows is brief description of typical ncaa infractions case as described by the ncaa in its bylaws13 when the ncaa receives complaint about member institution the enforcement staff evaluates the claim to determine if it is reasonably substantiated if so then the enforcement staff notifies the institution that the staff will conduct preliminary investigation if the staff determines after c onducting its preliminary inquiry that the allegations are not supporte d by sufficient evidence then the staff moves to close the case if the committee on infractions concurs then the institution is notified that the case is closed if the staff finds violation at this preliminary stage the complaint proceeds in one of two ways depending on the severity of the infraction if the violation is determined to be s econdary in nature14 then the enforcement staff determines the appropriate penalty and submits it for the approval of one designated member of the infractions committee if the penalty is approved the institution has the option to appeal the penalty to the infractions appeal committee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs4 15 id at article 19531 16 shelley v kraemer 334 us 1 13 1948 17 see goss v lopez 419 us 565 1975if the enforcement staff believes after its preliminary investigation that the institution committed violations believed to be major in nature then the claim moves on to second investigatory stage the offi cial inquiry the school then has two options the school first has the option to participate in the summary disposition process this is collaborative proce ss in which the involved parties and the enforcement staff conduct their own inve stigations and agree on report with findings and recommendations to be submitted to the committee on infractions for approval if the institution does not want to participate in the summary disposition process or if the committee on infractions does not accept the findings of the summary disposition report then the committee on infractions conducts hearings to determine the appropriate findings and proposed penaltie s the committees report is then forwarded to the school and all involved parties at which point the school indicates either that it accepts the findings and penalties or that the school intends to appeal the determination to the infractions appeals committee once school has exhausted its ppeals options the ncaas penalty determination is final for major violations such determination sometimes includes probation which puts limits on the num ber of scholarships sports program can offer and prohibits postseason ac tivity eg bowl ga mes tournament appearances for given number of years determination may also include requirement that the school cut its ties w ith certain individuals including coaches found to have been key pa rticipants in the prohibited conduct failure to abide by the ncaas penalty determinations can result in suspension of even termination of an institutions membership15 the courts and the ncaas due process issues the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution provides that state shalldeprive any person of life lib erty or property w ithout due process of law this requirement acts as prohib ition against state not private conduct that denies due process of law16 finding the requisite state action then is crucial to establishing successful claim for vi olation of the fourteenth amendments due process clause as statesponsored ins titutions public universities are clearly state actors and so are likely required to provide hearings to individuals before taking action against them17 however as the following discussion of ncaa v tarkanian and ncaa v miller will show the ncaas structure as voluntary organization comprised of public and priv ate universities scattered acro ss the country has so far shielded the ncaas investigatory and enforcement procedures from judicial intervention and regulation by the states ncaa v tarkanian in 1988 the supreme court dealt serious blow to efforts to require the ncaa to follow the same due process sta ndards as governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs5 18 488 us 179 1978 prior to tarkanian many lower courts had held the ncaa to be state actor and therefore subj ect to due process requirements it is important to note that these cases generally found the ncaas procedur to be adequate under the due process clause see eg university of minnesota v ncaa 560 f2d

with the ncaa for years over alleged recruiting violations following an investiga tion the ncaa infractions committee found 38 violations 10 by tarkanian himself the infractions committee imposed sanctions on unlvs basketba ll program and ordered the school to show cause why it should not face more penalties if unlv failed to suspend tarkanian as coach19 eventually unlv notified tarkanian that it planned on suspending him and tarkanian subsequently filed suit allegi ng that he had been deprived of his fourteenth amendment due process rights in violation of 42 usc 1983 the primary issues before the court were whether the ncaas actions constituted state action prohibited by the fourteenth amendment and were performed under color of state w in violation of 42 usc 198320 in analyzing other state action claims the court has repeatedly noted that as general rule the protections of the fourteenth amendm ent do not extend to private conduct that abridges individual rights21 further the court has fined conduct that is under color of state law as the misuse of pow er possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law22 the ultimate question then is wh ether the conduct causing the alleged deprivation of rights can be fa irly attributable to the state23 applying the test menti oned above the supreme c ourt has found state action where the state knowingly accepts the benefits derived from unconstitutional behavior of private party24 the court in tarkanian however was faced with facts which presented unique mirror image of the traditional state action case in that the final act challenged by tarkanian was committed not by private party but by the state itself ie unlv whereas in the traditional state action case an aggrievedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs6 25 tarkanian 488 us at 192193 26 id at 193 27 id at 192193 28 id at 193 29 id at 198199 30 id at 194195 the courts reasoning regard ing unlvs option to withdraw from the ncaa has drawn criticism see eg ronald j thompson due process and the national collegiate athletic association are there any constitutional standards 41 ucla l rev 1651 1664 1994 this option while theoretically possible is unrealistic in practice because the ncaa is in effect private monopolist in the realm of intercollegiate athletics 31 tarkanian 488 u s at 197198party must trace private conduct to some sort of state action or benefit in tarkanian the plaintiff was trying to trace state c onduct to the imprimatur of private party25 this distinction was essential to the courts analysis in tarkanian thus the question presented is not whether unlv participated in critical extent in the ncaas activities the court stated but whether unlvs actions in compliance with the ncaa rules and recommendations turned the ncaas conduct into state action26 the supreme court recognized unlv to undoubtedly be state actor subject to the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment27 the ncaa on the other hand was made up of s everal hundred other public and private member institutions each similarly effected by the ncaas policiesthe vast majority of which were located in states other than nevada28 further while the court acknowledged that unlvs conduc t was influenced by the ncaas investigations and determinations the court refused to find that this influence turned the ncaa into state actor the court found that the ncaas greatest authority as with any private membership organiza tion lies in its ability to expel members the mere fact that unlv may have acted out of fear of such an expulsion did not make unlvs actions attributable to the ncaa29 essential to the courts reasoning was th fact that it was the school itself not the ncaa that actually suspended tarkan ian voluntary act within the schools discretion just as unlvs membership in the ncaa is voluntary as the court put it unlv retained the authority to withdraw from the ncaa and establish its own standards the university alternatively c ould have stayed in the association and worked through the associations legislativ process to amend ru or standards it deemed harsh unfair or unwieldy30 the supreme court fu rther pointed out that the ncaa possessed governmental power s eg subpoena w itnesses contempt sanctions to facilitate its investigations31 tarkanian also argued that the ncaa s actions constituted state action because the ncaa was acting under authority delegated to it by the state of nevada in essence tarkanian argued that unlvs ag reement to adhere to ncaa enforcement procedures constituted dele gation of authority while the supreme court has foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs7 32 id at 196 33 id at 199 34

delegate authority to private party such that that partys actions are deemed to be state actions the court in tarkanian found such delegation the court pointed out that the school never dele gated any authority to take final actions against university employee those essential powers were retained by unlv far from acting as partners the court furt her found the ncaa and unlv had been at constant odds throughout th investigatory process the ncaa cannot be regarded as an agent of unlv for purposes of that proceeding it is more correctly char acterized as an agent of its remaining members which as competitors of unlv had an interest in the effective and evenhanded enforcement of the ncaas recruitment standards just as state compensated public defender acts in private capacity when he or she represents private client in conflict against th state the ncaa is properly viewed as private actor at odds with the state when it represents the interests of its entire membership in an investigation of one public university32 ultimately the court conc luded that the ncaa was not acting under the color of nevada law but rather the opposite was true it w ould be more accurate to conclude that unlv has c onducted its athletic progra m under color of policies adopted by the ncaa rather than that those policies were veloped and enforced under color of nevada law33 ncaa v miller in the wake of the s upreme courts decision in tarkanian four states nevada nebr aska illinois and florid passed laws purporting to require the ncaa to comply with certain pr ocedural requirements in its investigatory process also soon after the supreme courts decision jerry tarkanian and unlv were again under investigation by the ncaa before the committee on infractions could hold its hearing however tark anian and several other unlv employees demanded that the ncaa comply with th new nevada law the ncaa responded by filing suit in federal distri ct court arguing successfully to that court and on appeal to the ninth circuit that the nevada law was an unconstitutional violation of the dormant commerce clause and the contracts clause34 the constitution vests congress with the power to regulate commerce between the states35 the supreme court has also recognized in this power an inherent limitation on the ability of the states to regulate with respect to interstate commerce36 applying this socalled dormant commer ce clause to nevadas requirements with regard to the ncaa the district cour t found the nevada st atute unconstitutional the court found the ncaa to clearly be invol ved in commerce

795 f supp at 1488 42 ncaa v miller 10 f3d 633 9th cir 1993 while the ninth circuit agreed with the district courts finding that the nevada w violated the dormant commerce clause the ninth circuit ruled that the statutes interfe rence with state commerce was extensive enough to constitute per violation and that therefore the ba lancing test applied by the district court was not necessary id at 639640 the fact that the ncaa cont rols bids involving hundreds of millions of dollars for interstate television broadcasting of intercollegiate sports events37 the court balanced nevadas interest in ensuring fair hearings for its state schools and the employees of those school s against the burden nevadas law placed on interstate commerce wh ile the court found nevadas concern to be legitimate one the court held that the statute imp ermissibly burdened interstate commerce by preventing the ncaa from uniformly enforcing its rules across the nation38 put simply the nevada law required the ncaa to apply certain standa rds in nevada that differed from those generally applicable as mentioned above the district court also found that the nevada law violated the contracts clause of the constitution wh ich prohibits states from impairing the ability of parties to enter into contracts39 the supreme court has held that when examining contracts clause claims courts must inquire as to the degree of contract impairment and the nature and extent of the states interest in the law in question40 analyzing these factors in light of the preexisting contracts between the ncaa andnevadas member schools nd the importance of the ncaas investigatory process to ensuring fair play the district cour t found the degree of impairment effectuated by the nevada law to be substantial in addition the court concluded that this substantial impairment was not justified by an important public purpose and so could not withstand contracts clause scrutiny 41 the ninth circuit affirmed the district courts holding on dormant commerce clause grounds but did not reach the contracts clause question42 while the court in miller did not rule on the validity of the other state statutes purporting to regulate the ncaas procedures the reasoning in that case casts serious doubt on the ability of the states to force the ncaa to adhere to more rigorous due process principles as re sult it seems that any such direction must come from congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32529crs9 43 ncaa bylaws article 19528 44 36 usc 220501 et seq 45 for more information about the usoc see crs report rl32208 united states olympic committee reform an overview of proposed legislation by nathan brooks 46 36 usc 220522a4bafter tarkanian and miller while participation in the ncaa is voluntary and universities can withdraw the virtual monopoly that the ncaa enjoys ove r intercollegiate sports is such that any school that withdraws from the association is locked out from major college competition schools facing ncaa enforcem ent action are therefore left with little choice but to accept the penalty determinations of the ncaa the courts in tarkanian and miller have found the ncaas investigatory and enforcement procedures to be beyond constitutional scrutiny and beyond the ability of the states to regulate consequently any government attempt to require the ncaa to adopt more protective procedural rules would likely require legislation further the tarkanian decision creates the potential showdowns that some would view as unfair between states ponsored member schools and the ncaa specifically because such schools are state actors they are required to provide certain amount of due process to any player s or officials the schools plan to suspend or take action against if after providing such due process however the school finds that there is insufficient evidence to justify imposing disciplinary action on the individual in question the school then s the option to appeal the decision once again to the infractions committee but only if the institution can provide new evidence43 otherwise the school must choos between two options complying with the ncaa and taking action against an individual the school believes to be innocent and b refusing to take action against the student and risking expulsion from the ncaa effectively killing its intercollegiate athletic program congress
