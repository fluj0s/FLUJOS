government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34519the uptick rule the sec removes limit on short selling summary historically in much of the popular lore surrounding short selling borrowing stock with the objective of making profit if its price falls the activity has been unfavorably described as destructive fo rce for both stock markets and the firms whose shares are sold short in the 1930s due to concerns that concerted kind of manipulative short selling known as bear ra id had contributed to the stock market collapse federal securities regulations were adopted th at restricted short selling known as the uptick rule the restriction essentially forbade short sales on stocks unless stocks previous pri ce movement had been upward however modern economics orthodoxy ge nerally views shor t selling to be beneficial economic force among the benefits commonly ascribed to it are its ability to 1 counter an unwarranted speculative upward price pressure in stocks and even uncovering and exposing fraudulent issuer activ ities 2 enable an entity to hedge the risk of stock position owned thus prot ecting against price declines 3 provide liquidity in response to buyer demand nd 4 provide latent buying interest this perspective on the virtues of short selling was bolstered by the results from securities and exchange commission sec sponsored pilot program in which the lifting of the uptick rule for sample of stocks did not appear to have adverse economic outcomes as result in june 2007 the agency voted to rescind the uptick rule since then domestic stock markets have experienced greater volatility and there is contentious debate over the extent to which the turbulence derives from the freer hand that short sellers can now exercise in postuptick world or from heightened financial and economic uncer tainty engendered by the subprime mortgage meltdown representative michael castle for example has written the sec inquiring about the relationship

sec removes limit on short selling introduction on june 13 2007 the securities and exchange commission sec voted to eliminate rule 10a1 under the 1934 securities exchange act the uptick rule which for 70 years had placed restrictions on shor t selling on exchangelisted stocks in the aftermath of the agencys decision to rescind the rule controversy has surfaced over whether the action is perhaps related to an observed spike in stock market volatility this fallout from rescinding the rule has also generated some congressional concern on march 28 2008 representative michael castle wrote sec chairman christopher cox asking about the nexus between market volatility and the lifting of the rule in the letter repres entative castle observed that todays market is vastly different than the market of 70 years ago nd given that current market conditions are more volatile than those prevailing during the pilot program it is important that we monitor closely any impact of unrestricted short selling1 this report looks at the background public policy considerations and controversies surrounding the genesis and the eventual repeal of the uptick rule short selling short selling involves selling stock that the seller has borrowed if the stock price goes down the seller buys it again from the market and settles the transaction generally in the short selling process to sell stock short an entity like broker dealer will lend stock to the prospective short seller stock taken from the entitys inventory at some point the short ller closes the short position by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returns th em to the broker if the price drops the trader can buy back the st ock at the lower price and make profit on the difference but if the price of the stock rises the trader must buy the stock back at the higher price thus losing money frequent source of this borrowed stock is broker held margin stock short sellers are generally considered to be speculators seeking profit or brokerage house employees such as market makers managing their positions one measure of short selling is known as the shor t interest the total number of shares

been covered or closed out when expressed as percentage it represents the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shar outstanding for example at the close of business on the settleme nt day of may 15 2008 the nyse group announced that short interest equale d 42 of the total shares outstanding2 in popular lore short selling is often depicted as stionable form of stock market manipulation indeed the history of the us markets is dotted with various instances in which certain kinds of manipulative short selling appear to have had problematic market impact throughout hist ory there have been instances of particularly egregious form of stock manipulation known as bear raid in bear raid particular stock is sold short in an effort to drive down the price of the security by creating an imbalance of sellside interest the operatives then place themselves in position to acquire the stocks at artific ially deflated prices in addition unfettered short selling can exacerbate declining mark et in security by increasing seller based pressure thus reducing interest in bidding to acquire the stock and thereby causing further reduction in the price of stock by creating an appearance that the security price is falling for fundamental reasons short selling can however also confer number of economic benefits on markets including providing them with the following greater market liquidity short selling by market professionals can offset temporary imbalances in the demand and supply for stock shares additionally short sales can also add to the trading supply of stock that is available to pr ospective buyers and reduce the risk that the share prices paid by them are artificially high because of temporary contraction in given stocks supply greater market efficiency efficient markets require that prices fully reflect all buy and sell interests in traded securities investors who think that given stock is overvalued may c onduct short sales in an attempt to profit from pe rceived divergence of stock prices from their actual values such short sellers add to stock pricing efficiency because their transacti ons inform the market of their evaluation of future stock price performance an evaluation that is reflected in the resulting market price arbitrageurs also contribute to pricing efficiency by utilizing short sales to profit from price disparities between stock and derivative security like convertible security or an option on that stock an arbitrageur may purchase convertible security nd sell the underlying stock short to profit from current price differential between two economically similar positionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34519crs3 3 for example stock trade is consecu tively executed at 21 22 and 22 the last transaction at 22 was at zero plus tick it was executed at the same price as the prior trade but at higher price than the last diffe rent price of 21 under the tick test short sales could only be executed on plus tick or zero plus tick 4 for example if stock traded at 12 shar the next trade would be downtick if it is at 11 78 5 for example stock trade is consecutively executed at 22 21 and 21 the last transaction at 21 was at zero minus tick it was executed at the same price as the prior trade but at lower price than the last different price of 22 6 among others the sec has granted exemptions from rule 10a1 1 for transactions in exchanged traded funds 2 to permit register ed market makers and exchange specialists publishing twosided quotes in security to sell short to facilitate customer market and marketable limit orders at the consolidated best offer regardless of the last trade price 3 for certain transactions executed on volumeweighted average price basis and 4 to electronic trading systems that match and exec ute trades at independently derived prices during random times within specific time intervals 7 bear raids involved wellfinanced stock ope rators who conducted repeated waves of short selling targeted toward particular stocks ac tions that often resulted in downward price spirals which then enabled them to purchase the stocks at artificially deflated prices 8 for example 1951 academic study done at the behest of the new york stock exchange found that as whole there was conclusive statistical evidence that short selling materially affected the extent of major cline or major advance in the market as continuedthe tick test rule 10a1 under the 1934 securities exchan ge act placed restrictions on short sales the rule which was adopted in 1938 provided that subject to certain exceptions an exchangelisted security new york stock exchange and american stock exchange can be sold short 1 at price higher than the preceding transaction in the same security called the plus tick rule or 2 if the price is the same as the previous transaction price but at higher price than the last trade of different price the zero plus tick rule3 short sales however were not permitted 1 on the sale of stock at price that is ss than the previous sale price minus tick4 and 2 at the same price as the previous price but at lower price than the last different price zero downtick5 collectively these proscriptions are known as the tick test or the uptick rule6 by eliminating both the prohibitions on minus ticks and zero downticks the secs elimination of the tick test effectiv ely lifted the proscriptions on selling stock short when its price has recently been falling in adopting rule 10a1 the secs declared goal was to prevent short sellers from manipulating stock prices causing successively lower share prices the proscriptions were also seen as way of stopping the practice of bear raids7 many observers at the time believed that bear raids were major contributors to the stock market declines of 1929 and in the late 1930s in subsequent years however some of those assumptions have been challenged8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34519crs4 8 continued whole macaulay frederick and

the sec encouraged outside research ers to examine the pilot in response it received four completed studies from outside re searchers that examined data from the pilot in addition the agency held public roundtab on september 15 2006 that looked at the empirical evidence gleaned from the pilot data among other things there was widespread agreement that short sale price restrictions we re outdated and provided minimal if any value to the market except in the sense of foster ing the perception that something is being done to restrain bad short sellers most panelists reportedly agreed that short sellers who benefit markets greatly exceed those who have negative impact number of panelists stated that long side conventional stock manipulation in pump and dump scenarios in which there is upward price manipulation pressure is far more pervasive and detrimental than the traditional short sale bear raid transcript of the roundtable is available at httpwwwsecgovabouteconomics hopilottrans091506pdf the external studies and the roundtable panelists were in general agreement w ith the secs analysis of the pilots results for example one study found that under the pilo t the

part of regulation sho9 in an initiative aimed at updating short sale regulation in light of various market developm ents that had emerged since the initial 1938 regulation began pilot pr ogram to test the market impact of relaxing the uptick rule for select group of 1000 securities the pilot lasted year and then was extended into 2007 it was an attempt to test widespread industry academic and regulatory perceptions that the uptick rule was longer necessary in an analysis of results from the pilot the secs office of economic analysis found that short trade restrictions had limite d effect on stock price and that there appeared to be association between manipulative short selling activities like bear raids and the presence of the tick test it also found confirmation of the notion that the tick test appeared to have some potentially adverse market effects in discouraging short selling the study also revealed little empirical justification for maintaining price test restrictions esp ecially for large securities although it found some changes in the displayed liquidity all the tested securities showed about the same level of liquidity and pricing efficiency with or without the tick test when the differences between large and small secu rities were examined one of the most counterintuitive discoveries was that the short selling restrictions increased volatility in large securities while dampening it in smaller ones overall the sec found that there was little evidence suggesting that removal of the short selling restrictions would have negative impact on market volatility price efficiency or liquidity10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34519crs5 11 amendments to regulation sho and rule 10a1 file s72106 december 7 2006 12 speech before his fellow sec commissione rs

increa sed market volatility not related to end of short sale tick test sta says bnas securities regulation and law september 24 2007 p 1445 on december 7 2006 the sec commissioners voted to issue policy proposal that among other things would eliminate rule 10a1s tick test11 prior to that decision chairman cox observed that the core provisions of rule 10a1 have remained virtually unchanged since the 1930s but great deal else has changed in the marketplace over that very long time over the years decimalizati on and changes in trading strategies have undermined the effectiveness of the pric test and at the same time increased transparency and better means of surveillance appear to have lessened the need for the price test through the pilot program we sought to understand the effect of this particular regulation on our markets the evidence gathered from the pilot suggests little empirical justification fo r maintaining short sale price test restrictions at least for the exchangetraded stocks in the pilot in light of the results of the pilot program and the market developments that have occurred in the securities industry since rule 10a1 was first adopted we will today consider proposals to remove the tick test of rule 10a1 and to prohibit the sros from maintaining their existing price tests or adopting any new ones12 among those who backed the lifting of th tick test were number of individual traders academics brokerdeal ers the securities and fina ncial market association an association of veral hundred securities firms ba nks and asset managers and the securities traders association sta an association of individual professionals in the securities industry13 among the staunchest opponent s of rescinding the rest rictions were number of individual investors who invoked the spect er of greater likelihood of bear raids qualified support came from the new york stock exhange which expressed concerns over unrestricted s hort selling during periods of unusually rapid and large market declines exchange officials noted the pilot did not gauge the effect of an unusually rapid and large market decline b ecause such decline did not occur during the period american stock exchange ame x officials expresse d related concerns the exchange specializes in smaller stocks and its officials stated that the removal of the tick test from smaller stocks wa s premature and needed further studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34519crs6 14 nasdaq which was not technically an exchange when rule 10a1 was adopted has been subject to bid test under nasd and nasdaq rules which prohibits short sales at prices below the stocks best published bid offer to buy price when that bid price is below the previous different best published bid price the elimination of the tick test for exchangelisted stocks also meant that the bid test would also be eliminated 15 jeff benjamin did repeal of the uptick rule unleash market havoc surge of volatility rising number of short

evidence p 3on june 13 2007 the sec voted to adopt the proposal to eliminate the tick test14 thus the proscription on short sellers solely being allowed to sell at price above the last price of stock or at the pr ice of the stocks last trade if it was higher than the previous price was longer in effect after the abolition which went into eff ect in july 2007 media reports indicated that sec spokespersons made assurances th at the agency would however closely monitor for potentially abusive trading activities15 the postuptick rule era and concerns over market volatility among other things the high asset price variability that defines volatile markets is problematic because of the heightened investor uncertainty that it tends to generate by various measures 1 the elimination of the tick test coincided with an exceptionally volatile time in us stock markets16 and 2 the months that followed the removal of the uptick rule saw mo re pronounced market volatility than the months that preceded the removal17 as result number of market participants have alleged that the reform appears to have significantly exacerbated vola tility for example andy br ooks head of equity trading at t rowe price has opine d that the power of the short sellers or you could call them hedge funds has grown significantly in stature were in the thick of it and i think eliminating the uptick rule is major contributor to whats happening in the stock market im not saying the markets wouldnt have gone down but they would have gone down in more orderly fashion18 in addition martin j whitman founder

authority as marketing tactic to attract corporate listings 22 mctague stock markets increased market volatility not related to end of short sale tick test p 1445 23 in addition some academics have been hotly debating the identity of the core factors behind market volatility for decades debate that to this day continues without consensus for example see hehui jin and maurizio motelese

rred losses when shares of firms like cit group and bondinsurance companies such as mbia and ambac financial group plummete d behavior he ascribes in media reports to the action of shortsellers20 somewhat related concerns appear to have been behind the new york stock exchanges earlier and unsuccessful request to the sec during the proposal comment period that it be given the authority to voluntarily impose the tick test during periods of rapid stock price declines exchange officials had concerns that the period in which the pilot was conducted did not expe rience severe price declines making it hard to draw any conclusions about the imp act that the tick tests elimination would have in volatile market21 others however have questioned the ex istence of causal relationship between the change and market volatility officials at sta the trade association for securities professionals for example have rejected any suggestions of cause and effect between the lifting of the tick test and more volatile markets they claim that the juxtaposition of the two wa s merely coincidental22 in the context of the claims that resci nding the uptick rule has appreciably added to market volatility another possible view of the issue is that the lifting of the short sale restrictions may have had marginal impact on volatility but that larger and more significant forces were already at work before the rest riction was rescinded those taking this position might argue that those forces included uncertainties over the impact and reach of the subprime meltdown historically high oil price spikes and anxieties over the prosp ect of possible recession23 moreover some also note that even before the removal of the rule trading strategies existed that allowed traders to essentially circumvent the rules restrictions such alternative strategi would have included put options trading trading exchangetraded funds or even violating th uptick rule and facing relatively small

selling in world devoid of the tick test may have an effect on intraday25 market volatility and negative impact on market quality26 the study examined sample of short sellers who submitted aggressive short orders and were able to avoid tick test kinds of restrictions by for ex ample posting their orders on trading venues without such constraints during those occasional times when stocks were experiencing liquidity problems th research found that the traders caused pronounced intraday stock price reversals th at short selling tended to intensify at the beginning of significant stock price revers als the research which examined price reversals of much longer duration than did the sec pilot generally concluded found that the aggressive and price destab ilizing short selling was both recurrent and contagious and could not be fully attributed to corporate or macroeconomic news releases although these did appear to in crease the probability of such predatory short selling the study also observed th at it had found evidence of the existence of new and heretofore unexplored class of short sellers who appear to exacerbate market frictions and create mporary liquidity shortages27 such findings would appear to add more cautious note to the less troubled perspectives on the effects of banishing the tick test potentially deleterious short selling practices might this empirical study suggests be facilitated in certain circumstances when trading is not restrained by tick test controls
