antidumping and anti subsidy proceedings executive summary this paper describes the legal basis and practice of the institutions with regard to the community interest test it illustrates the practice with examples from recent practic the main purpose of the community interest test is to decide whether there are particular reasons not to impose measures in given proceeding despite finding that the dumped or subsidised imports caused material injury to the community industry since community interest considerations can lead to the conclusion that proceeding should be terminated despite the existence of unf air dumped andor subsidised trade the standards applied must be high given the dive rsity of situations analysed it is neither feasible nor appropriate to set clear thres holds above which the imposition of measures may be considered priori to be against the community interest the community interest analysis consists of the identification of any compelling reasons which would lead to the clear conclusion th at measures would not be in the global interest of the community in other words it must be found that the disadvantage for certain interested parties such as users importers or consumers would be clearly disproportionate to any advantages given to the community industry by the imposition of measures although clear disproportionality finding is relatively rare number of cases have been terminated without measures on grounds of community interest it should be underlined that the type of an alysis to be carried out in the community interest test is of an economic nature politi cal considerations and arguments relating to broader policy areas eg foreign policy labour standards regional policy are not within the scope of the examination the community interest test is also not costbenefit analysis in the strict sense in other words while the various interests advantages and disadvantages are put in balance they are not weighed against each other in mathematical equation not least because of obvious methodological difficulties in quantifying each factor with reasonable margin of security within the time available the community interest test addresses in particular the viability and future perspectives of the community industry with and without measures as well as the likely impact of measures or their absence on other interested parties such as importers suppliers users or consumers the assessment of the impact on interested parties must be made in the light of proportionality test when measures are not likely to bring any benefits to the community industry any increase in costs for users importers or consumers even very tiny one would be disproportionate however when measures are likely to improve the situation of the community industry certain increase in costs for other parties will generally be considered to be tolerable 2the community interest test in antidumping and anti subsidy proceedings the main purpose of the community interest test is to decide whether there are particular reasons not to impose measures in given proceeding despite finding that the dumped or subsidised imports caused material in jury to the community industry since the application of this test can lead to the rmination of proceeding despite the existence of unfair ie dumped andor subsidised tr ade the standards applied must be high considerations of community interest shoul d be overriding in order to prevail over the interest of the community industry to compete on levelplaying field the steps undertaken in the analysis of the co mmunity interest and the parameters to be assessed are clearly set by consistent pr actice of the community institutions the microeconomic industrial realities analysed are very diverse as are the interests at st ake hence any thresholds above which the im position of measures may be considered priori to be against the community interest are neither appropriate nor feasible 1 legal basis the legal basis for the community interest test is art 21 of the basic antidumping regulation2 which calls for an appreciation of all the various interests taken as whole in this global appreciation the need to eliminate the trade distorting effects of injurious dumping and to restore effective competition is given special consideration the test to be carried out by the community institutions is negative one ie measures may not be applied where it can be clearly concluded that it is not in the community interest to apply such measures the basic regulations also specify the procedur aspects of the community interest test for instance the fact that any conclusions must be based on substantiated submissions made by interested parties and that these parties have extensive procedural rights and obligations finally the community interest provisions also set out nonexhaustive list of interested parties which are directly concerned by the product under investigation the parties mentioned are the complainants impor ters and their representative associations representative users and representative consumer organisations although suppliers are not explicitly mentioned in art 21 it is sta nding practice to also consider their interests in the global analysis which is required exporting producers are not considered as inte rested parties in the framework of the community interest analysis nevertheless the substance of the arguments which they put forward may be examined in order to have broader more exhaustive analysis furthermore exporting producers receive final di sclosure of the facts and considerations relating to community interest3 2 for antisubsidy investigations the legal basis is art 31 of the basic antisubsidy regulation in the remainder of the text references to antidumpi ng should be understood as covering antisubsidy as well 3 joined cases t3398 and t3498 petrotub sa and republica sa v council 1999 ecr ii3837 204 3it should be noted that the community intere st test does not reflect any equivalent wto provision as the wto antidumping agreement does not require but neither prevents public interest test it is thus rather unique feature of eu law although some kind of public interest test has meanwhile been incl uded in different forms in the legislation of some other wto members the community appears to be the only wto member who consistently applies it in such an elaborated and systematic way4 2 nature and content of the analysis 21 global proportionality assessment of the economic effect of measures on different groups of interested parties once the existence of injurious dumping has b een established there is presumption for the need to apply measures unless compelling reasons lead to the clear conclusion that these measures would not be in the community interest the analysis required consists firstly of an evaluation of the likely consequences of the application or nonapplication of the envi saged measures on the interests of the community industry and of other parties covered by the scope of article 215 this means basically that prospective assessment has to be made in order to establish for each group of economic operators the likely effect of taking or nottaking measures while such prognosis has to work with hypotheses it is not speculative but based on factual data past experience and evidence this is not only the case for the community industry where the effect of the absence of measures can be deduced from the injury analysis but also for other parties eg data on past experi ence can show to what extent users can pass on cost increase following an increase in the cost of raw materials secondly all the different interests examined have to be balanced against each other in other words it must be found that the disadvantage to the other interested parties would be clearly disproportionate to any advantages given to the community industry by the imposition of measures clear disproportiona lity finding is relatively rare as normally the negative impact of measures on certain pa rties is rather limited as compared to the benefits for the community industry indeed in the vast majority of cases the positive effects of measures for the community i ndustry outweigh the possible negative impact on for example users and consumers if however measures would eg not bring any benefit to the community industry their im position would always be disproportionate this would be the case where it is found th at the community industry is not viable anymore and that even the imposition of meas ures could not be expected to allow its return to viability it would also be the cas if the community industry would clearly not benefit from measures for other reasons eg because substitute products would take over in these particular cases the application of antidumping measures would serve purpose it should be borne in mind that the comm unity interest is that of the community of 25 as whole intended as single market it should not be confused with the national interest 4 other traditional users of the ad instrument such as us and australia do not apply publi c interest test the legislation of canada provides for public interest test but it is not applied in suc h systematic way as in the ec and its practical impact seems to be rat her limited some new users eg argentina brazil zimbabwe malaysia have also included the po ssibility to apply some kind of public interest test in their legislation the contents and effect of which are however uncl ear 5 see case t1322001 euroalliages et v commission 2003 ecr iinyp 47 4of individual member states nor should it be c onsidered as the mere sum of the interests of the 25 individual member states through their regular contacts with different categories of economic operators member states obtain information on the interests of all parties concerned and are wellplaced to check the commission services evaluation with the feedback from those parties when taking position on the interest of the eu 25 however it should be recalled that info rmation which was not submitted to the investigating authorities cannot be used as basis for the findings member states have in this respect an important role in enc ouraging parties with whom they may be in contact to participate in the investigation and to transmit any relevant information in their disposal to the commission services the type of analysis to be carried out is microeconomic assessment of the likely impact of the imposition or nonimposition of measures on the directly interested economic operators in the community it must focus on the situation of companies likely to be directly affected by the measures this means th at normally the analysis will go one step up or down in the chain of economic operators involved in dealing with the product concerned for products not commonly sold at retail level consumer organisations are to be involved if they can demonstrate an objective link with the product concerned by the investigation6 it follows from the above that the community interest test is not costbenefit analysis in the strict sense ie while the various interests advantages and disadvantages are put in balance they are not weighed against each other in mathematical equation not least because of obvious methodological difficultie s in quantifying each factor with reasonable margin of security within the time available and because there is not just one generally accepted model for costbenefit analysis 22 new investigations and reviews it should be noted that the community in terest test is not only required in new investigations but also has to be performed in expiry reviews7 and full interim reviews there the essentially prospective analysis to be carried out can use concrete evidence of the past impact of existing measures as an important source of information for example if it was found in the original investigation that the imposition of measures would in all likelihood not substantially affect users or importers and none of these parties submits any comments in the review investigation it can be reasonably concluded that any negative effects on them are negligible8 however the examination of the past impact of measures cannot replace the requirement to carry out new assessment of the consequences of maintaining measures and the balancing of the interests at stake indeed it cannot be automatically presumed in an xpiry review that even if the likelihood of recurrence of dumping and injury has been tablished measures would still be in the community interest since circumstances might have changed and since the corresponding test in the original investig ation took only account of the normal lifetime of measures ie five years new analys is of the community interest is to be 6 case t25697 bureau européen des unions consommateurs beuc v commission 2000 ecr ii101 7 see case t1322001 euroalliages et v commission 2003 ecr iinyp 38 et seq 8 see eg expiry review on magnesium oxide from china 5performed9 it should also be noted that changed circumstances with regard to the community interest can be sufficient ground for the initiation of an interim review10 23 what is not covered by the scope of the community interest test the focus of the analysis is on the economic effects on the interested parties in this respect the question might be raised whether the test should also cover certain broader considerations eg foreign policy envir onmental policy labour standards regional policy macroeconomic effects of measures th at are sometimes invoked as relevant in the context of the imposition or nonimpositi on of measures although the alleged link might be rather indirect as general rule taking this type of consid erations into account would conflict with the precision and technical nature of the inves tigation and the instrument moreover the above mentioned broader topics are alr eady covered by specific legislation which includes public interest considerations concer ns relating to such broader aspects should consequently be addressed by other m eans than antidumping measures in the appropriate respective context indeed trade defence instruments should not be used as means to enforce legislation implement policie s or address particular problems in other areas in any event the impact of such c oncerns at the microeconomic level of the interested parties is generally not likely to be material enough to rival with more direct pricerelated considerations for example in lamps it was argued that the imposition of measures was against the community energy saving policies as measur would result in the increase of retail prices for consumers and thus reduce the sales of energy saving lamps this argument was rejected since the community interest analysis focuses on the economic impact of measures on the economic operators concerned and the community industry cannot be expected to bear the costs of the comm unity energy saving policies through suffering from unfair trade practices in any event it wa s also noted that in the unlikely event of price increase there would still be st rong economic incentive for consumers to buy energy saving lamps on the other hand considerations relating to general policy areas eg environment might exceptionally indirectly play role to the extent that they are linked to or coincide with the interests of certain interested parties for example in psf it was considered that the imposition of duties woul d contribute to guarantee the viability of the psf industry which holds central position in th recycling of pet bottles as they are the main customer of the recycling industry they consumed 70 of the recycling of pet bottles during the ip since waste manage ment and recycling are priority of the community the measures would thereby also indirectly contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives finally it should be noted that arguments re lating to alleged economic advantages in exporting countries eg lower wages can cl early not be invoked against the imposition of measures as the community interest test is performed once positive finding of dumping has been made 9 see case t1322001 euroalliages et v commission 2003 ecr iinyp 58 10 for further details on this issue see council clarification paper nr 17 63 the analysis of the community interest 31 collecting information as stated above community interest findi ngs must be based on concrete evidence collected from interested parties the data collection and anal ysis should in precision and procedure resemble that carried out for the other aspects of the investigation ie the establishment of dumping injury and causal link in order not to create big disparity in the investigation for this information collection the commission follows proactive approach by inviting parties to participate in the community interest investigation and to reply to the questionnaires sent to them in particular all interested parties known to be concerned and the relevant associations are contacted 11 this includes community producers users and consumers importers and traders as well as the upstream industry eg providers of raw materials or machin ery the timescale for the completion of questionnaires is set out in the notice of initiation of an investigation the commission services try to accomodate any requests for extension of deadlines and to the extent possible and due account being taken of the obligation to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment also to take into account late submissions of information when member states are in contact with economic operators that can provide relevant information they are strongly invited to encourage them to fully cooperate in the investigationit must be pointed out however that cooperation in this respect is often poor very often numerous parties do not come forward or do so too in the investigation they frequently provide only unsubstantiated or unverifiable information or limit their submission to some mere statements in favour or agains t the imposition of measures this hampers detailed analysis of the economic impact of the measures on the interested parties eg quantification of the likely cost increase for users and forces the institutions to resort to the use of partial facts available eg fr om available statistical databases economic studies sectoral information or also previous investigations 32 the assessment of the different interests at stake the interested parties have different and usually even conflicting interests visàvis the imposition or nonimposition of measures it is therefore necessary to identify and assess these various interests in order to finally balance them against each other cooperation for each group of economic operators differs significantly from case to case but is often poor in cases where within certain category only few parties cooperate special attention must be paid to their repr esentativity for that industry as whole for the purpose of the community interest analysis the representativity of submissions for the sector concerned does not depend on thei r number or market share but rather on 11 in order to identify those interested parties and relevant associations the commission services use in particular information requested from the community industry information collected in other investigations or information which is generally availa ble databases sector info rmation internet etc it should be noted in this respect that there are limits to the information that can be expected to be provided by the community industry if for example the community industry was forced to nam all its customers in all cases in the annex identifying th users it would rightly complain that such annex would become an easy way for exporters to get in contact with these customers which cannot be the purpose 7whether the companies constitute typical sample of the different categories of economic operators of that sector12 in practice the following elements are normally addressed 1 relevant interests of the community industry analysis when injurious dumping has been establis hed it can be presumed that antidumping measures are not against the interests of the community industry the analysis will therefore focus on the proportionality of the measures two aspects are particularly important in that respect first of all the viability and future perspectives of the community industry are looked at measures serve purpose only if the co mmunity industry is viable or has good perspectives to restore its viability and co mpete on the community market if measures are imposed if however an industry does not have the potential to recover and play role on the community market in terms of market share production capacity technology etc antidumping measures would always have to be considered as disproportionate even if the negative effect on other interested parties was very small secondly an analysis must be made of the likely effects of measures or their absence on the community industry these effects will vary for instance depending on whether the community industry is likely to maintain its price level and increase its market share as consequence of the measures or can rather be expected to raise prices and maintain the current market share with the price increase being passed on to the consumers furthermore particular attention is given to the potential impact of measures or their absence on employment in general the highe r the expected benefits for the community industry in terms of in particular likely incr eases in sales volumes market share prices and profitability and saved or created empl oyment the higher the weight of these considerations when balanced against any possible negative effect on other interested parties if the community industry would not or only marginally benefit from measures for example because the market share of th dumped imports is likely to be taken over entirely by nondumped but equally lowpriced imports from third countries measures would not be justified b examples in laser optical reading systems lors it was found that the community industry producing disc changers component of lors was still in nascent phase the community industry was set up in an environment of depressed prices at moment when the product was already well established on the market ie at very late stage and was still only reaching market shar of 14 during the investigation period under these circumstances th future perspectives and viability of the community industry were unclear therefore measures were not imposed also in the light of the fact that any advantages for th community industry were likely to be minimal given the relatively low level of employment affected and were clearly disproportionate when weighed against the interests of consumers importers and traders similarly in the ferrosilicon expiry review the investigation showed that the community industry had not been capable of benefiting sufficien tly from the measures in place this was evidenced in particular by its failure to maintain its market share its deteriorating profit the 12 see also case t1322001 euroalliages et v commission 2003 ecr iinyp 90 8closure of two companies and the reduction of employment in the remaining companies even though imports from the countries concerned had most disappeared at the same time the community steel producers had had to bear negative effects of measures in the form of additional costs for many years since it wa s therefore not clear that maintaining measures would provide sizeable benefits to the community industry while it would unduly prolong the longterm negative effects for the steel industry it was c oncluded that maintaining the measures would be contrary to the interests of the community industry in synthetic handbags it was found that it was not likely that the community industry would benefit from any antidumping measures impo sed since synthetic handbags would in all likelihood be sourced from other third countries not subject to measures in the medium term consequently most of the volume and price benefits from antidumpi ng measures could be expected to go to exporters in third countries and not to the community industry moreover the consequences of the nonimposition of measures on employment in the community synthetic handbags sector were relatively limited ca 500 jobs as compared to the employment in the corresponding distribution sector ca 4 100 jobs finally comparison of the market shares of the community industry 2 and the imports cerned 80 indicated that the impact of any measures on importers and traders would be clearl disproportionate to any possible benefit in the short term to the community industry under these circumstances and in view of the concurring significant impact which measures would have on consumers importers and traders measures were imposed the situation wa s however completely different for the leather handbags industry which was found to be viable competitive industry holding significant share of the community market and adding substan tial creative value to the product in the form of knowhow design innovation and quality measures on leather handbags were therefore found to be in the interest of the community industry in personal fax machines it was found that the community industry continued to invest and to develop its own type of personal fax machine wh ich would be shortly introduced on the market the imposition of measures would enable the co mmunity industry to maintain and further develop its activities in the community furtherm ore the imposition of measures was likely to save around 370 jobs directly linked to the pr oduct concerned and to positively affect around 4000 jobs overall based also on other considerations it was concluded that measures should be imposed in sulphanilic acid it was found that there was reason to doubt the viability and competitiveness of the community industry under normal conditions of fair trade even though one of the two community producers constitu ting the community industry had filed for protection from its creditors and its activities w ere being overseen by an administrator appointed by the court of commerce the latter company would continue to exist for the immediate future and would therefore be in position to benefit from measures moreover the investigation showed that the community industry had plans to increase its production capacity in order to meet the growing demand but that these plans had to be deferred because of the low price level caused by the dumped imports the imposition of measures would allow the community industry to increase its sales volume and prices thereby ge nerating the necessary level of return to justify continued investment if measures were impo sed losses of the community industry would continue and the company mentioned might not survive case involving vertically integrated industry was tungstic oxide and tungstic acid after the imposition of measures on tungstic oxide and acid or iginating in china the community industry continued to integrate vertically the subsequent expiry review showed that most of the sales of the community industry were captive in addition the community industry was also integrated upstream and sourced the raw material for tungstic oxide and acid from china as well in these circumstances it was not clear to what extent th industrys production chain was at risk in the absence of measures moreover the industry wa s found to be vulnerable anyway given the very high dependence on supply of raw materials from china in addition the effectiveness of the measures was doubtful and measures had negative ffects on users however since already the likelihood of recurrence of injurious dumping was not clearly established measures were not maintained for that reason without the community interest test being decisive 9in the salmon case it was concluded that the impositi on of measures on imports from chile would be inefficient since the community industry was not likely to benefit from them on the one hand it was doubtful whether measures would lead to price increase given the small market share of chilean salmon and of the community industry visàvis other sources that may not increase prices on the other hand even if meas ures were to trigger price increase to the benefit of the community industry the negati ve effects on other interested parties and the resulting transfer of wealth to those producersex porters in countries not subject to measures would greatly exceed the benefit to the community industry by contrast in the drams case it was found that the community industry was viable under normal market conditions following substantial rationalisation the remaining producers had made great efforts to keep at the front end of technological developments and were considered to be very competitive in world terms their situation had deteriorated sharply due to the subsidised imports from korea which had led to very low prices these in turn had adversely affected the ability of the community industry to remain profitable and to invest in order to remain competitive in the absence of measures the precarious situation of the community industry would deteriorate to point where its very existence could be at risk the disappearance of thi s technologically advanced industry with more than 10 000 employees would have significant negative effect on employment moreover entry costs in the market are high and reentry by existing producers or new ones would be unlikely therefore measures which would reestabli sh fair competition were in the int erest of the community industry the review investigations on goes found that the community industry was viable and capable of benefitting from the protection offered by th antidumping measures this was shown by its ability to improve its situation and restore satisfa ctory level of profitability furthermore the community industry had made strong efforts to restructure and rationalise its production in order to remain competitive at community and world level as it was however still in vulnerable situation its efforts would be jeopardised if measures lapsed and dumping recurred 2 relevant interests of importers and traders analysis since antidumping measures may have considerable impact on the situation of importers and traders the likely effect of measures on their economic position has to be considered in the community interest analys is in this respect the mere fact that measures will lead to cost increase for im porters can as such not be reason not to impose measures the analysis will rather focus on elements such as the importance of the product concerned for the business activity of the importers does it represent only minor part or major share of the total tur nover of the importers their profit margins and the possibility to pass on cost increases to the purchasers furthermore the availability of alternative sources of supply will be taken into account in this context it is often also argued that the community production is insufficient to meet the entire demand within the community and that therefore imports are necessary this argument is in general not valid as such as antidumping measures are not intended to exclude the dumped imports from the community market but to ensure that they compete on nondumped or noninjurious pr ice level with other suppliers on the community market moreover in most cases it is found that the imposition of measures does not lead to any problem of supply should there nevertheless be risk of lack of supply this would of course have to be taken into consideration in the analysis while normally importers will argue that the imposition of measures is not in their interests it should be noted that this is not necessarily always the case for certain products it may happen for example that due to the speed of innovation the price of the 10dumped imports has fallen to such an extent that the profit margin of the importers has become too small in such admittedly more exceptional cases the imposition of measures might be also in the interests of importers as it might lead to an upward adjusted price level furthermore measures can also be in the interest of importers which also act as traders with respect to traders the potential effect of measures on their situation depends on the product mix of the traded goods to the extent that they also trade in the community produced like product their interests will coincide with those of the community industry therefore for traders selling bot h imported and community produced products the respective positive and negative effects of measures may often neutralise themse lves as regards the potential impact on employment importers will normally be less affected by the imposition of measures than the comm unity industry in case of nonimposition of measures since importers in general produ ce less value added and thus less jobs are normally concerned furthermore they usua lly also import other products and can in addition switch to other supply sources more over while employment in the community industry might include highqualified jobs requiring special knowhow which the community has an interest to keep this is usually less the case for importers or traders the interest of the community industry might therefore generally prevail so far there have not been cases where measures were not imposed only on the basis of the interests of importers or traders b examples in glyphosate it was considered that since most importers dealt with range of products other than glyphosate the impact of measures on their overall business would be limited moreover the price decrease of glyphosate which importers expected if measures lapsed would only have limited financial benefit for importers since they would be forced to pass on the bulk of their cost decrease to their customers due to competition in hollow sections the investigation showed that the product concerned represented on average about 12 of the cooperating sa mpled importers total turnover the proportion of employees directly or indirectly involved in the trading of the product concerned represented only 23 of total staff of 107 employees of these importers furthermore the low proportion of the produc t concerned in the total costs of users should make it easier for importers to pass any price increase on to users therefore it was concluded that measures would not have significantly negative effect on importers in bed linen from pakistan it was also found that onl small share of the turnover of the cooperating importers was generated by sales of the product concerned and that there were many other sources of supply therefore the impact of antidumping measures on these importers could be considered as minor similarly in welded tubes it was concluded that measur were not likely to have significantly negative effect on the situation of importerstraders in the community since the product concerned represented on average only 10 of their total turnover and they were likely to pass any increase in prices of the product concerned on to users 11conversely in cdrs the imposition of measures was found to be also in the interests of importers prices of the dumped imports had decreased to such an extent that normal trading contribution margin was longer sufficient to cover the importers overhead costs moreover the decrease of market pr ices occurred at such pace that importers were faced with rapid value deterioration of goods in transit creating situation in which the purchase price occasionally exceeded the eventual sales price under these conditions it was found that measures would rve the interests of importers by restoring an adequate sales price level on the community market in tube and pipe fittings it was found that number of importers also traded in community produced tube and pipe fittings that only low number of companies importing from the countries concerned object ed to measures and that supplies from third countries with duty would still be av ailable therefore measures would not have significant negative effect on importers or traders 3 relevant interests of suppliers analysis the likely impact of measures on the upstream industry will mainly depend on the extent to which they are economically dependent on the community industry in principle the positive effect of measures for the community industry will have direct positive consequences for the suppliers esp ecially if both industries closely work together similarly likely deterioration of the situation of the community industry will negatively impact on the position of the upstream industry thus considerations regarding the interests of suppliers often reinforce the appreciation of the community interest in favour of measures if the upstream industry also supplies the exporters the possible negative effects of measures on their position will normally be outweighed by the positive effects on the community industry from which they also be nefit the existence of strongly export oriented upstream industry may exceptionally also speak against the imposition of measures or can alleviate the negative consequences of the nonimposition of measures the interests of upstream suppliers located outside the community are not taken into consideration in the analysis in line with the treatment of exporters in the exporting country concerned b examples in ptfe the investigation showed that the majo rity of raw material suppliers worked closely with the community industry and derived high large part of their turnover 75 from sales to granular ptfe producers therefore any reduction in the community industrys purchases would have significant effect on the situation of suppliers moreover it was argued that without the im position of measures there was risk of delocation of the community industry to thir d countries this would force the suppliers to search for clients outside the community where they would be in competition with traditional indigenous suppliers of raw mate rials and face additional export costs which would further erode their already low profit margins it was therefore provisionally concluded that the imposition of measures was in the interests of the upstream industry 12in welded tubes it was found that the cooperating pr oducers of the main raw material used in the product concerned hotrolled coils which employed around 92 000 people were likely to face reduction in demand if measures were imposed moreover as they had already faced unfair competition in the past they would have even more difficulties in recovering from past dumpi ng with the imposition of measures the upstream industry would continue to benefit fr om the existence of demand of hotrolled coils in the community measures were therefore in their interest 4 relevant interests of users analysis the interests of the downstream industry wh ich uses the product under investigation for further processing will depend on whether they predominantly purchase from the community industry from the dumping exporters or from third countries the degree of their dependence on each of these sources of supply determines the impact of measures furthermore the importance of the produc t under investigation for the final product manufactured by the users and the potential cost impact of measures play crucial role the fear for cost increase and the negative consequences for the user industry resulting therefrom is typically the main argumen t invoked by users against the imposition of measures any increase in the cost of pr ocessing industrys raw materials may indeed affect its ability to compete with other pro cessors both on the community market and in third countries for users which mainly purchase their inputs from the dumping exporters the negative effects of measures on their cost structure can be considerable however the assessment of the impact on users is often hostage of misconceptions since the product under investigation will typica lly be only one of several input factors for the user industry it is normal that this latter industry is larger has higher employment and larger turnover than the comm unity industry thus while employment considerations are obviously taken into account simple comparison of employment or of number of companies is not appropriate for the analysis similarly it would not be adequate to only consider the absolute amount of likely cost increases for users due to the imposition of measures otherwise the whol exercise would be meaningless since almost by default measures would be imposed in practice the investigation will first establish how much the product concerned represents in the cost of production and not as interested parties frequently claim the costs of raw materials or cost of manufacturi ng only of the users thereafter the likely cost increase following the imposition of measures has to be determined the latter analysis focuses mainly on two aspects first of all in order to determine the likely cost increase account will be taken of alternative sources of supply for example the availability of nondumped imports from the country concerned from the community industry or from third countries or the exis tence of exporters with comparatively low antidumping duties would allow users to switch to these sources thereby limiting the effect of measures secondly the likely cost increase for the users will be determined as compared to their profitability situation in other words the imp act on the net margin in this respect it is important to consider whether or not the user industry would be likely to pass on any cost increases to the next stage of the economic chain this naturally encompasses consideration of the competitive situation of the user market where users are exposed to strong competition it may be more difficult or even impossible to pass on cost 13increase in that scenario the negative impact of measures would carry relatively high weight in the global assessment especially if the product concerned represents an important part of the production costs of the users and if their proft margins are already low if however measures would lead to general price increase affecting all economic operators in the same way the cost increase fo r the users would be neutralised or at least mitigated for the assessment of the likely imp act of measures on the situation of users evidence on cost increases in the past can be an important source of information to take into consideration the determination of the likely cost increas is often complicated by the lack of full cooperation from the user industry if precise information in this respect is provided conclusions have to be reached on the basis of the facts available which may not allow representative arithmetical quantification of the effects of the measures on the downstream industry the lack of cooperation from users can indicate that the product concerned represents only small part of thei r cost of production and that they would not be significanty affected by antidumping m easures in exceptional cases however eg when sme are involved low cooperation might also be due to resource considerations this problem however exists also for other aspects of the investigation finally it should be noted that users sourcing from the community industry can in principle benefit from the improved situa tion of their suppliers and also have competitive advantage as compared to ot her users which after the imposition of measures will face higher costs13 however to the extent that they compete with companies from third countries that continue to have access to the dumped imports they can have competitive disadvantage both in the community and on third country markets which has to be taken into consideration in the analysis the assessment of the impact on users must be made in the light of proportionality test it must take into account the likely positiv impact of measures on the community industry and other interested parties when measures are not likely to bring any benefits any increase in costs for users even very tiny one would be disproportionate however when measures are likely to impr ove the situation of the community industry certain increase in costs for users will genera lly be considered to be tolerable at the same time the level of cost increase above which measures would be disproportionate will depend on many factors these would certa inly include the level of competition on the market the current level of profitability compared to that of the community industry the availability of other sources of supply the employment involved etc therefore fixed threshold above which any increase in costs would be disproportionate cannot be set b examples in gum rosin from china it was found that the imposition of measures would lead to substantial cost increase for users from numer ous high added value industries supporting large number of jobs in addition the impos ition of antidumping measures would not be adequate to remove the injury since it would prov oke significant increase in the price of gum rosin which would render more expensive substitute products competitive this would result in 13 while prices of the community industry might rise they will normally not increase to the same extent as the imports plus duty because the community industry typically benefits from measures via economies of scale moreover it should be recalled that since prices have often dropped before the imposition of measures the increase is just readjustment to the normal price level 14quick penetration of the community market by those substitute products with consequent global increase in costs in comparison measures would have only benefited smes located solely in one member state as the negative effects of measures were therefore disproportionate to the benefits for the community industry measures were imposed the following cost increases were found not to be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case in magnesia bricks the product concerned represented significan tly less than 1 of total costs so that the antidumping duties would only have marginal influence on the total costs in the steel making process in psf users claimed that they operated in highl price sensitive market and that even small cost increase could not be passed on to the final customer due to the already firece competition in the endproduct market however it was found t hat the likely cost increase for the downstream industry would be in the region of 040 so that even if this could not be passed on to customers the impact on the financial situation of users would not be significant in pet it was concluded that the cost of pet for mineral and spring water producers only represented 3 cents at the level of the endconsum er or 610 of the retail price which means that 10 price increase would entail possible maximum price increase of 06 to 1 at the level of the end consumer if all the cost s are passed on this in crease was not considered significant because it could either be absorbed by the downstream industry or passed on to retailers or endconsumers similarly as regar ds the soft drink producers the same increase of 10 of pet prices would entail minor 03 increase of the price for endconsumers as this increase is marginal the users could be expected to be able to pass it on to the retailers and the endconsumers in sodium cyclamate the possible financial impact of measures was found to be significantly below 1 of the total manufacturing costs of th cooperating user which was not considered to unduly affect the interests of users in graphite electrode systems the investigation showed that the possible cost impact on users would be between 015 worst case scenario and 003 more favourable scenario depending on whether the prices of the community industry and those of the imports concerned would both increase by the level of the duty between 12 and 20 or only the imports would increase by this amount cost increase somewhere in the middle of both hypotheses was considered the most realistic scenario as the community indus try had also spare capacities and could therefore increase production thus achieving economies of scale while the price increase was likely to be moderate it was found unlikely that such lim ited cost increase for the users would seriously affect their financial situation in urea it was found that in worst case scenario measures would result in an average cost increase of 06 for farmers using urea as their only fertiliser however given that importerstraders would probably not pass on the duties in full and that farmers increasingly sourced urea from other countries not subject to measures or from the community industry it was found highly unlikely that farmers would feel this full impact for the same reasons the possible hypothetical impact on industrial users of 32 to 42 in the worst case scenario was not very likely this was confirmed by the absence of comments by industrial users on thi s assessment therefore the impact on users was not such as to make the imposition of measures against the community interest in sulphanilic acid the commission sought to quantify the possible financial impact of measures on users by taking into account both the origins of their sulphanilic acid purchases and its share in their overall manufacturing costs as measures were based on the dumping margins it was assumed that prices of imports from the count ries concerned would increase by the duties on that basis it was found that measures would increase the full costs of optical brighteners by somewhat less than 1 of dyes and colorants by somewhat less than 1 and of concrete additives by less than 2 for the latter group of users it was also found that the turnover of products containing sulphanilic acids represented very small part less than 5 of the total 15turnover of the cooperating companies overall it was concluded that the imposition of measures would slightly affect the financial situation of users but would not endanger their overall activities or lead them to relocate th eir production outside the community in zinc oxide it was found that the imposition of measures would lead to an increase of less than 4 of total costs for the frit and glaze makers the investigation showed that they were in sufficiently strong financial position to be able to absorb this increase but that they could in all likelihood pass it on to their customers in the tile producing sector therefore measure s would not have major adverse impact on their activities in hotrolled coils it was estimated that the imposition of an antidumping duty of 8 may prompt an increase of around 16 in the overall co sts of the raw material s for the users this extra cost would cause an estimated increase in the full cost of production of about 11 giv the mix of various sources of purchases and the average value added in the downstream products this was found not to be such as to endanger the profitability of the user industry and not to outweigh the positive effects of measures on all other operators in the community market in silicon users opposed the imposition of measures bec ause of the expected cost increase but did not provide information to allow an assessmen t of the impact of measures on their costs or profitability on the basis of the information av ailable and following onspot visits it was found that the cost increase for metallu rgical users would be in the order of eur 11 per tonne of finished product ie by 08 which was not considered to be against the community interest 5 relevant interests of consumers analysis consumers are situated at the end of the distribution chain and constitute rather heterogeneous group whose purchasing decisi ons cannot always be rationalised in commercial terms eg brand loyalty despite th availability of cheaper substitutes the possible impact of measures on consumers may therefore be difficult to ascertain furthermore it should be noted that antidum ping measures normally only have direct effect on the interests of consumers in proceedings concerning consumer goods for these reasons the interests of consumers w ill rarely play decisive role in the community interest test the assessment of consumers interests will generally concentrate on two factors first of all the danger of price increases which might result from the imposition of antidumping measures and which would have to be borne by final consumers should be considered as for the users the impact of the impos ition of measures on consumers will depend on the extent to which price increases are passed on to final consumers in very competitive market for example the community industry may decide not to increase their prices or importers from the country concerned may have to reduce their profit margin so that the final impact of m easures on consumers remains limited price increases will most likely also be insignificant if exporters from the country concerned already have production plants within the community on the other hand it is often rather normal that antidumping measures lead to some price increase directly for the imports from the country concerned indir ectly for the community industry which may adjust to the higher price level this is ultimately the purpose of antidumping measures finally it should be noted that price increas are as such not necessarily valid argument against the imposition of measures since the shortterm advantage of being 16supplied with lowpriced dumped products may soon disappear following reduced competition if the community industry were driven out of the market 14 secondly the preservation of consumer choice is to be taken into account the imposition of measures may lead to restricti on of consumer choice if it can be expected that it would result in all or some of the exporters longer being interested in the community market depending on the level of the measures and the amount of competition this might indeed happen howeve r the effect of measures on consumer choice would not be significant if ther are many other sources of the product community industry imports from thir d countries nondumped imports from the country concerned especially if these so offer comparable product types and quality moreover imports from the country concerne d should normally also remain available albeit at higher prices finally there is also risk of reduction in consumer choice if exporters from the country concerned have already set up production plants in the community on the other hand where it is likely that th imposition of measures would not only lead to reduced choice for consumers but to real shortage of supply the interests of consumers may prevail over the interests of the community industry b examples in lors it was found that the imposition of measures was likely to severely limit consum er choice as many exporters would be likely to withdraw from the community market after the imposition of measures the consequent loss of c hoice in the variety of models available could not be compensated in the foreseeable future by the community industry the high market presence of the exporters and the fact that they offered wide model range comprising high quality productswould mean that if they were to withdraw consumers would be deprived of taking advantage of technological variety and development without any viable alternative for the foreseeable future in that situation it was found that the interests of consumers by far outweighed those of the community industry however in personal fax machines different conclusion was reach ed first of all the increase in costs due to measures was estimated at 6 ecu year for consumers very moderate amount which would be even further neutralised by the normal price decreases for this product furthermore the consumer would be able to rely on growing market supply from the community industry which was likely to keep its prices stable it was therefore concluded that the charge to consumers resulting from the impositi on of measures would be moderate compared to the benefits of securing the continuation of industrial activities and employment requiring high qualifications in the community in ring binder mechanisms i it was found that in worst case scenario ie should the cost increase that the users might suffer be passed on in full to the final consumer this would entail price increase of maximum of 4 for the final consumer however it was considered that this was unlikely to occur si nce experience showed that each step in the distribution chain was likely to support part of its cost increase in order to stay competitive on its market in leather handbags it was found that the effect of the duty on the consumer in the form of price increase was not likely to exceed 9 it was also considered that leather handbags being fashion product not purchased on regular bas is consumers did not have clear perception of the appropriate price so that moderate price increase was not likely to affect demand substantially in the long term therefore it was not expected that the impact of measures on the consumer would be significant 14 this problem may not arise if the level of competition from all third countries is high 17in the drams case it was also concluded that consumers would not be significantly affected by the imposition of measures even if the drams prices would increase by the full amount of the duty the impact on the prices of pcs would be limited to around 1 however the effect was likely to be smaller given the chronic overcapacity worldwide in colour television receivers it was concluded on the basis of the facts available that the impact of measures on consumers would be limited given the large number of players active in the market the large number of products which they offered and the high level of price competition between brands 6 competition analysis although not explicitly mentioned in article 21 of the basic regulation as factor to be considered in the community interest test the preservation of competitive situation on the market is relevant consideration in the context of the assessment of the potential effect of measures on in particular th community industry users consumers and suppliers indeed if measures lead to less competition this may have negative consequences for other parties in terms of increasing prices reduced choice etc the question whether antidumping measures could reduce effective competition arises if the community industry only consists of lim ited number of producers with significant market share in such situation the danger of reducing competition creating or strengthening an oligopolisticmonopolistic market structure or dominant position on the market must be assessed and taken into account in this respect however the sole fact that community producer already has dominant market position would not be reason to consider that his interests are less worthwile of protection against unfair trade the maintenance of dominant position is as ch not against the community interest as long abuse is made of such dominant position antidumping measures may also prevent the creation of dominant position of the exporters where dumping practices of the latter are likely to drive the community industry out of the market if measures are imposed in that situation competition considerations would plead in favour of measures whether or not the risk of dominant position of exporters exists depends in par ticular on the number of exporters and the structure of the exporting markets concerned in general the risk of reduction of competition does not exist if enough alternative sources of supply in particular imports from third countries remain to ensure effective competition linked to the risk of reduction of compe tition is the fear of shortage of supply the argument that the imposition of measures may endanger sufficient supply of the product concerned is often invoked by the user industry however in most cases it is found that measures will not lead to ny supply problems because on the one hand imports from the country concerned will remain available albeit at higher prices on the other hand alternative sources of supply ex ist from third countries or from the community industry which may have spare capacity or could increase its capacity the risk of supply shortage might also be invoked by other interested parties such as 18consumers but is rarely confirmed by the investigation or by subsequent reviews or monitoring exercises if the community industry has been found to engage in anticompetitive practices the possible reduction of competition following the imposition of antidumping measures must be examined with special care15 obviously measures to protect cartel cannot be in the community interest however it should be noted that past infringement of the ec competition rules is as such not reason to deprive the community industry from its rights to obtain relief against dumping practices furthermore if the involvement in anti competitive practices did not relate to the product concerned it would not be considered relevant in the context of the antidumping proceeding b examples in polysulphide polymers from the usa it was found that the absence of measures could lead to the withdrawal of the community industry and t hus to monopoly situation with higher price levels as only the american exporter would be left on the community market measures would allow the community producer to stay in th market thus preserving competition which was found to be beneficial to users in the long term in glycine from china provisional measures it was found that if the sole community producer of glycine disappeared from the market the ch inese exporters would be in position to supply over 80 of community demand leading to quas imonopoly situation this would in the long term be detrimental to the interest of users therefore measures were provisionally found not to be against the community interest similarly in ring binder mechanisms ii the community industry was reduced to one company group after several companies had closed down moreover there were only few producers of ring binder mechanisms worldwide mostly chinese or under chinese control in these circumstances it was considered that should the community industry cease to exist this would have negative effects on competition in the commun ity since users would become almost totally dependent on imports from chi na andor from chinese subsidiaries in third countries chinese producers would then have an incentive to substan tially increase their price levels which would endanger the competitiveness of user industries in the coumarin expiry review it had been argued that the existing measures had eliminated chinese coumarin from the community market leading to monopoly of the sole community producer however it was found that several alter native sources of supply still existed with japan and india still having nonnegligible market shares and that there were indications of anticompetitive practices of the community producer whose sales prices had decreased over the period under review therefore competitionrelated concerns were considered not to be compelling reason against the continuation of the measures in sulphanilic acid it was found that if measures were not imposed the community industry could be forced out of production this would further reduce the number of suppliers on the community market while production outside the community was already concentrated in relatively few countries measures would therefore help to protect the choice of user industries and maintain competition on the community market in magnesia bricks from china the user industry had argued that measures would strengthen market structure consisting of few important producers however it was found that the largest 15 in this respect dg trade cooperates with dg comp in order to determine whether ny anti competitive practices have been established or are be ing investigated relating to the product subject to examination as matter of routine contact is establi shed in all cases with very few actors on the market 19producer had around 30 of market share which was unlikely to be large enough to control and dominate the market this was supported by th fact that imports from the prc had eroded this market share these imports were likely to continue after the imposition of measures moreover there were number of small produ cers in the community and evidence was provided on how the large players had dominat ed the market or on other incompetitive behaviour in paracresol from china one user industry feared t hat the complainant community producer could use antidumping measures to reinforce its position and possibly dominate supply and price developments it was found however that duties would not result in significant reduction of competition or shortage of supply imports from china were expected to remain available at competitive prices as the duties were below the levels of undercutting found furthermore alternative sources of supply from third count ries were available in addition it was also expected that the community industry would increase its production and sales as there would thus still be sufficient number of major competitors on the market users and consumers would continue to have the choice of different suppliers the shortage of supply that appeared after the imposition of provisional measurest was found to be due to temporary circumstances such as technical and management problems both in the community and in china which were unlikely to persist if on the other hand measures were imposed it was considered that the future of the sole community producer would be at sta ke and its disappearance would effectively reduce competition on the community market for these rea sons it was concluded that measures would not have decisive impact on users and that there were compelling reasons not to impose measures in glyphosate it was alleged that two community pr oducers operated cartel however since sufficient evidence in this respect was pr ovided and antitrust proceeding had been initiated this argument was rejected in graphite electrode systems the community producers had been involved in cartel and were fined by the commission several yea rs before the ip since the anticompetitive behaviour had been terminated it was considered that the comm unity industry should not be deprived of its right to obtain relief against unfair trade practices 33 the global appreciation of the different interests as whole the community interest test requires global appreciation of different often contradictory interests after the eff ect of imposing antidumping measures or alternatively maintaining the status quo has been established for each group of interested parties the different interests ve to be weighed against each other negative consequences for one group of economic operators might be outweighed by positive consequences for other parties and vice versa in this global appreciation the degree of participation of group of economic operators and the quality of the data provided plays an important role this evaluation cannot be mathematical quantitative comparison according to standard parameters but has to be performed on case bycase basis it is basically an expression of the principle of proportionality whereby measures would not be in the community interest if disadvantages to one group of economic operators would clearly be disproportionate to the advantages enjoyed by another one whether this is the case will depend on number of varying factors which need to be balanced against each other in prospective assessment these factors are of ten interlinked and may carry different weight depending on the circumstances of the case therefore it would not be appropriate nor feasible to define general criteria and thresholds for instance above or below which there would be presumption that any impact on users would be minimal 20 4 conclusion the community interest test is an importa nt aspect of antidumping and antisubsidy investigations it requires an assessment of whether there are compelling reasons for concluding that in spite of finding of dumping and resulting injury the imposition of measures would not be in the global interest of the community this may be the case if the negative economic impact which measures would be likely to have on one category of economic operators is disproportionate to any benefits for other groups of interested parties the diversity and interlinkage of the intere sts involved and factors to be taken into account make it impossible to reduce the pr oportionality analysis to set of fixed thresholds or predetermined rules howe ver over the years the institutions have developed clear practice reflected in the above examples which gives guidance on how the community interest test is interpreted and applied 21annex list of cases bed linen council regulation ec n 3972004 of 2 march 2004 imposing definitive antidumping duty on imports of cottontype be d
