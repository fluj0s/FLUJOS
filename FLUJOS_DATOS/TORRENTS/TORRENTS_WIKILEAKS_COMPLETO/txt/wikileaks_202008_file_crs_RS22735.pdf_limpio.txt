insurance for civilian workers individual employers may devote hi gher or lower share or nothing at all contributions also vary by broad industry group for example in june 2007 spending by state and local governments on health insurance was 110 of total compensation while the share for private industry was 714 differences in employer spending may be explained by differences in health insurance coverage rates differences in the generosity of benefits and differences in the other components of compensation the 2007 share for civilian workers is high compared with the late 1990s when employer contributions for health insurance accounted for less than 6 of compensation as shown in figure 2 over the 19992007 period the share of spending for health insurance grew steadily from 58 in 1999 to 79 in 2007 previous upward trend occurred between 1991 and 1994 when spending grew from 61 of compensation to peak of 70 coinciding in time with president clintons health reform effort between 1994 and 1998 spending fell from 70 of compensation to 58 in part because of growth in managed care plans that had some success in controlling health care costs figur 2 health insurance as p ercentage of t
