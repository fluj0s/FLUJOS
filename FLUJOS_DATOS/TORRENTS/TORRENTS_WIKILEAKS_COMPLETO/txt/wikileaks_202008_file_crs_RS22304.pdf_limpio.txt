consists of 19 million acres in northeast alaska it is administered by the fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior doi its 15millionacre co astal plain is viewed as one of the most promising us onshore oil and gas prospects according to the us geological survey the mean estimate of technica lly recoverable oil is 77 b illion barrels billion bbl and there is small chance that taken together the fields on this federal land could hold 109 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil at 50bbl in 2005 dollars that amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22304crs2 1 basic information on

west of anwr now estimated to have held almost 14 billion bbl of ec onomically recoverable oil the refuge especially the nearly undistur bed coastal plain also is home to wide variety of plants and animals the presence of caribou polar bears grizzly bears wolves migratory birds and other species in this facto wilderness has led some to call the area americas serengeti the refuge and tw neighboring parks in canada have been proposed for an international park and several species found in the area including polar bears caribou migratory birds and whales are protected by inte rnational treaties or agreements the conflict between high oil potential and nearly pristine nature in the refuge creates dilemma should congress open the ar ea for energy development or should the areas ecosystem continue to be protecte d from development perhaps permanently what factors should determine whether to ope n the area if the area is opened to what extent can damages be avoided minimized or mitigated to what extent should congress legislate special management of the area if it is developed and to what extent should federal agencies be allowed to manage the area under existing law1 legislative history of the refuge the energy and biological resources of nor thern alaska have b een controversial for decades from legislation in the 1970s to 1989 oil spill to more recent efforts to use anwr resources to address energy needs or to help balance the federal budget in november 1957 an application for the withdr awal of lands in northeastern alaska to create an arctic national wildlife range wa s filed the first group actually to propose to congress that the area become national wildlife range in recognition of the many game species found in the area was the tana na valley alaska s portsmens association in 1959 on december 6 1960 after statehood secr etary of the interior fred seaton issued public land order 2214 reserving th area as the arctic national wildlife range in 1971 congress enacted the alaska nativ claims settlement act ancsa pl 92203 to resolve all native aboriginal land claims against the united states ancsa provided for monetary payments and created village corporations that received the surface estate to roughly 22 million acres of lands in alaska village corporations obtained the right to select the surface estate in certain amount of lands

reconciliation is an optional twostep process congress may use to make changes to existing law related to mandatory spending revenues or the debt limit3 first congress includes reconc iliation directives in budget re solution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or co mbination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution second each instructed committee develops legislative recommendations to meet its reconciliation directives and reports its legislative recommendations to its respective chamber directly or transmits such r ecommendations to its respective budget committee section 310b of the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 specifies two options for th submission of legislative recommendations to comply with reconciliation directives 1 if one committee is instructed the committee reports its legislative recommendations to its parent chamber directly or 2 if two or more committees are instructed the committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committ ee in the latter case the legislative language recommended by committees is p ackaged without any substantive revisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22304crs4 4 the latter two reconciliation directives involve the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee only the committees were instructed to report their tax cut reconciliation legislation by september 23 and thei r statutory debt limit reconciliation legislation by september 30 with the delay in the consideration of the omnibus spending reconciliation measure by the house and senate budget committees the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have also delayed their reporting of these reconciliation measures 5 most committees are instructed to reduce di rect spending over fiveyear period fy2006 fy2010 but two committees the house education and the workforce committee and the senate health education labor and pensions committee are instructed to reduce direct spending over the six year period fy2005fy2010 6 see steven t dennis

april 28 2005 the c onference report on the fy2006 budget resolution provides for three budg et reconciliation measures 1 to cut direct or mandatory spending by about 35 billion 2 to cut taxes by 70 billion and 3 to increase the statut ory debt limit by 781 billion4 the spending reconciliation directives instruct eight committees from each chamber to recommend by september 16 changes to existing laws to reduce direct spending by varying amounts totaling approximately 35 billion over sixyear period fy2005fy20105 in particular as it might relate to anwr the spending reconciliation directives

legislation committees reconciliation directives indicate budgetary am ounts that must be achieved by fiscalyear time periods they do not specify any particular policy changes8 the house resources committee and the senate energy and natural resources committee may recommend changes to any existing law under their jurisdictions whic h include matters re lated to anwr on october 19 2005 the senate ergy and natural resources committee voted to transmit legislative recommendations to open anwr to development in order to meet its reconciliation targets in ddition some representatives re portedly have indicated that the house resources committee might include provisions opening anwr to development in order to meet its reconciliation targets as well9 the congressional budget office cbo has projected that opening anwr to development will result in net federal proceeds of about 25 billion over fiveyear period10 such proceeds are classified as offsetting recei pts and are deducted from spendi ng the receipts therefore are counted as spending reductions rather than as revenue increases11 accordingly legislation increasing offsetting receipts by opening anwr to development would enable the two committees to satisfy their reconciliation directives to reduce direct spending majority vote is required in each committee to transmit its reconciliation recommendations to its respective budget committee as described above the budget committee in each chamber packages th instructed committees legislative recommendations into an omnibus reconciliation measure in both chambers the congressional budget act of 1974 as ame nded prohibits the budget committees from making any substantive revisions to the committees recommendations12 any substantive changes to the recommendations by the house resources committee or the senate energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22304crs6 13 house rule xvi clause 7 and section 310d1 of the budget act respectively whether or not an amendment to reconciliation measure violates the house standing rules or the budget act would depend on ruling of the presidin g officer with the advice of the house parliamentarian under section 312 of the budget act any points of order under the budget act relating to budgetary amounts however must be determined on the basis of estimates made by the house budget committee hbc generally th estimates used by the hbc are based on the cost estimates prepared by the congressional budget office cbo but the hbc has the authority to make its own estimates which may vary from the cbo estimates 14 like many senate rules these requirements are enforced by points of order points of order are not selfenforcing senator must raise point of order in order to prevent the consideration of legislation that violates the rulesand natural resources committee therefore would have to occur on the floor of each chamber or possibly in conference house floor consideration the house usually has considered budget reconciliation measures under special rule reported by the house rules committee and agreed to by the full house the special rule specifies the terms under which the reconciliation measure will be considered in the past the special rule providing for the consideration of reconciliation measures has limited the amendment process allowing the consideration of very few floor amendments except for limited number of leadership amendments the special rule for the consideration of the 2005 reconciliati on measure could make in order an amendment proposing to change the provisions recommended by the house resources committee unless the special rule waives certain points of order such an amendment must comply with the house standing rules and the budget act in particular an amendment must be germane to the reconciliation measure and must not have the effect of increasing the deficit13 in addition the special rule for the consideration of the reconciliation bill likely will allow motion to recommit with instructions because house rule x iii clause 6c2 prohibits special rule from preventing the motion on such bill the instructions however must comply with the house standing rules and the budget act as they apply to proposed floor amendments unless those rules are waived by the special rule senate floor consideration as noted above in th senate debate on budget reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours thereby precludi ng extended debate on the measure the budget act also places othe r restrictions on the consideration of the reconciliation measure on the senate floor three requirements are particularly relevant 1 floor amendments must be germane 2 floor amendments must not cause an increase in the deficit and 3 provisions contained in the measure and in floor amendments must not be extraneous under the byrd rule secti on 313b1d of the budget act each of these requirements might have an effect on the inclusion of anwr provisions in the reconciliation measure14
