similar to that passed in the in the 110th congress hr 976 and hr 3162 although the initial house proposal had smaller tax increases hr 2 increases cigarette taxes the primary source of tobacco tax revenues from 39 cents to 100 according to the joint committee on taxation the cigarette tax will raise 64 billion in federal revenues in fy 2010 with all federal tobacco taxes increases raising 71 billion similar tax increase is contained in the senate finance committee mark the analysis suggests that state and local governments will lose about 1 billion in cigarette tax revenues and up to 05 billion in lost revenues from the tobacco settlement payments the legislation is now being considered in the senate justiﬁcation is to discourage teenage smoking but this eﬀect is probably small reservation is that the burden falls heavily on lowincome individuals taxes on other tobacco products are also increased although cigarette taxes account for most tobacco revenues in the 110th congress the president vetoed the 110th congress schip proposal on october 3 2008 the house failed to override the veto and new bill hr 3963 passed the house and senate with changes in the cigarette

this report describes current taxes discusses potential revenue gains and discusses some of the basic issues surrounding tax increase it also briefly discusses the tax increase on cigars hr 2 passed the house on january 14 2009 and it included the same cigarette tax as proposed in the 110th congress an increase of 61 cents per pack raising the tax from 39 cents to 1 the estimated revenues in the house bill were 647 billion for fy2009fy2018 with 573 billion of the to tal from cigarettes the senate finance committee mark includes taxes similar to hr 2 very slightly higher across the board with 6166 cents increase in cigarette taxes g22g138g161g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 the vast majority of tobacco taxes are on cigarettes which account for 94 of tobacco sales totaling 75 billion in 2007 1 federal cigarette taxes are 039 per pack accounting for 94 of federal tobacco tax revenue there is 4 cent tax on package of small cigars large cigars carry tax of 20719 of sales price not to exceed 4875 per 1000 units leading to maximum tax of almost 5 cents per cigar per ounce the tax is 7 cents on pipe tobacco 1 cent on chewing tobacco 4 cents on snuff and 7 cents on pipe and rollyourown tobacco there are also taxes on cigarette paper and cigarette tubes the 61cent cigarette tax increase would lead to tax about 25 times the current tax these same proportions are proposed for snuff chewing to bacco and pipe tobacco roll your own tobaccos tax increases about eight fold and seven fold and the relatively small taxes on small cigars are increased to those on cigarettes large cigars are the only tobacco product with tax based on price but they also have cap the pricebased tax rises in proportionally but the cap increases by much more from 5 cents per cigar to 040 in the house bill 04026 in the senate finance committee mark tobacco tax receipts in the united states in fy2007 included 75 billion in federal tax 162 billion in state and local taxes and 8 billion in payments from the master tobacco settlement 2 state and local taxes therefore were roughly 88 cents per pack and the tobacco settlement payment is approximately the same as the federal tax 43 cents per pack although the tobacco settlement payments resulted from negotiations be tween the tobacco companies and the states to settle state lawsuits the payments function as if they were national tobacco excise tax that is allocated to the states and any changes that alter consumption would affect these payments some of the states have securitized their payments exchanged the stream of payment for fixed upfront amount according to estimates about quarter of payments are made to private investors rather than to state and

local and tobacco settlement payments are respectively 100 216 and 107 for total of 422 the joint committee on taxation projected an fy2010 revenue gain of 64 billion from the 61 cent increase crs

for funding the child health program are tobacco taxes the most desirable source of revenue compared to other taxes the incentive effects may be desirable at the same time the burden falls heavily on lower income people which may be of concern thus there is tradeoff between the objective of discouraging smoking and particularly discouraging youth smoking and the distributional effects of the tax the remaining issue involves an economic efficiency question relating to arguments that have been made that additional taxes are appropriate to cover costs smokers impose on others number of economic studies have questioned that proposition the following sections discuss these issues g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g151g561g21g150g152g148g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g10g142g138g149g157g145g561 large body of literature has suggested that increases in the price of tobacco reduce smoking however this response is not very large in economists parlance the response is relatively inelastic most of the evidence has found the price elasticity to be between 03 and 05 in absolute value meaning that 10 increase in price would cause 3 to 5 decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked 5 for older adult smokers about half of this effect was due to fewer continued states have securitized their tobacco settlement payments data on state tobacco payments are from government accountability office tobacco settlement states allocation of fy2005 and expected fy2006 payments gao06 502 april 2006 4 joint committee on taxation jcx0409 january 14 2009 to explain revenue effects consider the effects in the same year 2007 as the data reported in this analysis note initially that the revenue gain of 64 billion reported for the cigarette tax in the first full years fy2010 appears low since 61 cent increase is 156 times the current tax of 39 cents per pack and would appear to raise around 117 billi on 156 times 75 billion the revenue gain is reduced by the consumers quantity response generally an elasticity percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price of around 04 so 10 increase in price will reduce quantity consumed by 4 in the example considered here given the tax as share of price the price increase would be 156 156 times 75 billion divided by sales of 75 billion and the quantity consumed would fall by 625 04 times 156 that reduction in quantity is applied to both the old 75 billion and the new 117 billion yielding fall in revenues of approximately 12 billion and net gain of 105 billion the number should also be multiplied by 094 to eliminate the tax levied on other tob acco products and by 075 to account for the effect of excise taxes on corporate income taxes the net yield is projected at 102 billion times 094 times 075 or 75 billion this number is much closer to the jct number their smaller number probably reflects in part the expected decline in smoking over the three years from fy2007 to fy2010 and could presumably also reflect larger behavioral response the behavioral response from federal tax increase would reduce state and local taxes absent other changesby 625 therefore state and local revenues of 162 billion would fall by 1 billion and tobacco settlement payments of 8 billion would fall by 05 billion for total of almost 15 billion 5 for review of the literature on price elasticities for cigarettes see crs report 94214

participation response and about half due reduction in smoking quantity response for younger smokers the participation response was more important there is some evidence that the response declines with age and that it rises with income and that it is higher for women africanamericans and hispanics6 recent study however found variation with income7 some recent studies suggest that the response may be less or that the benefits of reducing smoking may be less there is some evidence that the response has been declining an unsurprising outcome since given decline in smoking the remaining smokers are more resistant to price signals in addition there is evidence that elasticities might be overstated in studies that compare state smoking levels because states with higher taxes may also have populations more hostile to smoking8 also recent studies found that smokers may respond to price increases by increasing the intensity of smoking by buying cigarettes with more nicotine and tar inhaling more deeply and smoking closer to the filter which could have deleterious effects since more intensive smoking can be more harmful9 due to the limited effects on adult smoking some arguments have been made that the increased taxes on adults are necessary over the interim to discourage teenage smoking evidence has suggested that teenage smoking is more responsive to price the original responses were estimated at elasticities over one but subsequent analysis led to an estimate of around 07 and number of recent studies have confirmed this general range 10 other studies have found smaller responses11 or very small response by younger teenagers12 one recent study replicated the 07 elasticity continued out of print and available from the author for review see also badi h baltagi

consider superior they found essentially response of the initiation of smoking to price13 another paper found weak and insignificant effect after controlling for antismoking sentiment14 while much evidence suggests that teenagers are more responsive to prices these recent studies raise some questions about the effectiveness of tax increases on teenage smoking especially among young teenagers the evidence on smoking indicates that higher prices will decrease smoking participation and quantity it is possible however that other types of interventions such as stricter regulations on sales to teenagers counseling education and assistance with smoking cessation might be more effective g6g146g156g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 it is generally recognized that cigarette taxes are one of the most regressive taxes that is tax that falls more heavily on lower income individuals as percentage of income indeed it is probably the most regressive of the federal taxes smokers tend to smoke fixed amount of cigarettes so that they pay fixed amount of tax since the tax is fixed amount per pack lower income individuals who buy cheaper brands still pay the same amount of tax in addition smoking is more prevalent among lower income individuals to illustrate in 1998 the joint committee on taxation estimated that 76 cent tax increase brought about through proposed federal tobacco settlement would raise the effective tax rate on average by 03 of income but would incr ease the burden of those with incomes below 10000 by 2 of income and the burden of those in the 1000020000 income by 06 of income 15 since this rate applies to all families those families with smokers would pay more for example family with one smoker who smokes 15 packs day would pay with 76 cent tax an additional 417 in taxes which is 42 of 10000 income and 84 of 5000 income to the extent the burden of the tax falls on lowincome families and the individuals in those families continue to smoke lowincome children in some families could be harmed even though the child health care provision helps lowincome children in general

because they impose costs on others largely through higher health care costs paid for through government and private insurance plans lost days at work and some other costs some economists have questioned this argument however because smokers premature deaths while harmful to smokers and their families reduce costs of certain government programs such as 13 philip decicca donald kenkel and

account for more subjective effects such as irritation to others although such problems might be better addressed through private market mechanisms provision of smoking and nonsmoking commercial establishments and regulation some disputes about the magnitude of environmental tobacco smoke remain if smokers are not imposing costs on others or imposing costs that are less than existing taxes and if they are making rational decisions to engage in an activity which while damaging to their health is nevertheless pleasurable then an additional tax would not increase economic efficiency it is not clear however whether young smokers where smoking is generally initiated are able to fully assess the costs of smoking g5g146g144g138g155g561g22g138g161g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g156g561 although taxes on other products are small part of total tobacco taxes there has been some controversy about the increases for cigars in 110 th congress proposals and their potential disruption of the industry as reported in the media17 small cigar taxes increase by factor of 27 they are apparently viewed by some as substitute for cigarettes who argue they should bear the same tax small cigars constitute less than 110 of 1 of cigarette sales for large cigar taxes which are currently maximum of 5 cents the tax could rise to as much as 10 in the original senate finance committee proposal in the 110 th congress the ceiling was lowered to 3 on the senate floor in the 2007 legislation and the ceiling in the house bill was 1 in 2007 hr 2 has ceiling of 040 which although much lower is eight times the previous maximum according to tax data large cigar sales above the current 5 cents cap premium cigars account for about half the total according to the cigar association of america the average manufacturers price is about 190 for these premium cigars the average tax on these cigars would be almost dollar 05313 times 190 minus 05 in the original 110th congress senate proposal but much smaller in the house bill because of lower rate and cap and smaller in the final proposal most state cigar taxes are based on value and would apply to the federal tax they are estimated by the cigar association of america at about 30 if retail prices are twice the manufacturers price the price of large cigars under the cap in the original senate proposal would have risen by 208 and the price of large cigars over the cap while varying considerably would have averaged 33 increase prices would rise more if there is also retailers markup on the tax the ceiling of 040 would result in much more modest effects there is less information on the effects of other tobacco products on health or the behavioral response if the purpose of the tax on cigars is to account for health costs per unit rather than price based tax would seem appropriate cigars may differ from cigarettes in that larger share may be likely to be smoked only occasionally and would therefore be less harmful to health they may also be less concentrated at lower incomes the occasional usage lack of addictiveness may mean larger price response but the usage by higher income consumers may mean smaller response
