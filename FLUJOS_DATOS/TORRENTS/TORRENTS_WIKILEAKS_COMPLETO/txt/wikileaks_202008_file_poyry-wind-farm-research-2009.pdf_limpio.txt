electricity markets are expected to undergo radical transition to renewable and other low carbon forms of generation within the next twenty years with the eus proposed 2020 renewable targets setting milestone on the path to substantially decarbonised electricity sector if achieved this transition has the potential to revolutionise established business processes across all timescales from infrastructure planning investment price formation and the realtime dispatch of generation to meet demand our view is that if the renewables and decarbonisation challenges are to be met the consequent level of uncertainty over market outcomes is greater than at any time since liberalisation of the electricity industry began given this background the overall objective of this project is to answer the question how could the impact of intermittent generation required to meet targets for renewables and decarbonisation of generation affect the wholesale energy markets in gb and ireland existing electricity markets electricity markets currently operate according to predictandprovide principles in the short term with generation investment based on forward market price and revenue expectations in the longer term demand is generally treated as uncontrollable and conventional generation through combination of withinday variation in market prices and ultimately system operator dispatch and ancillary services is actively managed to meet demand with secondbysecond resolution impact of renewable and decarbonisation targets there is consensus across europe and worldwide that climate change is an urgent problem and that the electricity sector is key part of reducing carbon emissions milestones have been set for the period to 2020 but the continued drive for decarbonisation of the economy will lead to pressure for further renewable and other low carbon generation beyond that time addressing this challenge will introduce large quantity of generation with technologies which in large quantities have the potential to disturb both shortterm operation and pricing and longerterm investment decisions in ways which hitherto have not been well understood the eus proposed renewable targets for 2020 imply very significant deployment of renewable generation in the next 11 years with target of 15 of final energy use sourced from renewables for the uk and 16 for the republic of ireland this could mean that over 30 of electricity generation will have to be met by renewable energy in the uk and perhaps 40 in ireland to meet such challenging targets it is possible that up to 35gw of wind will be required on the gb system by 2020 33 of total installed capacity and 6gw in ireland 43 of total capacity wind generation and other renewable and low carbon generation technologies to varying degrees have number of attributes which m ean that significant levels of capacity may perturb the operation of electricity markets implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 2 pöyry energy consulting wind generation has very low or negative short term operating cost and is therefore commercially inflexible so the conventional plant will have to follow the residual load as the output of wind generation is intermittent conventional generation has to be available and scheduled at times when there is little wind generation and dispatched off when there is lot of wind leaving significant capacity overhang and wind generation is unpredictable until close to real time causing the need for additional system reserve to be held within europe these issues are most critical for places such as the gb and irish markets which are lightly interconnected with little hydro capacity natural balance to wind generation and which enjoy significant wind resource it is not just the renewables targets that are changing the shape of the electricity market moving the system to low carbon base means that nuclear biomass and ccs coal generation may also be built in large quantities based on our current understanding their preferred mode of operation will be baseload with much lower flexibility than current thermal plant together these factors have the potential to radically alter the existing wholesale electricity market across all timescales sy stem with very large amounts of intermittent generation requires lots of flexible pricesensitive generation to provide backup however much of the generation that is likely to be built will be nuclear ccs and biomass all of which are designed and financed to function at baseload continuous operation and are expected to provide only limited flexibility for commercial as well as technical reasons in tandem the load factors and investment economics for more flexible conventional generation are expected to be adversely affected by the wind and other lowcarbon generation which is likely to make load following and provision of reserve more significant cost component of electricity market and system operation basis for the study to examine these profound shifts that may occur in the electricity market the overall objective of the work was to develop much more realistic outputs for the portfolio of wind farms in gb and the island of ireland evaluate the likely thermal plant operating regimes understand the impact on market prices examine the investment outlook for new plant and assess how robust market rules are to these changes this report examines in detail the economic and dynamic challenges in introducing large amounts of wind by 2030 in both gb and the irish markets it draws on real data from operating onshore and offshore wind farms and is the product of major modelling exercise to examine market fundamentals the backbone to answering the main question is sophisticated computer modelling tool zephyr backed by wealth of historical data on hourly wind demand and generator availability which has allowed simulation of different scenarios of the gb and irish market the zephyr model has been designed specifically to allow detailed examination of the electricity markets as it examines hourly ectricity prices 365 x 24 hours per year for implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 3 pöyry energy consulting series of 8 minimonte carlo simulations which simulate differing patterns of demand wind and plant availability thus to examine single year total of 70080 hourly prices are generated which captures large part of the variation that could be expected to ensure consistent set of input data for wind generation pöyry has used hourly observations from 36 sites across the uk and roi for the period 2000 2007 pöyry has worked with the uk met office to ensure that these sites offer an accurate representation of future wind generation in the uk for offshore sites the met office provided reanalysis data derived from wave model which has allowed consistent wind data to be obtained for offshore sites such as dogger bank the wash and the irish sea in total pöyry has used 24 million hourly wind speed records to generate comprehensive view of future wind generation in the uk and roi this allows simulation of any possible future deployment of wind turbines across the uk and ireland whether they are offshore onshore in scotland or further south this work builds on previous studies including research from uk erc and studies commissioned by berr now decc for the renew able energy strategy consultation we are grateful for the support of many st akeholders in the energy industries including the two system operators several ma jor utilities and government bodies who have provided significant support in terms of data interpretation and modelling methodology in particular for wind output and reserve and response requirements this collaborative approach has delivered degree of credibility which we believe is unparalleled the results of the study represent the views of pöyry and are not necessarily representative of the views of individual members or founders of this study scenarios the study has explored one core scenario in detail and further nine cases to examine range of possible outcomes and areas of interest the core scenario does not represent central or definitive base case for the future instead it represents reasonable starting case to explore the world in which current british and irish government policy with respect to renewables and co 2 emissions over the timeframe 20092030 is implemented in full for the core scenario we have created an alternative system operator dispatch case in which we have applied additional constraints on system dispatch including reserve and frequency response constraints and separately north south transmission constraints within both gb and sem the core scenario is world where there is drive towards renewables and lower carbon forms of generation energy efficiency measures have some impact leading to electricity demand growing at relatively low rate less than 05 per year in gb and under 1 in the sem despite some further electrification of transport and heating the price of oil is 70bbl with carbon prices at 37tco 2 in gb the core scenario assumes that wind capacity rises to 33gw in 2020 and 43gw in 2030 with gw of tidal additionally there is 16gw of new nuclear built by 2020 rising to 96gw by 2030 this is counteracted by clos ures of existing nuclear plant so that by 2030 107gw of nuclear is on the system 32gw of coal ccs is assumed to be built by 2030 in total furthermore we assume strong growth in biomass fired plant with total of 44gw being installed by 2030 in the sem there is similarly fast growth in installed wind capacity from 12gw in 2010 to 61gw by 2020 and 79gw by 2030 in this scenario wind rises to higher penetration of the sem than the gb market there is small growth in ccgt capacity implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 4 pöyry energy consulting peaking generation does not grow signi ficantly although the amount of peaking generation is much greater in the sem than in gb with the very significant volumes of renewable generation in the core scenario it is unsurprising that carbon emissions drop in both markets in gb emissions drop from 170mtco 2 in 2010 to 50mtco 2 in 2030 drop of twothirds this leads to an emissions intensity the amount of co 2 emitted per unit of generation falling from 460gco 2kwh down to 130gco2kwh by 2030 in the sem emissions drop from 20mtco 2 in 2010 to 8mtco 2 by 2030 slightly less than twothirds drop in the sem emissions intensity starts from higher base than gb at almost 500gco 2kwh owing to coal and peat plant however by 2030 this has fallen to 177gc0 2kwh the further nine cases explore other possi ble outcomes cap payment implements capacity payment in the gb market lower res which examines lower renewables target carbon drop where the carbon price is reduced ied examines the implications from strict implementation of the industr ial emissions directive offshore deployment increases offshore wind deployment severn ba rrage examines the implications of 10gw tidal generation interconnection where less interconnection between gb and the sem is assumed and two demand management scenarios which investigate the implications of demand management conclusions and findings world with significant intermittent generation is longer world of averages our analysis clearly shows that in system with significant volumes of intermittent generation extremes become increasingly important rather than average conditions indeed an average day becomes meaningless concept when wind generation could be contributing all of generation or nothing extreme days or hours become much more normal as price spikes significant changes in generation patterns or indeed significant overcapacity occur much more frequently periods of very low wind generation less than 5 of installed capacity across either gb or ireland will not be uncommon and may last up to few days equally periods with very high wind generation and low demand will exist since the correlation of wind between two points decreases the further they are away from each other low periods of wind at one location can often be offset by high wind speeds elsewhere at distance of about 200km apart roughly london to birmingham there is correlation r2 of around 065 between wind farms whilst by 900km apart approx london to aberdeen the correlation drops to 02 low correlation there is some correlation r2 of 044 between wind in the sem and in gb both do experience periods when average wind speeds or wind generation is either very high or very low together in our base scenarios there are periods when wind generation in gb is high over 90 of capacity and at the same time low below 10 of capacity in the sem although wind speeds on average do increase during daytime peak hours and are higher in winter than in summer this is typically masked by very significant variation of generation around the averages figure 1 illustrates the contribution of wind generation in the three pe ak demand hours across our eight monte carlo years the variation is striking ranging from 1 48 in gb and between 3 82 in sem these figures illustrate that wind will not necessarily be present when the system is facing highest implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 5 pöyry energy consulting demand and suggest that the validity of simple capacity credit assumptions is limited as wind penetration increases to significant levels figure 1 percentage of three peak demand hours met by wind generation 0102030405060708090100 of peak demand met by wind sem gb there is some variation in annual wind generation between our eight monte carlo years 20002007 for 2020 with an assumption of 33gw of wind capacity in gb there is annual generation of between 83twh and 93twh in our eight monte carlo years variation of 12 in the sem higher annual variation of 21 is found in 2020 with 61gw of capacity due to the smaller size of the market in generation terms this is between 146twh and 177twh with high volumes of wind generation risk in the market increases we have not created benchmark of risk but we find that market prices could jump between 40mwh and 1000mwh in short period of time this may be characterised as both price risk and also for nonbaseload plant as volume risk this combination of risk is particularly difficult for generators to hedge except within portfolio of generation which includes wind wind generation is highly variable and will change the profile of demand supplied by thermal plant the demand which must be met by nonwind capacity termed demand net wind will be much more variable than the current demand profile the duration curves for demand and demand net wind are shown in figure 2 in gb in 2030 in our core scenario demand varies between 30 70gw howe ver demand net wind varies between 0 65gw in the sem there is similar relationship the range of hourly demand across the year is 5gw but the range of demand net wind is 11gw implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 6 pöyry energy consulting figure 2 demand duration curves for gb and sem in 2030 gb s em installed capacity and demand from core scenario additionally the potential ramping required by the thermal system will increase the ramping houronhour change for demand net wind is greater than that for demand and as the installed capacity of wind increases the ramping will increase in 2020 the maximum hourly change that nonintermittent generation is found to face is 13gw up compared to only 11gw with wind by 2030 this has increased to 15gw up thus 15gw of generation has to be brought on line for single hour in the worst case scenario covered in our analysis in the sem hourly ramping of demand net wind increases from 21gw in 2020 to 26gw in 2030 compared to 11gw with demand only price volatility and price spikes may increase annual average prices will become increasingly driven by wind figure 3 shows how annual price s vary by monte carlo historical year for the gb and sem for gb in 2010 there is spread of about 5mwh between the simulations but by 2030 this has increased to almost 20mwh the spread in the sem is much smaller than in the gb market with range of 15mwh 164mwh in 2010 rising to 64mwh by 2030 5000500015000250003500045000550006500075000 0 20 40 60 80 100mwdemand demand net wind 4000200002000400060008000 0 20 40 60 80 100mwdemand demandnetwind

much more peaky increased periods with very high or very low prices this is because the system will alternate between having too much capacity in periods with high wind speeds and high wind generation and much tighter capacity when there are low wind speeds equally the market design in gb means that some very high prices would be required if new generation is to recover its fixed or investment costs by 2030 with significant volumes of wind on the system t he distribution of prices will change with periods of negative prices due to the wind generation bidding at its opportunity cost of 1 roc periods with low or zero prices and some periods with very high prices above 1000mwh even this does not fully remunerate newbuild peaking generators which are required by 2030 to maintain existing levels of security as shown in figure 4 price volatility increases sharply in all scenarios from 2010 onwards under the core scenario we find sharp jump in price volatility in 2016 as the system becomes tighter with retiral of plant under the lcpd volatility then drops but rises even higher by 2030 as result of price volatility due to wind generation and higher overall prices due to new entry in the ied scenario volatility is also high in 2020 due to further retirement of plant in 2020 as result of the ied industrial emissions directive the introduction of 10gw severn barrage has the highest volatility of the cases shown implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 8 pöyry energy consulting figure 4 hourly price volatility in gb 0510152025 2006 2007 2008

monthly commodity prices which will result in lower projected volatility compared to historical data as commodit prices chan ge daily note volatility defined as average absolute change in prices as fraction of annual average prices in the sem although prices will become more extreme than currently they will not be as volatile as gb prices because of the sem market rules there will be more low and zero priced periods than in gb due to the higher volumes of wind generation as share of the market though due to our assumed bidding of wind in roi at zero very few negative priced periods the extremes of high prices that gb may experience will be tempered in the sem due to the capacity payment mechanism although gb will maintain strong influence on sem prices periods of zero and negative prices may increase and average prices may fall in gb the core scenario has low priced periods in 2010 but by 2020 there are few periods when prices are zero or negative by 2030 the combination of nuclear ccs biomass and wind would create over 70 periods year on average where prices are less than 30mwh equally the number of periods when prices are between 010mwh increases substantially to 280 about 3 of the year in the sem there are much fewer negative priced periods as wind is modelled to bid at marginal costs assumed in roi to be zero in 2030 there are only 28 periods when prices drop below 30mwh 327mwh there are however many more low priced periods in the sem due to the higher wind penetration and smaller market size thus in 2030 there are over 700 hours when prices are between 0 and 10mwh and over 1000 hours when prices are below 20mwh table 24 shows the number of hours in which prices drop to low levels in selected scenarios split by price bands implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 9 pöyry energy consulting table 1 periods of low prices by band in gb and sem core scenario across all the scenarios and years we find that in gb an increase of 10twh of wind generation around 34gw of wind capacity reduces prices by about 06mwh whilst in the sem given an assumption of 14gw of interconnection an increase of 10twh reduces prices by 7mwh 763mwh an increase of 10twh of wind generation is much greater share in the sem than in gb which explains the greater impact average withinday price profiles remain broadly similar as wind generation increases with the pattern of lower prices overnight and higher prices during the day however the variance around these prices becomes much greater plant operation profiles may change load factors of conventional thermal plant are strongly impacted by high volumes of wind and baseload generation figure 5 and figure 6 reveal the detail in gb by 2020 load factors of older eclass ccgts1 are below 10 and newer fclass plant are under 60 whilst coal is at 50 the main reason for this is the reducing space for these plant to operate in with rising volumes of baseload nuclear ccs coal and biomass plant and increasing volumes of lowcost intermittent generation the running patterns of conventional plant by 2020 are increasingly the inverse of wind generation 1 and fclass ccgts refer specifically to ge manufactured machines but are used within this report to denote older eclass and newer fclass designs count of hours when prices are mwh 30 30 to 20 20 to 10 10 to 0 0 to 10 10 to 20 2010000000

of starts and reducing per iod when they are on the bars in 2010 they typically run with 50 starts and are on for around 70 hours 3 days this will be running 5 days week for some units and less for others by 2020 the number of starts has increased to 90 year with units implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 11 pöyry energy consulting on for only 60 hours by 2030 they start 120 times year and run for about 25 hours however older eclass ccgts have fewer starts in 2010 they typically run twoshift running for around 14 hours when on and starting 140 times year the number of starts then falls as the units are called upon to operate less and less so that by 2020 they are starting only 20 times year and operating 13 hours each time in the sem the change in coal and ccgts is much less even though wind penetration is much greater this is mainly due to the existence of larger amounts of peaking plant the less efficient peaking plant start 810 times year

in wind generation introduces particular concern over the incentives for investment in generation in the gb market which is an energyonly market with payas implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 12 pöyry energy consulting bid pricing investment in this market relies on relationship between tight system margins at times which delivers market prices above generators own shortrun marginal costs our concern is twofold with more wind capacity there is sharp increase in the variability of the system margin which is the basis for the capacity component of price with fewer hours with shortage of capacity but more severe shortages when there is shortfall and under payasbid pricing mechanism generators might find it difficult to capture the full market value of their energy at these rare times of shortage in all our scenarios we assume system security is maintained and sufficient plant is assumed to be built to ensure security margin in the core scenario there is reducing space for thermal generators to operate in which has strong implications for the returns on newbuild returns in gb for new build coal and peaking generation are relatively low around 3 irrs pretax real for conventional coal 6 7 for ccs coal and less than zero for peaking plant returns on ccgts when new build is required are at the lower range of our expectations for new build at around 9 it is notable that nuclear gives the highest return of the plant types shown of between 11 12 this is because it has low marginal cost so it runs at baseload low volume risk and is rarely displaced by wind unlike ccgts as noted above in our core scenario we assume the build of some ocgt capacity in 2030 which is not economic under existing assumptions interpreted strictly the energyonly nature of the gb market means that plants earn revenue only at times when they are operating despite the adjustment applied to the historical inferred capacity value some low merit plants predominantly older ccgts and newbuild ocgts still earn insufficient revenue to justify their existence this leads to 24gw of older ccgts being shut due to their inability to cover fixed costs in 2020 in our core scenario we assume the build of around 1gw of ocgt capacity in 2030 in order to maintain system margins and maintain reasonable range of prices for other plants on the system much of this plant is not economic under strict interpretation of the betta market arrangements as they stand even allowing for the assumed revenue to ocgts arising from ancillary service contracts new ocgts by 2030 are found to operate on average for 34 hours per year delivering an annual shortfall of around 34kw against investment requirements2 for example this implies t hat ancillary service revenue would have to double to cover virtually all of the costs of these plants or that captured energy prices would have to rise by in excess of 10000mwh above those modelled for their 3 4 hours per year of operation in practice these revenues would be very susceptible to yearonyear wind variation the gb and sem markets offer sidebyside comparison of how different market designs can lead to different outcomes in the sem plant returns are markedly different due to the market design and an explicit capacity payment mechanism peaking plant makes reasonable returns in particular the lower efficiency but cheaper designs plant benefit from the high and spiky prices in gb the sem imports high prices from gb however in the sem the payments for capacity provision mean that peaking and low merit plant does make return on investment even if it only generates infrequently although the cases tested do not prove this unambiguously based on our analysis we 2 this assumes annual levelised cost of 77kw assuming 10 pretax real rate of return over 20 years and 29kw annual fixed cost assumed annual revenue from ancillary services of 35kw per year and with an annual net contribution to fixed cost derived from the model results of 8kw implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 13 pöyry energy consulting expect that the existence of capacity mec hanism in sem will lead to better balance of investment to meet the needs of highwind environment than the betta arrangements we conclude that in order for security of supply to be maintained in gb at current levels without significant involvement by the dem and side there would need to be material increase in the capacity value accrued especially by peaking and midmerit generators compared with that in evidence in todays market wind revenue may be depressed due to wind revenue cannibalisation wind revenue cannibalisation describes the phenomenon whereby significant wind generation lowers the revenues achieved by wind farms this phenomenon is termed cannibalisation as wind generation eats into its available revenue stream3 in the core scenario for gb in 2010 the wind capture price is higher than the twa4 price as result of more wind generation in winter months when wholesale prices are higher by 2016 this has reversed with wind capturing 5mwh less than the twa price as increasing volumes of wind generation affect peak prices in particular by 2030 wind captures 13mwh less than market prices significant drop in the sem in the core scenario the effect of wind revenue cannibalisation is similar in 2010 wind earns above the twa price as in gb but by 2020 this has dropped to 5mwh 54mwh below and by 2030 the gap is 12mwh 13mwh it is surprising that the effect in the sem is not greater than in gb as the installed wind capacity is much greater the reason is that the sem is heavily interconnected to gb and gb price spikes and dips have lower correlation to wind generation in ireland the effect varies by differing locations dependent on their correlation to overall wind generation across the market and there is spread of 12mwh between the different locations in gb in 2030 and 10mwh in the sem an approximate relationship can be established between the amount of installed capacity and the discount between the twa price and the capture price of wind generation for gb with 10gw installed wind captures approximately the twa price for every further 1gw installed wind capture prices drop 025mwh below the twa price reserve requirements may increase as may requirements for warming response characteristics vary for differ ent markets depending on their physical size which means that different response requirements are binding for gb and ireland illustrated by figure 8 in gb the binding response requirement is typically secondary low frequency response which covers drop in frequ ency due to plant outage this constraint is binding changing system dispatch decisions for 30 of the time before 2016 with the commissioning of eprs5 the n1 contingency for replacement generation increases to 1600mw which means the constr aint becomes more important binding 70 of the time 3 this phenomenon is neither new nor restricted to wind generation but is symptomatic of the competition between any generators with similar costs it is not able because of the history of wind generators being zeromarginal cost price takers without material influence on the market and their expected transition to being significant driver of price 4 timeweighted average price the simple

for an average 10 wind output forecast error the system operator plans for the worst case rather than the average four hour reserve requirements in gb will rise from 5gw in 2010 to over 10gw by 2030 for january business days to cover possible errors in wind forecasting in the sem the requirement for four hour reserve rises fr om 800mw to almost 1200mw by 2030 in the sem the four hour reserve is largely met from operating plant or peaking plant held in reserve as result very little less responsive plant needs to be kept warm so that it can synchronise within four hours in the core scenario for gb the four hour reserve requirement has to be met in large part from plant that cannot respond when cold in four hour timeframe and would have to be paid to be kept warm the amount of cold plant also rises because load factors of ccgts fall and they are off for longer periods of time due to being displaced by wind existing market arrangements in gb will be put under pressure as noted above the modelling has recorded the returns which generators would earn in order to justify new build our methodology has assumed that sufficient generation capacity will be built in order to maintain existing levels of security of supply and to consider the implications for market pricing in order that this assumption can be realised the key issue is that the existing relationshi p between system margin and the capacity component of wholesale price must change in order that new entry is sufficiently rewarded our modelling assumes that at any given level of system margin the value of capacity is significantly higher than at present although the average levels on timeweighted average basis are similar and assumes that plants operating at the relevant times are able to capture the full capacity value for those hours however these assumptions alone are not sufficient to reward the level of new build peaking generation which is assumed to be required to maintain existing levels of security implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 15 pöyry energy consulting of supply in highwind system with large surplus of installed capacity over system demand the number of periods with narrow capacity margin is far fewer than in conventional system put another way although there are expected to be highdemand periods with very little wind requiring backup capacity these are rare events under continuation of the payasbid energyonly market the capture of capacity revenue in these infrequent periods is expected to be more difficult than in todays market and we anticipate that increased support would be required for peaking and lowmerit generation compared with todays market this could be through variety of means including development of the market to include trading of peaking option contracts increased ancillary service payments or some form of capacity mechanism alternatives might include living with lower level of security of supply or the inclusion of the demand side in the market in meaningful way key conclusion is that in order for security of supply to be maintained at current levels without significant involvement by the dem and side there would need to be material increase in the capacity value accrued by peaking and lowmerit generators compared with that in evidence in todays market it should be noted that this analysis does not lead to firm recommendation for revised market design in gb incorporating capacity payments however it does make stark the differences in outcomes between two different market arrangements and highlights some of the changes which would be required in order to maintain security of supply in gb if the highwind outcomes are to be realised closing remarks this study draws on fundamental modelling proc ess to quantify many of the aspects of intermittency that have largely been the subject of conjecture to date while it is clear that this approach can examine many issues in great detail it is our view that the impact of the intermittency have not been understood up to this point and that significant structural changes will probably have to be made to reach the current targets for renewable generation and decarbonisation of the sector implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 16 pöyry energy consulting this page is intentionally blank implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 17 pöyry energy consulting 1 introduction 11 background there is consensus across europe and worldwide that climate change is an urgent problem and that the electricity sector is key part of reducing carbon emissions milestones have been set for the period to 2020 but the continued drive for decarbonisation of the economy will lead to pressure for further renewable and other low carbon generation beyond that time in the longer term the uks government has committed to policy of 80 reduction in co 2 emissions by 2050 and the committee on climate change has set out pathway to this which includes very significant decarbonisation of generation by 2030 addressing this challenge will introduce large quantity of generation with technologies which in large quantities have the potential to disturb both shortterm operation and pricing and longerterm investment decisions in ways which hitherto have not been well understood the eus proposed renewable targets for 2020 imply very significant deployment of renewable generation in the next 11 years with target of 15 of final energy use sourced from renewables for the uk and 16 for the republic of ireland this could mean that over 30 of electricity generation will have to be met by renewable energy in the uk and perhaps 40 in ireland ireland has adopted renewable electricity target of 40 by 2020 and the uk is in the process of finalising its renewable energy strategy to support the eu renewable energy target our view is that if the renewables and decarbonisation challenges are to be met the consequent level of uncertainty over market outcomes is greater than at any time since liberalisation of the electricity industry began 12 what is intermittency the main new technology built to meet renewables and decarbonisation targets will be wind generation primarily due to its lower cost compared to most renewables and the fact it is known demonstrated technology proposals suggest that up to 35gw of wind could be on line in the gb system by 2020 33 to tal installed capacity and 6gw in ireland 43 of total capacity with the installed capacity by 2030 could be even higher the most obvious aspect of wind is that it does not blow at constant rate over time this creates particular issues for an electricity market and system operation as conventional generation has to be available and scheduled when there is little wind generation and dispatched off when there is lot of wind figure 9 illustrates this effect for the period over christmas 2008 and into new year 2009 we take this period of time and extrapolate t hese weather conditions for ward as if the is 43gw of wind generation installed in gb and 8gw in the sem6 the core scenario in this study in 2030 from about christmas day 2008 wind speeds across the british isles dropped significantly with generation from wind falling to low of 26 of maximum on christmas eve at lunchtime in gb and 22 in the sem on 27 december this period of low winds continued through until the second week in january coinciding with period of very cold weather due to high pressure area which covered most of europe leading to very cold days across much of the continent in the uk schools closed and the fountains 6 single electricity market covering republic of ireland and northern ireland implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 18 pöyry energy consulting in trafalgar square froze by 9 january this area of high pressure moved away leading to three days of much higher wind speeds and wind generation of almost 95 of capacity however once again high pressure area moved in across the british isles leading to two further days of very low wind speeds before wind generation picked up again this example from earlier this year illustrates perfectly t he challenges that significant volumes of wind may pose to the electricity system with periods of high wind generation followed by periods of very low generation rapid changes from high wind speeds to low wind speeds and potentially extended periods with limited generation figure 9 wind generation in gb and

potential to change the shape of the electricity market much of the new generation t hat is likely to deploy in gb in the next 20 years will be fundamentally different to the existing system in three main ways price insensitive most new generation planned for future low carbon world is price insensitive such as nuclear coal ccs and biomass 7 this means that the amount of generation that will vary its generation in response to price andor varying demand will decrease significantly the amount of generation able to flex in response to varying wind generation will reduce significantly 7 although much of this generation may be technically flexible including new nuclear plant it is likely that it will be priced in an inflexible manner and make load following more significant cost implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 19 pöyry energy consulting intermittent8 unavailable when needed wind wave and tidal technologies are all intermittent technologies and exhibit reliability when needed that is significantly lower than conventional plant with significant volumes of wind and marine generation there is much more generation that cannot be guaranteed on the system unpredictable predictability describes the extent to which the generation can be forecast wind and wave generation are both inherently unpredictable and the error in forecast of wind generation increases dramatically as the time interval increases in the same manner as any weather forecast tidal generation on the other hand is extremely predictable we know the time of high tides accurately for the next thousand years or so as shown in figure 10 system that was dominated by price sensitive nonintermittent and predicta ble technologies could be changing to one which is fundamentally different nuclear biomass and ccs coal generation all have economics that rely on continuous baseload operation although these plant may be able to vary their generation in response to demand it is usually not economic to do so additionally wind and marine generation is intermittent and will not necessarily be available when required lastly wind and wave generation are difficult to predict and forecast it is not single one of these attributes that will cause significant issues for the electricity system of the future rather it is the confluence of the three together which has potential to radically alter the existing wholesale electricity market across all timescales from investment in generation and network infrastructure to real time system operation in particular system with very large amounts of wind wave and tidal generation requires lots of flexible pricesensitive generation to provide backup however much of the non wind and marine generation that is likely to be built will be nuclear ccs coal and biomass all of which are designed and financed to function at baseload continuous operation and can provide only limited flexibility there is distinction between commercial and technical flexibility unit may be capable of providing significant flexibility but may choose not to do so due to the underlying economics and market design thus the driver for the intermittency issue is not wind per but the combination of large volumes of unpredictable intermittent generation and large volumes of inflexible generation replacing system that currently is dominated by flexible load following and predictable plant 8 the term intermittency is regarded by some as pejorative term and terms such as variability have been proposed as more accu rate description of wind generation patterns given that intermittency has become the most widely accepted term across the industry pöyry has chosen to use this and regards it as descriptive rather than pejorative it is also observed that all generation types are not wholly reliable even the best new technology might achieve availabilities in the low 90 s and many plant have availabilities at 70 however the availability of wi nd generation is significantly lower than this hence the distinction of intermittent generation implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc

change extend from prices and risk in the wholesale market and what sort of new entry could be expected to fundamental questions about market design these issues are most critical for areas such as the uk and ireland which are lightly interconnected with little hydro capacity natural balance to wind generation and which enjoy significant wind resource other areas of europe will share these concerns but none has the potential to be hit so hard or as immediately as the island of ireland and to lesser extent gb under current policies ireland faces levels of wind generation which are effectively unequalled in europe9 although wind generation in gb is expected to be proportionately less than for ireland the concerns for gb relate to its relative electrical isolation from the larger ucte continental system10 the operation of its market arrangements and the potential development of new nuclear generation which shares some of the inflexible attributes of wind generation it should be noted that difficulties that arise due to intermittency are fundamentally economic in nature none of the issues we highlight are in any way insurmountable or unsolvable but all imply additional costs and changes in the way the system is managed 13 objective of study given the potentially profound shifts that may occur in the electricity market the overall objective of this report is to answer the question 9 denmark has proposed target of 50 wind g eneration by 2025 but this is mitigated by the extent of its interconnection notably with the remainder of the nordel area which has high

how are future flows impacted by wind market arrangements are existing arrangements fit for purpose we have not in this study taken view on whether the 2020 targets for renewables and subsequent plans for decarbonisation of generation are met in the uk or ireland rather the purpose of this study is to explore the consequences for the electricity markets as the generation sector moves increasingly to renewable and other low carbon technologies the backbone to answering the main question is sophisticated computer modelling tool zephyr backed by wealth of historical data on hourly wind demand and generator availability which has allowed simulation of different scenarios of the gb and irish market this model has been designed specifically to allow detailed examination of the electricity markets as it examines hourly electricity prices 365 x 24 hours per year for series of 8 minimonte carlo simulations which simulate differing patterns of demand wind and plant availability these minimonte carlo simula tions use consistent demand availability and wind data for eight historical years ensuring that the highly complex interactions between weather availability and demand are correctly accounted for thus to examine single year total of 70080 hourly prices are generated 8760 hours x 8 monte carlo simulations which capture large part of the variation that could be expected the large part of the study has focused on examining core scenario which has been agreed with the founders of the study it should be noted that the core scenario does not represent central case or best view of the future world nor does it represent the views of either the founders or pöyry on the most likely future scenario rather it represents starting point with simple commodity price assumptions to understand how the future electricity system may evolve series of 9 further cases have been modelled to understand the impact of changing certain assumptions for the core scenario and other key cases we have examined market schedule and system operator dispatch so dispatch the market schedule run derives prices and the operation of plant without transmission and reserveresponse constraints this represents an hour or dayahead market where of interest we run so dispatch simulation11 which accounts for reserve and response constraints as well as northsouth 11 we have only run the so dispatch

work at the commencement of the study there were certain elements that were considered out of the scope of the study which could not be committed to from the outset however many of these could be addressed in further work in the future if required detailed modelling of transmission network linebyline model of the transmission system would require signific antly different modelling framework as result the study uses simplified zonal approach only considering 4 zones england and wales scotland northern ireland and republic of ireland postgate closure issues the study has not examined postgate closure issues including the impact of unforeseen generator failure and the impact of inaccurate demand and wind forecasts and as result has not modelled the balancing mechanism forecasting accuracy the study has not examined the impact of improving forecast accuracy for demand or wind generation the modelling approach assumes provision for reserve to cover forecast error but does not test the effect of forecast error on market prices for example how forward curves would change as data on wind generation improves closer to realtime european supergrid and paneuropean modelling assumptions for interconnector flows between gb and europe have been made based on our pan european modelling work assuming profile of hourly prices in interconnected countries and capacity assumptions for those interconnections however modelling the implications of intermittency on the entire european network is considered to be large undertaking that was outside the scope of the data and the model used 12

of methodology 21 underlying principles the aim of the modelling is to represent as accurately as possible the current and future electricity market in gb and ireland through detailed electricity market model zephyr there are number of key principles that underlie the modelling approach history as basis the relationships between the weather demand for electricity availability of plant and wind speeds are extremely complex and critical to an accurate analysis to ensure that this relationship is correct this study been based on consistent years of historical data for demand plant availability and wind this ensures that for example cold day in january caused by high pressure area north of scotland correctly matches demand driven by temperature and wind and wind speeds low in scotland possibly higher further south minimonte carlo approach to accurately model single year monte carlo approach has been used which uses number of iterations to examine the probability of events happening due to the detail of the zephyr model full monte carlo approach incorporating thousands of iterations is not possible we have chosen to run minimonte carlo with 8 iterations which cover the wind availability and demand from 2000 to 2007 this ensures that the model picks up representative share of for example peak demand coinciding with low or high wind generation fully competitive market and marginal cost bidding all plant are assumed to bid cost reflectively and when operating will fully cover their fuel startup and part loading costs this reflects fully competitive market which leads to leastcost outcome it is also assumed that new thermal plant will make high enough returns over their commercial lifetime to justify their investment and existing plant will cover their fixed costs market schedule and dispatch runs the modelling has been split into two elements first is market schedule run which derives prices and the operation of plant without transmission and reserveresponse constraints where of interest we run dispatch simulation14 which accounts for reserve and response constraints as well as transmission constraints between niroi and ewscotland cost recovery one way or another market forces will lead over time to the recovery of both fixed and variable costs of generation and also where there is persistent need for new capacity the recovery of the capital costs of developing it efficiently15 14 we have only run the so dispatch simulation for the core scenario 15 the principle of capital cost recovery is t applied for all types of capacity our analysis has assumed levels for renewables and nuclear and is not premised on the requirement that these specific types make reasonable return in the market also it is difficult for peaking plant to recover its capital costs in the abs ence of capacity payments mechanism our analysis demonstrates that significant quant ity of peaking plant would be required we have over 1 gw of new peaking plant in the co re scenario in great britain but we have not been explicit as to how this peaking plant would be remunerated in the betta market implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 28 pöyry energy consulting value of capacity the value of capacity that is used in the modelling which represents the scarcity value of capacity has been based on historical profiles this is explained in detail in section 25 22 description of zephyr zephyr is bespoke model that has been devel oped specifically for the intermittency project building on our 15year experience of modelling the european electricity markets the model simulates the dispatch of each unit on the gb and irish systems for each hour of every day total of 8760 hours per year the model is based on mixedinteger linear programming platform this allows us to optimise to find the leastcost dispatch of plant accounting for fuel costs the costs of starting plant and the costs of partloading in aggregate for example it may mean that the model will reduce the output of wind generation to avoid shutting down nuclear plant and incur the cost of restarting it later the model also accounts for minimum stable generation and minimum on and off times which allows more realistic operational simulation of plant such as large coal or nuclear sets that once running must remain on for certain number of hours or once shut down cannot restart for long period for each future year that is modelled 8 iterations are carried out which represent the wind availability and demand for the historical years 2000 2007 this means that for any given future year total of 70080 prices are created 8760 x 8 giving good representation of possible interactions between wind availability and demand the prices that result from the model are the result of the interaction of supply and demand in any given hour the model optimises the use of pumped storage so that it generates when prices are high and pumps when prices are low the model also accounts for interconnection between gb and ireland so that flows between the two countries are optimised interconnection flows between gb and continental europe are modelled with an hourly price profile of the continental countries based on the underlying commodity values and prices from our paneuropean eureca model generation from wind is based on actual hourly wind speeds at 35 locations

model can be classified under the following headings demand and availability wind wave and tidal commodity prices value of capacity plant data and zonal and reserve data the underlying assumptions are explained in the subsequent sections and further detail on the assumptions is included in the appendices 23 demand and availability the hourly profiles of demand have been taken from national grid and eirgrid data for demand from 2000 to 2007 each annual profile is used in separate monte carlo iteration thus peaks and troughs in demand will occur at different times in different iterations for gb demand reported by national grid is based on all generation that is registered as bm unit thus generation and the associated demand that is embedded in the distribution network is not included we have increased the national grid demand figures to account for the profile of embedded generation and hence in zephyr embedded implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 30 pöyry energy consulting generation and its associated demand are both accounted for this means that the scenario construction is insensitive to whether any future growth in generation capacity is

shown in figure 15 and were chosen to represent sit where there is likely to be significant wind turbine deployment in the next 20 years based on known applications and licensing areas determined by the government we have obtained 8 years of data from 2000 to 2007 for all these sites based on wind speed measurements from meteor ological masts with missing data in filled by the met office for offshore sites the met office provided reanalysis data derived from wave model which has allowed consistent wind data to be obtained for offshore sites such as dogger bank the wash and the irish sea

carbon trust variability of uk marine resources17 25 market prices value of ca pacity and capacity payments this section provides an overview of how we have implemented value of capacity in modelling which is key to understanding how wholesale prices may develop into the future in functioning electricity market wholesale prices need to cover two elements variable costs largely for fuel and carbon incurred by generation sets in the production of electricity and in particular the variable costs of the most expensive set operating at any point in time with allowance for unit inflexibility partloading and the costs of starting generators referred to as the system marginal price smp and fixed yearonyear costs of keeping sufficient plant open to ensure that demand is met in peak periods or in circumstances in which there is an impending shortage of capacity the cost of bringing forward new entry this is discussed further below we term the additional revenue required in excess of smp as the value of capacity voc sustainable investment equilibrium is reached when existing plants recover their annual fixed costs of operation and at times when new build is required when new plants are expected by potential developers to recover their annual fixed costs including return on the capital investment in perfectly competitive market with prices set by generator shortrun marginal cost bidding alone the resulting prices might be insufficient to cover the full costs of some of the plant on the system in particular the fixed costs of marginal plant and the capital cost of new entrants to ensure an adequate system margin an additional sum of money is required above the revenue implied by generationder ived shortrun marginal cost prices in market where new plant are required the value of capacity has to be high enough to cover the fixed costs of existing plant that would otherwise close in market where new entry is required the value of capacity has to be expected to be high enough to raise wholesale prices up to new entry levels the price at which the most efficient new entrant would make returns sufficient to justify building the plant there are various means by which this additiona l value of capacity is captured within competitive generation markets some markets including the sem have explicit capacity or reliability mechanisms which reward capacity independently from energy the gb market is an energyonly market in which the market price at times exceeds generation short run marginal costs this does not imply anticompetitive behaviour but instead reflects the economic theory that prices should include the risk that there is insufficient capacity to meet demand this mechanism requires that there should genuinely be an expectation of occasions with insufficient capacity to meet demand and that prices are permitted to rise to very high levels ultimately value of lost load for consumers who are cut off on these occasions peaking generators who run very rarely are not expected to capture the full revenue associated with the value of capacity this is exacerbated by the payasbid 17 variability of uk marine resources carbon trust and environmental change institute july 2005 implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 33 pöyry energy consulting nature of the trading which raises risks that peaking generators would be unable to capture the full economic value of their output even if they were available to generate at times of extreme system stress in practice some other sources of revenue are available in most markets which contribute to the fixed costs for certain plants such as ancillary services contracts for reserve and other system services such as black start or frequency response the value of capacity is in theory related to the expected value of scarcity and its existence can be explained in theoretical terms based on the value of lost load ie unserved energy and the likelihood as foreseen at the time of trading that there will be insufficient capacity to meet demand the loss of load probability the relationship is only approximate in the betta market but can nevertheless be discerned as the following analysis shows in terms of modelling there are various alternative approaches to generate value of capacity component in market including bidding up plant raising their bids in the model to above shortrun marginal cost on an individual basis to recover their fixed and possibly capital costs the difficulty with bidding up specific plant is that as these plant retire and are replaced it may be difficult to understand which plant can bid up to take their place another difficulty is that stations which operate at very low load factors in model may need to set prices at very high levels during their limited period of operation leading to price profile that is unrepresentative of reality thus there is risk of under recovery of costs we believe that the value of capacity approach explained in the following section is consistent both with historical data and with the potential future development of the electricity system in world with large volumes of renewable generation but we draw attention to the difficulty including assumptions required of making this framework internally consistent there are other means by which generators could capture the capacity value including the use of peaking generators to offer option contracts to other market participants the present betta market is too illiquid in short timescales and with too much basis risk between the various trading balancing and imbalance prices for these riskmanagement products to deliver secure returns to peaking generation but in principle there is scope for further development 251 value of capacity in gb the gb market has single energyonly market price and observed wholesale market prices have systematically been higher than shortrun marginal costs resulting from electricity market models this difference can legitimately be attributed to value of capacity element to prices the value of capacity tends to appear most at peak times of the day and is greater in winter than in summer this is illustrated in figure 16 below which shows the results of backcast of the zephyr model simulating hourly historical prices smp18 for 2006 and 2007 the blue lines show the smp prices

of the inferred value of capacity against the system margin the surplus of available generation over demand as shown in figure 17 below an approximate relationship emerges in 2006 and 2007 this relationship shows that when system margins are 30 or tighter gap appears between the smp modelled price and the wholesale market price when the system margin is 10 the value of capacity is 10mwh the relationship holds in similar pattern for both 2006 and 2007 the implied annual value of capacity as shown in the table in figure 17 is broadly consistent in 2006 and 2007 at around 4mwh hence for the modelling of future years we have assumed value of capacity profile before adjustment as shown in orange in figure 17 based on piecewise linear exponential function for 2008 the relationship follows somewhat different shape value of capacity appears when the system margin is 60 or tighter and the total value of capacity across the year is much higher this appears due to number of changes in the market in 2008 19 it should be noted that bidding above shortrun ma rginal costs in the gb market is permitted whilst in ireland it is not implications of intermittency 1 may 2009

in summer this reflects times of higher demand due to consumer usage patterns in market with significant wind generation the value of capacity may not appear at the times seen historically instead it is likely to appear at times of system tightness which could vary across the year with relatively short notice depending on how much wind generation there is at the time 252 value of capacity multiplier historically the average value of capacity has not stayed constant and has varied depending on the tightness of the generation system on an annual basis as well as whether new entry is required thus into the future it can be expected that the annual value of capacity will change depending on these factors however in order to maintain consistent level of security of supply as the amount of wind generation on the system increases the system margin on average also needs to increase with more periods of significant excess of capacity thus using our historically inferred value of capacity relationship with system margin would result in lower overall value of capacity which would be below that required to cover fixed costs of existing plant in turn if new generation is required the value of capacity would be well below that required to incentivise new investment thus to increase the value of capacity paid in gb we apply multiplier to the inferred relationship ie the derived value of capacity relationship is multiplied up until the revenues for existing plant or returns on new build plant are consistent with them covering their fixed costs or making the return on investment for new capacity note that implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 37 pöyry energy consulting for some very lowmerit plants there is still shortfall of revenue in our core scenario under existing assumptions in the core scenario the value of capacity component of prices varies over time as shown in table 2 in 2010 and 2015 the value is around 4mwh but this rises sharply in 2016 to almost 16mwh as the sy stem tightens and is on the verge of new entry however with new renewables build and new nuclear the system becomes less tight and it drops back to 5mwh in 2020 and 2025 in 2030 the value rises once more as new entry is needed to achieve this the voc multiplier rises from 6 in 2010 to 85 in 2016 up to 14 by 2030 although the multiplier is identical in 2015 and 2016 at 85 the value of capacity rises from 37mwh to 157mwh as result of the system becoming much tighter more periods with tight system margin lead to more periods of higher

payment mechanism in the sem in the single electricity market sem in the roi and northern ireland more explicit capacity payment mechanism cpm has been created as part of the market rules at present the total annual sum paid by consumers to generators is based on the cost of new entrant peaker in kw terms net of anc illary service revenue and inframarginal rent from operation in the energy market multiplied by the kw required in the year to meet the allisland security standard the annual payment is also split into monthly pots based on projected demand before the start of the year in question and further into halfhours based on variety of forecast and outturn metrics intended to act as proxy for the system margin the capacity payment is based on plant availability in any particular half hour rather than actual generation this means that plants know for certain that they will earn capacity payment when available although not the actual price even if they are not in merit and thus not

and in principle coal plant it does not apply to ccs coal nuclear and additional chp which we have treated as nonmarket determined the latter new entry along with renewables form the majority of the new entry we have assumed that any plant which are currently under construction plus few others which we believe to be very likely are commissioned will be built irrespective of changes in the market in the next few years these plant are listed in section 423 261 gb market after the specific projects described above have been commissioned the overall volume of new build is determined such that there are not more than about two periods per year22 on average with unserved energy in steady state where plant commissioning and plant closures balance over an extended period and new entry profitability is in line with the levelised cost we would aim for somewhat less than the 2 periodsyear mentioned above however as most of the new entry is not market determined steady state does not result of course project developers in competitive market will build plant if they think it is going to be profitable not on the basis of capacity margin per yet there is relationship between price levels and the capacity margin and the margin we have assumed is consistent in our modelling with realistic returns for new projects as our model does not cover all possible transmission constraints and there could be unserved energy when the reserve or response pr ovision is insufficient zephyr will tend to underestimate the amount of unserved energy there would be in practice this is discussed in more detail in section 681 when new entry is required we assu that plant with the highest return from ccgt ocgt and coal are built if more than one type of plant has high enough returns we assume mix of different plant are built if new entry plant are making the required irr we would need to increase the value of capacity either by increasing the value of capacity multiplier or if possible tightening the margin if any of them are making well above the required irr we would reduce the value of capacity either by loosening the margin or reducing the multiplier in all scenarios when new entry is required ccgts make the best rate of return with the exception of the capacity payment scenario in addition to the ccgt new entry described above small quantities of coal and ocgt new entry are built so their rates of return can be assessed these small additions have material impact on prices or plant operation in many of the scenarios some further ocgt capacity is built in particular in 2030 despite the economics suggesting that ccgt would remain the only new build there are number of reasons for this if only ccgts are built ccgts will end up at the bottom of the merit order this would result in less inframarginal rent23 and higher value of capacity would be required to ensure profitability this is particular issue in the ied scenario where with class ccgts closing f class ccgts which are not that much less efficient than the new entry ccgts end up at the bottom of the merit order 22 in the most extreme case which is the ied scena rio in 2020 this is relaxed to 3 periods per year 23 contribution to fixedcapital costs due to hav ing lower variable costs than the marginal plant implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 39 pöyry energy consulting we have not considered evolution of ancillary service payments with increasing wind reserve requirements there will be significantly higher warming costs if building ocgts saved money overall taking their capital costs into account by reducing plant warming costs this would be likely to happen although the exact mechanism is unclear small quantity of ocgt may in reality this has not been modelled be able to act as price taker24 without distorting the market too much the analysis has only been taken until 2030 and not further until 2040 or 2050 if further renewables come onto the system post2030 and this is clear that it will happen in 2030 it may be economically justified to build ocgt rather than ccgt since this study has not looked beyond 2030 it is not possible to comment on how the system might evolve after 2030 with just small quantity of ocgts and inelastic demand it is possible that the ocgts could contract to only run at extremely high prices however while this may lead to less value of capacity at other times overall it would probably lead to higher prices if this did occur more ocgts would be built but once they started competing with each other prices in hours when they run would fall there would then be little ocgt investment until capacity margins became tight again so cyclical investment cycle may result if our nonmarket determined capacity results in an overcapacity we close plant which are not approximately25 recovering their fixed cost this results in higher value of capacity although it will still be lower than in years where new entry is required this is done until the plant does recover their fixed costs or we start getting significant unserved energy plant closures are particular issue for class ccgts26 on the whole once we have closed plant the remaining class ccgts do roughly recover their fixed costs in reality some of the ccgts may be mothballed rather than closed down however when we close the ccgts eg 2019 some only have about 8 years of their lifetime remaining so are more likely to close down than be mothballed as we do not have need for new entry until near 2030 262 sem single electricity market as there is capacity payment in the sem the situation with regard to new entry is somewhat different than in gb we have assumed fixed value of capacity both in terms of the within year profile and the annual average in the case of ocgts this assumption does mean there is little relationship between capacity margins and the profitability of new entry27 however we have built sufficient new entry to keep reasonable capacity margin the assumption is that if the capacity margin got too big there would not be any new entry as companies would be unwilling to take the risk of the capacity payment falling for ocgts we have also assumed the ancillary services payment remains constant difficult issue is exactly what constitute s tight margin given that sem has by 2015 14gw of interconnection with gb which is over 20 of sem peak demand we have assumed that cernieur set the capacity pay ment so that sem does not become over 24 run whenever the price exceeds its marginal costs 25 in the case of ccgts we have not consider ed any nonenergy market revenue in reality some nonenergy market revenues is likely for very low load factor ccgts 26 the assumption is that ccgts will need to recover most of their fixed costs through the energy market 27 almost all ocgt revenues come from the capacity payment implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 40 pöyry energy consulting reliant on gb for this reason there is unserved energy in sem in our scenarios28 in 2030 when the capacity margin is tight in gb it is quite large in sem as from 202530 450mw ccs coal plant

implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 41 pöyry energy consulting 3 wind and wind generation in gb and the sem to understand the implications of intermittency we have undertaken research into the patterns of wind and wind generation historically and how these will influence the future this section highlights the methodology and data that has been used to generate future profiles of wind generation in gb and the sem and examines how accurate the resulting model is for the sem in 2007 we also then answer series of questions on the wind and wind generation including correlation of the wind and the relationship between wind and demand 31 overview of data and methodology 311 wind speed data to create the most realistic generation profiles possible historical hourly wind speed data was purchased for 20002007 for 36 locations covering the uk and the roi 10 covering onshore and offshore locations for the sem and 26 covering gb onshore and offshore locations the choice of wind locations is the result of collaboration between ourselves the intermittency project founders and the met office areas of interest were defined for onshore and offshore sites based on current locations of wind farms and expected future locations given these areas the met office and met éireann advised on which synoptic stations were most representative of the areas in question as result the distribution of actual and expected installed capacity has influenced the selection of wind sites figure 19 presents the final selection of wind locations in relation to planned and operational wind farms figure 19 location of selected observation nwp stations for gb met observation point wind farm implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 42 pöyry energy consulting the hourly wind speed data covers gb and sem markets for the period 20002007 the reason for the selecting these years is consequence of poor data availability in earlier years which would have lengthened the data acquisition and processing time unnecessarily offshore data for gb was derived by numeric weather prediction program nwp such programs take data from weather buoys surrounding the chosen location and output hourly wind speed data for given location 312 conversion of wind speed data to wind generation this is an overview of the methodology used for more comprehensive description see the appendices since the speed data is from meteorological masts at 10m height the hourly wind speed data was adjusted to reflect the difference in height between the mast and hub height of wind turbine around 80m high the uplifted wind speed was converted to power output from wind turbine using power curve as shown in figure 20 these represent the power output of wind turbine fo r given wind speed at low wind speeds below the cutin threshold the power output is zero above about 4ms it rises quickly with the cube of the wind speed and flattens of as the wind turbine caps power output usually by changing the angle of the blades above certain wind speed 25ms onshore 30ms offshore the wind turbine cuts out completely and stops generating to prevent damage to components the standard power curves for turbine shown in orange in figure 20 have been converted to represent th output for group of turbines the aggregated power curve in particular group of wind turbines together will have smoother output than single turbine and will not all cut out together at high wind speeds due to the variation from gusts of wind

timescale extends to 2030 it has been necessary to formulate scenarios that are consistent with the expectation of high degree of installed wind capacity assumed in this study reports from i ndustry and government have guided the creation of the installed wind capacity scenario for the sem the grid 25 report has been used as key reference the scenario for gb has been informed by sources including uk government targets and the offshore licensing rounds of the sea and crown estate this study has not assessed the economics of wind generation and the ratio of onshoreoffshore wind is an input to the study from that an output from it equally we have not examined in detail the geographical co nstraints that may limit wind development such as areas of outstanding natural beauty or national parks figure 21 shows the installed capacity in each market compared to peak demand despite the greater amount of installed capacity in gb the sem has higher wind capacity as proportion of demand in addition the distribution of installed capacity varies between the two markets the uk has greater proportion of offshore capacity expressed as ratio of total installed capacity than the sem the implications of this are covered in subsequent sections figure 22 shows the geographic location of the installed wind capacity both scenarios involve high installa tion rates of wind capacity the rate of installation in both markets is not constant but increases to 2020 before reducing to 2030 such dynamic could have significant implications for the wind generator supply chain that are not explored further in this study in addition the uk sees significant expansion in offshore wind post2015 while the onshore wind development is curtailed in the sem onshore wind resources continue to be developed

system smoothing out to limited extent peaks and troughs and thereby leading to less peaky wind generation profile this section investigates the degree to which wind speed and hence power output is correlated between wind locations in the gb and sem markets 321 how correlated is wind speed between locations figure 25 shows the correlation of wind speed at wind locations with respect to distance between the location s the calculation covers all 36 wind locations for the 8 monte carlo years resulting in 630 points being plotted at distance of about 200km apart roughly london to birmingham there is correlation of around 065 between points whilst by 900km apart approx london to aberdeen the correlation drops to 02 figure 25 correlation of wind speed over distance note correlation measured as r2 value it should be noted that the wind locations in this study have not been chosen as being representative of the entirety of uk and ireland but rather for coverage of areas where high amount of installed wind capacity is expected therefore it is to be expected that the average correlation of wind speeds will be slightly higher for the sites used in this study rather than the studies where sites were chosen for geographical coverage in general it can be concluded that with increased distance between sites the correlation of wind speed between the sites decreases this confirms the expectation that low periods of wind at one location can be to some extent be offset by high wind speeds at different location the effect of this is to reduce the variability of wind generation in terms of application at the market level this analysis implies that there is likely to be more correlation between wind speeds and hence power output in geographically small area than large area therefore one would expect that power output between sites in the sem is on average more correlated than that in the gb market obviously this does not take into account weighting caused by t he amount of installed capacity in on location 0001020304050607080910 0 200 400 600 800 1000 distance kmcorrelation implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 47 pöyry

power output between the gb and sem markets figure 26 correlation of wind generation in gb and sem in 2020 relationship does exist between the two markets albeit not strong one it is clear that there are times of high wind generation in gb and low wind generation in the sem and vice versa equally there are many periods when wind generation output in the two markets is similar and correlated however the relatively low level of the correlation at 044 implies that there will be opportunities where lower wind generation in one market may be countered by higher wind generation in an alternative market thereby creating an opportunity to sell excess wind generation 01000200030004000 0 5000 10000 wind generation in gb mwwind generation in sem mwr2 045 0100020003000400050006000 0

along with the average demand profile the capacity factors have been derived from all monte carlo year s and all wind locations and therefore represent an average of the data set there is variation in wind capacity factors across the day with low period of wind generation overnight followed by an increase in the mid afternoon before dropping off to the overnight level peak wind generation usually occurring at approximately 3pm broadly coincides with peak demand at 6pm there is significant variation in average capacity factor between seasons with more consistent wind speed regimes expected in winter compared to summer difference of 10 in summer compared to 5 or 6 in winter in addition the period of peak generation moves between seasons with autumn and winter exhibiting peaks at earlier

consulting although there are trends between wind and demand it is not strong relationship and masked by the significant variation in the wind figure 28 illustrates the correlation between hourly generation from wind and demand for monte carlo year 2002 in 2030 it can be seen that the correlation between wind and demand is poor this result implies that wind generation cannot be expected to always be available when required 324 how often are there wind events wind event is defined as period when there is power output from wind location given the shape of the non aggregated power curve figure 20 both low and high wind sp eeds can lead to power output it is therefore important to identify both the number of low and high wind speed periods that lead to generation the aggregated power curve figure 20 shows that the cut in and cut out speeds for number of turbines over given area is not the same as that for single turbine table 3 reports the number of periods where high wind speeds over 30 and 35 ms and low wind speeds less than 1ms occur the total sample size is 29 million data points covering all monte carlo years under investigation and covers all wind locations it can be seen that in relation to the sample size there are relatively few low wind periods moreover low wind period is only defined for one location in reality the system sees generation as the product of multiple wind locations as result the impact on the overall system depends on the amount of installed capacity at the particular location where low or high wind speed event occurs table 3 count of low

pöyry energy consulting table 3 shows that the majority of wind periods are those in which the wind speed is less than 1ms while outages due to high wind speeds are far less common this finding coincides with the properties of the wind speed distribution weibull distribution30 that shows relatively large number of low wi nd speed events and small number of very high wind speed events in conclusion there are relatively few wind events moreover given wind event the likelihood is that the cause is low wind speed rather than high wind speed this is in line with expectations given that wind speeds in northern europe conform to weibull distribution 33 variation in wind 331 how much does generation vary by differing locations the amount of energy from wind varies from location to location and is dependent on the wind conditions and the installed capacity at individual locations figure 29 presents the average capacity factor derived from capacity factors for individual wind locations scaled up to the country level the derived capacity factors are not weighted by installed capacity therefore the actual capacity factor of wind for the gb or sem markets will be defined by the level of installed capacity per wind location figure 29 capacity factors per region note ri is republic of ireland sc is scotland is northern ireland as rule it appears that offshore sites exhibit higher capacity factors in general than onshore sites due to the large amount of installed capacity offshore it is to be expected that offshore sites will in effect pull up the average capacity factor for the respective markets in terms of onshore sites the scottish and roi locations exhibit higher capacity factors in general due to higher average wind speeds while the wind locations in england and wales are of lower generation 30 weibull distribution is continuous probability distribution with skew with higher probability of low values than high values it is frequently used to represent wind

and the identification of low and high wind energy production periods table 4 shows the sum of wind generation for the eight monte carlo years for 2020 and 2030 in our core scenario for gb in 2020 wind generation varies between 832twh and 933twh range of 10twh or 12 in 2030 with greater installed wind capacity the variation is 15twh or 13 the slightly greater variation in 2030 despite identical

periods in which generation from wind contributes less than 5 of maximum wind output or more than 95 of wind output these periods are of interest as they define the number and duration of times in

band represents twohour period figure 33 plots the frequency of occurrence of low wind periods against the length of time they occur for in the uk and sem markets as would be expected the distribution is skewed towards wind periods with short durations as the length of time increases so the frequency of occurrence decreases for the purposes of this study such periods are interesting as they represent the periods when the generation system is under significant stress as obvious sources of flexibility such as pumped storage cannot operate at full capacity for more than 5 hours the distribution of low wind periods varies between the gb and sem markets mainly due to geographical coverage for example in the gb market there is one period in the 8 monte carlo years where wind generation is ss than 5 of demand for nearly 3 days implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 56 pöyry energy consulting there appear to be more periods in the sem over

hours in 2030 the sem also sees the number of high wind energy periods increase from 166 hours to 224 hours the reason for this difference is the increased installed capacity offshore as result the average capacity factor would be expected to increase as the amount of installed capacity has the effect of weighting the higher capacity factor more hence pushing up the overall capacity factor 34 wind and demand this section addresses wind and demand and in particular the modified demand profile that is exhibited by the gb and sem systems as result of the significant amount of installed wind capacity 341 what does demand look like after wind since wind is generally price taker and runs ahead of all other generation demand net of wind is what the rest of the thermal syst em will have to

and unpredictable figure 36 shows the effect of wind on demand profile for january in 2020 it can be that the effect of wind is to alter the regular nature of the standard demand profile and replace

installing substantial wind capacity can be seen by comparing the curves in blue and orange in figure 37 for the sem the change is startling with periods of zero or even negative demand ie there is more ener gy generated from wind than the system requires in addition 3gw of thermal capacity is only required for around 50 of the hours in year instead of 100 for demand only as result the spread of demand net wind that thermal capacity has to meet is about 7gw as opposed to 4gw without wind the same is true for gb the spread of demand to be met by the thermal system is almost 70gw after the

demand and wind generation match hourbyhour the difference between 2020 and 2030 is that wind generation can now deliver more energy t han the sem system requires and hence there are periods when the system has more ener gy provided than demanded all by wind the effect of the tail has implications for base load capacity as the number of hours that given load is required and therefore plants are required to operate reduces figure 39 demand net wind generation for gb 2020 and 2030 2020 2030 installed capacity and demand from core scenario figure 39 shows the duration curves for demand net wind generation for the gb market in 2020 and 2030 similar pattern is visible with variation between monte carlo years due to the coincidence of wind and demand as wind generation increases the number of periods when there is little demand to be met by thermal generation increases in 2020 20 of the time demand net wind is less than 30gw whilst in 2030 it rises to 30 of the time 342 how does demand net wind change on an hourly basis the rate of change of demand net wind over time gives an understanding of the amount of thermal generation that is required to come online to meet demand it gives measure of how much ramping that the thermal system must do the figure for ramping is calculated by subtracting demand net wind at time t1 from time t for the purposes of this study 1 hour ramping 4 hour ramping and 12 hour ramping have been used figure 40 and figure 41 show 1 hour wind ramping duration curves for monte carlo year 2002 one duration curve is plotted f or monte carlo year 2002 and represents the sorted hourly demand net wind value that must be met by the thermal system it should be noted that negative demand means that less capacity would be required for the next hour while positive value for demand indicates that more capacity is required in the next hour in gb both in 2020 and 2030 there is very little difference for the majority of the ramping curve showing that demand net wind is not on average any more volatile than demand alone however there is change at the extremes of the curve which is not evident from the charts where small number of periods have

hourly ramping requirement due to demand only in 2020 is 62 gw and 107mw for demand net wind the hourly ramping increases to 96gw and 128gw in 2030 the difference is more extreme an hourly ramping of demand of 60gw and 107gw increases to 124gw and 152gw in the sem there is more of visible difference in the ramping duration curves as shown in figure 41 primarily due to the larger share of wind generation assumed for the irish market than for the gb market and the more vol atile and correlated wind generation from the geographically smaller market it becomes particularly evident in 2030 where the ramping for demand net wind is visibly more extreme for all of the duration curve table 7 shows the hourly ramp of demand only for the sem is minimum of 11gw and maximum of 11gw both of these figures are half that of demand net wind reported in 2020 and 2030 when wind has modified the demand profile therefore it can be concluded that for the sem the addition of significant quantity of wind generation results in an increase in the ramping requirement that the rest of the system must deal with moreover both maximum and minimum ramping requirements are affected figure 40 1 hour

for small number of hours where rising demand coincides with falling wind the requirement increases in the sem due to the small market and greater share of wind the onehour ramping requirement grows overall as do the extremes 343 would there ever be wind generation at peak demand hours examining the top three demand hours31 for each monte carlo year and comparing the amount of wind generated in that period illustrates the variability of wind at key system tightness based on actual data from 2000 to 2007 for demand and wind table 8 shows that there is significant variation in the contribution of wind to demand at peak demand hours varying between maximum of 48 in gb to mere 1 and between 82 in sem and 3 however it does show that wind will not necessarily be present when the system is

demand hours for each year 35 offshore wind offshore wind sites are expected to contribute significant proportion of future electricity supplies for the gb market in all scenarios as result it is important to understand how offshore wind may differ to onshore and the extent to which paucity of offshore wind data may affect the results in total 8 locations were chosen as being representative for offshore sites in the uk while 1 site was chosen as being representative for the limited offshore development expected in the sem market the data for the offshore sites was provided by the met office as output from their numerical weather prediction program due to lack of recording stations in the areas that were of interest ie those corresponding to round two and three locations where large deployments of wind generation could be expected the data for the offshore site in sem was provided by met éireann using offshore buoy data generation from offshore wind sites differs from generation from onshore wind sites in two respects firstly there is large concentration of installed capacity in one location and secondly the nature of offshore wind regimes compared to onshore wind regimes these differences result in two emergent questions how is offshore wind different to onshore wind is single mast representative of large offshore area 31 the peak three demand hours has been used as is similar to the triad measure used by nationalgrid to calculate tnuos charges implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 63 pöyry energy consulting 351 how is offshore wind generation different to onshore offshore wind regimes exhibit significant differences to those onshore for variety of reasons firstly the absence of terrain effects means that the wind profile tends to be smoother and more constant secondly the average wind speed is higher at offshore sites than onshore sites figure 42 illustrates the difference in average capacity factor between onshore and of fshore sites for all monte carlo years used in the study figure 42 comparison of offshore and onshore capacity factors average capacity factors 000005010015020025030035040 ri offshoreew

question is that currently there are operational wind farms that approach in size the expected view of installed capacity in our core scenario or that cover the area where round 3 wind farms are expected as result of lack of appropriate empirical data and in order to answer this question correlation between offshore wind sites is analysed to see if there value in increasing the number of offshore observation points high correlation would imply that there is little value in using another repres entative point while low correlation would imply that there is value in using another representative point for the area in question significant installed capacity is expected at offshore wind sites eg 6gw on the dogger bank implying that large area will be covered by turbines using the bwea recommendation of spacing turbines 25mwkm2 for multiple wind farms in large areas or 5mwkm2 for single wind farm areas of up to 2500km2 will be covered the governing factor for the spacing figures is to control wake effects although others such as seabed conditions are also constraints in reality in addition the difference between the two installed power densities is primarily due the spacing between wind farms implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 64 pöyry energy consulting figure 43 correlation of wind speed for offshore sites the graphs in figure 43 show the correlation between two classes of offshore wind farms superimposed on the correlation between all wind farms involved in the study the left hand graph in figure 43 shows the correlation between offshore sites greater than 20km from the coastline is high er than expected while the right hand graph shows that the correlation between site close to the shoreline within 10km and sites further offshore is lower than expected this is due to the boundary effect of the shoreline which means that onshore wind conditions exert influence on offshore wind conditions up to distance of 20km off the coast given that most of the offshore sites described in this study are at distance of greater than 20km from the coast this would imply that the right hand graph while interesting is not applicable to the question in hand the higher correlation between far offshore sites implies that for given area covered by turbines far offshore sites will give higher wind speed and therefore power output correlation than if the same area were to be covered over land as result it could be argued that offshore sites will not benefit from lack of correlation as land sites do however it should be noted that the increase in correlation between offshore sites may be more than compensated for by the higher capacity factors observed at offshore sites in terms of application to the wind model the largest area that will be covered by turbines is likely to be 2500km2 for illustrative purposes this can be seen as square of 50km by 50km the left hand graph in figure 43 shows that the correlation between two points 50km apart wash on to wash off is 096 using these two sites s proxy for points at the extreme ends of wind farm on dogger bank im plies that there is little value in using data from another representative point and therefore one meteorological mast is suitable as representation of large offshore area 36 conclusions it is clear from the above analysis that there is considerable intermittency in wind generation and system with considerable in stalled wind capacity will have significant variations to manage periods of very low generation less than 5 across either gb or ireland will not be uncommon and may last up to few days equally there will be periods with very high wind generation 0001020304050607080910 0 200 400 600 800 1000 distance

points decreases the further they are away from each other the wind in two different locations is not the same and hence low periods of wind at one location can be offset by high wind speeds at different location the effect of this is to reduce the variability of wind generation as result the smaller the geographic area the more variable the wind resource will be hence wind in the sem has greater variability than in gb there is some correlation r2 of 044 between wind in the sem and in gb both do experience periods when average wind speeds or wind generation is either very high or very low together with our deployment of wind turbines there are periods when wind generation in gb is very high and at the same time very low in the sem although wind speeds on average are higher during peak hours and are higher in winter than in summer this is typically masked by very significant variation of generation around the averages thus with our installed capacity assumptions for 2020 at triad peaks top 3 demand hours wind generation has been between 1 and 48 of demand in gb and 3 and 82 of demand in the sem there is considerable variation of wind speeds and hence wind generation between different years and with an assumption of 33gw of capacity in gb in 2020 annual wind output could vary between 8393twh variation of 12 in the sem annual higher variation of 21 could be expected in 2020 with 61gw of capacity due to the smaller size of the market in generation terms this is between 146twh and 177twh the demand needed to be met by nonwind capacity demand net wind will be much more variable than the current demand profile in gb in 2030 demand could vary between 30gw and 70gw however demand net wind may vary between zero and 65gw considerably more as result of the wind in the sem there is similar relationship the spread of hourly demand across the year is 5gw but demand net wind may be 11gw importantly the potential ramping required by the thermal system will increase although the ramping in the majority of hours will be similar to currently the worst case ramping will increase by 2020 the maximum hourly change that thermal generation may face is 127gw up and 97gw down by 2030 this could have increased to 152gw up and 124gw down thus 152gw of generation may have to be brought on line for single hour in the worst case scenario in the sem hourly ramping of demand net wind increases from 21gw in 2020 to 24gw in 2030 this ramping duty can be mitigated to some extent by more active demand however the volumes suggest that this will largely require

is driven by underlying plant economics retiral of plant is driven by technical lifetimes or where applicable environm ental restrictions ie the lcpd or ied directive as basic modelling assumption we always assume that enough capacity is built to meet demand the tightest we allow the system to get to is maximum of two periods of lost load per year 41 common input assumptions this section describes

scenario inputs 411 demand demand assumptions are shown in table 9 below the total demand shown is the average for all monte carlo simulations and each simulation has different pattern of weather reflected thus each monte carlo simulation gives different annual demand for example cold winter may lead to higher annual demand despite all other factors being equal 32 eirgrid grid25 strategy for

scenario more detail on specific findings from the core scenario is provided in section 6 topic investigations where the results are used to answer specific questions in addition the appendices provide detailed information on the scenario 421 purpose of scenario the core scenario does not represent central or definitive base case for the future instead it should be understood as reasonable starting case to explore the world in 2020 and 2030 with significant intermittent and baseload generation the core scenario is intended to be internally consistent this means that new thermal plant which is built such as nonccs coal ccgts and ocgts were intended to make sufficient returns over their lifetime to justify being built in effect this means that market participants have certain element of perfect foresight in their investment decisions equally if existing plant do not cover their fixed costs they close however in practice newbuild peaking generators are required in gb by 2030 to maintain existing security of supply standards but under present assumptions these do not make sufficient revenues to justify the investment we have not examined the investment case for wind marine biomass and ccs coal new build as the purpose of this study was not to examine the investment potential in these technologies but rather to investigate the effect of deploying them in effect investment in these technologies is independent of market conditions and outlook for renewable technologies this is principally due to the subsidy they receive either through the roc renewable obligation certificate mechanism in gb or the refit renewable energy feedin tariff programme in the republic of ireland for nuclear the potential rate of new build of plant and the participants able to build these plant limits the rate of deployment of the technology rather than necessarily market returns 422 wholesale prices we have used the zephyr market model to determine the outcome for prices and in the core scenario wholesale prices evolve in complex manner out until 2030 in gb average annual wholesale prices rise from 55mwh in 2010 to 76mwh in 2016 the rise to 2015 is due to rising carbon prices whilst the jump from 2015 to 2016 is due to the tightness of the system following retirement of 8gw of coal and 3gw of oilfired plant under the lcpd although new entry is not

marginal costs and hence drive prices down additionally the increasing system margin over this period means that the value of capacity component of prices in gb reduces from the highs in 2016 average

however sem prices fall below gb prices in 2030 due to the very high volumes of wind generation in the irish market generators in the sem benefit from high prices in gb the interconnection to gb means that the sem imports high gb prices which would otherwise be much lower prior to 2020 monthly prices exhibit strong seasonal pattern as is currently the case with higher prices in winter and lower in summer due to the combination of higher electricity demand and higher gas prices however from 2020 onwards this pattern is much weaker resulting in flattening of the seasonal profile by 2030 in the sem the traditional summerwinter profile has reversed due to the large number of zero priced periods in winter from large volumes of wind generation in gb the relationship reasserts itself in 2030 as the system becomes tighter due to retiring older plant this leads to requirement for new build of plant and higher prices in peak winter hours figure 45 annual and monthly wholesale prices in gb and

intention of ensuring consistency between new build and investment returns however as noted above in order to maintain security of supply we have had to assume some build of ocgt which is apparently uneconomic given existing assumptions which only consider the present levels of ancillary service payments and the limited sources of revenue to lowmerit generation under the existing gb market arrangements figure 51 shows the assumptions on capital and fixed costs for new build plant in the uk and the republic of ire land along with the economic lifetime and economic construction time further detail on how the irrs are calculated is included in the appendices indicatively we consider irrs pretax real hurdle rates of between 812 as sufficient to incentivise new entrants plant in gb it is important to note that the existing relationship between system margin and the capacity component of wholesale price is assumed to change in order that new entry is sufficiently rewarded our modelling assumes that at any given level of system margin the value of capacity is significantly higher than at present although the average levels on timeweighted average basis are similar and assumes that plants operating at the relevant times are able to capture the capacity value for those hours however these assumptions alone are not sufficient to reward new build peaking generation returns for plant in gb vary significantly the highest returns are for nuclear which makes in excess of 11 irr for all the years of our analysis nuclear does not have volume risk as its low variable cost means it generates at baseload additionally the implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 80 pöyry energy consulting carbon price of 35tco 2 38tco 2 and the zero carbon emissions from nuclear increase returns in this scenario returns for new build coal plant both with and without ccs are very low conventional coal has returns below 4 resulting in conventional coal plant built in this scenario35 for coal ccs returns are about 65 in 2020 onwards these would not be sufficient to incentivise new plant to be built returns to new build ccgts are around 8 in 2015 and 2016 the drop in 2020 is due to the significant increase in wind nuclear and ccs coal generation which puts downwards pressure on load factors and prices the rise in 2030 is due to the requirement for new entry as older coal and gas plant retire in our core scenario we assume the build of around 1gw of ocgt capacity by 2030 in order to maintain system margins and reasonable level of market prices for other plants on the system peaking plant make returns less than zero largely because their load factors are not sufficiently high to allow them to capture sufficient market income to cover their capital costs as income in gb is assumed to be available to plants only when they are operating there are other means by which generators could capture the capacity value apart from capturing very infrequent price spikes in payasbid market without resorting to capacity mechanism the most obvious is an increase in the revenues earned by generators offering reserve and flexibility to the system operator alternatives include the use of peaking generators to offer option contracts to other market participants the present betta market is too illiquid in short timescales and with too much basis risk between the various trading balancing and imbalance prices for these riskmanagement products to deliver secure returns to peaking generation but in principle there is scope for further development we conclude that in order for security of supply to be maintained at current levels there would need to be material increase in the capacity value accrued especially by peaking and lowmerit generators compared with that in evidence in todays market plant in the sem the main difference between returns for plant in gb and the sem is due to the capacity payment mechanism cpm in the irish market given that plant are paid for their availability rather than their generation revenues of peaking plant increase significantly as result peaking plant have irrs of around 9 in the sem whereas equivalent plant in gb have returns of less than zero more efficient advanced gts show lower returns as although their load factors are higher the much higher capital costs drive down returns the high prices in the gb market caused by the capacity tightness in 2016 increase prices in the sem as well leading to benefit caused by price linking between the sem and gb ccgts experience this effect in 2015 and 2016 which pushes irrs upwards however the large amount of wind generation in the sem leads to an unfavourable environment for ccgts which see irrs pushed downwards to 63 by 2030 35

the rate at which new renewable capacity must be installed and the total amount that is deployed the core scenario leads to fundamentally differe nt energy markets retirement of lcpd plant and 2020 targets create an investment conundrum in gb with significant volumes of low carbon generation being built from 2016 onwards investing in thermal plant for 2016 is risky as company would need to recover its investment in short period of time before revenues are driven downwards by wi nd and nuclear thus an energyonly market requires high prices to incentivise new entry to keep the lights on betta and sem lead to different outcomes regarding new entry the energyonly market in gb leads to economic ocgt newbuild as peaking plant do not run sufficiently to recover their investment however we do find need for up to 1gw of peaking generation in gb by 2030 even with the multiplier which we assume is applied to the value of capacity peaking generation is not sufficiently rewarded to justify its build given assumptions on ancillary service revenue and the operation of the market in ireland the cpm leads to ocgts being more profitable than ccgts the core scenario is world where thermal plant are increasingly used as mid and peaking plant to balance the intermittency of wind leading to much lower load factors than at present in this scenario coal and ccgt load factors are dramatically depressed by wind in particular the older ccgts in gb eclass have load factors that mean many do not recover fixed costs and as result close down the findings and results from the core scenario are discussed in more detail as part of section 6 topic investigations implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 87 pöyry energy consulting 5 summary of further cases 51 overview of the further cases series of further cases has been run to explore specific areas of interest these are outlined in this section more comprehensive results are given in the appendices the distinction between scenario and sensitiv ity is whether the new build assumptions are internally consistent in scenario we ensure that conventional new entrants except ocgt are able to fully recover their investment costs by changing new build value of capacity and retiral of plants in sensitivity one of the inputs for scenario is changed without ensuring full consistency of new build table 16 below summarises the scenarios table 16 overview of scenarios and sensitivities scenario key question description core scenario what is the impact of intermittency on the markets of gb

capacity payment scenario assumes that capacity payment mechanism cpm based around that already existing in the sem is implemented in gb we analyse the potential effect on prices new build requirements and their returns and the knockon implications for irish market the core scenario assumes that sufficient capacity is available to maintain security of supply and includes some uneconomic build of ocgts at the end of the period therefore the implications of cpm on system security have not been directly evaluated other than to note that its existence does make ocgt build economic in practice there are other means to ensure security of supply including development of the market to include trading of peaking option contracts in creased ancillary service payments or the inclusion of the demandside in the market in meaningful way the cpm in the sem remunerates generators for being available rather than just for generating this means that plants know for ce rtain that they will earn capacity payment when available even if they are not in merit and thus not generating the total annual sum paid by consumers to generators in the sem cpm is based on the cost of new entrant peaker in kw terms net of ancillary service revenue and infra marginal rent from operation in the energy market multiplied by the kw required in the year to meet the allisland security st andard the annual payment is also split into monthly pots based on projected demand before the start of the year in question and further into halfhours based on variety of forecast and outturn metrics intended to act as proxy for the system margin the result is very smoothed set of capacity prices compared to the theoretical value of capacity within the cpm case we have made the key assumption that generators and demand would bid into the energy market at their short run marginal cost in practice at times of scarcity even with capacity mechanism generators might be able to achieve above marginal cost prices in the energy market and thereby be rewarded twice for the provision of capacity the dynamic of this is complex but we note that in the sem there is licence requirement for generators to bid in line with shortrun marginal cost principles and that this was in part justified in order to avoi d double payment for the provision of capacity the sem variant of capacity mechanism is designed to deliver smoothed profile of capacity prices but other designs may still deliver volatile capacity revenues 521 changes compared to the core scenario to obtain consistent scenario in terms of new build investments new plant capacities are altered in the capacity payment scenario over 4 gw of additional ocgts are built in 2030 along with less retiral of older ccgts and fclass figure 56

viable these plant can be commissioned for any forecast shortfalls of capacity in short time period both due to the simpler engineering and also the lower risk associated with lower capital costs also wholesale prices become less volatile in gb as the capacity payment mechanism prevents periods of very tight system margins and hence extremely high prices figure 60 shows the reduction in volatility with the adoption of cpm leading to volatility that halves in critical years such as 2016 and 2030 due to the inter linkage between the sem and gb capacity mechanism in gb has strong influence on the

noticeable as shown in table 17 in gb returns for ocgts become much higher and compatible with new entry whilst ccgt returns are driven downwards as prices are much lower on average in the irish

management scenarios the ability to flatten demand during the day offers significant potential to reduce system costs and create more economically and bette r designed electricity system currently demand for electricity is largely if not wholly independent of the cost in any hour to produce it as result consumers behaviour is not influenced by the cost of producing electricity in any meaningful manner by reducing peak demand savings may be possible through reducing new build of generation and minimising the number of starts of plant also if demand is more dynamic it may be possible to offset some of the intermittent effects from wind by increasing demand at times of high wind generation and decreasing it when there is less wind this study has examined two cases where demand side management is implemented inflexible demand management and pr ice responsive demand management the uncertainty surrounding demand side management is significant and so the scenarios represent an illustration of the impact rather than definitive view of how demand side management may contribute case 1 inflexible demand management dumb meters this assumes that demand is moved from the peaks during the day to the troughs during the night this implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 115 pöyry energy consulting is achieved by similar system to the ec onomy 7 heating system in the uk or night saver used in the roi with demand for space and water heating primarily moving additionally we have added electric v ehicles assuming overnight charging case 2 price responsive demand management smart meters this assumes that load can be dynamically moved from w hen required to when it is cheapest using smart meters that receive information about wholesale prices and reschedule energy demand accordingly in effect load can act as electricity storage allowing consumers to change the timing of electricity demand primarily water and space heating to minimise their costs the appendices contain more detailed discussion on the scope for demand management and on our underlying assumptions 591 inflexible demand management assumptions for the inflexible demand management scenario we have changed the underlying demand profile by adding an additional heating profile and an electric car profile this represents heating demand both space and water that takes places overnight rather than during the day in both gb and ireland the heating profile has been taken from the existing economy 7 profile it is more difficult creating reasonable assumption for electric vehicles as very few of these exist and the technology may undergo significant changes from the status quo before deployment thus we have assumed that the profile of charging of electric vehicles is the inverse of the diurnal pattern of use of electric vehicles for this scenario we have assumed that the total annual demand remains identical to the core scenario in effect any increase in space or water heating and electric vehicles is offset by greater increases in energy efficiency compared to our core scenario this allows direct comparison of how the syst em may behave without significantly changing the underlying assumptions on build requirements the resulting profile for england and wales is shown in figure 83 showing that energy consumptio n at the peaks is reduced with corresponding increase in demand during the early hours of the morning it should be noted that resulting profile becomes doubled peaked at least in winter this is due to the lack of smoothing in an inflex ible demand management system where load is determined by the time of day rather than wholesale prices in reality we may expect smoother profile than this as combination of inflexible and price

demand management smart meters assumptions movable demand can be modelled as form of energy storage heat storage in the case of demand from space or water heating or battery storage in the case of demand from electric cars which generates energy during those periods which the demand is moved from and consumes energy during the periods which the demand is moved to using the same assumptions for customers as the inflexible demand management scenario we calculate the total amount of movable demand each day based on projections of space heating demand growth in the domestic services and industry sectors and the assumption that dynamically managed electric vehicle charging and space and water heaters must be on for minimum of five hours each day in order to store sufficient energy to meet twelve hours of heat electric car demand for 2020 this leads to 22gwh of daily movable demand with charging capacity of about 4gw and generating capacity of 2gw comparing table 21 to table 22 by

scenarios have the effect of flattening the demand curve which alleviates the need for new build ccgt in gb to cover tight periods as shown figure 85 in 2030 3gw less ccgt is required to be built to maintain the same level of system security in the inflexible mand management scenario whilst in the price responsive demand management 4gw less capac ity is required due to the improved capping of

implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 121 pöyry energy consulting figure 87 demonstrates that the inflexible demand management serves to flatten the demand curve but that its inflexibility can end up making the problem worse as is the case during 14 february 00000800 where the effect of the economy 7 demand curve is to create extra load at time when intermittent generation is already low at 4am demand in the core scenario is about 40gw with only 8gw of wind generation however in the inflexible demand management scenario demand has been driven up to over 50gw

consumption system demand before storage system demand after storage however figure 88 demonstrates the improvement to this situation with price responsive demand management rather than inflexible demand on 14 february in the early morning demand rises to 45gw leading to much less stressed system overnight instead the requirement for heating load is spread out over longer time period and some of it occurs during peak hours of the day as generation from the wind rises from an overnight low of 8gw to high 10 hours later of 32gw in addition to easing the strain on the system by generating during times of low intermittent generation the storage also acts to adjust the shape of the demand curve so that the demand for nonintermittent generation the light blue and orange area in the graph is flattened over the course of day this means that fewer starts are needed reducing the need for thermal generators to waste energy running at minimum stable generation or activating plant as such we would expect only to see the number of starts in the price responsive demand management scenario fall significantly towards the later end of the scenario until then the inflexible demand management

2030 prices in the capa city payment scenario are lower whilst in other years they are higher the profile of monthly prices is flatter as generators do not need to recover costs in small number of years hourly prices are much less volatile with similar number of low priced periods but much fewer high priced periods sem prices become much less volatile as well how is new build affected the capacity payment allows older ccg ts to stay on the system and also incentivises new peaking plant in gb adjustments in the sem are minor lower returns on ccgts mean new plant are built what is the impact on total system investment costs it is notable that the market arrangements have very little impact on total investment costs since the vast majority of this is in wind irish consumers would benefit from lower market prices in the sem if gb adopted capacity payment however generators would lose revenue as they would longer benefit from the high prices that occur in the gb market in 2016 and 2030 how are plant returns affected in gb returns for ocgts become much higher and compatible with new entry whilst ccgt returns are driven downwards as prices are lower on average in the irish market returns for ccgts reduce for the same reason and as result further ccgts are built lower res scenario what is the effect on prices are prices less peaky prices in the lower res scenario are somewhat higher than the core scenario due to less downwards pressure from wind lower res prices are less peaky and have zero or negative priced periods how do emissions change emissions drop in gb but only to 165gco 2kg in 2030 whilst in the sem emissions remain above 200gco 2kg what is the effect on generation in the lower res scenario renewable share of generation reaches 33 by 2030 rather than 42 in t he sem renewable generation reaches 40 in 2020 and 50 in 2030 what is the impact on wind cannibalisation in gb overall wind revenues are higher as there is less wind depressing prices the variations between sites are also suppressed carbon drop scenario what are the implications on price with carbon price that is 15tco 2 lower wholesale prices drop substantially by an average of 7mwh overall price patterns are unaffected how are load factors affected the lower carbon price significantly increases load factors of coal plant and depresses fclass ccgts neither nuclear nor peaking plant load factors are affected the same pattern occurs in ireland higher load factors for coal with lower load factors for ccgts how are plant returns affected as expected irrs of coal plant rise due to lower carbon costs and those of ccgts drop slightly in gb as coal generates more in sem the cpm keeps peaking plant profitable how are emissions affected overall emissions are 1020 higher with carbon price 15tco 2 lower this is due to higher coal generation which significantly increases emissions implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 124 pöyry energy consulting ied scenario which plant close and what is required to replace them the ied has potentially significant ffect on gb plant in particular over 5gw of coal and 8gw of ccg t might have to close in 2020 in addition to the lcpd closures however this scenario is difficult to balance as ocgts have to be built to ensure returns to older ccgts if only new ccgts are built then other ccgts would be displaced leading to race to the bottom there are negligible changes in sem due to the ied there is new ccgt build as returns are too low what is the effect on prices prices in gb are less spiky in 2016 but much more so in 2020 due to the retiral of plant prices in sem are driven up in 2020 as well though to lesser extent what is the effect on emissions the closure of gb plant reduces emissions by almost 20mtco 2 per year in 2020 however much of this plant would have closed in 2025 so reductions after 2025 are much smaller and negligible in 2030 emissions in the sem go up as result of the plant closures in gb as irish plant generate more and the sem exports more energy to gb offshore deployment sensitivity how do prices and volatility change by 2030 despite the same volume of generation prices are slightly higher as wind farms are more correlated with each other and hence system margins are tighter more often how does volatility change price volatility increases marginally with higher offshore deployment but it is not significant change severn barrage sensitivity how does plant operation change the severn barrage has noticeable effect on thermal plant operation as it depresses thermal generation ccgt twice day does it affect prices annual and monthly prices are slightly affected with gb prices dropping by 2 in 2030 and sem prices by 28 the severn barrage significantly increases price volatility in gb and this sensitivity has the highest volatility of all our scenarios price volatility is almost 50 greater how do wind capture prices change capture prices in the severn barrage scenario are slightly lower than in the core scenario as the severn barrage depresses prices when operating what is the impact on emissions the severn barrage scenario results in the lowest emissions of all our scenarios dropping to under 50mtco 2 in 2030 how much is wind output reduced large severn barrage increases wind loss significantly from 55 to 2010 periods in 2025 in gb and 300 to 690 periods in 2030 it also has an impact on the sem increasing wind loss instances to over 1000 periods in 2030 implications of intermittency 1 may 2009

has lower overall flows but the patterns remain very similar wi th move towards more exports from the sem in winter by 2030 interconnectors are constrained much of the time how do returns change for plant in sem reduced interconnection translates into lower returns for sem plant across all class of plant as the market is less interconnected to high gb prices in 201520 and excess wind cannot be exported to gb from 2020 onwards how much does wind output decrease wind output decreases in both countries but especially in ireland with an increase in periods of wind loss from 60 to 220 in 2020 and 700 to 1200 in 2030 inflexible demand management scenario price responsive demand management scenario how does increased demand management affect demand with inflexible demand management the demand curve is flattened with more demand during off peak hours t he effect is greater with price responsive demand management as demand is moved to where it has the greatest reduction on price what is the effect on number of plant starts demand management may make considerable difference to the number of plant starts by 2030 the number of starts per year is reduced from 10000 across both gb and the sem combined to 7500 in the inflexible demand management scenario with price responsive demand management that is reduced even further to 5000 fall of 50 what is the effect on investment in

aim of the study was to answer series of questions posed about the electricity markets of gb and ireland and how they are impacted by intermittency these questions reflect the main areas of interest and concerns of the participants of the study the answers to these questions draw upon results from range of the scenarios outlined in section 0 focusing in particular upon the core scenario 61 market prices the core scenario in section 414 gives description of how market prices evolve and how the relationship between investment and prices changes over time this section shows how market prices may evolve as result of wind in the various scenarios and how volatility zero priced periods and price shapes may change in the future 611 how will market prices change will average annual prices drop significantly wind has an effect on wholesale prices in gb which is masked by other changes in the market in particular the value of capacity in the smp shown in figure 90 on the left market prices drop from 60mwh in the core scenario in 20 1516 to 58mwh in 2020 and 52mwh in 2030 since commodity prices are the same in all years after 2015 this drop in smps is caused by the underlying changes in generation and above all by the large volumes of wind generation on the system this effect is very similar across the scenarios all of which have the same underlying commodity prices although is less pronounced in the lower res scenario due to the lower volumes of wind generation installed for wholesale prices however the changes due to the value of capacity as the system becomes tighter and requires new entry are much more significant than the effect of wind pushing down prices this leads to annual prices that do not show obvious changes due to intermittency as shown by the wholesale prices in figure 90 on the right implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 128 pöyry energy consulting figure 90 annual smp and wholesale prices in gb system marginal

similar fashion though to lesser extent due to the lower installed wind capacity falling from 60mwh to 55mwh by 2030 if ireland had lower interconnection to gb than assumed in the core scenario there is greater downward pressure on prices due to more periods of zero prices as wind is deloaded this is shown in the interconnection scenario in figure 91 in this we reduce irish export capacity by 820gw and reduce import capacity by 500mw this reductio n in expected build of interconnectors pushes prices downward by an additional 3mwh compared to the core scenario in the sem the effect on

historically prices have been much higher in the winter than the summer due to combination of higher demand and higher gas prices however in the uk and roi there is significantly more wind in the winter months than the summer months typically wind generation in the winter is approximately double that during the summer this will have countervailing effect on the monthly price profiles figure 93

the opportunity cost assumed for uk onshore wind equally the number of periods when prices are between zero and 10mwh increases substantially to 280 about 3 of the year in the sem there are far fewer

of periods when prices are extreme it is unsurprising that price volatility increases however given market with zero or negative prices traditional measures of volatility break down normally volatility is defined as the standard deviation of the log of price returns volatility stdev log p hph1 for all prices p at hour h however this metric breaks down with negative prices there is meaningful result for the log of negative number equally defining volatility as the standard deviation of price returns cannot be used as if prices are zero it becomes insolvabl you cannot divide number by zero volatility stdev p hph1 1 for all prices p at hour h hence for price volatility we have used revised metric the average absolute change in prices as fraction of annual average prices this measures the absolute hourly change in prices phph1 1 averaged across the year and then divided by annual average prices as shown in figure 99 price volatility increases sharply in all scenarios from 2010 onwards it should be noted that historical volatility is not directly comparable as the future prices are modelled with monthly or annual commodity prices whilst historical prices incorporate daily commodity prices the core scenario experiences sharp jump in price volatility in 2016 as the system becomes tighter volatility then drops but rises even higher by 2030 as result of price volatility due to wind generation and higher overall prices due to new entry implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 137 pöyry energy consulting of all the cases the severn barrage where 10gw of tidal barrage are built has the highest volatility due to the impact of the barrage on prices the offshore growth scenario has very similar volatility to the core scenario despite the greater geographical concentration of the wind in the north sea this is surprising result as 20gw of wind near the wash and on the dogger bank is highly correlated and could be expected to drive significant prices spikes and dips although this may be the case it is not significantly more correlated than wind generation across gb in the core scenario and hence does not drive up volatility significantly figure 99 hourly price volatility in gb 0510152025 2006 2007 2008 2010 2015 2016 2020 2025 2030volatility see notes for definition of metrichistorical cap payment core ied

years affect prices the interaction between wind demand and availability has an influence of prices particularly when the system is tight using historical data certain years will have more periods where low wind and high demand coincide together figure 101 shows how annual prices vary by monte carlo historical year for the gb market with all monte carlo simulations run with exactly the same set of commodity price and capacity inputs the only change is in wind availability and demand in 2010 there is spread of about 5mwh between the simulations but by 2030 this has increased to almost 20mwh thus as the volume of wind increases the more sensitive outturn annual prices become to the interaction of wind plant availability and demand thus the risk of operating in the market will increase any one of the 8 monte carlo simulations could be the outturn price and series of low priced years could result from this interaction figure 102 shows the average wholesale price and the spread for both gb and the sem the spread in the sem i s much smaller than in the gb market with range of 15mwh 164mwh in 2010 rising to 64mwh by 2030 this highlights the different profiles of the market designs the sem market design is lower risk with lower price volatility and lower risk of extreme prices whilst the gb market is higher risk with higher likelihood of extreme prices ultimately the market risk would be borne by endusers as utilities would demand higher prices to compensate them for the higher risk in the market implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 139

load factors of older eclass ccgts are below 10 and newer fclass plant are under 60 whilst coal is at 50 the main reason for this is the reducing space for these plant to operate in with rising volumes of baseload nuclear ccs coal and biomass plant and increasing volumes of intermittent generation their running patterns by 2020 are increasingly the inverse of wind generation by 2030 even chp biomass and to lesser extent nuclear are displaced by wind generation at certain times of the year pushing load factors downwards the load factors in the various scenarios show results as expected

this imply with increasing volumes of wind the existing thermal generation on the system has to fulfil changing role with limited role for baseload generation and much more need for midmerit and peaking generation modes of operation in gb as shown in figure 106 newer fclass ccgts have an increasing number of starts and reducing period when they are on in 2010 they typically run with 50 starts and are on for around 70 hours 3 days this will be running 5 days week for some units and less for others by 2020 the number of starts has increased to 90 year with units on for only 60 hours by 2030 they start 120 times year and run for about 25 hours however older eclass ccgts have fewer starts in 2010 they typically run two shift running for around 14 hours when on and starting 140 times year the number of starts then falls as the units are called upon to operate less and less so that by 2020 they are starting only 20 times year and operating 13 hours each time for coal plant the number of starts stays roughly constant this is due to two factors firstly coal tends to run ahead of gas in the core scenario due to the relativity of carbon coal and gas prices secondly the plant left after 2016 are the highest efficiency plant thus the number of starts drops in 2016 as the older coal plant that have not fitted fgd close and only the newer plant with fgd remain however the length of the

much new thermal generation might be required the amount of new thermal generation unsubsidised required in the core scenario is relatively low primarily due to an assu med low demand growth until 2030 and very significant growth in renewables and bioma ss in gb total of 58gw of already committed new ccgts are built between 2010 and 2015 given this build low demand growth and the renewables new generic ie currently unplanned ccgts are required in 2016 to cover the retiral of 10gw of plant under the lcpd this retiral leads to tighter system but one that still is within our two hour lole following the lcpd closures 32gw of new nuclear comes online by 2020 and further 64gw afterwards and 32gw of ccs coal by 2030 of the older ccgts 24gw close in 2020 as they do not cover their fixed costs on an annual basis and further 5gw close by 2030 due to the combination of fixed cost recovery and the age of the plant in 2030 significant new entry of ccgts is required with the retiral of many older and ageing plant if the ied is implemented in its strictest reading with the closure of an additional 13gw of plant in 2020 there could be need for significant new thermal plant to cover this shortfall in this case 7gw of new ccgt would be required implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 145 pöyry energy consulting in the lower res scenario there is 3gw less wind generation in gb in 2016 however this does not lead to any further requirement for new build as the contribution of this wind generation to system margin is sufficiently low not to require new plant in the event of higher demand growth than outlined it is possible that further new thermal build may be required 632 what are returns on new thermal generation to ensure broadly consistent scenario we have made three key assumptions firstly plant that are committed in the next few years will be built irrespective of our scenario assumptions thus the new build in 2010 is the same in all scenarios secondly the system will never get tighter than two periods of lost energy on average ie we maintain system security standard thirdly to achi eve this prices must be sufficiently high to incentivise new entry when required through capacity revenues of some kind in practice we found that some ocgt build is required by 2030 and with existing assumptions these investments are not commercially viable it should be noted that the purpose of this study was not to investigate plant returns for investment purposes and the figures below are only an indication given our assumptions for scenarios different input assumptions particularly on commodity prices will lead to different plant returns as discussed in section 425 we assume plant returns between 812 would be sufficient to encourage new entry the returns on different types of plant are shown in table 26 below for the core capacity payment lower stretch and carbon drop scen arios in gb the highest returns are to nuclear plant across all the scenarios this is due to the absence of volume risk which means that unlike thermal plant they are unlikely to have depressed load factors due to large volumes of wind nuclear benefits from high commodity prices so our assumption of 70bbl for brent 70t for coal and 58ptherm for gas gives high returns to nuclear five years ago 30bbl oil prices would have been considered typical longterm view return to low priced oil world would affect nuclear returns considerably due to the exposure to commodity price risk across all scenarios coal and ccs coal do not make sufficient returns to permit new build in our modelling conventional coal returns va ry from 1 to 7 across the years whilst ccs coal from 48 to 65 all well below the indicative threshold of 8 for required for investment conventional coal returns are held down due to the high capital costs of build and carbon price of 35tco 2 in the core capacity payment and lower stretch scenarios the lower carbon price of 20tco 2 in the carbon drop scenario improves returns for conventional coal but only to 7 returns on ccs coal plant remain low due to the capital costs of new build carbon price of 35tco 2 is not sufficient to incentivise investment and they would require some element of subsidy to run returns to ccgts are highly variable in the core scenario where new ccgt build is required primarily in 2030 returns on plant ri sufficiently high to incentivise new build though the value of capacity in years where there are sufficient system margins plant returns drop substantially in 2016 given much tighter system margins irrs on ccgts rise towards new entry levels the capacity payment scenario leads to very different outcome with regards to plant returns in gb payment for availability means that

imported from gb typically between 7 in lower years and 9 in higher years the lower res scenario leads to the best returns due to high gb prices and high load factors for ccgts given less renewables coming online however the implementation of cpm in gb leads to irish ccgt revenues falling sharply to between 35 this is because gb wholesale prices become much lower keeping irish prices low and hence depressing ccgt revenues building advanced ocgts in the sem does not lead to sufficiently high returns to make them the main new entrant although they run at higher load factors than older ocgt designs due to higher efficiencies their higher capital costs mean that returns remain low 633 how important could the lcpd and ied emissions legislation be to the outcome the implications of the lcpd on existing plant are reasonably certain in 2016 10gw of coal and oilfired plant that has not fitted fgd will have to close much of this may have already closed due to having exhausted their maximum

renewables assumed for 2016 the core scenario suggests that there is pressing need for new plant to be built to meet the 2016 date however if demand grows at greater rate or renewables at slower rate it is likely that new plant will be required the ied in its strictest reading may have greater effect on plant closures than the lcpd with 5gw of coal and 8gw of ccgts having to close by 2020 in addition to the lcpd closures with further requirement for new build prices are high not only for 2016 but also for 2020 leading to higher prices for longer period and thus higher returns on ccgts as

revenue cannibalisation problem wind revenue cannibalisation describes the situation when generation from the wind is having direct effect on prices with high volumes of wind generation prices are pushed downwards hence wind generators capture lower prices however when there is low wind generation prices are high so wind farms do not capture high prices fully this issue is termed cannibalisation as wind is cannibalising its own revenue streams figure 108 shows the extent of wind revenue cannibalisation in gb in the core scenario the black line shows the average price captured by wind generator annual revenueannual generation whilst the red line shows the twa wholesale price36 in 2010 the wind capture price is higher than the twa price as result of more wind generation in winter months when wholesale prices are higher by 2016 this reverses with wind capturing 5mwh less than the twa price as increasing volumes of wind generation affect peak prices in particular by 2030 wind captures 13mwh less than market prices significant drop in the sem as shown in figure 109 the effect of wind revenue cannibalisation is similar in 2010 wind earns abo ve the twa price as in gb

lower res offshore core figure 112 compares the wind capture prices for range of the larger wind sites and the severn barrage the captured prices broadly follow the expected trend as outlined below in the severn barrage scenario with large barrage the captured price of the severn barrage is particularly low as it depresses its own revenue in similar manner to wind revenue cannibalisation in the severn barrage scenario all wind sites have significantly lower capture price this is because with more low cost generation at times when it is windy the smp is more likely to collapse to zero or less note that more nuclear capacity would probably have the same effect all captured prices are much higher in the lower res scenario due to the reduced wind capacity in the offshore scenario which has greater concentration of wind off the east coast of england in the dogger bank and the wash dogger bank and the wash including wash onshore have significantly lower capture price than in the core

deloaded firstly if wind generation exceeds demand and the excess cannot be exported secondly if it is cheaper to deload wind rather than turn off power plant for short period of time for example it may be more economic to reduce wind output for couple of hours than switch off large coal or nuclear station and then restart it thirdly if system operation constraints with reserve or response mean that wind has to be curtailed to keep sufficient thermal plant on the system to meet reserve constraints finally if transmission constraints mean that wind generation in certain region has to be constrained off the first three of these factors are modelled within zephyr with the transmission effects modelled in part with constraints between the models four zone figure 113 shows how much wind generation is deloaded in gb in the core scenario with the light blue bars showing how much wind is lost in the market schedule due to economic reasons and the dark blue the amount lost in the so

interconnection constraints to gb in 2015 and 2016 wind is deloaded in the market schedule and although there are almost 1000 hours when wind is deloaded the volumes tend to be very small by 2020 the volume of wind generation lost starts to increase to 287gwh with about quarter of the year with periods of limited wind deloading by 2030 this has increased substantially with over 2twh of wind deloaded over 5000 hours much of this is due to the sheer volume of installed capacity in the market schedule about 12twh of wind is deloaded for economic reasons or an excess of wi nd generation

periods are hours the issue of wind deloading is driven by the volume of wind generation installed thus in the lower res scenario where installed capacity reaches 29gw in 2030 in gb and 5gw in the sem there is barely any wind deloading in either gb or in the sem increasing the amount of wind offshore particularly in the north sea does increase the amount of wind deloaded as the wind generation becomes somewhat more correlated in gb this increases the volume of wind shed from 111gwh in the core scenario to 153gwh the sem experiences similar increase with deloading increasing from 12twh to 19twh large severn barrage also makes substantial increase in the wind deloading due to an extra 10gw of very low priced generation available twice day since the severn barrage is assumed to bid in with 2rocs about 70mwh it displaces onshore and offshore wind generation which bid at 1 and 15 rocs respectively thus wind 37 given the small nature of the irish market and the limited interconnection

accounts for reserve and response constraints as well as transmission constraints between niroi and ewscotland representing some of what system operator would do to ensure the system remained stable the reserve and response constraints will cause the system operator to redispatch plant to ensure enough are running partloaded or ready to run to ensure that the so can meet potential shortfalls on generation the reserve and response constraints modelled are inertia sem only requirement for minimum number of thermal units generating at one time low frequency response this is the capability to respond to drop in system frequency typically caused by trip forced outage of anther unit high frequency response this is the capability to respond to rise in system frequency caused by demand

including renewables 651 what is the effect of reserve and response constraints on plant load factors table 27 and table 28 compare plant load factors in the market schedule and system operator di spatch runs in gb there is little difference in plant load factors but the trend is for the load factor of low load factor plant to rise slightly and the load factor of high load factor plant to fall slightly in the sem there is much larger change in plant load factors apart from biomass the load factors of all tec hnologies are higher in the so dispatch run due to lower net imports from gb and more deloaded wind there are particularly large increases in the load factors of peaking plant and coal plant with the increase in peaking plant primarily due to the response constraints discussed in more detail in the next section coal plants have lower minimum stable generation and lower noload costs than ccgts so are relatively good at running partloaded there is particularly large increase in load factor for the kilroot coal plant in northern ireland this is due to the relative lack of wind capacity in northern ireland combined with the transmission constraint between republic of ireland and northern ireland in gb pumped storage utilisation amount of time spent pumping or generating is significantly lower in the system operator dispatch run this is because pumped storage provides low frequency response when it is neither generating nor pumping40 although the volume of low frequency response capability from pumped storage is highest when it is pumping this is typically overnight when low frequency response is not significant factor there is drop in the pumped storage load factor in the so dispatch run in 2020 this is result of higher low frequency requirement due to the commissioning of eprs in the market schedule and so dispatch runs there is some increase of pumped storage utilisation from 2020 to 2030 this is result of increasing price volatility due to increased wind and to some extent nuclear and ccs coal in sem pumped storage utilisation is higher in the so dispatch case this is probably because the low frequency response contribution of pumped storage is highest when pumping far higher than when not pumping or generating and in sem unlike in gb low frequency response remains an issue overnight 39 effectively keeping power plants in state wh ere they

not met note that the four hour figures are reserve and response requirements combined frequency in gb initially the low frequency requirement binds between 20 and 30 of the time there are number of reasons for the fall from 2010 to 2016 but the main factor is that the market schedule run uses less pumped storage output in 2016 than in 2010 this means that less changes to pumped storage and power plant operating patterns are required to provide response in 2020 there is big increase in how often the constraint binds this is due to eprs being commissioned which raises the requirement by 460mw the reason 460mw change in the requirement makes so much difference is that the preepr requirement was always met when there was pumped storage generation since in this state pumped storage provides at least 900mw whereas this is longer the case postepr also see reserve and response in appendices in the sem the low frequency constraint binds much more often there are three main reasons for this firstly the requirement is far higher relative to the size of the market secondly for each thermal unit only 510 unit dependent of the capacity can count towards the requirement not the full headroom and finally there are much more stringent limitations on the amount of response that can be provided by pumped storage implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 160 pöyry energy consulting the limited headroom of 510 of capacity is part icularly important at night since when demand is lower the total volume of capacity running will be lower as the wind penetration increases the constraint becomes less binding this is because 30 of loaded wind can provide response for example in 2030 in 87 of the periods with low frequency response not binding there was more than 300mw of deloaded wind compared with 16 of periods with more than 300mw deloaded wind overall inertia constraint sem only as wind penetration increases the inertia constraint for the sem becomes far more binding there are three main reasons for this as wind generation increases for given hour less thermal generation will be required consequently there would be smaller volume of thermal capacity generating and without response requirements probably less units note this effect on its own would make the low frequency constraint more binding with even higher wind capacity built on the system wind will start being deloaded more frequently this reduces the requirement for thermal generation to provide low frequency response so inertia starts being the main response issue higher frequency requirement will typically lead to more units generating by 2030 there is large 450mw ccs coal unit commissioned in northern ireland apart from renewables this unit is likely to be top of the irish merit order ie lowest variable cost but despite its size it is still is only one unit as far as the inertia constraint is concerned combined with point i this has large effect on the number

they are displacing as result startup costs may increase as the small plants will be run for as short period as possible increase net exports from sem to ew this will increase the volume of generation in the sem so naturally lead to more units being on so more system inertia the cost of this approach will be determined by the shapes of the relevant parts of the two supply curves and whether without the inertia constraint the interconnector would have been constrained it should however be noted that the sem low frequency constraint may also lead to more flows from sem to ew41 deload more wind in the sem this will lead to more thermal generation42 so more system inertia deloading significant am ounts of wind may result in significant increase in system costs figure 118 compares the gb to sem

schedule and so dispatch runs for the sem whilst figure 120 shows when the low frequency and inertia constraints bind for the same period in the s em we see that one or both are binding all the time on days 6 and 9 the inertia constraint is not binding during the day but is binding some of the time at night on days 7 and 8 the inertia constraint is binding much of the time and there are partly as consequence number of periods where the low frequency constraint does not bind day 8 and 9 are nonbusiness days on days 6 and 9 the main changes in dispatch are that there is little more use of peakers to help meet the low frequency response requirement and higher total generation particularly at night as outlined above having more capacity on which here leads to more output helps meet the overnight low frequency requirement due to plants being limited to providing 510 of their capacity as reserve out at the start of day 6 there is 400mw difference in thermal output between the market schedule and so dispatch runs difference of about 50 on days 7 and 8 with the inertia constraint binding much of the time and the low frequency response requirement on thermal capacity falling due to deloaded wind there is much larger change in output patterns for period 10 on day 7 the total thermal generation increases from 700mw to 1500mw more than doubling factors affecting the level of output include the level of demand net of wind and the residual response requirements requirement on thermal plant the mix of plant generating is strongly influenced by the inertia requirement as well as ccgts and coal plant there are ocgts and oil steam plant which primarily contribute to inertia and an advanced ocgt which contributes to low frequency response and inertia ocgts run more at night when inertia is more of an issue and advanced ocgts primarily during the day implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 163 pöyry energy consulting figure 119 example of

they can be brought on within 4 hours to meet errors in forecasts of demand wind generation or thermal plant availability thus the error in wind forecasting that the system operator plans for is taken into account this does not represent the average error in wind generation forecasting but the error that the system operator is planning for we have used two assumptions 25 of wind output our base case or more conservative 50 of wind output in these two cases the so is planning for 25 or 50 of the forecast wind not to be available within 4 hours43 the evolution of the 4hour reserve requirement is shown in figure 121 unsurprisingly the require ment increases over time as the volume of installed wind capacity increases in the base case 25 requirement the requirement in gb rises from 500mw in 2010 to about 11gw in 2030 whilst in the sem it rises from 800mw to 1600mw over the same period increasing the amount of reserve required for wind error in forecasting of 50 significantly increases

requirement in the sem it is very rare for the 4 hour constraint not to be met figure 122 shows how on what proportion of days the 4 hour constraint binds or is not met at some stage th main driver is the capacity margins if there is barely enough capacity to meet demand there clearly is not enough to meet the reserve requirement44 but increasing wind is also factor for gb figure 123 shows the size of the shortfall for 44 we may be slightly overstating this since our availabilities include forced outages but this is part of what the reserve was for there is need for enough capacity to meet

day on days when it is windy t he requirement is higher w hereas when it is not windy the requirement is lower the growth in reserve requirements means more capacity is required that is capable of generating given four hours notice this could be met by building more ocgts which can easily start within one hour from cold or keeping other plant eg coal ccgts sufficiently warm that it can generate given four hours notice figure 125 shows the length of time that plant have been off which are required to provide fourhour reserve in 2010 the average require ment of 6gw almost 4gw is met from plant that is running or has fast ramp rate such as pumped storage or ocgts the remaining 2gw is met from plant that needs to be kept in state whereby it can be brought on rapidly typically through keeping the plant warm by burning fuel in gb there is an increase in the extent plant need to be kept warm for two main reasons firstly the requirements for fourhour reserve increase thus increasing the amount of warming required secondly plant are running at lower load factors and hence are more likely to have been off for longer periods of time particularly in periods with high wind generation finally in gb the market does not deliver peaking new entry only baseload new entry as result much of the requirement for fourhour reserve falls on baseload plant which would be cold except for warming contracts in the sensitivity where we require 50 of wind generation to be held as reserve the requirement on cold plant rises even more sharply to 6gw by 2030 in the charts we do not differentiate by technology it may be much cheaper to keep an oil steam plant warm than ccgt for example which would increase the effect of the increase in the sem the four hour reserve constraint provides little problem in the 25 case due to the relatively large number of ocgt plant that are built thus the requirement can be met without any warming of plant in the 50 case small number of plant will be required to be kept warm though much smaller percentage than in gb the extent that plant need to be kept warm for long periods of time may be minimised through good sharing of reserve but due to the relative size of the markets this is likely to be of limited benefit to gb the reserve requirements and how they are met will vary with our scenarios with less wind for example in the lower res scenario there would clearly be less of an increase in warming requirements given the importance of peaking plant in providing 4 hour reserve another way of reducing warming requirements would be to build more ocgts thus in the capacity payment scenario warming requirements would be much lower implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 169 pöyry energy consulting

becomes of critical importance as the volume of installed wind generation increases as discussed in section 2 the larger the geographic area that installed wind capacity is spaced the more constant and less intermittent the wind generation becomes thus being heavily interconnected to much larger market means that it is possible to smooth out the effects of peaks and troughs in wind generation the sem is small market both in terms of geographic spread and total demand thus it becomes very susceptible to intermittent generation unless it is interconnected to gb in the core scenario significant reinforc ement of existing interconnection is assumed with the eirgrid eastwest interconnector full reverse flows on the existing moyle interconnection and new 500mw link all being built by 2015 currently existing flows on the moyle interconnector are dominated by exports from gb to northern ireland as shown in figure 127 over time this pattern will change in 2015 the expansion of the interconnect ions means that ireland imports an average of 750mw with broadly flat profile across the year the tightening of the gb market in 2016 means that exports reduce by about half from 2020 onwards as the volume of wind grows above 6gw the seasonal profile increasingly shows high imports during the summer when wind is low and lower imports in winter by 2030 january has net exports due to the high wind generation whilst august has the highest imports as wind reduces implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 171 pöyry energy consulting figure 127

scenario with 900mw import and 600mw export unsurprisingly the interconnector is constrained more of the time than before with exports from the sem constrained in 10 of the year in 2020 in the lower interconnection scenario compared to 5 in the core scenario and imports cons trained 30 compared to 20 previously the smaller interconnection causes significant increase in the periods and amount of

whereas by 2015 it is disproportionately in ri by 2030 ccs coal plant has been commissioned in which makes the flows little more balanced the other observation is that the northsouth interconnection is constrained much of the time peaking at about one third of the time in 2025 while we have disproportionately built thermal capacity in building still higher proportion of the thermal new entry in northern ireland may help slightly but probably not that much the interconnection would still be constrained much of the time with the wind deployment and capacity assumed for the core scenario

transfer capacities are based on seasonal temperature ratings and outages they amount to the full value in the winter and the weighted average of the full summer value and summer value when

used parameters eg losses specific to any particular project the losses used are based on moyle however the results can be used to compare our scenarios as figure 135 shows the interconnect or scenario has the highest annual revenues this is to be expected since having less interconnection leads to less convergence of prices the other scenario with higher revenues than the core throughout is the offshore growth scenario there are two reasons for this the concentrated wind increases volatility in gb prices and much of the wind is off the east coast of england in the case of dogger bank well off the east coast this is likely to result in lower correlation with irish wind the scenarios which are lower than the core scenario are the lower res apart from 2016 where the margin in gb is tighter in the lower res and the carbon drop in the lower res with less wind prices are less volatile in the carbon drop wholesale prices are lower on average as would be expected both these effects lead to lower revenues the main drivers of interconnector revenues applying across all scenarios are tight system margins in gb 2016 and 2030 and price volatility which increases as more wind is commissioned 666 how important is interconnection between gb and the continent the modelling undertaken for this study examines flows between gb and the continent however these markets are not modelled fu lly like the gbireland interconnection instead flows are modelled using static border prices with an hourly price profile to simulate continental prices in the netherlands france and belgium these prices have been calculated using mixedinteger linear programming model similar though less sophisticated to zephyr that covers the netherlands germany belgium and france using the same fuel price assumptions as the zephyr scenario thus this modelling does not take account of how gb interconnection may affect these markets not the extent to which wind generation will be altering prices on the continent given this caveat there are still some relevant findings from analysis of the flows and the extent to which interconnection between gb and the continent is being driven by wind currently there is single interconnection linking gb and the continent this is the 2gw ifa interconnexion franceangleterre in our modelling we assume that both britned gb to netherlands is commissioned in 2012 at 1000mw and connection linking gb and belgium comes on line by 2015 700mw thus by 2015 gb is connected to the continent with 37gw of capacity as the installed capacity of wind increases in gb these interconnections become more important in balancing the gb and to lesser extent the sem system figure 136 shows duration curve of continent imports and exports from gb in 2010

january and 20 january period of high wind speeds drives exports from gb to the continent from 20 january wind generation reduces leading to more imports and more balanced position with the

rather than regulatory issues nevertheless the results shed light on number of important points of market design with others for possible future consideration this section of the report draws on an analogy that market design should be like audio equipment ie that it should faithfully reproduce the underlying fundamentals however discordant the design needs to suit the market circumstances and should follow the underlying economic principles of applying prices to whatever is scarce whether this is energy flexibility reliable capacity reserve etc such that the provision of scarce services should be rewarded through transparent market prices available to all providers of the same service to the extent that market prices for the provision of services deviate from this principle long term investment andor short term dispatch are liable to be suboptimal some market design questions relate to differences between gb and the sem while others relate to design aspects which are potentially missing from both markets do capacity payments materially improv outcomes compared to an energyonly market what are the implications of dayahead rather than withinday gate closure are there inefficiencies associated with sim ple as opposed to complex bidding ie allinclusive permwh prices rather than separate pricing for starts and load costs should market pricing capture system operation requirements are there distortions arising from priority dispatch or the form of subsidy for renewables are existing market arrangements adequate to deal with large volumes of renewable generation 671 do capacity payments materially improve outcomes compared to an energyonly market would capacity payment mechanism be more expensive table 29 compares the enduser costs of the current betta mechanism in the core scenario wit h the capacity payment scenario enduser costs represent the cost of buying electricity in the wholesale market plus the cost of subsidies paid to renewables excluding transmission costs48 both scenarios assume the same demand and growth in renewables ccs coal and nuclear generation thus the costs from subsidies is identical in both scenarios more importantly the core scenario includes the assumption that security of supply is maintained requiring 1gw of ocgt build by 2030 which under present assumptions is commercially uneconom ic capacity payment is one potential way of making this build economic 48 this is the hourly market price multiplied by the demand in that hour for all periods in the year plus the cost of rocs in year implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 183 pöyry energy consulting the two scenarios give very different profiles of prices both hourly and at an annual average the core scenario leads to much more volatile prices with peak prices greater than 1000mwh prices also rise significant ly in response to system tightness in particular in 2016 and 2030 when new capacity is required as result enduser costs tend to be more volatile with some periods of much lower costs but also periods of much higher costs recalling the assumption that security of supply is maintained in the core scenario relying on some uneconomic ocgt build the capacity payment scenario generates much flatter prices both daybyday and yearbyyear leading to much more stable though higher given the assumed higher level of investment overall costs by discounting the enduser costs back to 2015 at 8 it is possible to compare the two scenarios between the two scenarios there is marginal difference in cost with the core scenario costing 228bn whilst the capacity payment scenario is 231bn over the period the increase is principally due to the higher generation investment in the capacity payment scenario thus from 2015 to 2030 the choice of market mechanism does not make significant difference to enduser costs the indivisibility of investment to some extent clouds the picture since there is additional ocgt build by 2030 in the capacity payment scenario but less ccgt build in scenario with higher demand growth there may be more opportunity for substitution of ocgt for ccgt build leading to lower

implications of dayahead rather than withinday gate closure an important difference between betta and sem is the timing of gate closure the last time at which participants can take pricing decisions this has its greatest impact on interconnector scheduling since firm prices are fixed at 1000 dayahead for the following day to 0600 2044 hours ahead this restricts the ability of the interconnector to accommodate wind output which is rather uncertain over these timescales it would be possible to conduct model runs whic h explicitly perturb interconnector bidding in order to test inefficiency of these seams issues but this has not been done to date measure of the impact of dayahead gate cl osure may be inferred from the revenue of the interconnector when scheduled efficiently and by inference

implies revenue to the interconnector owner of around 56 million annually with further unquantified benefits in terms of consumer surplus and producer surplus if arbitrarily 10 of this value is lost through early gate closure for interconnector prices the system cost might be estimated to be around 5 million annually by 2030 the potential inefficiency increases sharply albeit with marked contrast

interconnection and the potential efficiency loss associated with dayahead pricing for interconnector trades increases markedly however the absolute sums involved are relatively small implying that dayahead gate closure for interconnector trades is not major impediment to system efficiency 672 are there inefficiencies associated with simple as opposed to complex bidding ie whether to price per mwh or to apply prices for starts load etc the betta market requires generators to price the risk of starts and partloading into simple permwh prices and their own selfdispatch decisions whereas sem permits generators to bid separate incremental start and noload costs with market optimisation of these costs in principle the sem approach reduces risks and commercial freedom for generators with the potential of improving the systemwide optimisation of start and load costs the relative contribution of start and load to prices and to costs gives an indication of the potential significance of the simple bidding rules implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 185 pöyry energy consulting the model calculates wholesale prices as th ree components merit order price

and start costs have limited influence on dispatch costs or market pricing and that the impact of choosing either simple or complex bidding on dispatch efficiency is likely to be rather small perhaps falling rather than rising in the later years 673 should market pricing capture system operation requirements the market pricing in both betta and sem excludes direct consideration of reserve response or transmission constraints and other aspects of flexibility such as the costs of maintaining thermal units in hot standby these services are priced separately outside core market scheduling and pricing processes with varying degrees of market transparency as an indicator of the potential for market distortion if these services are not correctly prices figure 141 shows for the core scenario

re sponse and northsouth constraints in both gb and sem redispatch to meet these constraints on system operation will raise the output of some units and lower the output of other units compared with the market schedule results therefore the absolute mw changes are halved in generating the results the metric does not capture redispatch of wind generation or within technology type for example if ccgt is deloaded to bring on another partloaded ccgt for response provision implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 187 pöyry energy consulting the metric reveals that redispatch for reserve response and the limited transmission constraints modelled is material in sem over 10 of total generation but far lower in gb around 1 the inference is that in gb these issues can more safely be excluded from the core market processes whereas in sem there is far stronger case for the market prices to include these services in some transparent fashion 674 are there distortions arising from priority dispatch or the form of subsidy for renewables the renewable support schemes in the republic of ireland and northern ireland are fundamentally different in ireland wind plants have been assumed to bid with price of zero in northern ireland have been assumed to bid at the negative of the roc price the future treatment of priority dispatch and wind in the sem is under regulatory review at present so these assumptions are designed to test the implications of different bidding behaviour rather than the present reality simple measure is the frequency with which wind generation is deloaded in the republic of ireland and in northern ireland using the core scenario in the market schedule which excludes reserve and response as well as northsouth transmission constraints the number of periods in which some wind is deloaded is very much higher in the republic of ireland than northern ireland the difference is more marked in the so dispatch case with over 2twh of wind deloaded by 2030 93 of the unconstrained wind output compared with 41 in northern ireland table 31 comparison of deloaded wind in and roi core scenario this result implies that if wind generation bids in different ways in the two jurisdictions then there is the potential to transfer significant volumes of renewable generation output between ireland and the uk 675 are existing market arrangements adequate to deal with large volumes of renewable generation this is the most fundamental regulatory question of all the key issue is whether the market will adequately reward the delivery of scarce services in future in support of investment the analysis to date indicates that the key services in future will include the provision of reliable capacity and especially in sem the

collapse or investment in conventional generation cannot continue we have identified that the existing relations hip between system scarcity and the capacity component of market price will need to change in future in the absence of formal capacity payment mechanism in gb key conclusion is that in order for security of supply to be maintained at current levels without significant involvement by the demand side there would need to be material increase in the capacity value accrued by peaking and lowmerit generators compared with that in evidence in todays market in sem the need for flexible generation is we ll served by the existence of capacity payment mechanism however the extent of redispatch for reserve and frequency response compared with the market schedule suggests that some form of market pricing for the delivery of flexibility is desirable to ensure that these services are adequately rewarded 68 system security 681 will the system be less secure than at present for the purposes of this study we have assumed that sufficient generation will be built to ensure that maximum of two periods of supply loss will be experienced on average across the 8 monte carlo simulations this has been informed by the standard for the sem of 8 hours lole loss of load expectati on which we have reduced to two hours to take into account that we are not modelli ng transmission constraints on linebyline basis we believe that two hours gives reasonable view as to the tightest that system might be permitted to get to either before the system operator intervenes as in the sem or the market or government intervened in gb in reality with transmission constraints the loss of load would be greater number of periods than this as result of this assumption the simple answer to the question posed above is that in our results the system will remain as secure as present since that is an input to our modelling nevertheless the study reveals more in the nature of the security margin and the stresses which will affect it in present particularly the economics of provision of low merit generation capacity to ensure that maximum of two hours lole is met in order to maintain sufficient generation capacity we assume that at any given level of system margin the value of capacity is significantly higher than at present although the average levels on time weighted average basis are similar and assumes that plants operating at the relevant times are able to capture the full capacity value for those hours in gb absent capacity mechanism this still does not permit economic build of ocgt which achieve very low load factor this issue merits further consideration for this study we have examined syst em security using three measures hourly capacity margin expected energy unserved and periods when n1 contingency is breached50 50 the n1 requirement is that system security must be maintained in the event of the loss of the largest infeed load we define this being brea ched if insufficient capacity is available to cover this loss ie system margins drop below the n1 requirement implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 189 pöyry energy consulting the analysis is based on the market schedule run this is because the englandscotland transmission constraint rarely binds and it is most likely to bind when it is windy when capacity margins are not likely to be tight in sem while the niri constraint binds more frequently this is again most likely to be when it is windy there are number of caveats with our approach we model demand with hourly resolution so do not fully model the possibility of demand being higher at some point within the hour there will be times when in zephyr demand can be met but there is not enough capacity left over to cover low frequency response in mitigation we base generation availability on actual data so that outages are taken into account in our availabilities there is an increasing number of periods particularly in gb with insufficient spare capacity to meet the reserve requirement an investigation of the implications of this is beyond the scope of this report but the effect is not likely to be major in reality the reserve and response requirements do not produce 100 security if for example two eprs have outages in short space of time 05 hours or the wind forecast error is more than assumed in the reserve requirement there may be additional unserved energy however as these events are likely to be very rare this is likely to be fairly small contribution we have not modelled interconnector outages we have not modelled most transmission constraints noting that is hard to predict where these will be in 20 years time we have assumed there is always sufficient capacity available in continental europe to cover imports to gb examining this issue is beyond the scope of this study 682 how will capacity margins change assuming that system security standards are maintained as we do in the core scenario increasing wind penetration will lead to more periods with greater capacity margins this is shown in figure 142 for gb for historical years of 2006 2007 and 2008 with very little wind generation along with 2016 and 2030 where there is increasing wind generation although the number of very tight periods is similar between historical and future years the capacity margin on average is much greater in 2016 and even more so in 2030 this reflects the extra generation that is required as backup for the periods where there is little or wind generation

than the highest margin in 2015 however in the 10 of periods with the tightest margin capacity margins are smaller in 2030 our hourly prices contain value of capacity when the margin is less than about 30 in 2016 and 2030 the two years with the most unserved energy in 2016 36 of periods have capacity margin of less than 30 this compares to 16 in 2030 for sem the duration curve would change

the reasons outlined we have unser ved energy demand in sem in gb in the core scenario the unserved energy averaged over monte carlo scenarios is 1120mwh in 2016 240mwh in 2025 1930mwh in 2030 and zero in other years we believe these are comparable with historical values it is interesting to note that in 2016 there are 15 periods year with unserved energy 5 of which are less than 200mwh whereas in 2030 despite the unserved energy being 70 higher than in 2016 there are 175 periodyear with unserved energy very small increase on 2016 in 2030 only two periods have loss of load below 200mwh this difference is due to the increased volume of wind generation with the tight periods becoming more extreme the ied scenario has high energy unserved in 2020 as result of the large number of plant being retired in very short period of time which leads to particularly tight system margin for year in this scenario by 2025 the extra nuclear coal ccs and wind being built eases the system tightness

methodology in this study has been to build capacity so as to limit the number of periods with unserved energy per year to two periods in practice there would be more for reasons outlined at the start of this section additionally since there are fewer periods with small capacity margins for new entry to be viable there needs to be more value of capacity in those periods where the system is tight see section 25 value of capacity prices also need to be peaky for existing plant such as class ccgts to recover their annual fixed costs51 684 what are the implications for the n1 contingency as further measure of system tightness in gb be have looked at periods where the spare capacity is less than the largest load52 this again ignores the interconnection with sem which may overstate the number of periods whereas we include the full capacity from the continent which may in reality understate the number of periods this is shown in figure 145 again averaged across monte carlo scenarios the increase follows similar patte rn to the unserved energy with the greatest number of periods in 2016 and 2030 51 this is consequence of class ccgts running at low load factors as with the closure of the oil steam plant and lack of new entry ocgt s there is little below them in the merit order 52 note that this level of spare capacity wo uld more than meet the low frequency response requirement

conclusions the study has focused on the following main question how could the impact of intermittent generation required to meet targets for renewables and decarbonisation of generation affect the wholesale energy markets in gb and ireland the conclusions to aspects of this question are summarised below wind generation how intermittent and how correlated is wind generation unsurprisingly there is considerable intermi ttency in wind generation and system with high levels of installed wind capacity will have significant variations to manage periods of very low wind generation less than 5 of installed capacity across either gb or ireland will happen infrequently but may last up to few days equally periods with very high wind generation will exist thus with our installed capacity assumptions for 2020 at the top 3 demand hours for the last 8 years wind generation covers between 1 and 48 of demand in gb and 3 and 82 of demand in the sem there is some variation of wind between different years and with an assumption of 33gw of capacity in gb in 2020 variation of between 83twh and 93twh in our eight monte carlo years variation of 12 in the sem higher annual variation of 21 is found in 2020 with 61gw of wind capacity due to the smaller size of the market in generation terms this is between 146twh and 177twh there is some correlation r2 of 044 between wind in the sem and in gb both markets experience periods when average wind speeds or wind generation are either very high or very low together with our deployment of wind turbines there are periods when wind generation in gb is high over 90 of capacity and at the same time low below 10 of capacity in the sem unsurprisingly different locations have different capacity factors with offshore wind having much higher capacity factors than onshore wind the demand which must be met by nonwind capacity demand net wind will be much more variable than the current demand profile in gb in 2030 demand varies between 30gw and 70gw however demand net wind varies between zero and 65gw considerably greater range as result of the wind in the sem there is similar relationship the range of hourly demand ac ross the year is 5gw but demand net wind rises to 11gw by 2030 as regards the hourly change in demand that the thermal system will face ramping of demand net wind in gb by 2020 the maximum hourly change that nonintermittent generation is found to face is 127gw up and 97gw down by 2030 this has increased to 152gw up and 124gw down thus 152gw of generation has to be brought on line for single hour in the worst case scenario covered in our analysis in the sem hourly ramping of demand net wind increases from 21gw in 2020 to 24gw in 2030 implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 196 pöyry energy consulting market prices to what extent will market prices change and how will volatility increase increased penetration of wind is likely to make prices become much more peaky with more periods with very high or very low prices this is because the system will alternate between having too much capacity in periods with high wind speeds and high wind generation and much tighter capacity when there are low wind speeds equally the market arrangements in gb mean that some very high prices will be required if generation is to recover its fixed or investment costs market prices principally in gb may be negative at times as result of renewable generation bidding at its marginal cost which in gb and northern ireland might include the negative of the roc value in the sem although prices will become more volatile than currently they will not be as volatile as gb prices setting aside the pric floor and cap which are presently in place there may be more low and zero priced periods than in gb due to the higher volumes of wind generation as share of the market but very few negative priced periods due to the market design as result of our assumed bidding of wind in roi at zero the extremes of high prices that gb may experience will be tempered in the sem due to the capacity payment mechanism although gb will maintain strong influence on sem prices across all the scenarios and years there is definite relationship that as wind generation increases overall smps decrease in gb an increase of 10twh of wind generation drops prices by about 06mwh whilst in the sem an increase of 10twh reduces prices by 7mwh 76mwh an increase of 10twh of wind generation is much greater share in the sem than in gb which explains the stark difference in the results plant operation how will plant load factors starts and on times be affected by intermittency load factors of conventional thermal plant are strongly impacted by high volumes of wind and baseload generation in gb by 2020 load factors of older eclass ccgts are below 10 and newer fclass plant are under 60 whilst coal is at 50 the main reason for this is the reducing space for these plant to operate in with rising volumes of baseload nuclear ccs coal and biomass plant and increasing volumes of lowcost intermittent generation the running patterns of conventional plant by 2020 are increasingly the inverse of wind generation as regards running patterns different plant types are affected in different ways newer f class ccgts have an increasing number of starts and reducing period when they are on in 2010 they typically run with 50 starts and are on for around 70 hours 3 days this will be running 5 days week for some units and less for others by 2020 the number of starts has increased to 90 year with units on for only 60 hours by 2030 they start 120 times year and run for about 25 hours however older eclass ccgts have fewer starts in 2010 they typically run twoshift running for around 14 hours when on and starting 140 times year the number of starts then falls as the units are called upon to operate less and less so that by 2020 they are starting only 20 times year and operating 13 hours each time in the sem the significant change in operating patterns for coal and ccgts that was observed in the gb market is not seen even though wind penetration is much greater this is mainly due to the existence of lar ger numbers of peaking plant the less efficient peaking plant start 810 times year and are on for 3 to 4 hours with the advanced gts starting 100 times year with similar on times implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 197 pöyry energy consulting overall although the amount of co 2 emitted from starting and partloading plant does increase it still remains small share of the total and unlikely to be of significance until the volume of zero carbon generation drops to very small levels new thermal generation what is the outlook for new thermal generation the amount of new thermal generation required in the core scenario is relatively low until 2030 primarily due to low assumed demand growth until 2030 and very significant growth in renewables and biomass in gb the highest returns are to nuclear plant across all the scenarios this is due to the absence of volume risk which means that unlike thermal plant they are unlikely to have depressed load factors due to large volumes of wind across all scenarios coal and ccs coal do not make sufficient returns to permit new build in our modelling conventional coal returns on areal pretax basis vary from 1 to 7 across the years whilst ccs coal returns vary from 48 to 65 all well below the indicative threshold of 810 for required for investment returns to ccgts are highly variable in the core scenario when new ccgt build is required primarily in 2030 returns on plant ri sufficiently high to incentivise new build though the value of capacity in years when there are sufficient system margins plant returns drop substantially in 2016 given much tighter system margins irrs on ccgts rise towards new entry levels the capacity payment scenario leads to very different outcome with regards to plant returns in gb payment for availability means that ocgts become profitable as they are in all scenarios in the sem ccgt returns ar lower in this scenario particularly from 2020 onwards this is because payments from the capacity mechanism are not sufficient to recompense fully the higher fixedcapital costs of ccgts vs ocgts in the sem there is much greater consistency of outcome between scenarios due to the presence of the cpm thus returns to ocgt peaking plant remain above 8 in all scenarios and all years and are stable between 89 this is because the vast majority of ocgt revenue comes from the capacity paym ent rather than varying wholesale prices since these plant run at very low load factors returns to ccgts in the sem vary and in particular are affected by the gb market hence if the gb market remains with the current betta market arrangements returns in the sem are high as result of high wholesal prices imported from gb typically between 7 in lower years and 9 in higher years returns to irish ccgts are likely to be lower if there is capacity payment mechanism in gb that suppresses peak price levels wind revenue to what extent is wind revenue depressed by windonwind competition and how much might be deloaded wind revenue is depressed as more wind generation comes on the system in the core scenario for gb in 2010 the wind capture price is higher than the twa53 price as 53 timeweighted average price the simple average of all hourly prices in year implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 198 pöyry energy consulting result of more wind generation in winter months when wholesale prices are higher by 2016 this reverses with wind capturing 5mwh less than the twa price as increasing volumes of wind generation affect peak prices in particular by 2030 wind captures 13mwh less than market prices significant drop in the sem in the core scenario the effect of wind revenue cannibalisation is similar in 2010 wind earns above the twa price as in gb but by 2020 earnings are 5mwh 54mwh below twa prices and by 2030 the gap is 12mwh 13mwh there is substantial variation between different sites with spread between locations in gb of 5mwh with the highest revenue location in stornoway north scotland and the lowest in rhyl on the northwales coast there is an approximate relationship between the amount of wind capacity in the gb market and the discount to twa prices that wind generation obtains with 10gw installed wind captures approximately the twa price for every further 1gw installed wind capture prices drop further 025mwh below the twa price reserve and response how do requirements for reserve and response change and what are the implications as the installed capacity of wind in market increases the amount of response and reserve that needs to be held and the signifi cance of reserve and response grows in gb there is little difference in plant load factors due to the need to meet reserve and response requirements but the trend is for the load factor of low load factor plant to rise slightly and the load factor of high load factor plant to fall slightly compared with the market schedule there is an increase in the amount of plant being partloaded to provide secondary frequency response in the sem there is much larger change in plant load factors there are particularly large increases in the load factors of peaking plant and coal plant with the increase in peaking plant primarily due to the response constraints four hour reserve in both markets becomes increasingly significant as wind penetration increases assuming an uncertainty of 25 in wind forecasting four hours ahead the system operator plans for the worst case rather than the average four hour reserve requirements in gb will rise from 5g w in 2010 to over 10gw by 2030 for january business days to cover possible errors in wind forecasting in the sem the requirement rises from 800mw to almost 1200mw by 2030 in the sem the four hour reserve is largely met from operating plant or peaking plant held in reserve as result very little other plant needs to be kept warm in warm state so that it can synchronise within four hours however in gb the market design and low plant returns in the core scenario mean that very little peaking generation is buil t this means that the four hour reserve requirement has to be met in large part from plant that cannot respond when cold in four hour timeframe and would be required to be kept warm interconnection and transmission how important is interconnection and how are future flows impacted by wind the interconnection between gb and the sem becomes of critical significance as the volume of installed wind generation increases the larger the geographic area over which installed wind capacity is situated the more constant and less intermittent the wind generation becomes thus being heavily interconnected to much larger market means implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 199 pöyry energy consulting that it is possible to smooth out the variation in wind generation the sem is small market both in terms of geographic spread and total demand thus it becomes very susceptible to intermittent generation except through its interconnection to gb however building large amount of interconnection has the effect of depressing its own revenues as prices equalise between markets and this may make significant interconnection between markets difficult on commercialonly basis transmission flows between scotland and england increase substantially in the core scenario with the high volumes of renewable capacity built in scotland the core scenario assumes significant reinforcement of existing capacity in 2016 which largely alleviates northsouth constraints hence peak flows in 2020 reach our assumed capacity of 76gw but only on small number of days the trend of flows from north to south remains but over time an increasing volume of flow transits into scotland from england during low wind periods north of the border between the roi and the core scenario assumes limited increase in transmission capacity from 400mw in 2010 to 700mw in 2015 as result there are significant constraints on flows from roi to due to relatively more volumes of wind generation built in roi market arrangements are existing arrangements fit for purpose our modelling has assumed that existing standards of security of supply are maintained and we have reviewed the value of capacity which is required to support the necessary investment however we have identified that the existing relationship between system scarcity and the capacity component of market price will need to change in future in the absence of formal capacity payment mechanism in gb ke conclusion is that in order for security of supply to be maintained at current levels without significant involvement by the demand side there would need to be material increase in the capacity value accrued by peaking and lowmerit generators compared with that in evidence in todays market in sem the need for flexible generation is we ll served by the existence of capacity payment mechanism however the extent of redispatch for reserve and frequency response compared with the market schedule suggests that some form of market pricing for the delivery of flexibility is desirable to ensure that these services are adequately rewarded system security how may system security change this study assumes as an input that system security is maintained to maximum of 2 hours lossofload expectation per year thus we cannot judge whether system security is higher or lower with more wind however increasing wind penetration will lead to more periods with greater capacity margins alt hough the number of very tight periods is similar between historical and future years the capacity margin on average is much greater in 2016 and even more so in 2030 this reflects the extra generation that is required as backup for the periods where there is little or wind generation in gb in the core scenario the unserved energy averaged over monte carlo scenarios is 1120mwh in 2016 240mwh in 2025 1930mwh in 2030 and zero in other years which is comparable with historical values with increasing wind penetration the amount of unserved energy implications of intermittency 1 may 2009 207_intermittencyreportv2_0doc 200 pöyry energy consulting increases although the number of periods remains the same this is due to the increased volume

however still sample day model as extending this model is outside the scop of this study zephyr can be run in two modes market schedule and so system operat or dispatch these are sometime referred to as unconstrained and constrained ru ns respectively the market schedule run aims to simulate what the market dayahead or t gate closure would produce for plant operation and prices the so dispatch

capability to meet low frequency lf response requirements primary in sem secondary in gb13 4 hour reserve requirements inertia sem only low frequency response is the capability to respond to drop in system frequency typically caused by trip forced outage of another unit typically primary response covers timescales up to 30 seconds from the outage while secondary response covers timescales from 30 seconds to 30 minutes from the outage reserve is the ability to cover unforeseen increases in generatio n requirements14 over timescales longer than secondary response in this study we model the 4 hour requirement capability ability of increase output with 4 h ours notice 13 the assumption is that these are the most im portant when secondary is met in gb primary will normally be met and when primary is met in sem secondary wil l normally be met the difference in what is most important relates to the relative sizes of the two markets 14 for example due to higher than expected dem and lower than expected wind availability plant outages beyond the low frequency response requirements implications of intermittency appendices may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 6 pöyry energy

the system frequency must be within 02hz of 50hz between 0 and 30s after an outage the frequency is allowed to drop to 492hz between 30s and 30m from the outage the frequency must be abo ve 495hz this lowers the requirement for sudden increase in power plant output 17 the ratio of the rates pumped storage facility can pump and generate 18 in reality the units which are not pumping or generating

model is to transform the hourly w ind speed data into realistic hourly wind generation profiles for the uk and sem markets the scope of the model includes geographical coverage of the two markets under investiga tion covering wind generation that is envisaged to be deployed in the uk and sem markets up to 2030 therefore it is necessary for the model to account for onshore an d offshore wind generation that is expected to enter into the markets of gb nd sem in order to provide adequate coverage 27 gb sites have been lected 19 onshore and 8 offshore while 9 sites were selected for the sem 8 onshore and 1 offshore the reasoning for the number of chosen sites and other data assumpti ons is presented in subsequent sections the methodology used for this model has been derived from revi ew of the available literature particularly the work carried out under the auspices f the european trade wind project and through dialogue with founders and members of t he intermittency study flow chart of the model is shown in figure 6 the following section briefly explains the steps of the methodology figure 6 flow diagram of the pöyry wind model met office and met éireann datawind speed aggregated

location per wind region which is necessary to introduce for purposes of validation power output is aggregated to the regional level via regional adjustment factor 111 power curves the power curve converts the uplifted wind speed into power output power curves are provided by wind turbine manufacturers and define the electri cal output of single turbine for range of wind speeds therefore the generation profi for single turbine can be simulated by recording the output for given wind speed at certain point in time if wind speed data were on an hourly basis the hourly generation pr ofile of single wind turbine could be estimated using this method the wind generation profile from group of turbines covering dispersed area cannot be represented by normal power curve the reason for this is primaril the spatial and temporal distribution of wind over the area covered by the win d farm in question the cumulative effect of these variations is to smooth the standa rd power curve the extent to which smoothing occurs is defined by the charac teristics eg physical dimensions terrain profile of the area in question given the scope of the w ind model is to produce hourly generation profiles for the markets in question implies that the smoothing must be taken into account the smoothed power curve also known as the aggregated power curve represents the cumulative effect of number of wind turbines dispersed over given area on the power output profile the objective of the power curve model is to produce two generic aggregate power curves for use in the wind model one for onsh ore sites and one for offshore sites the methodology for producing the aggregated power curve is as follows 24 met masts are the meteorological mast s which measure windspeed temperature precipitation and other

aggregated power curve by mapping modified wind spe ed to standard power curve the method was applied to two turbine profiles 3mw turb ine representing onshore sites and 5mw turbine representing offshore sites the two turb ine profiles were chosen with input from study founders the reason for choosi ng relatively large 3mw turbine to serve as being representative of onshore sites is to better account for generation at low wind speeds the offshore turbine of 5mw capacity was selected because offshore sites generally use turbines with the largest technically feasible capacity as result of the expense involved in the construction of offshor wind farms given that this study extends to 2030 it is likely that turbines with capacity of at l east 5mw will be deployed figure 7 aggregated

corresponding to wi nd speeds of between 14 ms and 25 ms or 30 ms for the offshore turbine in the standa rd power curve is shorter in the case of the aggregated power curve validation of the aggregated power curve entails comparison between the total annual energy output of hypothetical wind turbine based on the standard power curve profile and the energy output of hypothetical unit based

wind farm sites the areas of interest are scattered across the whole uk and its coastal waters interest also extends to some sea areas far from l and but data provision for these areas is being dealt with separately the areas sidered here have been denoted in figure 1 anemometer sites that made hourly wind observations over the peri od 20002007 were chosen to provide the best possible representation of each rea within the constraint of using maximum of 26 sites ultimately it was decided that th 7 areas over sea would be better represented with modelderived wind data than by anemo meter data from an adjacent coastline leaving 19 anemometer stat ions to represent the land areas figures 2a and 2b show available anemometer site s of possible relevance to the areas of interest

fundamentally governed by atmospheric pressure gradi ents and in particular in the uk by the degree of proximity to the most f requent track of atlantic storms northeastwards between scotland and iceland on this ba sis average wind speeds might be expected to be somewhat stronger towards the rthwest of the uk however in practice wind speed at specific location can be greatly modified by number of other factors away from local obstructions such as adja cent trees or buildings the most important of these factors are the roughness of the surf ace over which the wind blows the topographical setting of the location and the gradual increase in mean wind speed with site altitude an additional consideration is height above ground or sea surface as wind speed decreases from about 600m height towards the surface the rate of decrease being greatest near the surface and function f surface roughness e21 influence of largescale topography the influence of topography on wind speed and direction i s on both large and small spatial scales examples of large scale topographic influences would be the funnelling of westsouthwesterly winds through the central lowlands of scotla nd and the sheltering of the same land corridor from northerly and southerly winds by the sco ttish highlands and southern uplands in the context of this report large scale topography is taken to mean features of horizontal extent similar to or greater than the sizes of the areas of interest marked in figure 1 in choosing the anemometer sites for this pro ject the aim has been for each site to represent largescale topographic zone pöyry energy consulting may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 66 may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 67 pöyry energy consulting e22 influence of smallscale topography wind speed is also modified by smallerscale hi lls hollows ridges and valleys so that in the vicinity of such features additional topographic influ ence on wind speed will remain to greater or lesser extent depending on atmospheric condit ions the atmosphere behaves as if it had rigid ceiling thus hills and valle ys represent constrictions to the wind flow between the surface and this ceiling causing acce leration at the point of constriction ie over the hill or ridge summit however this i s an extremely simplistic model and real influences of topography are very complex for in stance for an isolated hill the wind may preferentially blow around the sides of the hill rather than over the summit also the impact of topography will usually be differ ent for different wind directions so that systematic estimation of the net impact of topography over all wind directions is major yet uncertain undertaking and is not atte mpted here deep valleys are particularly difficult to assess and according to wind direct ion may act as funnels or be cut off from the main wind flow many but by means ll of the chosen anemometer sites are in flat terrain where significant sm all scale topographic influences are unlikely attention is drawn to anemometer sites for which there should be an awareness of possible small scale topographic influences it should be kept in mind that some of the turbine sites may also be subject to small scale topographic infl uences not represented by the chosen anemometer station e23 influence of terrain and sea roughness within about 600m of the land or sea surface the wind spe ed which would occur in free air is reduced by friction over the surface the retarding effect increasing as the surface is approached for this reason wind speeds increase with height above ground or sea the degree of retardation towards the surface is dependant u pon surface roughness and some impact of surface roughness is derived from up to several tens f kilometres upwind however typically well over 50 of the influence is from within 12 kilometres of the site except in storm conditions sea rfaces are the smoothest and cause the least resistance to wind flow next come bare flat land surfaces fo llowed by increasingly rough surfaces as the proportion of land covered by trees buildings nd windbreaks increases the roughest surfaces being the intensely builtup areas of city centres on this basis cook 1885 defined six surface roughness categories 05 and provide d descriptive definitions of each as follows this reference also provides photographic illustration of each category terrain roughness category 0 large expanses of water mudflats snowcovered farmland large areas of flat tarmac terrain roughness category 1 flat grassland parkland or bare soil without hedges and with very few isolated obstructions terrain roughness category 2 the meteorological standard typical uk farmland with nearly flat or gently undulating countryside fields crops fences or low boundary hedges and few trees terrain roughness category 3 farmland with frequent high boundary hedges occasional small farm structures houses or trees terrain roughness category 4 dense woodland or domesti c housing typically between 10 and 20 plan area density terrain roughness category 5 city centres comprising mostly 4storey buildings or higher typically between 30 and 50 plan area density may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 68 pöyry energy consulting using maps and photographs terrain roughness category has bee n assigned to each anemometer site this could not be highprecision exercise especially at sites typical of coasts with marked differences in surface roughness trajectory accord ing to wind direction in such cases biased average was estimated giving greater weight to terrain roughness towards the southwesterly direction quarter as winds bl ow more frequently from this quarter at most uk sites the terrain category allocated to each anemometer site is listed in the 4th column of annex in practice all sites had an overall terrain roughness category between 0 and 3 with cases of 4 or 5 i t is assumed that the criteria for choice of wind turbine sites will also rule out consideration of terrain categories 4 and 5 e24 influence of anemometer or turbine height above surface the conventional height for meteorological anem ometer cups is 10m above the ground at few locations the cups are at nonstandard height but t heir speeds can be corrected to the standard 10m height column 5 of annex gives height for each anemometer in practise because the rate of increase in wind speed with hei ght above ground varies with surface roughness it is useful to combine the two effects to obtain an overall terrain roughness anemometer height correction for each site table 94 of cook 1985 gives such combined factors for the specific case of converting wind speed s from any terrain category and height above surface to 10m above terrain category 2 the meteorological standard however from this table conversions between any oth er terrain categoryanemometer height pair can be deduced using this ta ble and the terrain category and height attributed to each anemometer series of division factors has been derived to convert wind speeds from each anem ometer to wind speeds at 10m above any other terrain category 0 1 2 or 3 these division factors are given in columns 69 of annex e25 influence of altitude above sea level altitude over the site above mean sea level should not be fused with the height of the anemometer or turbine above the ground or sea and considered in section 24 on average wind increases gradually with altitude of site abo ve mean sea level according to cook 1985 the rate of increase varies with wind speed but i s typically 100007 of the basic wind speed for each metre above mean sea level on this b asis column 10 of annex gives division factors to correct winds speeds from the alti tude of each anemometer site to sea level obviously many wind turbine sites will not be at sea level but knowledge of this correction allows standardisation of l data to common altitude mean sea level for comparison purposes and also potentially as prior step to further correcting the data to the attitude of wind turbine sit in columns 1114 of annex the altitude factor for each anemometer site is combined with the corresponding terrainanemometer height corrections from columns 69 to provide t of division factors for standardising the wind data from each anemometer sit to 10 m above sea level over any terrain type 0 1 2 or 3 e3 application of wind sp eed scaling factors the simplest but crudest way to use the supplied wind data would be to choose the most representative anemometer site and use the data from that site without any correction given the likely spatial variations within an area as discussed in section 2 the allocated anemometer site will often represent specific turbine site nly very crudely the following method would improve upon using the data witho ut modification may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 69 pöyry energy consulting i choose the most representative available anemograph site u sually the one or one of the two or three attributed to the area i n which the turbine is located see figures 2a and 2b ii assess the terrain category of the turbine site according to th criteria given in section 23 reference to example photographs in cook 1985 might aid this assessment iii for the chosen anemometer site obtain the correction facto r for that turbine terrain type from columns 11 12 13 or 14 of annex an d divide all wind speeds by this factor to obtain equivalent turbine site wind speeds standardised to 10m height and sea level altitude iv correct the resulting wind speeds to the altitude above an sea level of the turbine site by adding 007 to the wind speed for very metre altitude see section 24 v correct to the height above ground or sea of the turbine b multiplying by the factor for the appropriate terrain category and height in annex b annex b has been derived from table 94 of cook 1985 e4 comments on the chosen anemometer sites the following brief notes are offered regarding the chosen anemometer sites the numbered areas refer to those denoted on the map at figure 1 the location of each anemometer site is illustrated by the maps at figures 2a and 2 b with the chosen anemometer sites labelled in red area 1 hebrides chosen site stornoway the available choice was between two sites the other sout h uist being on the south west side of the islands and so even more exposed to atlantic storms stornoway on the slightly less exposed northeast side of the islands was chosen s more generally representative and because the potential wind farm sites curren tly being considered are close to stornoway nonetheless the anemomet er is on well exposed flat open airfield with sea only 300 metres to the northnortheast it is also recommended that stornoway be used fo r any coastal turbine sites in area 2a the northern half of area 2 including skye see below area 2 northwest scotland chosen sites stornoway loch glasca rnoch and dunstaffnage this is large area of complex terrain encompassing wide ran ge of exposures the dunstaffnage site though coastal is also quite landlocked being in the firth of lorne rather than adjacent to open sea it is also in relative ly sheltered northeastfacing bay rather than having direct sea exposure to the southwest much f the land from east through to southsouthwest of the anemometer is forested fo r these reasons the site has been attributed relatively high terrain roughness categ ory see column 4 of annex although it has been chosen as the nearest anemometer to several potential turbine sites it is particularly important in this case that correction procedure such as that documented in section 3 is applied to the data for any sites on skye or the more directly exposed mainland coastline northward s from mull use of the stornoway data would be more appropriate even though strictly stornoway is in area 1 may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 70 pöyry energy consulting loch glascarnoch has been chosen in an attempt to represent inl and upland but not mountaintop sites in the scottish highlands whether in area 2 or area 3 it is situated near the border between these two areas in bare but hummocky t errain 265m above mean sea level the site is near the summit watershed divide of two valleys together forming westnorthwest to eastsoutheast land corridor nonethe less in all other directions the site is surrounded by higher ground when consi dering both loch glascarnoch and potential turbine sites in the highlands i t must be appreciated that there will be huge spatial variations in smallscale topographic inf luences on wind flow in this complex terrain the choice of loch glascarnoch merely caters for the large scale topographic influence of the highlands as whole possib ly acting as an obstruction around which winds to some extent may be deflected the t opographic exposure of loch glascarnoch is unlikely to be repres entative of high mountain summits even after correction because of the difference in smallscale topographic co ntext for the purpose of anemometer site selection it has been assumed that none of the proposed turbine sites are on high mountain summits say above 1000m altitude in ch case met office advice should be sought area 3 northeast scotland chosen sites wick kinloss inverbervi and loch glascarnoch loch glascarnoch is near the border between area 3 and area 2 an d is intended to represent inland upland portions of both zones see area 2 f or greater comment wick kinloss and inverbervie are all nearcoastal but represent coastl ines of different aspect wick represents the promontory of the far northeast of scotland nd probably is the best representation for the similarlyshaped promontory around peterhead converging towards inverness from either of these promontories in creasing topographic shelter by scottish highlands seems likely in particular the northfacing coastline eastwards from inverness represented by kinloss lies in the lee of the cairngorms as far as the prevailing south westerly winds are concerned and so migh t be expected to be somewhat less windy the eastsoutheastfacing coastline sout hwards of peterhead through aberdeen towards the firth of fife is represented by inverbervie and may have different characteristics again although having high grou nd to the west this coastline is exposed to the south and southsouthwest and also especially towards i ts southern end lies almost in line with the land corridor of the central lowla nds through which the prevailing westsouthwesterly winds funnel it should however be born in mind that the inverbervie anemometer is on coastal hilltop and therefore particularly exposed area 4 central lowlands of scotland chosen site drumalbin although termed central lowlands this broad westsouthwest to eastnortheast corridor of land from roughly glasgow to edinburgh to dundee contains several clumps of hills and these are assumed to be the more likely sites fo r wind turbines hence the chosen anemometer site of drumalbin is at the relatively high ltitude of 245m albeit better described as being on undulating plateau rather th an hill top the central lowlands of scotland may be considered as very distinct largescale topographical zone in terms of wind climatology channelling and funnelling winds from the prevailing westsouthwest and from the eastnortheast while being she ltered from northerly and southerly winds area 5 northern ireland chosen site lough fea may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 71 pöyry energy consulting at 225m altitude this is the highest available site howe ver its exposure is not particularly high the site being in broad highlevel valley with some trees probably best described as category 3 terrain roughness apart from fetch across small lake to the west and southwest for the latter reason an overall category 2 has be attributed area 6 southern uplands of scotland chosen west freugh but also drumalbin and boulmer the area numbered 6 in figure 1 is somewhat misleading as t he southeastern sector of the area numbered 4 central lowlands as marked actually cove rs the eastern side of the southern uplands the southern edge of the central lowlands along with the southern uplands contains broad westeast swath of potenti turbine sites some being on the west or south coasts some being eastcoastal and many being inland west freugh is intended to represent lowland sites towards th west of the area and in particular sites within few kilometres of the west or south coasts lowland sites towards the east of the southern uplands and in particular those w ithin few kilometres of the north sea coast would be better represented by boulmer area 7 inland upland areas would be better represented by drumalbin on the edge of are 4 area 8 lancashire chosen sites walney island and winter hil l walney island is lowlying but very exposed location and is i ntended to represent the lancashire coastline the inclusion of winter hill is to cate r for any wind farms on top of the pennines this site is by far the highestaltitude site i n the list being on top of an exposed 440m summit northwest of manchester area 9 northeast england chosen site boulmer coastal boulmer best represents eastcoastal locations whether in northeast england or southeast scotland however correction to higher terrain rough ness category should also enable it to give reasonable representation of inl and sites area 10 north wales chosen site rhyl like the scottish highlands the complex often hilly or mount ainous terrain of wales is particularly difficult to represent by available anemometer sites although rhyl is known as coastal resort its anemometer site is actually several kilometres in land in category 3 terrain also being on northfacing slope the site may be fforded some additional shelter from the prevailing southwesterly wind direction none theless it is probably the best available representation of noncoastal sites in north w ales provided appropriate corrections are made for differences in terrain roughness and altit ude and provided it is not used to represent high mountaintop should the tter be necessary use of modelled data for area 7 andor 12 is recommended still foll owing the correction procedure documented in section 3 for northcoastline sites pa rticular care should be taken to apply lower terrain roughness category probably rrain category 1 as compromise between open sea to the north and land to the so uth given that this coastline faces away from the prevailing sout hwesterly wind flow and lies in the lee of high ground to the south some reduction in mean wind speed relative to many other coastlines nonetheless seems likely an alternative way of tre ating turbine sites on or just offshore from the north wales shoreline might be to interp olate between the rhyl data and the modelled data for area 7 and which represents conditi ons well offshore note that anglesey has much greater exposure to the southwest and for potential turbine sites on anglesey it would be more appropriate to use the mode lled area 7 data correcting it from category 0 terrain roughness to category 1 may 2009 208_intermittencyreportappendices_v2_0doc 72 pöyry energy consulting area 11 east yorkshirehumberside chosen site bridlington coastgua rd bridlington was chosen because of the rather sheltered exposure f leconfield and because some of the potential turbine sites are coastal how ever although the site is on low cliff top very exposed to winds from northeast through to south the housing estates of bridlington lie nearby to the west and southwe st as this is the most frequent wind direction the overall terrain category for the site has b een assessed as 2 for most rural sites along the coastline correction to category 1 woul d be appropriate the attributed anemometer height of 15m is actually compromise bet ween its height above the land surface and its height above the sea surface at the foot of the shallow cliff area 13 central wales chosen site trawsgoed this area has proved the most difficult of all to represent given the sparse anemometer network and valleylocation of all stations with sufficient record the selected site of trawsgoed is exception lying in northwestsoutheast alig ned valley otherwise surrounded by hills local valley effects may well apply and wou ld be very difficult to assess the best guidance is probably that trawsgoed should rep resent similar topographic locations but should be used with caution as t he correction factors given here in annex take account of any additional smallscale topog raphic influences for hill top or high plateau sites in central wales it would be wiser to use the offshore modelled data for area 12 applying an appropriate terrain category an d altitude correction areas 14 and 16 the fens and norfolk chosen site witte ring this is straightforward choice of flat wellexposed ane mometer site to represent very flat area being an airfield and on top of very shallo w hill in fenland terms the site errs on the side of particularly good exposure and is attributed terrain category 1 this terrain category may not necessarily apply to all potential turb ine sites in areas 14 and 16 depending on the proportion of adjacent woodland area 18 cornwall chosen site cardinham cardinham is an inland site with category 2 terrain but on top of bodmin moor for coastal turbine sites apply an altitude correction but also lower terrain roughness of 1 or even 01 towards the far west of cornwall area 20 southeast england chosen site solent it has been assumed here that turbines sites in southeast gland are most likely to be on the downs or the south coast the solent site is almost n the shoreline at lee on solent very exposed to prevailing wind directions northwest t hrough southwest to south east the terrain immediately inland from the site is u rban hence the nonstandard anemometer height see annex in order to rise well above buil ding heights given that winds blow predominantly from the open water here the adja cent urban area is unlikely to greatly reduce wind speeds overall hence the attributed overa ll terrain category of 1 however if comparing these data with data from other sites i t is important that speeds be reduced to take account of the 25metre anemometer mast area 22 inland yorkshire chosen site leeming leeming is at the northern end of the

ie category 0 terrain roug hness e5 anemometer starting speeds most anemometers installed by the met office have cups that h ave to be turned mechanically by the wind in order to register wind speed once the cups are turning the recorded wind speed is proportional to the speed of rota tion of the cups however in order for the cups to start turning static frictional force s to be overcome this means that when the wind increases from calm finite wind spee d has to be reached before the cups start to turn meanwhile calm continues to be registered once the cups are turning they will carry on turning at lower wind speeds than the start ing threshold although there is still finite stall speed below which the cups will cease to turn as instrumentation has improved so also has the mobility of ane mometer cups so that there is single start speed that can be applied uniformly across the anemometer network during the period of data provision two types of anemometer were in use at the requested sites the mark 4 and the mark 6 the latter having significantly lower starting speed for these two anemometer types avera ge start and stall speeds are as follows mark 4 start speed 3 1 ms stall speed 1 ms based on sted sample of 71 anemometers mark 6 start and stall speed 05 ms based on tested sampl of about 250 anemometers the main impact on recorded wind speeds applies to the mark 4 nly and is during sustained periods of light winds 3 ms during which the ane mometer may record calm throughout it may be useful to consider this in the text that most wind turbines also have cutin speed though the precise details of the rbines to be used in this case are not known annex c lists the types of anemometer in use at ea ch site during the period of data provision e6 references cook
