aig is the risk systemicstrictly confidentialdraft february 26 20092what is systemic risk _1systemic risk is the risk imposed by interlinkages and interdependencies in system or market which could potentially bankrupt or brin g down the entire system or market if one player is eliminated or cluster of failures occurs at once _1systemic financial risk occurs when contingency pla ns that are developed individually to address selected risks are collectively incompat ible it is the quintessential knee bone is connected to the thigh bone where every element that once appeared independent is connected with every other element _1aigs business model sprawl of 1 trillion of insurance and financial services businesses whose aaa credit was used to backstop 2 trillion dollar financial products trading business has many inherent risks that are correlated with ne another as the global economy has experienced mu ltisector failures aig s vast business has been weakened by these multisector fa ilures _1aigs original problem an overreliance on us residential mortgageback ed securities rmbs in its investment portfolios has now been deepened by weakness in the commercial mortgagebacked securities market the global real estate market the global equities market slowing business and co nsumer spending activity and the concomitant demand for higher liquidity by regulato rs and customers around the world _1systemic risk afflicts all life insurance and inves tment firms around the world thus what happens to aig has the potential to trigger cascading set of further failures which cannot be stopped except by extraordinary mea ns 233risk assessment summary in the fall of 2008 the federal reserve and depar tment of the treasury determined that the systemic risk of failure of aig was so great that they should provide support program by injecting liquidity and equity capital i nto aig to repay the debt and reduce the degree of financi risk to the firm aig has instituted winddown of its financial products business and massive divestiture process to sell businesses despite the increasingly difficult ma and credit environment the previously provided solution addressed shortte rm liquidity needs and aig s over concentration in the rmbs market but aig still fa ces massive investment losses and credit downgrades without additional federal tool s being deployed in the aig situation aig will not be able to repay its obligations des pite adequate current security against the us government s investment that investment may not be recovered aig operates in more than 140 countries around the world whose customers regulators and governments have thus far been refr ained from liquidating or seizing assets based largely on the support given to aig by the us government the failure of aig would cause turmoil in the us economy and global markets and have multiple and potentially catastrophic unforese consequences the inability of aig to immediately secure addition assistance from the federal reserve and the department of the treasury threaten s not only aig s sales process but also consumer and business confidence around the wo rld4how big is the systemic risk in insurance _1while the term insurance is used aig and its industry brethren sell and rvice not just the traditional property and casualty and death benefit life insurance policies but accident and health coverage pension and retirement policies and variety of wealth accumulation vehicles such as an nuities _1the systemic risk is principally centered in the life insurance business because it is this subsector that has the greatest variety of investments and obligations that are subject to loss of value of the underlying inve stments _1the life insurance industry employs approximately 2 3 million people in the us who sell individual and group policies there are over 19 trillion of face value life policies in force in the us and 375 million poli cies _1over the past decade the voluntary termination rat on individual policies declined remarkably to six percent by 2007 as sumers could obtain liquidity from numerous other sources _1a significant rise in surrender rates inspired by consumers needs for cash or because of rumored or real failure of insurance com panies could be disastrous because of widespread loss of liquidity the indust ry would struggle to raise adequate cash to meet surrender requests run on the bank in the life and retirement business would have sweeping impacts acr oss the economy in the us in countries around the world with higher sav ings rates than the us the failure of insurance companies like aig would be catastrophe 45impact on us government s efforts to stabilize economy _1if aig were to fail notwithstanding the previous bstantial government support it is likely to have cascading impact on number of us life insurers already weakened by credit losses state insurance guarantee funds would be q uickly dissipated leading to even greater runs on the insurance industry _1given aig s insurance companies relative size compared to other us insurance companies there is ability for an arranged marriage of aig s largest units with other us insurance companies _1in addition the government s unwillingness to support aig could lead to cris is of confidence here and abroad over other large financi institutions particularly those that have thus far remained viable because of government support programs _1this loss of confidence is likely to be particularl acute in countries that have large investments in us companies and securities and wh ose citizens may suffer significant losses as result of the failure of aig s foreign insurance subsidiaries _1this could lead directly to decrease in the attra ctiveness of us government securities and consequent increase in borrowing costs for th us government and related issuing entities66impact on us government s efforts to stabilize economy _1moreover permitting aig to fail would be even more serious today than in september especially in view of the support of the us gover nment public confidence in financial institutions is at nadir and it is questionable w hether the economy could tolerate another shock to the system that failure of aig w ould produce _1the extent and interconnectedness of aig s business is farreaching and encompasses customers across the globe ranging from governmenta l agencies corporations and consumer to counterparties failure of aig could create chain reaction of enormous proportion _1while some of these potential consequences are inhe rently judgmental and to an extent speculative if there is one conclusion that can be unquestionably drawn from the failure of lehman it is that the adverse consequences of t he failure of major financial institution cannot be foreseen _1just as the government was unable to predict that t he failure of lehman would lead to the collapse of the reserve fund followed by much of t he money market industry the government would be even less capable of predicting the fallout from the collapse of much larger more global and more consumeroriented institution such as aig7aigs global impact _1largest us

than 81 million life insurance policies to individuals worldwide face value 19 trillion claims paid in 2008 more than 12 billion _1if aig fails policyholders are likely to seek to cash in policies placing enormous strain on the insurance system as well as bond and equity markets as assets are liquidated to pay policyholders surrender of insurance policies at abovenormal act uarial rates could impair current policyholders as capital along with state guarante funds might be insufficient to pay all policyholder claims thirdparty sellers of aig products would face an u nmanageable spike in customer redemption demands damaging consumer confidence forced sales of assets would be required to cover w ithdrawals _1existing aig policyholders could be unable to obtai n insurance coverage from

foreign regulators the seizure by one regulator in given region eg asia would almost certainly have domino effect and lead to the seiz ure of insurance businesses in multiple jurisdictions across the region once these assets were effectively nationalized the would be out of the reach of the us given the substantial footprint of aig s insurance presence in these regions the consequence of seizure would significantly im pair if not cripple the entire insurance industry within certain regions even if there is not an immediate seizure of the in surance businesses there will be significant policy cancellations which will like ly lead to seizures _1seizure of foreign assets could lead to loss of assets to repay the federal reserve collapse of aig s public debt loss of value of the ustreasury s preferred shares2121conclusion insurance is the oxygen of the free enterprise system without the promise of protection against life s adversities the fundamentals of capitalism are undermined the failure of the world s largest insurer at time of major global financial and economic instability will exacerbate the challenge of reignit ing consumer confidence since life insurance has changed greatly in character over the st two decades from just basic provision of death and disability benefits t vehicle for retirement savings and wealth accumulation the effects of disrupting the industry are wide ranging and significant there is legitimate public policy rationale for regulatory reform of the industry and the federal government s continuing role in aig s destiny would be consistent with such policy direction
