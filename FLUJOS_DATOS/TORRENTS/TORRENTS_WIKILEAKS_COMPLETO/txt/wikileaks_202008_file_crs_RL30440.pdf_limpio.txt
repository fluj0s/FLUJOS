base closures estimates of costs and savings summary approximately 13 years ago in decembe r 1988 the first military base closure commission recommended the closing and r ealignment of 145 us domestic bases and facilities this action was the consequence of the department of defenses broad reevaluation of its mission in conj unction with the weakening and ultimate collapse of the soviet union there wa s little need according to the pentagon to continue to retain the vast cold warera infrastructure funds saved from closing down underutilized bases dod further noted c ould be used to enhance development of new weapons and improved readiness the 1988 round of infrastructure reductions was followed by three additional rounds in 1991 1993 and 1995 since then fu rther rounds of base closures and realignments have been authorized by c ongress despite repeated requests from the department of defense in recent years fo r two additional rounds the reasons for congressional resistance are twofold first there is concern over likely backlash from constituents living in or near military installations sec ond many members of congress remain wary about repetition of the perceived political intrusion by the clinton administration that occurred in re gard to the 1995 recommendations to close kelly and mcclella n air force bases the four base closure and realig nment brac commissions recommended individually total of 534 actions to close realign or otherwise affect specific bases facilities and activitie s in december 1998 the gene ral accounting office reported that the four brac commissions genera ted 499 recommendations but that in its final tally only 451 of th ultimately required acti on primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recomme ndations of later commission the closing of all 451 brac installations major minor and other from the four rounds is expected to be comple ted by the end of fy2001 as originally scheduled the disposing of all the closed property however is expected to take many more years the pentagons current estimate of the percentage reduction in base structure as result of the first four rounds is 21 this figure is used as support for additional infrastru cture reductions since othe r key indicators such as the defense budget and the force structur personnel and units have declined 40 and 36 respectively in terms of costs and savings associated with the first four rounds of closures and realignments dod report april 1998 estimated net tota l savings of about 14 billion through fy2001 it projected that net annual savings thereafter would be in the vicinity of 56 to 57 billion as for the two new rounds currently being sought the pentagon has estimated an annua l savings of about 3 billion after they are

domestic bases including us territories the report also provides info rmation on the costs and savings associated with implementation of domestic ba closings and realignments1 from 1976 to 1988 virtually us domestic bases were closed as result of congressionally imposed restrictions2 this situation changed radically in 1988 when the us congress passed legislation tablishing the first of four independent base realignment and closure commi ssions brac the four commissions activated in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 generated 499 reco mmendations for closing and realigning bases only 451 of these ultimately re quired action primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of later commission3 closures and realignments problem of defining terms the term base closure is frequently used loosely and imprecisely brac action may not involve base as one might commonly envision it to be but rather facility mission or f unction it also may not i nvolve closure or even realignment but rather disestablishment relocation or r edirection in 1995 report on the brac process the genera l accounting office gao noted that the term base closure often conjures up the image of larger facility being closed than may actually be the case m ilitary installations are rather diversifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs2 4 see us general accounting office report gaonsiad95133

base camp post station yard center homeport or leased facility further more than one mission or function may be housed on given installation the report noted additionally that an individual brac recommendation may actually affect variety of activities and functions without fully closing an installation full closures to the extent they occur may involve relatively small facilities rather than the stereotypically large military base4 thus base closure is highly amor phous imprecise term that may serve to facilitate communication but often fails at the same time to provide an exact understanding of the action taken scale of the base structure the military base structure of the department of defense includes approximately 5000 prope rties worldwide these properties range widely in personnel assigned and amount of property controlled from unmanned navigational aid stations to major military bases with thousands of personnel and in the case of nellis air force base more than million acres the department of defense currently maintains website list of 588 installations worldwide5 this list is subset of properties excluding numerous minor activities and smaller pr operties the 588 installations are divided into the following three groups 1 50 united states 519 installations 2 3 us territories 8 installations3 19 foreign countries 61 installations the 527 us installations comprising those within the 50 states and its territories are grouped according to three categ ories major minor and other each major service determines for itself the thod of defining its categories for example the army defines major inst allation as one with 5000 or more us service members dod civilian employees ndor other authorized tenants it defines minor installation as one w ith personnel numbering between 1000 and 5000 in its other category it includes sites and faci lities with pers onnel levels between 300 and 1000 the air force on th other hand has classified major and minor installations on the basis of wing or squadron size th navy determines itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs3 6 us gao status op cit p 25 7 in closure all missions carried out at base either

recommended total of 534 actions to close realign or othe rwise affect specific bases facilities and activities the breakdown for each of th commissions reports is as follows 1988 brac 145 recommendations 1991 brac 82 recommendations1993 brac 175 recommendations1995 brac 132 recommendations the 1995 brac commission report however stated that the number of brac actions from all four rounds totaled 505 not 534 most recently in december 1998 the general accounting office g ao reported that the four brac commissions generated 499 reco mmendations but that in its final tally only 451 of these ultimately required acti on primarily because 48 were changed in some manner by recommendations of later commission 6 these discrepancies make it difficult to pin down the precise number of brac actions as the gao report explained the brac commissions have been somewhat arbitrary in the way they enumerate recommendations the recommendations have included closures realignments disestab lishments relocations and redirections7 the closing of all 451 brac installations m ajor minor and other from the four rounds is expected to be comple ted by the end of fy2001 as originally scheduled the disposing of all the closed property however is expected to take many more years according to gao about 464000 acres of brac real property were determined to be excess but as of march 1998 only about 31 of property designated for nonfederal users had been formally transferred8 the main delaying factor in the process has been the need to meet strict environmental cleanup standards in order to move things ong more swiftly dod has adopted the use of interim leases until such time as formal deeds can be issued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs4 9 plant replacement value as defined by dod is what it would cost to repl ace all the buildings pavements and utilities at baseit is difficult to find consistently determined figures on overall brac actions however the department of defense does provide one such set of statistics smaller in number that identifies 97 major closures and realignments the overall baseline figure for dods major bases nonbrac as well as brac is 495 as of september 30 1999 the following inform ation on brac major closures and realignments was as follows major brac closures recommended 97 1988 commission 16 1991 commission 26 1993 commission 28 1995 commission

station ny percent of base structure closed in its report to the 1993 base closure commission the department of defense estimated that under the first two rounds 1988 and 1991 domestic base st ructure was reduced by onl 9 measured by plant replacement value 9 it stated that adding th 1993 closures recommended by dod to the previous ones would reduce the domestic base structure by about 15 in its recommendations to the 1995 ba closure commission the department of defense estimated that adding the 1995 closures recommended by dod to the previous ones would reduce the domestic base structure by approximately 21 the pentagons current 1999 estimate of the percentage reduction in base structure remains essentially the same 21 see figure 1 for comparison with other indicators of defense drawdown for several years the department of defense has been urging congress to authorize additional base cl osure rounds it has stressed that base structure reductions lag significantly behind the reduc tions in the defense budget and in the force structure military units and personne l additional base closures according to dod would free up funds urgently need ed for the development of new weapon systems as well as providing for increased training and readiness of the armed forces many if not most authorities on defe nse policy agree with dods assessment few have suggested however that the unde rlying premise of relative parity may be false for start some argue that the defense budget and military personnel columns below represent worldwide figures while the domestic base structurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs5 10 for more extensive discussion of new base closings see crs report rl30051 military base closures time for another round by david lockwood august 3 1999 9

and its territories if the us overseas bases closed are added to those of the domestic base structure the comparable figure would be an overall re duction of about 26 second concern has to do with the i ssue of reconstitution potential need to increase military capability when the united states is confronted at some future point by hostile and powerful enemy state the argument is that while the defense budget can be increased in matter of week s the same is not true of the force structure or the base structure some believe the problem of reconstitution is potentially most hazardous with regard to the base structure once property is converted to civilian use it is for all pr actical purposes permanently lost as military asset prospects for fut ure base closures 10 in mid1997 secret ary of defense william cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignm ents he explained that wh ile four previous rounds had achieved significant savings it was importa nt to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities spite dod pressure most members of congress were reluctant to support authorization of new ba closure legislation at that time the reasons given included among others grassroots opposition from communities likely to be affected and president clint ons intervention in the 1995 base closure commissions recommendations regarding mcclellan and kelly air force bases11 of the two chambers the house of representatives expressed the stronger and more united opposition in the sena proponents of new base closure rounds attempted to attach an amendment to the fy1999 defense authorizati on bill but failed source us department of defense defense reform initiative report november 1997 p 37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs6 the base closing issue however wa s revived at the outset of the 106th congress proponents believed that their cause would be helped by the fact that it was not an election year on january 20 1999 senator john mccain along with senators carl levin and charles robb introduced legisla tion s 258 that would authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003 on february 1 the clinton administration submitted to congress its budget for fy2000 which included provision for two more rounds in 2001 nd 2005 on may 12 and 13 however the senate armed services committee in its markup of the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 rejected propos als by senators mccain and levin to include authority for new base closings the two senators attempted to revive the base closure proposal during floor debate on s 1059 but t with defeat by vote of 60 to 40 on january 18 2000 just prior to the ope ning of the new session of congress the department of defense announced that the clinton administration would once again seek congressional authority to clos more military bases starting in 2003 its spokesman said that this is particular ly opportune time to ma ke such transitions since the national economy is so strong additionally he reassured critics and sceptics alike that politics would not be llowed to intrude on any future rounds of base closings in its statements urging new rounds of closures the pentagon added its stamp of approval to the brac pro cess stating that it was proven effective tool to make difficult decisions that impact both national security and local communities it proposed that future brac rounds adopt the same procedures that were used in the 1995 brac round however most members of congress were not inclined to act on an issue fraught with potential controversy especially during presidential election year nevertheless senator john mccain nd senator carl levin sponsored an amendment 3197 that sought two dditional rounds of base closures and realignments beginning in 2003 and 2005 in floor debate june 7 2000 senator mccain stressed the importance of removing the armed services burden of managing and paying for an estimated 23 excess in frastructure costing at least 36 billion year the mccainlevin initiative however was solidly rejected by vote of 35 to 63 at the outset of the 107th congress senators mccain and levin have once again introduced bill s 397 to authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005 in its february 27 2001 press rel ease the taxpayers for common sense tcs national budget watchdog or ganization immediately applauded the initiative and said that it would save billions for other important defense priorities it estimated the cost of maintaining excess military bases at about 36 billion each year and said that projected pentagon savings could amount to as much as 21 billion through 2015 if the military were allowed to close bases in 2003 and 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs7 12 us gao status op cit p 36 13 us department of defense the report of the department of defense on base realignment and closure april 1998 144 p figure 2 brac estimate d costs and savings 1990 2001costs and savings two important aspects of analyzing costs and savings are associated with brac closings the first has to do with the ement of chronological timing in the early years base closure costs greatly exceeded savings at later point in time 1998 costs and savings became about equal see wh ere the two lines in figure 2 cross presently with the implementation of four brac rounds nearing completion the deadline is end of fy2001 savings are proj ected to be significantly greater than costs the second and more fundamenta lly problematic aspect has to do with determining the accuracy of data especia lly data involving savings the inability of dod to locate some of its data including the original cost and savings estimates it gave to the brac commissions has complicated matters these difficulties have been addressed at some length by dod as well as by the congressional budget office and the general accounting office see below source gaos analysis of dod data 12 dod and agency findings department of defense at the request of congress the department of defense submitted report in april 1998 on the status of base realignments and closures13 in its report dod provided data on the estimated costs and savings for the first four rounds 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 the report stated that overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs8 the resultant savings from the shutdown of bases and facilities during bracs rounds would exceed initial estimates it also said that the drama tic level of savings would permit the department to increase spending on the modernization and transformation of its forces while staining high levels of readiness the dod report stressed that all organizations must estimate savings produced by management reforms c onsolidations and reorganiza tions accounting systems can keep accurate records of costs but parallel systems exist to track savings to determine brac savings the report explained requires either 1 estimating what the composition of the dod budget w ould have been without brac or 2 distinguishing the effects of brac from the effects of other myriad factors that affect dod installations and budg ets over more than decade with this caveat the dod report proceeded to estimate net total savings from the four brac rounds of about 14 billion through 2001 see table 1 it projected that annual savings thereafter would be in the

required by provision of law the congressional budget office cbo nd the general accounting office gao reviewed dods 1998 report following its release cbo found dods estimates of savings from previous closure rounds as fu lly implemented consis tent with its own estimates 56 billion as compared to 50 billion cbo also acknowledged that firm measures of brac sa vings requested by congress do not and cannot exist it elaborated as follows brac savings are really avoided costs costs that dod would have incurred if brac actions had not taken place b ecause those avoided costs are not actual expenditures dod cannot observe them and record them in its financial records as result dod can only estimate savings rather than actually measure them14 in its review cbo made number of ot her interesting observations it stated that dod was unable to locate some of th data requested by cbo including the original cost and savings estimates that dod gave to the brac commissions also cbo noted that estimates of brac costs nd savings would be more accurate if they included dods environmental and caretaker costs for some bases after the sixyear implementation period is completed general accounting office the general accounting office submitted its review of dods report on november 13 199815 it was longer and provided more supporting detail than the cbo review gao asserted that the four previous brac closure rounds would result in substantial net saving it noted also that dods report should be viewed as providing rough approximation of costs and savings rather than precise accounting it said that dods data systems do not capture all savings associated with brac actions nor has dod establishe d separate system to track brac savings pair of consistent messa ges are present in the three reports reviewed above first there is practicable way to dete rmine with precision the actual costs and savings from the brac rounds one has to be satisfied with estimates second regardless of substantial initial costs much greater savings will be achieved in the long run as result of the four rounds of military base closures prospects for future savings the department of defense during the st several years has repeatedly stated its need to close more military bases citing studies that confirm an excess base capacity in the range of 23 it has sought authority from congress so far to avail for two new base closure and r ealignment rounds in 2003 and 2005 according to dods estimates two new r ounds each roughly the size of the last two rounds initiated in 1993 and 1995 would generate annual savings of about 3 billion afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30440crs10 16 us department of defense op cit pp 1922 17 burns robert clinton to seek more base closings ap jan 18 2000 they are implemented16 failure to close unneeded bases dod has warned could seriously impede its efforts to allocate resources in the most efficient and effective manner it has stated also that such fa ilure could cost the pentagon in the future 20 billion that would be better spent on ship s jet aircraft nd other crucial military equipment17 the prospects for achieving future savings depend greatly on congress actions in the course of the ne xt two sessions during which conditions for establishing new independent base closure commission will be most advantageous conclusion the pentagon insists that the high cost of maintaining base structure far in excess of its current and most likely future requirements imposes very significant financial burden on the depar tment the removal of this burden remains major department of defense objective it is an especially important item on dods agenda this year as it presents and defends its annual budget in hearings before the committees of the new 107th congress with the conclusion of the year 2000 presidential election members of congress may be more inclined now than before to undertake the necessary steps to authorize new base realignment and cl osure brac rounds the longstanding argument of many members of congress against any new rounds as long as the clinton administration remained in place because of perceived abuse in the handling of mcclellan and ke lly air force bases has now become largely moot major impediment to further closures and realignments thus appears to have been removed it is generally agreed however that congress has only brief window of opportunity to muster the support needed to establish new independent base closure commission the previous one having expired more than 5 years ago any extended delay by congress that moves br ac decision closer to the next election in 2004 it is widely acknowledged will likely result in dwindling support and possible rejection
