district government these changes include improvements in the citys financial condition including the citys third consecutive year with budget surplus and proposed amendments in the citys home rule charter that would change the size and composition of the board of education board these changes have been accompanied by controversial 13week delay in completion of the citys annual financial report debate concerning structure compos ition and effectiveness of elected versus appointed school boards and the resignations of the citys chief financi officer cfo and the superintendent of public schools in addition the district government has had to address problems related to special education foster care medicare fraud and court operations during the last year the authoritys role has evolved from that of direct management of the daily operations of the citys nine largest agencies to one of exercising oversight of the district government this transition has been aided by congressional support for mayor williams government reform efforts as evidenced by congressional passage of the district of columbia manageme nt reform act of 1999 pl 1061 the act which was signed march 5 1999 transferred direct administrative authority for the districts nine largest agencies from the authority to the mayor district of columbia financial condition the district of columbia

of city services and returning the district of columbia to position of financial solvency working in concert with the districts elected political leadership the authority and the cfo have implemented series of financial and management reforms and have improved tax collection these reforms federal assistance and an improved economy have resulted in three consecutive years of budget surpluses pl 1048 requires the district to produce four consecutive years of balanced budgets as prerequisite for the abolition of the authority and the return of home rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30513crs3 1 the districts fy1998 surplus was in part the result of the national capital revitalization act of 1997 pl 10533 the revitalization act which improved the citys fiscal prospects through the infusion of over 5 billion in federal funds transferred financial responsibility for number of functions to the federal government including accumulated pension liability for police firefighters teachers and

of 864 million after subtracting 35 million payment to the retirement of the citys longterm debt the cfos delay in releasing the comprehen sive annual financial report cafr strained the cfos relationship with the mayor the city council the control board and the private firm charged with conducting the annual audit the 13week delay in the cfos release of the report due february 1 2000 but not released until april 29 2000 triggered criticism of the cfos leadership and eventually contributed to her resignation in february 28 2000 letter to the authority eight members of the council

management and financial problems of he district of columbiapublic education like so many district government institutions the citys public education system has experienced changes during the past

hiring new superintendent and addressing the problems of special education students are but few of the challenges that must be addressed school board reform in 1999 members of the board of education clashed over allegations that board of education chair wilma harvey improperly used school board personnel for personal projects eventually the board replaced harvey as chair and installed robert childs an atlarge member as chair the chairmanship controversy jeopardized the scheduled june 30 2000 transfer of administrative authority to the existing school board and refocused city and congressional attention on the need to reform what many perceive as flawed and ineffective institution the direction of school board reform in the district of columbia including the size of the school board and whether to elect or to appoint school board members has been hotly debated topic that was decided by the voters 51 for the hybrid board of education and 49 against in referendum vote on june 27 2000 much of the debate on electedversusappointed boards involves matters of accountability democracy efficacy and expertise2 supporters of an elected board believe that such boards are directly accountable and sensitive to the concerns of residents because they are democratically elected detractors argue that elected boards particularly those elected by ward or district are too parochial in their focus and too partisan in their politics school boards they offer often serve as political training ground for persons with higher political aspirations who are more interested in building political base than in improving the schools supporters of appointed boards contend that appointed board members are more likely to bring education or other expertise to the boards deliberations and are less likely to be subjected to or swayed by partisan or parochial pressures to protect the interest of particular group in order to win political advantage detractors argue that appointed boards are subject to patronage and are selected in an undemocratic fashion the mayor and the city council settled on hybrid board comprising both elected and appointed members after considering and rejecting proposals that would have allowed the mayor to appoint the superintendent and fivemember board of education transferred control of the schools including the hiring and firing of the

congressional review period period after declaring state of emergency and then returning power to restructured and smaller seven member elected board reduced the board of education from 11 to seven elected members and allowed district residents to choose between ninemember elected school board and fivemember board appointed by the mayor the latter proposal which was initially approved by the city council on february 1 2000 was criticized by alice rivlin the chair of the authority who argued that referendum fight over an elected versus appointed board would be divisive she urged the council and the mayor to support single plan or face the possibility of authority or congressional action on february 17 2000 after weeks of debate the city council with the mayors support approved bill pr13295 that would restructure the district of columbia board of education pending approval of referendum by district voters and 35day congressional review period during which resolution of

of paul to charter school was supported by twothirds of the parents with children in attendance at paul granted by the public chart er school board which is one of two charter granting authorities in the district5 and subsequently endorsed by the authority the paul junior high school debate served as lightning rod for issues surrounding the conversion and transfer of public school buildings to charter schools on march 7 2000 in the midst of the paul junior high school controversy the city council passed emergency legislation that places sevenandonehalf month moratorium on public school building conversions and transfers to public charter schools though the bill does not affect the conversion of paul according to charter school supporters it would have chilling effect on future

education students who represent about 15 of total public school enrollment according to advocates representing special education students bus services for students with special needs are routinely late or nonexistent according to report by the special master appointed by federal judge to help resolve transportation and other special education issues at least one in every 10 special educatio n

the district government from using city funds and resources in filing the court challenge presently the district of columbia elects nonvoting delegate to congress who has been granted the right to cast committee votes but cannot vote in either the committee of the whole or the house the plaintiffs arguments for granting fullhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30513crs8 congressional voting repres entationa single house vote and two senate votesrest on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment lawyers for the plaintiffs contend because the apportionment process deprives district residents of republican form of government because it leaves them unrepresented in the national legislative body this the plaintiffs have argued denies them equal protection under the law because although they are subject to laws passed by congress they lack voting representation therein the justice department argued that the 14th amendment provision governing equal protection does not apply and that the constitution grants voting representation in the house and the senate only to states specifically article i section 2 paragraph 1 states that the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states article i section 3 paragraph 1 states that the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state in addition article i section 8 of the constitution grants to congress the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states further article iv section 3 grants only to congress the power to admit new states into the union the three judge panel whose ruling was later appealed directly to the supreme court handed down their decision on march 20 2000 by decision of two to one the panel founded that district residents did not have legal right to voting representation in congress the panel acknowledged the apparent inequity and paradox that residents of the nations capital do not possess the right to voting representation in the house and senate as do residents of the 50 states but the majority opinion stated that the constitution clearly states that voting representation in the hous and senate is reserved for the people of the several states the majority opinion suggested that residents seek redress through the political process and not the courts political remedies could include statehood constitutional amendment creation of federal enclave and return of the remaining portion of the district to maryland or allowing district residents to vote with marylanders in senate and house elections on october 16 2000 the supreme court affirmed the march 20 2000 ruling of the three judge panel receiverships the courts continue to play significant role in the daily operations of the district government according to the districts proposed budget for fy2001 7 of proposed total general fund expenditures 48 billion will be controlled by court appointed receivers three agencies the

district administr ative control however the effectiveness of the agencies under receivership and their progress toward return of the four agencies to district government control has been uneven at best city officials are hopeful that the agencies will be returned to district control within year the housing authority was returned to district control by september 2000 there is little to indicate that two other agencieschild and family services and mental health serviceshave made substantial progress in addressing the problems and issues that forced the agencies into receivership the agencies problems were highlighted by news reports of the deaths of children and retarded adults in their care on october 23 2000 united states district judge thomas hogan approved plan that would return control of the child and family services agency to the district government by the summer of 2001 and elevate the agency to cabinet level agency mental health services is set to return to district control by april 2001 the fourth agency jail medical services will be returned by the end of the year through the efforts of the mayor during the interim city officials are seeking greater budget coordination with courtappointed receivers presently city officials including the authority lack the power to review revise or alter the budget request of an agency under receivership the agencys budget request for each fiscal year is simply included in the districts proposed budget and is subject only to court review as part of the mayors strategy to hasten the return of agencies under receivership and to enhance financial accountability and management of district funds the congressional delegate for the district of columbia introduced the district of columbia receivership accountability act of 2000 hr 3995 on march 5 2000 the act would require each courtappointed receiver to consult with the mayor and cfo when preparing the agencys annual budget prepare and submit to the mayor for inclusion in the districts annual budget the agencys proposed or estimated budget follow the applicable procurement policies and practices of the chief procurement officer of the district submit to annual financial and management audits conducted by the inspector general of the district and ensure that the costs incurred in the administration of each agency are consistent with applicable regional and national standards unless waived by the court during an interim period of up to two years housing authority the housing authority which has been in receivership since 1995 could be returned to city control sometime this year earlier this year district public housing residents elected three tenants to ninemember board of commissioners charged with setting policy and

services in the case of child and family services the city agency charged with protecting abused and neglected children critics of the receiver point to the case of brianna blackmon 23month old child who died in january after being returned to her mother the mother had been charged and found guilty of child neglect year earlier the childs death prompted congressional hearing and recommendations that included additional training for social workers and requiring social workers to provide field reports to judges 10 days before hearings on childs status in the wake of the brianna blackmon case the courtappointed receiver asked the city for 60 million in additional funds this would increase the agencys budget to 184 million and would be used to provide higher payments to foster parents hire additional social workers and implement other initiatives necessary to fully comply with the court order to improve the agencys services on october 23 2000 the district court judge thomas hogan approved plan that would return the agency to district control by the summer of 2001 the agreement returning control of the agency to the district requires the district to elevate the agency to cabinet level agency with the administrator reporting directly to the mayor develop licensing standards for foster and group homes and enact legisl ation that gives the agency responsibility for investigating abuse and neglect cases currently neglect allegations are investigated by the agency while abuse cases are investigated by the police mental health services on march 6 2000 us district judge thomas f hogan approved plan to return the agency to district control the judge found that since being placed in receivership in 1997 the system had deteriorated the plan agreed to by district officials and coalition representing mental health groups removed the courtappointed receiver at the end of march 2000 placed the agency under control of an interim receiver and will transfer control to the district by april 2001 the court will appoint monitor to review the districts administration of mental health services during the first sixmonth period following the district takeover the state of mental health services in the district was illustrated on february 29 2000 when police and firefighters were called to northwest washington mental health group home and found the doors chained shut

the cost of health services is one of the issues prompting city officials to seek removal of the receiver for medical services at the district of columbia jail the jails medical services which have been under receivership since 1995 carry an excessively high price tag according to the citys congressional delegate the delegate on march 7 2000 cited statistics from the national institute of

for district inmates is almost three times the national average criminal justice the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 105336 initiated several changes in the operation of the districts corrections and
