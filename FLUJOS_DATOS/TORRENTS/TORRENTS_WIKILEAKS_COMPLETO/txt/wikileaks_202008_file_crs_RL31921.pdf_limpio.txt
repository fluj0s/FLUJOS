summaries of statut administered by the environmental protection agency which summarizes more than dozen environmental statutes this report will be updated at the begi nning of the first session of each new congress or sooner if congress enacts w that substantively changes statute congress enacted the original version of fifra in 1947 but revision in 1972 is the basis of current pesticide policy substantial changes were made in 1988 and again in 1996 the 1996 fifra amendments were contained in the food qua lity protection act fqpa which also ame nded the ffdca congress first required limits on pesticide residues on raw food in 1954 amendments to the ffdca limits were required for food additives including pesticide residues in processed foods in the 1958 ffdca amendments in the 1996 ffdca amendments congress established new standard of safety fo r pesticide residues in food both raw and processed maximum residue levels set by epa must ensure with reasonable certainty that harm will result from pesticide exposure fifra requires the us environmental protection agency epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the ited states through re gistration and labeling of pesticide products the sa of any pesticide is prohibited in the united states unless it is registered and labeled epa is directed to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable advers effects on people and the environment taking into account the costs and benefits of various pe sticide uses in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pesticides based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards pesticides manufactured solely for export do not require registration for pesticides to be register ed for use in food production ffdca section 408 authorizes epa to blish allowable residue levels called tolerances that ensure that human ex posure to pesticide re sidues in food will be safe foods with pesticide residues above the tolerance or for which there is tolerance established may not be imported or sold in interstate commerce pesticide may not be registered under fifr for food use unless tolerance for that pesticide and food has been established under ffdca fifra directs epa to make public any data submitted to s upport registration application if epa registers the pesticide but certain data are protected as trade secrets and other registrants may not us the same data to support registration applications for similar pesticides for period of 10 years epa continues to evaluate the safety of pesticides after they are registered as new information becomes available pesticide registration may be canceled or amended if epa determines that current use may cause unreasonable adverse

for implementing federal pesticide polic ies under two statutes the federa l insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra1 governing the sale and us of pesticide products within the united states and the federal food dr ug and cosmetic ac t ffdca which limits pesticide residues on food in interstate commerce including imports this report defines key terms provides brief hi story of the federal pesticide laws and describes key provisions of th laws including the pestic ide registration process and how it interfaces with food safe ty requirements in additi on this report lists several references for more detailed informati on about the acts and two tables cross reference sections of the us code with corresponding sections of the acts the report is descriptive rather than analy tic highlights key provisions rather than providing comprehensive inventory of th acts numerous sec tions and addresses authorities and limitations imposed by statute rather than the status of epa implementation or other polic issues other crs products address current pesticide issues including crs report rl32218 pesticide registration and tolerance fees overview by robert esworthy overview there are an estimated 18000 pestic ide products currently in use2 t h s generally are regulated under fifra but approximately 5800 pesticide products used in food production also are regula ted under the ffdca as discussed below fifra requires epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registration and labeling3 pesticides are broadly defined in fifra section 2u as chemicals and other products used to kill repel or control pests familiar examples include pesticides used to kill insects and weeds that can reduce the yield and sometimes harm the quality of agricultural crops ornamental plants forests wooden structures and pastures but the broad definition of pesticide in fifra also applies to products with less familiar pesticidal uses for example substances used to control mold mildew algae and other nuisance growths on equipment in surface water or on stored grains are pesticides the term also applies to disinfectants and sterilizing agents anima l repellents rat poi and many other substances httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs2 4 ingredients in pesticide products are categorized as active or inert active ingredients are those that are intended to control the pest wh ile inert ingredients are used to deliver the active ingredients effectively to the pest iner t ingredients often are solvents or surfactants and often comprise the bulk of the pesticide produc t some inerts are known to be toxic and some are known to be harmless but epa lists most in the category inerts of unknown toxicity fifra directs epa to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and th environment taking into account the costs and benefits of various pesticide uses the act prohi bits sale of any pesticide in the united states unless it is registered and labeled to indicate approved uses and restrictions it is violation of the law to use pesticide in manner that is inconsistent with the labe l instructions epa regist ers each pesticide product for each approved use for example product may be registered for use on green beans to control mites as seed treatment fo r cotton and as trea tment for structural cracks in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pes ticides based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards establishments that manufacture or sell pesticide pr oducts must register with ep facility managers are required to keep certain records and to allow inspections by federal or state regulatory officials for the 600 or more pesticides ie active ingredients registered for use in food production the ffdca section 408 authorizes epa to establish maximum allowable residue levels called tolerances that ensure that human exposure to the pesticide ingredients in food and an imal feed will be safe4 safe tolerance is defined as level at which there is reasonabl certainty of harm from the exposure under ffdca foods with residue of pe sticide ingredient for which there is tolerance established or w ith residue level exceeding an established tolerance limit are declared unsafe and adulterated ch foods cannot be sold in interstate commerce or imported to the united states pesticides may not be registered under fifra for use on food unless tolerances or exemptions have been established under the ffdca history of federal pesticide law table 1 and table 2 summarize the history of fifra and ffdca respectively fifra federal pesticide legislation was first enacted in 1910 it aimed to reduce economic exploitation of farmer s by manufacturers and distributors of adulterated or ineffective pesticides c ongress did not address the potential risks to human health posed by pesticide products until it enacted the original 1947 version of fifra the us department of agriculture usda was responsible for administering the pesticide statutes durin g this period however responsibility was shifted to the epa when that agency was created in 1970 broader congressional concerns about long and shortterm toxi c effects of pesticide exposure on people who applied pesticides app licators wildlife nontarget insects and birds and on food consumers subsequently led to complete revision of fifra in 1972 the 1972 law completely replaced the original 1947 law and is the basis of current federal policy substan tial changes were made in 1988 pl 100532 1996 plhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs3 104170 and 2004 pl 108199 the 1988 am endments focused on accelerating the reregistration process the 1996 amendm ents facilitated registration of pesticides for special socalled minor uses reauthorized collection of fees to support reregistration and required c oordination of regulations implementing fifra and the federal food drug and cosm etic act 21 us c 321 et seq the 2004 amendments known as the pesticide re gistration improveme nt act pria modified the types and amounts of fees that epa could co llect to support its activities the pesticide registration improvement renewal act or pria 2 pl 11094 enacted october 9 2007 reauthoriz ed and revised these fee provisions which would have expired at the end of fy2008 see table 3 for listing of current provisions in fifra authorization for appropriations for fifra expired on september 31 1991 although appropriations bills have continued to provide funding to implement the law authority provided by fifra to epa to issue and enforce regulations is for the most part permanent and is not aff ected by the lack of authorization table 1 federal insecticide fungicide and

possible contaminants it required the food and drug administration then part of the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs4 department of agriculture to set maximum residue levels tolerances for unavoidable poisonous substances in food congress acted to protect consumers from pesticide residues on food in 1954 by adding new section 408 to the ffdca it directed fda to set residue tolerances for all pesticides in raw agricultural commodities congress expanded the requirement for tolerances in the food additives amendment of 1958 which adde d section 409 directing fda to set tolerances for food additives in cluding pesticide residues in processed foods section 409 also forbade the addition to f ood of any additive including pesticide residue if it was found to be potential cancercausing agent this provision is referred to as the delaney clause in 1970 authority to establish tolerances for pesticide resi dues was transferred to the newly formed epa fda now in the department of health and human services retained responsibility for enfo rcement of tolerances in food that is imported or sold across state boundaries in 1996 congress substantially revise d requirements for pesticide residue tolerance setting in the food quality prot ection act fqpa the fqpa redefined terms so that pesticide residues in proce ssed foods were long er regulated as food additives and therefore longer were subject to the delaney clause the fqpa also established new safe ty standard of reasonable certainty of harm from exposure to pesticides see table 4 for listing of current pesticiderelated provisions in ffdca the act of july 22 1954 authorized such sums as may be necessary to carry out this ffdca section 21 usc 346b table 2 federal food drug and cosmetic act section 408 and amendments

pesticide manufacturers apply to register pesticide active ingredient pesticide product or new use of regi stered pesticide under fifra section 3 epa requires them to submit scientific data on toxicity and behavior in the environment epa may require data from any combina tion of more than 100 different tests depending on the potential toxicity of active and inert ingredients and degree ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs5 exposure to register pesticide us on food epa also requires applicants to identify analytical methods that can be used to test food for residues of active ingredients certain inert ingredients nd their breakdown products and to determine the amount of residue that could remain on crops as well as on or in food products assuming that the pesticide product is applied according to the manufacturers recommended rates and methods based on the data submitted epa termines whether and under what conditions the proposed pesticide use woul d present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment if the pes ticide is proposed for use on food crop epa also determines whether safe level of pesticide residue called tolerance can be established under the fede ral food drug and cosmetic act tolerance must be established before pe sticide registration may be granted for use on food crops if registration is granted the agency sp ecifies the approved uses and conditions of use including safe methods of pesticide storage and disposal which the registrant must explain on the product label fifr requires that federal regulations for pesticide labels preempt state local nd tribal regulations use of pesticide product in manner inconsistent with its label is prohibited epa may classify and register pestic ide product for general or for restricted use products known as restricteduse pe sticides are those judged to be more dangerous to the applicator or to the envi ronment such pesticides can be applied only by people who have been trained nd certified individual states and indian tribes generally are responsible for traini ng and certifying pesticide applicators fifra section 3 also allows conditional temporary registrations if 1 the proposed pesticide ingredients and uses are substantially similar to currently registered products and will not create additional significan t environmental risks 2 an amendment is proposed for additional uses of registered pesticide and sufficient data are submitted indicating that there is significant additional risk or 3 data requirements for new active ingredient require more time to generate than normally allowed and use of the pesticide during the period will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment nd will be in the public interest fifraffdca coordination epa has long coordinated pesticide registrations for food uses under fifra with tolerance setting under the ffdca th food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa public law 104170 codified this policy thus if epa revokes residue tolerance under ffdca it cancels the fifra pesticide registration for that food use similarly if pesticide registra tion for use on food crop is canceled epa also cancels the residue tolerance for th food however just as fifra allows continued use of remainin g pesticide stocks after registration is canceled ffdca allows continued commerce in commodities legally treated with pesticide thus epa does not immediatel revoke the tolerance for the pesticide residue when it cancels the corresponding registrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs6 5 that is use on food crops animal feed crops or food products directly eg grains fruits or vegetables after harvest 6 us house of representatives committee on commerce food quality protection act of 1996 hrept 104669 part 2 104th cong 2nd sess 1996 p 6tolerance setting any person who has registered pesticide may petition epa proposing establishment of tolerance or an exemption for that pesticide to permit its use on foodrelated crops5 tolerance petitions must incl ude information about pesticide application rates measured concentrations of pesticide residues on the food after the pesticide has been applied according to direc tions on its label and safety of pesticide use on food crops the ffdca re quires epa to respond to each pe tition by establishing tolerance or exempting the pesticide from the requirement if the pesticide will not leave residue s above an established safe level epa will register the pesticide for use on that food product and set the tolerance level by issuing regulation epa tolerances for pesticide re sidues preempt state nd local restrictions on food if the state and local restrictions are based on lower resi due levels states may petition for an exception if the epase t residue level threatens public health the ffdca section 408 as amended requi res epa to assess safety in terms of total exposure to the pesticide that is to the concentration of pesticide allowed by the tolerance together with all other di etary and nonfood exposures for which there is reliable information as well as to other pesticides that have the same toxic effects on people quantitative standard of safety is established by law but the committee on commerce noted in its report on the bill that became the fqpa that epa should continue setting standards to ensure safety as it had in the past the committee expects that tolerance will provide reasonable certainty of harm if the administrator determines that the aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue will be lower by an ample margin of safety than the level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause or contribute to any known or anticipated harm to human health the committee further expects based on discussions with the envir onmental protection agency that the administrator will interpret an ample margin of safety to be 100fold safety factor applied to the scientifically termined observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies6 in determining safe leve l the ffdca directs epa to take into account many factors including available informati on on dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children fqpa strictly limited the nature and influence of benefits considered in tolerance setting under section 408 of the ffdca as amended section 408 allows epa to maintain or modify existing tolerances but not to establish new tolerances at higher than safe residue levels only if the pesticide use avoids other greater risks to consumers or is necessary to avoid significant disruption in domestic pr oduction of an adequate wholesome and economical food supply such higher tolerance levels may be set only for pesticides that are potential carcinogens or have some other health ffect for which there is known level of exposure at which harm is anticipated known as nonthreshold effect thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs7 7 ibidhigher tolerance level allowed for such pesticide residues must be safe for infants and children as well as with respect to health effects for which there is known threshold that is level below which exposure is known to be harmless the higher cancer or other nonthre shold risk posed by the tolerance on an annual basis may not be more than 10 times the risk at safe level of exposure and not more than twice the risk of safe level over lifetime for nonthreshold effects the house commerce committee provided additional guidance for establishing level of resi due that should be considered safe in the case of nonthreshold effect which can be assessed through quantitative risk assessment such as cancer effect the committee expects based on its understanding of current epa practice that tolerance will be considered to provide reasonable certainty of harm if any increase in lifetime risk based on quantitative risk assessment using conservative assumptions will be greater than negligible it is the committees understanding that under current epa practice epa interprets negligib risk to be oneinamillion lifetime risk the committee expects the admini strator to continue to follow this interpretation7 the safe standard applies to both raw and processed foods and requires epa to consider cumulative and aggregate exposure to pesticides in food drinking water air and consumer products cong ress directed epa to reeval uate all existing tolerances against this standard before august 2006 ffdca directs the fda in the department of health and human services and usda to monitor pesticide re sidue levels in food in interstate commerce and to enforce tolerances through their food insp ection programs usda is responsible for inspecting meat and poultry fda inspects ll other foods states also may monitor pesticide residues in food sold within their jurisdictions public disclosure exclusiv use and trade secrets fifra section 3 directs epa to make the data submitted by the applicant for pesticide registration publicly available within 30 days after registration is granted however applicants may claim certain da ta are protected as trade secrets under fifra section 10 if epa agrees that the data are protected the agency must withhold those data from the public unless th data pertain to the health effects or environmental fate or effects of the pesticide ingredients information may be protected if it qualifies as trade secret and reveals 1 manufacturing processes 2 details of methods for testin g detecting or measuring amounts of inert ingredients or 3 the identity or percentage quantity of inert ingredients companies sometimes seek to register product based upon the registration of similar products relying upon the data provided by the original registrant that are publicly released this is allowed howe ver section 3 of fifra provides for 10 year period of exclusive use by the registrant of data submitted in s upport of an original registration or new use in addition an applicant who submits any newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs8 data in support of registration is titled to compensation for the cost of data development by any subsequent applicant w ho supports an application with that data within 15 years of its submission if compensation is not jointly agreed upon by the registrant and applicant bindi ng arbitration can be invoked reregistration most pesticides currently registered in the united states are older pesticides and were not subject to modern safety review s amendments to fifra in 1972 directed epa to reregister appr oximately 35000 older products in order to assess their safety in light of current standards the task of reregistering older pesticides was streamlined by reviewing groupings of produc ts having the same active ingredients on generic instead of individual produc t basis for fooduse pesticides epa evaluated pesticides eligibility for reregistration at the same time the agency reassessed the tolerance for that pestic ide under the ffdca the fqpa required epa to reassess pesticides posing the gr eatest risks first many of the 35000 pesticide products were not reviewed and their registra tions were canceled because registrants did not request reregistration at least 14000 products are longer in use nevertheless the task for registrants and epa was immense and costly to accelerate the process of reregistration congress in 1988 amendments to fifra imposed 10year reregistration sc hedule to help pay for the additional costs of the accelerated process congress di rected epa to require registrants to pay reregistration and annua l registration maintenance fees on pesticide ingredients and products the 1996 amendments to fifr extended epas authority to collect maintenance fees through fy2001 exempti ons from or reductions in fees were allowed for minoruse pesticides public health pesticides and small business registrants congress extended authority for fees annually through appropriations legislation after fy2001 until the omnibus ppropriations legislation signed january 23 2004 pl 108199 modified the types and amounts of fees that epa could collect potentially through fy2008 the 2004 fifra amendments pria r eauthorized collection of annual maintenance fees to support registration designated tion of those fees for the review of inert ingredients and extended the deadline for completion of reregistration pria directed epa to complete reregistrati on eligibility decisions reds for pesticides with food usestole rances by august 3 2006 and to complete reds for all remaining nonfood use pesticides by october 3 2008 the reregistration process will continue for several years after that date as explained on the epa reregistration website after epa has issued red and declared pesticide eligible for reregistration individual enduse products that contain the pesticide active ingredient still must be reregistered through this concluding part of the process known as product reregistration the agency makes sure that the risk reduction measures called for in reds are reflected on individual pesticide product labels in some cases the agency uses memoranda of agreement or other measures to include risk reduction measures on pesticide labels sooner before product reregistration ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs9 8 epa pesticide reregist

modifications to the fee payment process and an expansion of the range of categories of pesticide registration licensing activities subject to fees special review epa continues to evaluate the safety of pesticides after they are registered as new information becomes available fifr requires registrant s to report promptly any new evidence of adverse effects from pe sticide exposure if evidence indicates that registered pesticide may pose an unreasonable risk epa may initiate special review of available information to reevaluate the risks and benefits of each registered use fifra also authorizes epa to require registrants to conduc t new studies to fill gaps in scientific understanding to assist risk asse ssments as result of special review epa may conclude that registration is adequate needs amendment or should be canceled canceling or suspending registration if special review or reregistration evaluation finds that registered use may cause unreasonable adverse effects epa may amend or cancel the registration9 fifra also allows registrants to request cancellation or amendment of registration to terminate selected pesticide uses requesting voluntary cancellation sometimes reflects registrants conclusion that the co st of additional studies is not worth the expected benefit that is pr ofit from sales if the registration would be maintained if registration is canceled for one or more uses of pesticide fifra does not permit it to be sold or distributed for thos uses in the united states although for specified period of time us farmers may use remaining stocks and commerce may continue for commodities that were legally treated with the pesticide fifra allows registrants to appeal an ep decision to cancel registra tion an appeal initiates lengthy review process during which the product may continue to be marketed however if there is threat of an imminent hazard during the time required to cancel registration fifra authorizes ep to suspend registration suspension orders which also may be app ealed stop sales and use of the pesticide in the event of suspension and cancellation fifra s ection 15 directs epa to request an appropriation from congress to compensate anyone who ow ned any of the pesticide and suffered any loss due to the suspension or cancellation the registrant of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs10 suspended and canceled product is responsible however for all of the transportation and disposal costs and most storage costs use of unregistered pesticides fifra also allows for unregistered use of pesticide products in special circumstances section 5 allows experimental use permits for purposes of research and to collect data needed to register pesticide section 18 allows emergency exemptions from the provisions of fifra to be granted to federal or state agencies for example if there is virulent outbreak of diseas that cannot be controlled by registered products in addition section 24 c permits states to allow additional uses of federally registered product to meet special local needs enforcement generally epa has the authority to enforce fifra requirements however fifra section 26 gives states with ade quate enforcement procedures laws and regulations primary authority including inspection authority for enforcing fifra provisions related to pesticide use epa is authorized by section 27 to rescind states primary enforcement responsibility if it is not being carried out fifra section 11 authorizes epa to form cooperative agreements with states giving them the responsibility for training nd certifying applicators of restricted use pesticides states also may initially review and give preliminary approval to applications for emergency exemptions and special local needs registrations although under some conditions fifra allo ws epa later to deny stateapproved applications section 9 authorizes inspections by epa and authorized state officials of pesticide products where they are stored for distribution or sale section 13 authorizes epa to issue orders to stop sales and to seize supplies of pesticide products civil and criminal penalties for violations of fifra are established in section 14 while section 15 pr ovides indemnity payments for end users distributors and dealers of pesticides when regi strations are suspended and canceled federal district courts are authorized in section 16 to review epa final actions and omissions when action is not discretiona ry people adversely affected by an epa order may file for judicial review of the order following hearing but fifra does not authorize citizen suits against violators export of unregistered pesticides fifra does not give epa the authority to regulate domestic production for export of unregistered pesticides even if us registration has been canceled for health or environmental reas ons however fifra does re quire exporters to prepare or pack pesticides as specified by the purchaser and in accord with some of the fifra labeling provisions for example exporters must translate warning information into the language of the des tination fifra also requires exporters of unregistered pesticides to obtain the purchasers signature on statement acknowledging that the pesticide is unregi stered and cannot be sold in the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31921crs11 states epa is required
