trade organizations wto doha round has emerged as major stumbling block in the sevenyear negotiations doha round negotiations nama refers to the cutting of tariff and nontariff barriers ntb on industrial and primary products basically all trade in goods which are not foodstuffs while the agriculture negotiations have often overshadowed the nama talks trade of industrial and primary products continue to make up the bulk of world trade average tariffs in developed countries have declined from 40 at the end of world war ii to 6 today through successive rounds of general agreement on tariffs and trade ga ttwto trade negotiations developed countries seek the reduction of continuing high tariffs in the developing world particularly from such countries as brazil india and china developing countries seek special and differential treatment and tie their cuts in industrial tariffs to reductions in agricultural tariffs and subsidies several econometric studies have modeled the possible effect of industrial tariff liberalization on the global economy the studies vary based on the assumptions and data used all but one found greater net welfare benefit from liberalization of manufacturing tariffs than from agriculture the studies indicate that developing countries in the aggregate would gain the most from manufacturing liberalization at least in relative terms and that the single largest gainer in terms of net welfare benefit would be china recent summit of wto trade ministers held in geneva on july 2129 2008 broke up without agreement over dispute concerning agricultural safeguards over the past year committee level negotiations have proceeded following the release of draft modality text in july 2007 and revised in february may and most recently july 10 2008 the main stumbling block has been the negotiation of the tariff reduction formula members agreed to swissformula nonlinear tariff reduction formula approach at the december 2005 hong kong ministerial one in which higher tariffs are decreased more than lower tariff s however disagreements persist about the size or amounts of the tariff cuts the talks also seek to reduce the incidence of nontariff barriers which include import licensing quotas and other quantitative import restrictions conformity assessment procedures and technical barriers to trade the use of sectoral tariff elimination and special and differential treatment for developing countries have also proven controversial legislation to implement any agreement that re sults from the doha round negotiations would need to be passed by congress us trade promotion authority tpa under which congress agreed to time line for voting on implementing legislation with amendments in return for consultation and adherence to congressional negotiating objectives expired on july 1 2007 consequently there may be attempts to revise or extend tpa in order to consider legislation resulting from doha agreement

the overall us economy previous to the doha round industrial tariff negotiations were the mainstay of general agreements on tariffs and trade ga tt negotiations these rounds led to the reduction of developed country average tariffs from 40 at the end of world war ii to 6 today however average tariff figures mask higher tariffs for many labor intensive or valueadded goods that are especially of interest to the developing world moreover average tariff levels in developing countries remain high with average industrial tariffs averaging about 13 for the united states and other developed countries prospective gains from the nama talks in this round would be from the reduction of high tariffs in the developing world particularly from such countries as brazil india and china veloping countries were exempted from making concessions in market access in previous rounds thus sustaining the heavy tariff structure in those countries developing countries are leery of opening up their markets to competition often making the argument that protectionist policies were employed in the development of many successful economies from the european and north american economies in the 19 th century to the rise of the east asian tigers in the 20th century however as negotiating positions have made clear developed countries are demanding more access for their industrial products as price for opening up their agricultural sectors where many developing countries have comparative advantage conversely developing countries have held industrial tariff negotiations hostage to movement on agriculture this dynamic has been one of the factors contributing to the current deadlock in the negotiations 1 world trade organization world trade 2007 table 2

ministerial of the wto held at doha qatar in november 2001 the course of the negotiations were set in the doha ministerial declaration which provided the negotiating objectives of the round in general terms the objectives for the nonagriculture market access negotiations were described in paragraph 16 which read we agree to negotiations which shall aim by modalities to be agreed to reduce or as appropriate eliminate tariffs including the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks high tariffs and tariff escalation as well as nontariff barriers in particular on products of export interest to developing countries product coverage shall be comprehensive and without priori exclusions the negotiations shall take fully into account the special needs and interests of developing and leastdeveloped country participants including through less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments to this end the modalities to be agreed will include appropriate studies and capacitybuilding measures to assist leastdeveloped countries to participate effectively in the negotiations the nama paragraph was short on specifics and left the modalities for the talks to negotiations the general nature of the document reflected the reluctance of many members to sign up for the round and the language has been characterized as the least common denominator of what could be agreed upon at the time however the declaration gives certain clues about what path the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33634g22g145g142g561g25g152g155g149g141g561g22g155g138 g141g142g561g17g155g144g138g151g146

address concerns of the developing countries by commitment to reduce tariff peaks and escalations to concentrate on products of export interest to developing countries and to provide special and differential treatment sdt including through less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments which became mantra for developing countries however the language on reducing tariff peaks high tariffs and escalation also suggests the desire for degree of tariff harmonization this in turn would suggest the use of nonlinear reduction formula see tariff reduction below paragraph 16 allowed members to take away from the ministerial what they wanted and to return to specifics later this initial ambiguity has haunted the negotiations to this day negotiations proceeded at slow pace in 2002 and 2003 several deadlines for agreement on negotiating modalities ie methodologies by which negotiations are conducted were missed in the agriculture and industrial market access talks without agreement negotiators looked toward the september 2003 cancún ministerial to resolve the modalities in the weeks before cancún negotiating documents to achieve this resolution were criticized by all sides and expectations of the ministerial were reduced to achieving an ag reement on the framework for the modalities to be used in future negotiations during this period the united states favored an aggressive tariffcutting negotiating strategy in december 2002 the united states proposed the complete elimination of tariffs by 2015 this proposal would have eliminated nuisance tariffs tariffs below 5 and certain industrial sector tariffs by 2010 and would have removed remaining tariffs in 5 equal increments by 2015 3 this proposal applied to all countries and did not contain sdt language throughout the negotiations the united states generally has sought to limit the scope of special and differential treatment maintaining that it is in the developing countries own interest to lower tariffs not least to promote trade among developing countries the initial european union eu tariff reduction proposal relied on compression formula one in which all tariffs are compressed in four bands with the highest band being 15 4 joint submission by the united states canada and the eu before the cancún ministerial first proposed the use of swissstyle harmonization ie nonlinear formula for tariff reduction this joint paper did contain sdt language for developing countries in the form of credits awarded for unilateral liberalization activity 5 in the end industrial market access was not even discussed at the cancún ministerial which broke up over agriculture and the socalled singapore issues yet draft text from the ministerial known as the derbez text became the basis for the july 2004 framework agreement which in turn formed the basis for subsequent negotiations the july framework agreement reaffirmed the use of an unspecified nonlinear formula applied linebyline that provides flexibilities for developing countries the text also supported the concept of sectoral tariff elimination as complementary modality for tariff reduction on goods of particular export interest to developing countries but it advanced concrete proposal 3 market access for nonagriculture products communication from the united states tnmaw18 december 2 2002 4 market access for nonagriculture

wholesale inclusion of the derbez text they insisted on paragraph included as the first paragraph of the text indicating that additional negotiations are required to reach agreement on the specifics of some of these elements the elements being the formula treatment of unbound tariffs flexibilities for developing countries participation in sectoral tariff modalities and preferential tariff beneficiaries as in the doha ministerial ambiguity allowed for an immediate agreement but sowed the seeds of future disagreement as in other sectors subsequent negotiations on nama have been conducted on the basis of the july framework agreement although it was hoped th at modalities could be achieved in time for the 6 th ministerial at hong kong this proved optimistic and progress was limited to incremental steps for example while the july framework called for nonlinear harmonizing tariff reduction formula the hong kong ministerial finally settled on the swiss formula for tariff reduction but did not settle on coefficients for that formula 6 at the ministerial wto members agreed on new deadline of april 30 2006 to achieve final negotiating modalities and to establish draft schedules based on these modalities by july 31 2006 these deadlines were not met and after contentious negotiating session on agriculture on july 23 2006 directorgeneral pascal lamy suspended the doha round for period that was to last approximately six months following the july 2006 suspension several wto country groups such as the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters met to lay the groundwork to restart the negotiations although these meeting did not yield any breakthrough lamy announced the talks were back in full negotiating mode on january 31 2007 key players in the talks such as the g4 united states european union brazil india conducted bilateral or group meeting to break the impasse in the first months of the year in april 2007 g6 negotiators g4 plus australia and japan agreed to work towards concluding the round by the end of 2007 yet g4 negotiating session in potsdam collapsed anew in june 2007 on july 17 2007 the chairman of the nama negotiating group released modalities text to be considered by the negotiating committee while this text has proved controversial it served as the basis for continued if fruitless geneva negotiations for the next year revising the texts on february 8 may 19 and most recently july 10 2008 7 however summit of wto trade ministers held in geneva on july 2129 while making some progress on nama issues broke up over an intractable dispute

liberalization scenarios they use models of the world economy known as computable general equilibrium cge models which provide computer simulations of the worl d economy through equations that

economic impact of such flows on tariff revenues production prices and welfare8 assumptions made in modeling the world economy as well as the version of the gtap data used affect the results of the studies for example it has been noted that models that use the most recent data gtap version 6 using 2001 data have found smaller welfare gains to the world economy from trade liberalization previous versions of the data did not reflect ongoing trade liberalization such as chinas entry into the wto the implementation of preferential trading arrangements or the phasein of previous liberalization commitments 9 the results also depend on whether given model uses static or dynamic assumptions such as constant or increasing returns to scale or whether the model accounts for unemployment or technology transfer the focus of these reports are often on the effects of agricultural liberalization or on the potential gains or losses of developing countries however this section restricts itself to those studies that model industrial or primary product tariff reductions table 2 provides summary of the model outcomes described below one wellknown attempt to gauge the impact of the multilateral trade liberalization is the michigan model multicountry multisector general equilibrium model that is used to analyze various trade policy changes and scenarios 10 in this study conducted at the beginning of the round the model measures the welfare effects of 33 reduction in tariffs and subsidies on agriculture the same reduction on tariffs in manufactures and service sector liberalization according to this model 33 reduction in manufacturing tariffs would result in net welfare benefit of 1634 billion to the world economy the united states would achieve net 236 billion welfare gain although japan 452 bil lion and the eu 392 billion would receive greater gains overall the developed countries would achieve 1134 billion in net welfare gains and the developing countries led by china 109 billion would receive the other 50 billion in worldwide net benefit the models outcome suggests the united states could gain primarily from services liberalization 135 billion would receive some net welfare benefit from manufacturing tariff liberalization 236 billion but could suffer net welfare loss of 723 billion from the agricultural liberalization assumed in the model 11 the model suffers from the use of older data from 1995 but is bolstered by more dynamic assumptions such as increasing returns to scale and monopolistic competition 8 for more information see the gtap website at purdue

effect of trade liberalization using more recent gtap6 data from 2001 the world bank study found that full liberalization of all merchandise trade including agriculture could lead to 287 billion increase in real income by 2015 full liberalization in industrial manufactures alone would lead to 105 billion increase in real income divided between 38 billion increase from textiles and apparel liberalization and 67 billion increase from liberalization for other manufacturers developed countries could receive the largest share of benefit from full liberalization in dollar terms 57 billion v 10 billion for developing countries but developing countries may achieve greater benefits in proportion to the size of their economies the wo rld bank study found that developing countries would receive preponderance of the benefits resulting from textile and apparel liberalization 22 billion v 16 billion in the developed world the world bank study also modeled possible doha round outcomes in computing 50 reduction by developed country tariffs and 33 reduction by developing countries for all merchandise trade agriculture and industrial the study found that welfare gains from such liberalization could total 961 billion of this amount industrial tariff liberalization could provide 216 billion of extra net welfare benefit with 71 billion accruing to developing countries 12

two different scenarios for possible manufacturing outcomes of the doha round an ambitious scenario of 50 reduction in developed country tariffs and 33 reduction in developing country tariffs and more modest scenario for manufacturing with 36 reduction in developed country and 24 reduction in developing country tariffs the authors of the model warn the extent of liberalization may be overstated due to the models use of applied rather than bound tariffs the study found global real income gains from manufacturing were 531 billion for the ambitious scenario and 381 billion for the mode st scenario the liberalization of manufacturing tariffs represented over 906 of the gains from the doha round liberalization in the ambitious scenario and over 87 for the more modest formula in the ambitious scenario the gains were apportioned between 302 billion 568 for developing countries and 23 billion 432 accruing to developed countries the more modest scenario yielded 21 billion to developing countries and 164 billion to developed countries in either scenario the largest recipient of welfare gains is china at 148 billion and 106 billion respectively these figures represent nearly half of all gains shown for the developing world and slightly more than 14 of the gains overall the study suggests that some regions such as subsaharan africa would be net losers in manufactured goods liberalization in terms of net gains or losses of world export market share for developing country manufacturing exports under the modest scenario china would be the largest gainer with an approximate 033 increase in its share of world exports some countries including brazil mexico south africa and the re st of subsaharan africa would lose industrial market share under the modest scenario for the united states the model suggests that real income gains resulting from manufacturing liberalization would be nearly 65 billion for the ambitious doha scenario and 45 billion in gains for more modest outcome the united nations committee on trade and development unctad also models trade liberalization in industrial sectors 14 the unctad model uses static cge model that assumes perfect competition and constant returns to scale the study models welfare gains under free trade and under several swiss formula scenarios the formula under which negotiations are now taking place see tariff reduction below15 under the complete liberalization scenario the net welfare benefit accruing to the entire world was estimated at 2008 billion with developing countries accruing 1353 billion of that over 13 of that gain would accrue to china 486 billion the eu would receive the largest gains among developed countries at 285 billion and the study predicted the united states would receive 112 billion in benefits the unctad study also models swiss formula reductions using coefficients equaling the average weighted industrial bound tariff by group 34 for developed countries 125 for developing countries with one scenario modeling the respective coefficients at twice that level this model generated net welfare gains between 1076 billion and 1347 billion under the scenarios developing countries gained 652 billion to 869 billion of this figure nearly 23 of the gains again china gained the most between 348 billion and 412 billion around ½ of total world welfare gains the model shows us gains of 58 billion and 70 billion respectively while this study has the advantage of using an agreedupon negotiating modality the study does not use coefficients actually proposed during the negotiations 14

found that worldwide net welfare gains from full tariff liberalization in manufactured goods could be 234 billion which represented 56 of all tariff reduction gains seventythree percent of this gain went to developing countries 17 billion with 63 billion accruing to the developed world in relation to the size of their economies developing countries gained relatively more with such gains equaling 033 of developing country gdp versus 005 for developed countries notable in this survey was an outcome showing that north america would suffer the largest welfare loss from manufacturing liberalization 68 billion due to according to the authors an unfavorable termsoftrade effects in the motor vehicle and related industries resulting from lower prices in the sector16 the study also modeled several swiss formula scenarios but the models did not differentiate between agriculture and manufacturing tariffs because of the differing assumptions made in these models and the different datapoints generated by them it is difficult to generalize about their results all but one found greater net welfare benefit from liberalization of manufacturing tariffs than from agriculture the studies suggest that developing countries would gain the most from manufacturing liberalization at least in relative terms and that the single largest gainer in terms of net welfare benefit would be china most of these studies indicate the united states could achieve modest net welfare gains from manufacturing liberalization

negotiating issue in the nama talks has been over the tariff formula the december 2005 hong kong ministerial declaration endorsed the use of nonlinear swiss style tariff reduction formula this result builds on previous negotiations beginning with the doha ministerial declaration which launched the round in november 2001 that declaration committed member nations to negotiate the reduction or elimination of tariffs based on modalities to be agreed in the talks negotiating modalities discussed for the nama talks included cuts determined by formula by requestoffer approach or by agreement to harmonize or eliminate tariffs in specific sectorall of which had been used in previous rounds of negotiations the doha declaration called for the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks or tariff escalation tariff peaks refer to countrys adoption of the maximum allowable tariff in order to protect sensitive products from competition tariff peaks are levied by the united states for certain textile products footwear and watches tariff escalation is the practice of increasing tariffs as value is added to commodity as an example of tariff escalation cotton would come in with low tariff fabric would face higher tariff and finished shirt would face the highest tariff tariff escalation is often employed to protect importcompeting valueadding industries peak tariffs and escalations tend to be levied particularly against the products of developing countries thereby adding to the cost of consumer goods in developed countries 16 prezemyslaw kowalski the doha development agenda welfare

more than two years including the illfated cancun ministerial the july 2004 framework agreement endorsed non linear formula applied on linebyline basis as modality to conduct tariff reduction negotiations nonlinear formula works to even out or harmonize tariff levels among participants this type of formula would result in greater percentage reduction of higher tariffs than lower ones resulting in greater equalization of tariffs at lower level than before negotiations on linebyline basis means that the formula would not be applied as an average to industrial categories but to the tariff line of each individual product harmonization formula would also work to reduce tariff peaks and tariff escalations another stated goal of the doha declaration by contrast an example of linear formula would be one that reduced tariffs by certain percentage across the board consequently this formula would not change the relative tariff rates among members country with relatively high tariffs before undergoing the formula would still have high tariffs relative to other countries afterwards this approach is generally favored by countries with high tariffs or certain tariff peaks that the country seeks to preserve after further 18 months of largely fruitless negotiations the december 2005 hong kong ministerial formally adopted the swiss formula as the nonlinear formula by which industrial tariff cuts would be negotiated it is known as the swiss formula because it was the formula proposed by switzerland and later adopted by gatt members to cut tariffs in the 1970s tokyo round the swiss formula is t atat where t the resulting tariff rate is obtained by dividing the product of the coefficient and the initial tariff rate t by the sum of the coefficient and the initial tariff t selection of the coefficient is key because it determines the final tariff lower coefficient results in lower tariff t in addition the equation works in such way that the coefficient also represents the countrys maximum tariff after the formula has been applied although the ministerial agreed to swiss formula it did not agree on the coefficients that would finalize the negotiating modalities before the round was temporarily suspended in july 2006 negotiations in geneva were being conducted around the use of two coefficients for the formula with one value for developed countries and another higher value for developing countries the eu in its crosscutting proposal of october 2005 proposed coefficient of 10 for developed countries and 15 for developing and least developed countries ldcs this ratio was subsequently endorsed by the united states 17 pakistan proposed that the developed countries have coefficient of 6 and developing countries coefficient of 3018 other proposals suggested range of figures new zealand has suggested that the difference between the two should be more the five percentage points19 developing countries contend that they should be afforded higher coefficient based on language in the doha ministerial declaration affording them less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments 17 us eu to work together on nama inside us trade march 3 2006 18

formula with multiple coefficients was one put forth by argentina brazil and india known as the abi proposal20 abi also used the swiss formula but it proposed the coefficient to be the tariff average of each country thus each country would have its own co efficient abi would not result in tariff harmonization among countries because there would not be common coefficient however it would result in harmonization across products within each countrys tariff schedule21 just prior to the illfated june 30july 1 2006 miniministerial in geneva pascal lamy suggested possible compromise in the form of the 202020 proposal in addition to advocating ceiling of 20 billion in us domestic agriculture support and the use of the g20 agricultural market access proposal for developed countries lamy advocated developing country of coefficient of 20 for the nama swiss formula the nama element of the proposal was criticized by us and eu officials as lacking ambition us manufacturing groups scored the proposal as failing to provide sufficient market access to make deal worthwhile to us manufacturers brazil for its part attacked the proposal as too ambitious and renewed its call for coefficient of 30 for developing countries the nama chairmans negotiating draft of july 2007 and reaffirmed in february 2008 suggested swiss formula coefficient of 89 for developed countries and between 1923 for developing countries the chairman calculated that such coefficient range would yield an average tariff of 3 90 of tariffs below 5 and tariff peaks of 785 for the united states and europe 22 for developing countries the chairman calculated the average bound tariff resulting from the suggested coefficients as 12 with 80 to 90 of tariff lines below 15 thirtyone developing countries would apply these tariff re ductions least developed countries ldcs would be exempt from reduction commitments and recentlyacceded members such as china taiwan and vietnam would be granted higher coefficient to reflect the ambitious reductions these countries have already undertaken in order to join the wto the july 2007 nama draft reflected middle ground between the more ambitious coefficient range 1015 of the developed country proposal and that of the nama11 1035 such middle ground was proposed by chile and drew support from colombia mexico costa rica hong kong peru singapore and thailand this proposal called for developed country coefficient of less than 10 and between the upper teens and low twenties as developing country coefficient 23 reaction to the july 2007 draft was cool on all sides the nama1124 group of countries criticized what they considered the asymmetry of the proposal with the agriculture text claiming that it demanded more from developing countries than the agriculture text did from developed countries it also claimed that the proposal did not reflect the less than full reciprocity commitment for developing countries reflected in the doha declaration 25 three members of

report 27 suggests an 8 coefficient value for developed countries and sliding scale approach for the value of the coefficient for developing countries under this proposal the developing country coeffi cient would be tied to the use of one of the so called paragraph 7 flexibilities that had been introduced in the july 2004 framework agreement under that agreement developing countries may choose one of the following flexibilities 1 apply less than formula cuts for up to 10 of tariff lines provided that the cuts applied are less than half the formula cuts and that the tariff lines do not exceed 10 of the value of members nonagricultural imports or 2 keep tariff lines unbound or not applying formula cuts for 5of tariff lines provided they do not exceed 5of the value of members nonagricultural imports the bracketed percentages were initially posited as working hypotheses then adopted by the july 2007 draft modality text and then removed in the february 2008 revised draft while this was seen by some as step backward in the negotiations according to the chairman it was done to increase the range of flexibilities available to developing countries to encourage them to accept the existing range of coefficients in the overall tariff reduction formula 28 the result of these negotiations has been the proposal to tie these paragraph 7 or sliding scale flexibilities directly to the overall formula cuts thus developing country adopting coefficient x 20 could choose 1 to apply less than formula cuts for up to 14 of tariff lines provided that the cuts applied are less than half the formula cuts and that the tariff lines do not exceed 16 of the value of members nonagricultural imports or 2 keep tariff lines unbound or not applying formula cuts for 65 of tariff lines provided they do not exceed 75 of the value of members nonagricultural imports developing country adopting coefficient y22 would adopt figures in the july 2007 brackets above developing country adopting coefficient z25 would not avail itself of any flexibilities as it has made the least formula reductions the range of values for the coefficient and for the percentages of tariff lines subject to the flexibilities indicate the range of figures subject to final negotiation the use of these flexibilities has been further complicated by the socalled anticoncentration clause which provides that the flexibilities available to developing countries shall not be used to exclude full chapters of the harmonized tariff schedule hs from full formula reductions both the united states and the eu have been adamant that the flexibilities should not be used in way to exclude whole industrial sectors from formula cuts as reflected in the 2 digit hs chapter continued librarycfmrefid99395 26 us criticizes draft nama text

the anticoncentration clause beyond the statement that it should not apply to full hs chapters as agreed by all members at hong kong the lamy draft modalities set full formula tariff reductions as minimum of 20 of national tariff lines or 9 of the value of imports of the member in each hs chapter the july 2008 draft also provides for certain flexibilities for countries participating in customs unions such as the southern african customs union sacusouth africa namibia botswana lesotho and swaziland and mercosur brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay these flexibilities are sought to allow these countries to maintain common external tariff while subjecting them to formula cuts countries that have recently joined the wto socalled recentlyacceded members rams had to commit to tariff reductions and bindings as part of their accession negotiations thus they have been given some additional flexibilities in the proposed modalities albania armenia macedonia kyrgyzstan moldova saudi

production of few products would be allowed flexibilities in the amount and structure of their tariff reductions but would be required to increase the level of their tariff bindings however venezuelas

g22g138g155g146g143g143g561g4g146g151g141g146g151g144g561 second issue in the negotiations is the process of tariff binding and the use of bound tariffs in the reduction formula under article ii of the ga tt tariffs are bound at specific levels of customs duty when an agreement is reached between nations on mostfavored nation basis to 1 lower duty to stated level 2 maintain an existing level of duty or 3 not to raise duty above specified level tariffs can be bound as specific duty per item or as an ad valorem duty an ad valorem tariff is set as percentage of the value of an imported good while non ad valorem or specific tariff uses some other measurement such as fixed rate per unit or weight of goods the binding of tariffs provides for stability and predictability in the trading system by preventing the raising of tariff rates except under strict circumstances accompanied by compensatory actions the uruguay round achieved success in binding tariffs in both developing and developed countries for all countries the percentage of imports under bound rates increased from 68 to 87 the percentage of imports under bound rates increased from 78 to 99 in developed countries from 73 to 98 in transition economies and from 21 to 73 in developing countries 30 29 us firm on nama sectoral commitments as chair issues warning on unresolved items international trade reporter july

sets maximum tariff which cannot be exceeded without penalty however many countries actually apply much lower tariffs to imported goods these applied tariffs can vary widely from bound tariffs especially in developing countries although the united states the eu and several other nama friends of ambition advocated the use of applied tariffs as the basis by which tariff formula cuts be made the 2004 july framework and the subsequent h ong kong ministerial document decided to implement tariff cuts based on bound rates this decision had implications for the tariff formula because bound tariffs are often significantly higher than applied tariff levels reductions from applied rates would result in greater cuts to actually applied tariffs thus for the negotiations to provide actual market access as opposed to just cutting the binding rate the formula coefficient must be lower higher coefficients would work to exclude some tariff lines from any actual cuts in applied tariffs especially in developing countries second goal of the doha negotiations in this area concerns the binding of tariffs by developing countries because the binding process commits country not to raise tariffs beyond certain level binding has been seen as the first step in tariff reduction under the 2004 framework agreement reductions in unbound tariff lines would be calculated from twice the currently applied rate however the hong kong ministerial declaration adopted constant nonlinear markup approach but did not adopt any particul ar formula generally such an approach would add certain number of percentage points to the applied rate of the unbound tariff line in order to establish the base rate on which the tariff reduction formula would be applied the july 2008 draft suggests markup of applied rate plus 25 percentage points 31 the framework also provided flexibility for developing countries who have bound less than 35 of their nonagricultural tariff lines they would be exempt from tariff reduction commitments in the round provided that they bound the remainder of their nonagricultural tariff lines at an average level of 285 subsequent discussions on this issue have backtracked somewhat however with the july 2008 draft proposes that countries with binding coverage below 15 of tariff lines bind 7090 of currently unbound tariffs and countries and countries with binding coverage at 15 or above bind 7590 of their tariff lines 32 in addition all tariffs are to be bound in ad valorem terms all remaining non ad valorem tariffs would be converted and bound by

position to do so would grant ldcs dutyfree and quotafree access to 97 of their tariff lines as part of their doha obligations the negotiations have also acknowledged the challenge of designing tariff reductions for countries that are already beneficiaries to various preference programs such as the us african growth and opportunity act or the eus everything but arms eba initiative 34 to ameliorate such preference erosion the draft modalities provide extended implementation periods for tariff reduction for certain tariff lines on which some developing now receive non reciprocal tariff

sectoral tariff elimination as supplementary modality for the nama negotiations sectoral initiatives such as tariff elimination or harmonization permit critical mass of countries representing the preponderance of world trade in commodity to agree to eliminate tariffs in that good such an arrangement requires the participation of the major players however because under the mostfavorednation principle those tariffs would be eliminated for all countries even those not reciprocating the 1996 information technology agreement is an example of completed sectoral tariff elimination agreement in which 41 countries have eliminated tariffs on 180 products the hong kong ministerial declaration took note of these sectoral negotiations and instructed negotiators to determine which sectors could garner sufficient support to be realized 36 sectoral 34 the eba is an eu tariff preference program that provides ldcs with tarifffree quotafree access for their exports excluding armaments 35 now

materials sports equipment toys and textiles clothing and footwear37 the united states has been the main proponent of sectoral negotiations and has linked level of overall formula cuts to participation in the sectorals the united states has sought to have developing countries commit to sectorals and to the level of cuts prior to determining the level of formula cuts 38 some developing countries have participated in these discussions and have proposed some sectors other developing countries have questioned engagement in sectoral negotiations prior to settling on formula for negotiations while the current nama draft as modified by the lamy proposal and the subsequent chairmans report reaffirms the voluntary aspects of sectoral negotiations it calls upon members to commit to negotiate the terms of at least two sectoral initiatives in order to achieve critical mass or with view to making them viable in the chairmans report any developing country member participating in resulting sectoral initiative would be able to increase its coefficient in the overall tariff reduction formula by an increment to be determined the july 2008 draft also introduced the possibility of special and differential treatment for developing countries participating in the sectorals including 0 for x tariff reductions longer implementation times and partial product coverages the chairmans statement also broached the exclusion from sectorals of tariff lines for which the paragraph 7 flexibilities were applied see above by developing countries the revisions to the nama text have proved controversial the national association of manufacturers charges that the chairmans text undercuts the possibility of meaningful sectoral agreements through the expansion of special and differential treatment and urges ustr schwab not to allow this document to be come the negotiating text going forward 39 the switch in the terms used to describe the level of participation that would make sectoral initiative feasible from critical mass to viable was also seen as weakening the text this is because the term critical mass has come to mean the initiative would include countries comprising 90 of world trade thus requiring the participation of china and maybe other developing countries the term viable by contrast does not have such defined connotation perhaps giving these countries pass on participation 40 37 tnmaw103rev2 p 6 38 us firm on nama sectoral commitments as chair issues warning on unresolved items wto reporter july 9 2008 39 national association of manufacturers nam dismayed

july 1 2007 the parties likely will seek to achieve progress in the talks in the hope that the 110th congress may extend tpa to consider poss ible doha round agreement congressional consideration of tpa extension legislation may provide venue for debate on the status of the round and the prospects for reaching an agreement consistent with principles set forth by congress in granting tpa if progress is not made in the doha round or if it goes into period of limbo there may be consequences for industrial tariff liberalization first the negotiation of bilateral and regional free trade agreements may accelerate in the wake of the 2006 negotiation suspension the united states the eu brazil and india all announced plans to concentrate on additional bilateral liberalization while bilateral or regional free trade agreements fta potentially can completely remove tariffs or any other trade distortions between negotiating countries the proliferation of these agreements may complicate international trade as exporters must navigate competing tariff schedules rules of origin or other nontariff barriers this prospect can lead to trade diversion circumstance in which countries trade based on tariff levels and not on comparative advantage related question is whether the proliferation of these agreements may erode the willingness of participating countries to negotiate multilaterally especially if countries are able to strike deals with their major trading partners further consequence may be the loss of agreements already made at the negotiations while the nama talks are far from completed some components such as the swiss formula have been agreed it is possible that prolonged disagreements may imperil the progress that has been made as countries may withdraw what they have ag reed to without signs of forward momentum it is also unlikely that the nama talks can achieve breakthrough in the absence of progress in the agriculture talks for good or ill the agriculture talks have become the linchpin of the negotiations aside from the intrinsic importance developing countries place on the agricultural talks many developing countries appear to have used the nama negotiations as bargaining chip to hold out for better agriculture offers these countries often hold defensive positions in the nama talks and seek expanded agricultural access in protected and subsidized developed country agricultural markets as recompense for any nama concessions they might make conversely developed countries seek market openings in industrial products to offset their concessions in agriculture because of the negotiating principle of the single undertaking in which nothing is agreed until everything is agreed separate agreements in discrete negotiating areas are unlikely httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33634g22g145g142g561g25g152g155g149g141g561g22g155g138 g141g142g561g17g155g144g138g151g146 g163g138g157g146g152
