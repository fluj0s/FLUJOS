introduction scientists engineers and health professionals frequently communicate and cooperate with one another without regard to national boundaries dating back to the 1700s benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson are thought of as the nations first scientific diplomats1 scientists and inventors themselves they corresponded with colleagues and brought knowledge back from their visits to europe to enhance the development and policies of the very young united states today the united states serves the same role for other countries that are in the early stages of development or at major point of transition congress is currently discussing how to maximize the effectiveness of these international science and technology st policy activities2 this report provides an overview of current us international st policy describes the role of the department of state dos the white house office of science and technology policy ostp the us agency for international development usaid and other federal agencies and discusses possible policy options for congress it focuses on international science and technology diplomacy where american leadership in science and technology is used as diplomatic tool to enhance another countrys development and to improve understanding by other nations of us values and ways of doing business these efforts could focus on both enhancing nations science and technology st resources as well as addressing developmental challenges where st could play role according to the national research council five potential challenges include child health

domestic benefits from cooperation in science and technology22 one fundamental question asked during the hearing was why the united states should support international science diplomacy rather than invest in domestic rd table 1 provides summary of the administrations response for the united states to be competitive according to administration witnesses it needs to know where the frontier of science is occurring as other countries increase their investment in higher education and rd the top science and engineering research and facilities may not be in the united states but in other countries this increases the importance of us investment in international st diplomatic activities say administration witnesses including federal programs that support us scientists collaborations with foreign scientists and access to the best research facilities in the world as well as enhancing the international connections of us science and engineering students and leaders in addition us science and engineering higher education and research helps developing countries by enhancing their human resource capacity and as result their ability to achieve longterm development these international connections can be important say witnesses not just for those countries but in helping the us respond to global challenges such as infectious diseases such as avian flu further according

decide that funding international st activities is important agreeing on policy goal beyond enhancing the countrys development such as improving us relations with other countries or enhancing popular opinion of the united states may help set priorities activities funded might differ depending on those priorities for example two possible goals might be 1 improving us relations with the government of country or in region or 2 raising popular opinion of the united states in that country or region in the case of the first goal activities might focus on enhancing the foreign governments decisionmaking based on science and engineering information or providing financial or technical aid to countrys science and engineering efforts in the case of the second goal activities might focus on challenge more visible to the public such as increasing access to water enhancing agricultural productivity or obtaining high quality stem education although the effectiveness of different st diplomatic initiatives has not been studied the state department contends that some key elements for success are finding areas or programs that 1 break new ground sometimes in neglected area of science or development 2 are educationally and developmentally transformative 3 address core developmental issues of poverty and human development 4 promote sustainable uses of natural resources 5

research 3 facilities and equipment 4 academic opportunities from primary through postsecondary education 5 meetings dialogues and visits and 6 private sector activities see table 2 international st cooperative activities can be multinational regional or bilateral related question is who might best lead such efforts relative to the desired goal options include scientists engineers and health

in addition the report recommends creating closer connection between the roles of the assistant secretary for oes and the stas to bring senior attention to the full range of set challenges and

otherwise the stas could become the principal deputy assistant secretary of state pdas in oes26 st capacity at usaid national research council nrc report recommends congress and others take action to
