fund management reform congress faces possibly multibilliondolla r problem stemming from indian trust funds the federal government s management of indian tr ust funds and lands has led to financial claims against the united states by indian individuals and tribes the indian individual claimants alone suggest they ar owed as much as 176 billion besides lawsuits the issue has also led to the cont roversial reorganization of two agencies the bureau of indian affairs bia and the office of special trustee for american indians ost within doi the bia has long managed funds lands and re lated physical assets held in trust for indian tribes and individuals trust nds total about 56 million acres almost 46 million acres for tribes and 10 million acres for indi viduals the funds asset value recently totaled about 33 billion of which about 29 billion was in about 1400 tribal accounts and 400 million was in more than 260000 indivi dual indian money iim accounts the treasury department houses the accounts incl uding making payments to beneficiaries historically the bia was frequently criticized for its management of trust lands and funds investigations and audits in th 1980s and after showed that among other problems the bia could not document the sset values of all trust fund accounts and could not link all trust lands to their ow ners and accounts congress enacted the american indian trust fund management re form act of 1994 to reform the management of indian trust funds and assets the act dir ected the secretary of the interior to account for trust fund balances and created the ost to oversee trust management reforms two years later based on the 1994 act and general trust law iim account holders filed class action suit in the federal district court for the district of columbia against the various us officials demanding an accounting of thei r funds and correction of fund mismanagement cobell v norton civil 961285 ddc in addition at least 25 tribal suits have been filed covering specific tribes funds these events have led to the currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22056crs3 2 for legal analysis and history of the cobell case see crs report rs21738 the

mismanagement claims and settlement2 in the first of two stages of the cobell case the district court in 1999 found that doi and treasury had breached their trust duties regarding 1 the document retention and da ta gathering necessary for an accounting and 2 the business systems and staffing to fix trus t management the c ourt ordered doi and treasury to bring trust manageme nt up to current trust standards the final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money that ought to be in the iim plaintiffs accounts in an intervening stage the dist rict court decided what historical accounting method should be used to determine the amount owed the plaintiffs doi in 2003 proposed reconciling all trust account transactions above certain value but only sampling of transactions below that value back to 1938 while the plaintiffs had proposed using production and mapping da tabases and doi data to timate the total amount due doi estimated its method would show iim sses in the tens of millions while the plaintiffs methods have s hown estimated losses including interest of well over 100 billion the district court has twice issued orders september 2003 and february 2005 requiring the doi to perform historical accounting of all iim trust account transactions and assets since 1887 without using statis tical sampling after the second order doi estimated that compliance would cost 12 13 billion both times the us court of appeals for the dc circuit overturned the dist rict courts order to date the district court has not issued another order on historical accounting the doi continues to carry out its historical accounting plan congress has acted on the cobell suit chiefly through oversight hearings and through provisions in interior appr opriation acts and reports both the house appropriations committee and the conference committee in their reports on the fy2006 interior appropriations act pl 10954 stated that they rejected the position that congress intended in the 1994 act to require an histor ical accounting on the scale of that ordered by the district court but bills have been introduced in this congress to amend the 1994 act to delineate the extent of the historical accounting obligation congress has long been concerned that the costs of the cobell lawsuit may jeopardize doi trust reform implementation reduce spending on other indian programs and be difficult to fund current costs incl ude the expenses of the ongoing litigation possible future costs include 1213 billion fo r the courtordered historical accounting cobell settlement that might cost as much as the courtordered hist orical accounting the 275 billion that the cobell plaintiffs have proposed as settlement amount in their statement of principles for settlement legi slation or the more than 100 billion that cobell plaintiffs estimate their iim accounts are owed among the funding sources for these large costs are discretionary appr opriations and the treasury departments

and funds mismanageme nt claims under the 8billion settlement3 reorganization the doi bia and ost have undertaken or proposed number of administrative and organizational changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 act one of the more important ch anges was the 1996 transfer from bia to ost of the office that manages the trust funds management of trust lands and other physical assets stayed with bia in april 2003 the doi undertook new and ongoing reorganization that splits the bia trust management operations off from other bia services at the regional and agency levels and creates ost fiel d operations by placing fiduciary trust officers and administrators at bia regional and agency offices to oversee trust management and pr ovide information to indian trust beneficiaries tribal leaders and the cobell plaintiffs vigorously oppose the current reorganiza tion claiming it included insufficient consultation with tribes insufficiently defined new ost duties and should have followed not preced ed creation of new trust ma nagement procedures the doi responded that it had consu lted with tribes for year beforehand and that it had faced courtordered deadline attempts to lt the reorganization in recent congresses have been defeated and bills in previous cong resses proposing various changes in doi and bia trust management such as abolishing ost assigning trust line authority to new office or establishing commission to reco mmend improvements in fe deral indian trust laws and policies have not been reported from committee s 1439 and hr 4322 however as noted above propose to reorganize doi management of indian trust assets and s 1439 may be marked up pending the negotiations mentioned above indian gaming lands the indian gaming regulatory act igr pl 100497 was enacted to provide regulatory structure for gambling on indian reservations and cer tain other lands withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22056crs5 the intent that tribes would use gaming revenues for tribal economic development and governmental programs igra prohibits gaming on any trust lands acquired after its enactment in 1988 but allows eight excep tions to this prohibition including ones for tribes without reservations in 1988 newly r ecognized tribes restored tribes and land claim settlements and in circumstances where the interior secretary and the state governor agree that the acquisition would benefit the tribe and not harm the local community critics assert that the exceptions allow reservation shopping where tribes seek trust lands for gaming offreservati on ie distant from tribes existing reservations or current or historic loca tions and also undermine the onreservation economic development intended by congress and encour age land claims and investor funded tribal petitions fo r federal acknowledgment two of the bills introduced to curb the exceptions s 2078 and hr 4893 have been reported both bills delete the exception requiring secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed befo re certain 2006 date march 7 for hr 4893 april 15 for s 2078 to go forward alt hough hr 4893 adds geographic limitation to lands with nexus to the tribe both bills retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988 newly recognized tribes and restored tribes but with limitations for the latter two exceptions including tribal nd nexus interior s ecretary approval and for hr 4893 triballocal mitigation agreem ent the land claim exception is repealed by hr 4893 but retained by s 2078 alt hough with geographic and legal limitations hr 4893 adds new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment but applies the same limits as for newly recognized tribes opponents object that the bills add new and unfair burdens on newly recognized restored and landle ss tribes that the exceptions for secretarialgubernatorial agreem ents and land claims have been used only rarely since 1988 and especially that hr 4893s requirement for mitigation agreements is an unprecedented subjection of tribal sovere ignty to local governments s 2078 awaits senate floor action hr 4893 was considered by the h ouse september 13 and failed to pass for more inform ation see crs report rs21499 indian gaming regulatory act gaming on newly acquired lands native hawaiian recognition native hawaiians the indigenous people of hawaii are not currently considered indians under federal indi an law and have po litical tity that like indian tribes is recognized by the federal government c ongress has however authorized number of federal programs to benefit native hawaiians supporters of recognition are concerned that the absence of recognized native hawaiian political entity endangers federal and state native hawaiian programs exposing them to current legal challenges that claim the programs are racebased at present indian tribes are usually recognized either by congress or through the dois administrativ process native hawaiians however are excluded from the doi process which means congressional action is needed for native hawaiian political entity to be recognized three bills in the 109th congress s 147 hr 309 and s 3064 would establish process by which native hawaiian political entity would be organized and federally recognized the bills leave for later negotiations and legislation questions concerning the political entitys governmental powers and lands and exclude the native hawaiian political entity from bia programs and from coverage under the indian gaming regulatory act some of the arguments for and against the bills are summarized herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22056crs6 4 for further analyses of legal nd other issues see crs report rl33101 s 147hr 309 process for federal recognition of native hawaiian governmental entity proponents argue that congress has power to recognize native hawaiian political entity because congresss constitutional au thority over commerce with the indian tribes extends to all indigenous native peoples in the united states they also argue that congress has recognized special political and legal relationship with the native hawaiian people s 147 221 identical with th at with indian tribes they point to the numerous native hawaiian programs that congress has established especially the hawaiian homelands program which was established in 1921 when hawaii was territory but is now under hawaii state cont rol with certain continuing congressional duties under which certain public lands are reserved for l ease only to native hawaiians proponents argue that native hawa iians have not given up thei r claims to sovereignty but rather had sovereignty forc ibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii an action led by americans living in hawaii and with the active support of certain us officials and armed forces there the new republic of hawaii agreed to us annexation in 1898 they further state that native hawaiians like indian tribes have maintained single distinct community with cultural and political institutions opponents dispute these points they argu that congresss authority extends only to indian tribes not to all indigenous pe oples and that hence congress does not have constitutional authority to recognize native hawaiian political entity september 2005 justice department statement echoed this concern over constitutionality opponents also argue that the united states does not have special responsib ility to native hawaiians as it has for indian tribes oppone nts also contend that recognition of native hawaiian political entity would be based on race alone arguing that unlike indian tribes the native hawaiian entity would not need to meet criteria of geography community and continuous political autonomy they argu further that native hawaiian recognition would set precedent for politi cal recognition of other racebased nonindian groups for instance the us civil rights commission on may 5 2006 issued briefing report opposing passage of s 147 as re ported citing racial discrimina tion concerns in addition some opponents dispute the claims regardin g native hawaiian sovereignty arguing among other things that native hawaiians sovereignty ended well before 1893 because the kingdom gave political rights to nonnativ hawaiians or that sovereignty resided in the monarch not the native hawaiian people and ende d with the 1893 overthrow bills similar to s 147 and hr 309 received extensive consideration in the previous three congresses s 147 wa s reported by the senate i ndian affairs committee on may 16 2005 srept 10968 s 3064 an amende d version of s 147 introduced may 25 2006 is based on discussions among congressi onal offices the administration and the state of hawaii the senate on june 8 2006 failed to invoke cloture on motion to proceed to consider s 147 effectively ending senate considerati on of s 147 and s 3064 hr 309 was referred to the house res ources committee and has not been reported separately the house judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution held hearing on july 19 2005 on constitutional issues raised by hr 309 serial 109374
