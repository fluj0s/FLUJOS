summary rumors about prime minister putins disengagement from his duties have proliferated in moscow suggesting that he has lost his edge in making critical decisions on measures linked to the economic crisis putin has reportedly been working from home on many issues leaving much of the running of the government to his deputies particularly first deputy prime minister igor shuvalov while some here see putins withdrawal as increasing the odds that he might step down from office most continue to emphasize his centrality in the political constellation with his handsoff behavior reflecting the lack of an acceptable compromise amongst the kremlin elite on difficult economic issues end summary 2 c there are consistent reports that putin resents or resists the workload he carries as prime minister to galvanize the russian bureaucracy wellconnected xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that putin is said to be distracted and disinterested leaving daytoday management of the gor to shuvalov xxxxxxxxxxxx who was member of xxxxxxxxxxxx said that only putin has the authority to lead the gor and in his absence economic policy responses to the crisis have been entirely ad hoc xxxxxxxxxxxx saw the ongoing budget revision process as further evidence of putins fatigue in more resolute times putin would have ended the fiscal haggling quickly instead it has dragged on for two months during the worst financial crisis in decade prominent xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed about putins isolation saying that the pm is increasingly isolated and has regular contact only with shuvalov and kudrin 3 c similarly xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that putin has not been on regular schedule at the russian white house preferring to leave the daytoday operations of government in the hands of the actual prime minister shuvalov an assessment shared by xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx alleged that there are number of documents waiting for putins signature several of which are linked to the governments anticrisis package that are creating backups in the implementation of important projects xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told us it is well known that putin did not like coming to the russian white house where he was confronted with stacks of papers on issues of minuscule importance on which he did not want to expend his energy the problem xxxxxxxxxxxx noted was that the russian system was geared to topdown decisions and paralysis was often the result of putins inaction 4 c the rise of rumors such as these suggest that putin may be losing some of his teflon persona under the pressures of russias economic woes at least among the elite however recent levada surveys reinforce that most russians continue to see putin as running the country 87 percent of respondents saw him holding his power up from 74 percent year ago while some speculate that putins disengagement may presage readiness to step down from office most continue to stress his centrality in the ruling structure and his personal sense as the savior of russia indeed his disengagement reflects his longstanding predilection to prevaricate on difficult issues and his recognition that sharp reduction in resources limits his ability to find workable compromises among the kremlin elite beyrle
