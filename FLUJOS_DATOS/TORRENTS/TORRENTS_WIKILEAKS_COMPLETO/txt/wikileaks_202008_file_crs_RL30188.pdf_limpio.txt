context summary into his third year of rule president kim dae jung continues to receive high ratings in polls except for his handling of political matters the political situation is volatile and uncertain with his ruling millennium democratic party mdp locked in partisan standoff with the opposition grand national party gnp led by lee hoi chang president kim also has tenuous relationship with his former coalition partner the unite d liberal democrats uld this fluid situation has complicated domestic support for the presidents sunshin policyof engagement with north korea us policymakers including many in congress have mixed views on the efficacy of the engagement policy and have strong interest in south korean political support for the policy and for president kim the partisan strife is rooted in regionalism defining issue in south korean politics from 1961 through 1997 power was associated with the southeastern kyongsang region but under president kims stewardship it shifted to his political strongholdthe southwestern cholla region significantly this shift also marked the ascendency of power elite with liberal political outlook quite different from that of the conservative establishment associated with the gnp the opposition with its previously dominant parliamentary majority has tried to regroup to regain its strength the ongoing partisan struggle has complicated president kims effort to attain bipartisan support on various issues including economic reform and policy toward north korea president kim has tried to engage pyongyang in more conciliatory and more consistent manner than was the case with his predecessors the june 2000 inter korean summit seemed to vindicate this approach since 1998 president kim has espoused comprehensive approach to meet pyongyangs economic security and political concerns with support from the united states and japan in return pyongyang is to mend fences with the south and equally important to halt its nuclear and missile programs this approach is predicated on the provision of incentives to pyongyang by seoul wash ington and tokyo solid allied united front in policy coordination and patience in dealing with pyongyangs penchant for contentiousness and duplicity the underlying rationale is that in time north korea will moderate and play by the rules of the international community if the history of negotiations with pyongyang is any indication the settlement of interkorean conflict seems certain to be thorny depending on among other things whether the goals and priorities of the allied

jung received the nobel peace prize for peace and reconciliation with north korea in particular for his role as the prime mover behind the sunshine policy of engagement with north korea in an oslo press conference he reportedly expressed his wish to share the prize with north korean leader kim jong il acknowledging that his prize was made possible in part by the historic interkorean summit meeting he had with kim jong il in june 2000 in february 2001 the engagement policy stayed on course thanks to president kims determined effort to promote reconciliation and cooperation with the north this policy may shift to more brisk pace in the months ahead as part of his resolve to support north koreas effort to rebuild its crippled economy significantly the norths effort was underscored by kim jong ils unannounced trip to china january 1520 2001 for firsthand view of chinesestyle economic reform the trip was highlighted by fourday tour of shanghais industrial sites and hightech center that has been flourishing with foreign investment and joint ventures on january 17 the tour prompted president kim to opine that north korea was definitely changing as it seemed to be trying to become second china few days later he told his cabinet to prepare measures needed to accommodate north koreas likely shift to new direction at present in seoul the most anticipated event in the interkorean relations is kim jong ils promised visit to the south rumored to be sometime between march and june 2001 speculation was that his second summit talk with president kim may reveal clues on how the north will embark on economic reform economic issues are seen as likely to dominate the second interkorean summitry according to south korean media north korea is said to be demanding political and economic gifts from the south in exchange for kim jong ils visit to the south president kim appears satisfied with his sunshine policy currently implemented on the basis of socalled flexible reciprocity which is mocked by critics as an aid first benefitslater giveaway policy the president seems convinced that his peace oriented conciliatory approach will in time enable the north to address security issues and to initiate an opendoor policy in any case according to south korean media the sunshine policy seems certain to face challenge in the months ahead as south koreans seem troubled by the norths uncertain politica l and military intentions equally troubling to them appears to be north koreas alleged penchant for taking without giving something in return even as president kim maintains thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30188crs2 1 for coverage of broader issues see crs issue brief 98045 korea ussou th korean relationsissues for congress by larry niksch updated regularlysouth korea benefitted more from the engagement and despite his optimistic prognosis notwithstanding critics continue to allege that his policy lacked three critical conditions reciprocity transparency and national consensus in his new year press conference president kim vowed we will never extend aid to the north without the consent of the people on february 7 after washington meeting with us secretary of state colin powell south korean minister of foreign affairs and trade lee joungbinn stated that the bush administration expressed its full support for south koreas policy of engagement in joint statement issued on the same day the two governments agreed to work to achieve meeting between president bush and present kim at the earliest time this meeting seemed to help allay south koreas concern that the new bush administration might adopt more conservative stance toward the north south korea was reported to be worried that washingtons likely hardline approach could conflict with and slow momentum on president kims engagement policy the bush administrations north korea policy was tentatively outlined at powells senate confirmation hearing in january when he stated that the administration would move ahead without any sense of haste in trying to normalize relations with north korea he also said that the us is open to continued process of engag ement with the north so long as it addresses political economic and security concerns is reciprocal and does not come at the expense of our alliance relationships us interest in south koreas sunshine policy us interests in south korea involve range of security economic political and north korea policy issues of these us relations with the south korean political leadership especially over north korea issues have strong implications for us security interests1 for decades the united states has supported south koreas progress toward democratization in this regard the united states welcomed the inauguration in february 1998 of civilian president kim dae jungs administration the second since 1993 as another significant milestone in south koreas progress toward mature democracy us concern for president kims policy toward north korea has drawn renewed interest since 1998 as this represents sharp break with the traditional emphasis on reciprocity the reversal of direction from the right to the left has seemed to catch many in the south unprepared leaving some confused and others conflicted this policy shift has been caught up in the partisan strife between president kims coalition government and the conservative opposition camp until recently the sunshine approach endured without bipartisan show of consensus and support as result although the policy has been touted by the kim administration as the only promisi ng alternative to war there has seemed some tenuousness with regard to the future of the engagement policybeyond president kims tenure in office ending in february 2003

number of specialists on korean affairs in washington if president kim prevails the united states might find itself more closely associated with the sunshine policy since late 1998 the kim administration has urged the united states to adopt its own sunshine policy as the cornerstone of new comprehensive us policy toward the north2 frustrated with pyongyangs coolness toward its engagement policy the kim administration has pleaded for what amounts to reinforcement from the united states from the us perspective the intent of the sunshine policy seems for the most part compatible with its overriding security interest in denuclearized korean peninsula but there is range of us views about the appropriate means to use in order to achieve this desired end thus many us policymakers and other observers seemed to have mixed views on the efficacy of kims sunshine policy and its compatibility with us policy on the korean peninsula quest for political stability background kim dae jung the dissident voice of generation of crusaders for democracy won the presidential election in december 1997 by razorthin margin3 he defeated lee hoi chang of the centerright establishment that had dominated south korean politics for nearly 50 years kims success on his fourth try was historic first for south koreas perennial underdogthe opposition led by kim observers attribute this feat to several factors the first was kim dae jungs preelection compact with conservative rival kim jong pil former prime minister under the militarydominated regime of president park chung hee whereby kim dae jung would have the constitution amended by the year 2000 if elected in return for kim jong pils support for his candidacy if amended the constitution would allow for the establishment of parliamentary cabinet system to replace the existing presidential system presumably under the premiership of kim jong pil see fragile coalition below there is consensus that this pact

believed to have minimized split in opposition votes4 the second factor was voters anger and disgust with economic mismanagement and money scandals under the outgoing kim youn g sam regime the third was split in votes for lee hoi chang as result of factional leader rhee injes defection to seek the presidency for himself the fourth was allegations of draftdodging by two sons of lee hoi chang the fifth was solid support for kim dae jung from regional loyalists progressives and labor union activists additionally the absence of north korean provocations in the runup to the election which meant more votes for pro government candidates in the past is believed to have helped kim dae jung these factors seemed to have enabled him to surmount two disadvantages his narrow politi cal base in the less populous poorer and the negatively stereotyped cholla region in the southwest and as one source put it years of military propaganda that portrayed him unfairly as soft on the communist north5 the

members between them in the 299seat national assembly the coalition parties wasted time in trying to bolster their ranks at the expense of the opposition gnp that had majority with 165 seats this asymmetry was at the center of partisan strife since the inception of the coalition however realignment did not come easily since south koreas political culture allowed little leeway for conciliation or compromise another complication was the confusion coming from the suddenness of reversed political fortunesan unprecedented opposition takeover of presidential power even as the ruling camp appealed for bipartisan collaboration it seemed to provoke the gnp by trying to undercut its parliamentary majority for its part finding its familiar world turned upsid down the gnp seemed unable to adjust to its new role as loyal opposition indeed within hours after kim dae jung was sworn in the gnp blocked approval of kim jong pil as the presidential nominee for prime minister and denounced the ruling camp for targeting gnp members for actual or threaten ed prosecution on charges of corruption9 the coalition eventually secured majority by welcoming gnp defectors by may 1999 the hardpressed gnp seemed to face crisis of identity10 if the ruling camp has its way more gnp members may break the ranks either to form new partyor to join the ruling camp11 beleaguered gnp may well have the consequence of widening the gulf between the chollacentered kim dae jung administration and the largely kyongsangbased gnp opposition12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30188crs6 north korea demarcation line

dictatorship and 2 power alignment pivoting on the regional identity of sitting president33 he argued that an equitable regional powersharing through cabinet formula could remedy those problems kim jong pil may have also hoped that new cabinet system would boost his personal power observers view the cabinet system issue as problematic for several reasons first were kim dae jung to yield to kim jong pils pressure he would have to share much of his power with the newly empowered cabinet probably under kim jong pil second the gnp continues to support the existing presidential system virtually ruling out twothirds majority needed for any constitutional amendment third president kim s more pressing priority is to continue policies to promote recovery from the economic crisis and to pursue

presidency suggesting that he came prepared to tackle the issue37 president kim made it official in his inaugural address on february 25 1998 the policy has since been fleshed out to make it more receptive to skeptical pyongyang and adjustable to situational needs38 in the closing months of 1998 expanding on this policy the kim administration began to advocate more inclusive approac h one

that figuratively honey works better than vinegar in trying to entice the north to moderate and change it seems also to reflect his conviction that south korea must take the lead in trying to initiate steps for the settlement of interkorean issues41 the philosophical underpinning of the policy runs deep as the sunshine policy is believed by many to be the culmination of an evolutionary process in the making since the early 1970s42 the sunshine policy is in stark contrast to the containment and reciprocity oriented policy pursued by the kim young sam administration its objective as one writer put it is to use sunshine to enable north korea to voluntarily remove its coat of isolation and hostility and give up its vision of liberating the south43 in setting the basic tone of his policy president kim vowed that while his administration would actively seek reconciliation and cooperation with the north and forswear any attempt to harm or absorb the north it would not tolerate armed provocation of any kind by the north to expedite reconciliation he also promised to encourage the souths privatesector to explore and capitalize on economic opportunities in the north without government intervention however major projects requiring public funding are to be premised on intergovernment dialogue and reciprocity it seems that several assumptions underpin the sunshine policy first is president kims overarching notion that there is an emergent need to help ease beleaguered pyongyangs concerns about domestic and external uncertainties which might cause the north to lash out in desperation second in such scenario north koreas formidable fire power positioned on the other side of the demilitarized zone dmz could decimate the seoul metropoli tan regionhome to 19 million

fear of being unraveled lastly the cold warderived culture of confront ation would gradually dissipate to minimize the chances of renewed hostilities in korea president kim initially seemed hopeful that the two koreas could achieve significant breakthrough if they first revisited the historic interkorean agreement on reconciliation nonaggression and exchanges and cooperati on that formally went into effect in february 1992 but since has remained on the shelf he proposed an activation of the 1992 accord an exchange of special envoys possible summit meetin g45 reunion of separated families and

and continued cooperation in kedos korean peninsula energy development organization lightwater nuclear reactor project in addition he promised to address unspecified other factors of imbalances between the two koreas underscored were two key points one was that the process of engaging the north should be crafted to minimize the confrontational atmospherics of the past through gentler and kinder approach46 the other was that this process should in the nearterm aim for neighborly coexistence rather than the potentially convulsive end result of unification at the same time the president seemed realistic about the attendant difficulty in trying to mend the fences with north korea counseling patience and steadiness in dealing with wary pyongyang he was particularly emphatic about the need for robust deterrence against north korean provocations47 pyongyang would respond in time to his sunshine policy in order to ensure its survival he judged below are examined important

cooperation should be conditioned on the principle of reciprocity48 deal was struck as pyongyang ridiculed seouls reciprocity as logic better suited for horsetrading than for collaboration between the two halves of the same nation pyongyang claimed that reciprocity was norm applicable only in relations among sovereign nations but not between fellow countrymen it then tried to take the moral high ground by chiding the kim administration for treating an humanitarian issue as part of its mercantile pursuits49 for emphasis pyongyang reiterated we being sovereign country cannot exchange our sovereignty for fertilizer we can live without fertilizer but cannot live without sovereignty50 unfazed senior blue house official stated dialogue between the authorities will be based on

the appearance of unilateral concessions without north korean reciprocation may have fueled speculation that the kim administration was bent on engagement at any cost and that pyongyang might become even more arrogant toward the south some observers viewed as unwise the kim administrations reported shift to flexible policy of aiding the north firstand waiting patiently for signs of favorable response from the nort h55 in public lecture on april 28 1999 foreign minister hong seemed to confirm the shift stating that the sunshine policy seeks to provide political economic and social favors

cordial treatment of president kim dae jung during their june 1315 2000 summit resulted from the sunshine policy cannot be determined but clearly north korea has showed new and warmer attitude toward relations with the south this however was not the case in 1999 at first blush pyongyangs policy in 1999 seemed different because its february 3 1999 overture for dialogue with the south contained nuance of expression that can be construed as sign of change closely examined this overture seemed to reflect shift in style not in substance there was little to suggest that pyongyang changed its policy of attempting to use the south to its own advantage in hint of change in february 1999 pyongyang proposed reunification oriented dialogue repackaging previous overture unlike similar 1998 proposal for instance the proposal this time contained an explicit reference to possible dialogue between the authorities of the two sides in the second half of 1999 uncharacteristically it also refrained from repeating pyongyangs familiar demand for the dissolution of seouls counterintelligence unitthe agency for national security planning now renamed the national intelligence service nis initially the kim administration seemed to read the 1999 proposal as welcome sign of change courtesy of its sunshine policy71 close reading shows that the 1999 overture was essentially reiteration of pyongyangs past position it argued that the dialogue should be guided solely by the principles and guidelines set forth by the great leaders kim il sung and kim jong il72 then it urged the south to comply with three preconditions before the dialogue could take place it demanded that the kim administration should immediately 1 cease cooperation and joint military exercises with outside forces ie the united states 2 abrogate seouls national security law that is designed to control pyongyangs covert operations in the south as well as pronorth korean activities among south koreans and 3

standards by which to judge whether the kim administration was prounification or proamerican74 the kim administration reacted with watchful prudence aware that compromise on those conditions would generate two equally unattractive consequences adverse domestic public opinion and probable complications for south koreas security alliance with the united states nevertheless in seoul some with connections to the kim administration seemed to feel that to break the interkorean deadlock the admittedly superior south should compromise first to make up for the economic and diplomatic weakness of the inferior north75 it should be noted that for years these preconditions were among the parameters of pyongyangs attempt to turn the south into permissive environment for north korean infiltration and covert operations76 to be sure pyongyangs silence on the nis alleged to be the notorious headquarters of antinorth fascist plots appeared to be revealing but did not signify its willingness to condone the niss existence on the contrary the north continues to press the south to dismantle the nis77 the silence was apparently calculated for effect because in the unlikely event that the national security law were abolished the nis would have legal standing on which to base its antispy operations one may also note that the nis would be under the same legal constraints should the kim administration decide to guarantee the freedom of pronorth korean activities in the south case can be made then that the february 1999 overture was probably intended to gauge the efficacy of

recently pyongyang seemed ambivalent about the sunshine policy it took umbrage at that policys alleged aim to undress the north in all aspects of politics economy and military affairs78 and it denounced the policy as reactionary and deceptive subterfuge aimed at the overthrow of the north79 nonetheless pyongyang seemed to have judged that this policy could be useful because of possible winwin outcome in relati ons with the south an outcome that would enable the north to have it both waysextracting financialeconomic benefits from south korean firms such as hyundai virtually riskfree without conceding anything substantive to the south some observers opine that pyongyang is in nolose situat ion given the premise that success or failure of the sunshine policy hinges on pyongyangs action and that therefore the north may be able to affect the outcome of the policy either by going through the motions of positive response to the south or by withholding it from the south as means of extracting further concessions80 critics say that in its quest for positive response from the north the kim administration could run the risk of playing into the hands of the opportunistic north81 south korean domestic reaction under past authoritarian regimes the souths policy toward the north was more often offlimits to the opposition nor was it subject to be addressed independently by freelance journalists or academics the policy was in and of itself national security matter controlled exclusively by the blue house and national security agencies in 1993 however when the democratically elected administration of the first civilian president kim young sam took office backed by prodemocracy activists the north korea policy veered to the left briefly for the first time since independence under pressure from conservatives and public opinion alike the sometimes erratic policy could not be sustaine d even after shift to the right the kim young sam administration

february 2003 despite uncertainty about sustainability beyond respected for his expertise on unification and foreign policy issues coupled with his reputedly forceful personality president kim has

tends to go more often unquestioned in public unless the policy is perceived to be untenable on its own merit on the other hand despite the predominant influence of the blue house over the engagement policy south koreans do not seem as intimidated as they used to be when it comes to freedom of expression or of the press to be sure it is an open secret in seoul that the south korean media continu

of majority that the engagement policy deserved the benefit of the doubt view augmented by the kim administrations reasoning that the only way to find out whether the sunshine policy will work or not is to engage the north there has seemed to be few public qualms about the rationale and structure of the policy provided the south remained ever alert to pyongyangs potential entrapment game or to the risk of falling prey to wishful thinking some observers opined that such thinking was reflected in the condescending notion that the sunshine policy reflects the confidence of

rather than the submissive posture of weak government86 among political circles reaction to the policy differs along partisan as well as ideological divides political supporters of president kim have seemed to follow the topdown line of reasoning that there are signsof changing north korea linked to pragmatic force within the circles of the party military and government functionaries the sunshine policy the argument goes has been not to appease the north but to help bolster this pragmatic group as way to induce the north to open up and reform in the long run this line of reasoning also underscores that the engagement policy is aimed at ending the cold war on the korean peninsula87 south koreans have been asked to be patient and not to expect quick return on the long term engagement policy dissenting views have come mainly from the oppo sition gnp insurgent mem bers of the ruling coalition partner uld dwindling number of concerned journalists and foreign and interkorean affairs specialists on the centerright despite their reservations about the sunshine policy though they have appeared to agree with the rationale for the policy in broad terms88 critics have tended to argue that even as the policy may help allay eventually pyongyangs concerns about its survival it still might not be able to cajole the north to lower its guard on the touchy question of openness and reform in this reasoning the critics have taken skeptical view of the kim administrations haste in trying to stretch the notion of reciprocity to an indefinite future from pyongyangs perspective nontransparency and isolation are believed to be critical to its survival in bid to catch the adversaries off guard or keep them at bay and guessing on the unpredictability of its intentions and actions89 it might be wishful thinking critics have opined to anticipate desired change in the north in the foreseeable future having exploited for lack of better term reversesunshinecard to ensure its survivability selfcentered kim jong il regime might decide to keep its stalinist ways more or less unchanged and worse still buttressed by large conventional military forces coupled with

insecure pyongyang may refuse to make concessions unless it can gain guarantees of absolute regime survival to pyongyang an eventual us military withdrawal from the south has appeared most important in this regard barring that some analysts say that pyongyang might acquiesce in continued us presence albeit in neutral peacekeeping role91 if pyongyangs reported shift in policy is true the implication seems to be that the united states might be pressed to relinquish its defense obligations to the south as part of new role as peacekeepers in korea to the consternation of critics in seoul the kim administration reportedly tried to take pyongyangs socalled policy shiftas sign of pyongyangs positive response to the sunshine policy92 later blaming media competition and misunderstanding the kim administration clarified that the structure and disposition of all forces on the korean peninsula can be addressed only after substantial progress is achieved on establishing peace regime on the peninsula93 president kim is known to favor continued us militar presence even beyond korean unificationbut without explaining in what capacity94 coordination with the united states by mid1998 president kim seemed to have become convinced of an emergent need to craft new approach within his overall sunshine policy this may have reflected his disappointment at lack of positive response from pyongyang to his overture for dialogue and because of his concern that seoul and washington could end up working at crosspurposes to pyongyangs advantage apparently it was unsettling for the kim administration to realize that seoul and washington might have different focus in dealing with the northseoul being absorbed in the narrower issues germane to the two koreas as opposed to washingtons

a1nuclear and missile proliferation95 the kim administration also seemed troubled by perceived lack of clear road map in washingtons north korea policy96 thus president kim seemed to sense the need to integrate the south korean and us policies into more coherent and coordinated framework in june 1998 in an interview with the new york times several days prior to his state visit to washington president kim called for the united states to change its north korea policy by increasing economic and political engagement with the north as part of more futureoriented and flexible approach he suggested that the united states end its economic sanctions against the north without setting conditions97 in addition he urged the united states to normalize its relations with the north to help the north end its isolation and open up to the outside world his notion of new us approach seemed to take shape rapidly having gained new urgency precipitated by two security related developments in august 1998 one was the public disclosure of the existence of possible underground nuclea r facility in the north the other was pyongyangs launch of threestage taepodongi ballistic missile through japanese airspace president kim seemed worried by the disquieting prospect that his sunshine policy could be derailed by us congressional reaction to these developments particularly at issue was the omnibus appropriations act for fy 1999 specifying that new funds could be allocated for kedo after march 1 1999 without the presidenti certification that north korea is in compliance with all provisions of the usnorth korea agreed framewo rk of october 1994 another key issue was the congres sionally mandated presidential certification by june 1 1999 that the united states is making significant progress in negotiations with north korea on reducing and eliminating the north korean ballistic missile threat president kim seemed to fear that tough reaction from washington might put north korean hardliners into bellicose mood crystallized by yearend in the form of package deal kim dae jungs new approach or comprehensive engagement policy can be seen as an extension on grander and more inclusive scale of his sunshine policy vague as it was it became the centerpiece of the kim administrations diplomatic agenda tailored to gain unqualified support from the united states

suggested that usjapanese normalization of relations with the north longer be predicated on parallel progress in interkorean relations99 major departure from the policy of his predecessor the shift seemed to signal the kim administrations concerted effort to reinvent the inter korean environment to make it more hospitable to wary pyongyang one which still appeared to be operating on the basis of distorted vision of reality100 part of that effort included seouls resolve as senio r blue house official stated to leave stone unturned to persuade them hawkish us republicans and other us skeptics into accepting our practical proposal the kim administration had hoped that comprehensive engagement policy would be adopted by the clinton administrations north korea policy coordinator william perry as the centerpiece of the socalled perry report101 released in october 1999 this report was viewed in seoul as being in step with its own engagement approach and expressed support for the reports findings because they are said to endorse and complement president kims policy102 however even as the perry report was appraised as realistic and balanced some south korean experts are reported as criticizing it for not paying sufficient attention to inter korea issues dealing as it did exclusively with north korean nuclear and missile issues103 simply put the perry report concludes that the united states has two policy alternatives toward pyongyang the first and better one is to normalize relations gradually as the dprk relinquishes its nuclear weapons programs the other one in case north korea fails to do so is for the us and its allies to takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30188crs28 104 us department of state statement of william perry on us north korea policy international

believing that the us must not withdraw any of its forces from korea so as not to jeopardize peace and stability on the korean peninsula admittedly the report did not immediately address number of issues outside the scope of direct usdprk negotiations such as rok family reunification implementation of the 1992 northsouth basic agreementand japanese kidnaping cases as well as other key issues of concern it does note however that all of these issues should be and would be seriously addressed as relations between the dprk and the us improve105 conclusions presiden t kim dae jungs leadership marked significant milestone in south korean evolution towards mature democracy that came as an unprecedented transfer of power from the centerright establishment to centerleft minority in opposition accompanied by an equally historic shift in the regionally defined center of power these changes arguably reflected the advent of new generation of power elite steeped in the politics of liberalism not to mention the politics of fragile coalition rule between two regionallybased ideological ly disparate parties the thrust of these developments has tended to harden the personalitydominated partisan divide along regional lines making bipartisan accommodation even more difficult especially as regards president kims reputedly dovish sunshine policy political stability has seemed elusive punctuated by false starts and failed expectations of bipartisanship moreover the tenuousness of political stabilit raises the specter of continued uncertainty the ongoing partisan standoff provides volatile political background influencing president kims sunshine policyand by extension critical us security interests as well the engagement policy may well stay the course through december 2002 when new president must be elected by law president kim is required to step down in february 2003 whether the sunshine policy can be sustained beyond 2002 appears unclear given the fragility of bipartisan show of support for the policy and what can be interpreted as waitandsee attitude among the centerright political leaders and other concerned south koreans the dividing line of pros and cons however does not appear to be as hardened as it may seem criticism of the sunshine policy is not about the grand rationale and structure of the policy but about its potential negative results for some south korean interests106 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30188crs29 106 continued man on the sunshine policy lim replaced kang indok one of the reputed hardliners on north korea and the frequent target

dialogue by waving the socalled reciprocity card north korean central broadcasting network in korean may 26 1999assuming the best possible outcome for the two koreas the postsummit unification euphoria may in time take on life of its own on balance that seems likely to hinge on whether north korea is willing to try to play by the rules of the international community with regard to reciprocity confidence building and peaceful coexistence equally critical the momentum toward reconciliation could stall if the north overplays its hands or there were to be civil unrest in the south spawned by groundswell of what might be called pronorth korean leftist activities to assure domestic consensus and best possible outcome for the engagement policy some observers believe that the kim administration should make its decision making process more transp arent so that the sunshine policy can be popularly embraced as truly national rather than blue house policy many south korean analysts seem troubled by the perception that key decisions on the policy continue to be made by few in the privacy of the blue house another concern is over the kim administrations perceived retreat on the principle of reciprocity now apparently stretched to policy of aidingthenorth first in hopes of pyongyang returning the favor in the future critics maintain that such waitandsee and benign attitude will more likely embolden the north to try to exact more concessions from the south in highpriority bid to maintain its milit aryfirst policy at the expense of other sectors of society the kim administrations attitude toward reciprocity or lack of balance between carrots and sticks as the argument goes will more likely affect south koreas domestic political calm and national security president kim urges the united states and japan to normalize their relations with north korea not minding the absence of parallel progress in interkorean relations critics tend to argue that this might leave south korea with minimal leverage needed to keep interkorean relations on an even keel making it difficult to steer the north toward desired end if only because selfcentered north korean regime will be less likely to be accommodating observers note that washington seems concerned about perception that the kim administration and the united states have different perspectives on dealing with pyongyangs nuclear and missiles issues absent an agreement on policy priorities this could pose problem in policy coordination moreover analysts have arguedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30188crs30 107

yield the desired outcomes in the short term but president kims engagement policy is substantial improvement both in conceptual and practical terms over the north korea policies of the previous south
