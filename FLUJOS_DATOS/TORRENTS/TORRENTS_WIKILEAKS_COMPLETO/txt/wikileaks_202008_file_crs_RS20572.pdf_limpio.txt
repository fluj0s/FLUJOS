separatism and alienation in aceh are combination of four factors 1 aceh has distinct history as an independent kingdom from the 15th century until the beginning of the 20th century it maintained diplomatic and consular relations with several states including great britain it exchanged diplomatic notes with the united states5 in 1873 the dutch invaded aceh and conquered it after war that lasted until 1904 hasan tiro is descendant of the last sultan who was k illed fighting the dutch 2 there has been progressive aliena tion of the population in reaction to the policies of successive indone sian governments since i ndonesia won independence from the netherlands in 1949 the indonesian gove rnment abolished the province of aceh in 1950 prompting the first revolt of the acehnese in the early 1950s in 1959 the indonesian government declared aceh special territory w ith autonomy in religious and education affairs but the gove rnment never implemented this special status from the 1960s aceh was subject to increased centraliz ation of power in jakarta under president suharto revolts aiming at independence occurred in the 1970s and late 1980s 3 extensive human rights abuses by the tni have been documented military abuses of civilians reportedly became comm on from the 1970s to the present abusive tactics have included the murder torture and arbitrary arrests of politically active acehnese especially those who advocate referendum member s of nongovernment organizations ngos and human rights worker s retaliation is ma jor source of abuses in response to gam attacks and

acehs wealth has gone to the centr government by the 1970s discontent arose over the flow of wealth from acehs natural resources upwa rds of 8090 of this wealth has gone to java indonesias most populous island and the center of indonesian political power7 this prompted dissident acehnese to claim that aceh was the object of javanese colonialism which had replaced dutch colonialism indonesian policies indonesian policies toward aceh have been influenced by three factors since the fall of the suharto government in may 1998 one is the weaknesses in the governments that followed suharto they have been coalitions of individuals and groups with little or prior government experience or little experience in top decisionmaking levels the same is true of the parliament elected in june 1999 second the indonesian body politic remains resentful over the loss of east timor blames the united nations and foreign governments rather than indonesian policie s and is determined that aceh will not separate the third is the relationship between the new governments and the military since suhartos fall civilian leaders have tried to exert control over the tni with minimal success the tni retains authority over policy in indonesias outer islands and resists the central governments attempts to assert its authority in these places including aceh the tni leadership favors policy of crushing the rebellion by military means and it is suspicious of negotiations with gam it has pressed several times since 1999 for the imposition of martial law in aceh which would give the tni unquestioned authority over the province the governments political response includes an offer of autonomy to aceh in early 2001 the parliament passed special autonomy w for aceh it provides that aceh will receive 70 percent of the revenue from the pr ovinces natural resources it gives the provincial government the right to impose islamic sharia law but sharia reportedly is not popular among many acehnese it provides for local elections however the special autonomy law has not been implemented the provincial government has not passed needed implementation legislation accordin g to report by the

autonomy but must also take up gams proposal of referen dum on the question of independence gam holds that there should be an international role in the settlement of the aceh question the indonesian government opposes role by other governments or the united nations these issues were key to the breakdown of the ceasefire signed in december 2002 the truce provided for tni and police units to withdraw from specified positions gam would turn over its arms in specified cales under supervision of the henry dunant center and thai and filipino military monitors gam agreed to refrain from advocating independence political nego tiations were to ensue the ceasefire initially reduced violence however it began to break dow n after february 2004 independent observers agreed with the tni

of civilians us policy on aceh us policy developed within the context of three broader policy objectives toward indonesia that came out of east timors paration in 1999 and the fall of the suharto government the first was to support political evolution in indonesia towards democracy the second was to support indone sias territorial integrity to reassure postsuharto leaders that the united states would not re peat its east timor policy of 1999 towards other parts of indonesia where there were paratist movements the third advocated by the pentagon and the us pacific command wa s to restore links between the us and indonesian militaries which had been cut because of the east timor situation the us war against terrorism added policy priority of securing indonesian cooperation
