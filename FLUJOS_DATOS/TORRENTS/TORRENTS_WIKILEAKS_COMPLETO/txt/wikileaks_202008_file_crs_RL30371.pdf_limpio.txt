democratic party but also continue d strong support for the radicals new parliamentary elec tions must be held by the end of 2007 but many observers believe early elections could take place this year the current government is weak but continues to hang on partly because smaller partie s in it know that they may lose all of their seats in parliament when new elections are held the weakness of the government also appears to suit th radicals and socialists who have not yet sought to overturn it however events that may occur later this year may destabilize the government these could include ko sovo settlement that results in kosovos independence the transfer of indicted war criminal ratko mladic to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia or scandals over priv atization or other issues experts disagree on their predictions for the outcome of possible early elections according to public opinion polls the radical s remain the most popular single party in serbia by wide margin however they may not be able to form majority on their own or with the socialists on the other hand nationalist backlash over kosovo or other issues could put the ra dicals and socialists over the top the international community would likely strongly disapprove of the pa rticipation of the radicals in serbian government an lternative could be for the ds dss and other democratic parties to
