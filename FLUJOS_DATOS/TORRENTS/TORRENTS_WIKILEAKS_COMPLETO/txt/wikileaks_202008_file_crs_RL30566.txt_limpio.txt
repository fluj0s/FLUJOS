defense and trade division south koreaus economic relations summary south korea is major economic partner for the united states in 2006 trade between the two countries surpassed 75 billion making south korea the united statess seventhlargest trading partner ahead of france and italy and its seventhlargest export market in 2006 the us was koreas thirdlargest trading partner secondlargest export market and its secondlargest supplier of foreign direct investment fdi bilateral economic relations have advanced to the point that the two sides in february 2006 announced their intention to negotiate bilateral free trade agreement fta which they hope to complete in 2007 if an agreement is reached it would be the united statess largest fta since the completion of the north american free trade agreement to go into effect ftas must be approved by congress and the korean national assembly the fta negotiation and ratification processes are likely to politicize bilateral trade disputes and produce spillovers between the economic and strategic aspects of the relationship particularly if there are dramatic developments in the crisis over north koreas nuclear weapons program increased ussouth korean economic interaction has been accompanied by numerous disagreements over trade and economic policies the intensity of the disputes has diminished considerably since the late 1980s and early 1990s in part because south korea has enacted set of sweeping marketoriented reforms as quid pro quo for receiving 58 billion package from the international monetary fund imf following the near collapse of the south korean economy in 1997 in recent years the united states and south korea appear to have become more adept at managing their trade disputes so that they tend to be less acrimonious than they were in the 1980s and 1990s this is due in part to the quarterly workinglevel bilateral trade meetings that have been held since early 2001 strategic factors including south

peninsula in 1950 and fought to repel north korean takeover of south korea over 33000 us troops were killed and over 100000 were wounded during the threeyear conflict in 1954 year after the parties to the conflict signed an armistice agreement the united states and south korea signed mutual defense treaty which provides that if either party is attacked by third country the other party will act to meet the common danger the united states maintains about 34000 troops in the rok to supplement the 650000strong south korean armed forces1 in recent years strategic differences between washington and seoul particularly over the optimal policies toward north korea have caused some in the united states to question the benefits of the alliance beginning in the 1960s rapid economic growth in south korea propelled it into the ranks of the worlds largest industrialized countries for over decade south korea has been one of the united statess largest trading partners economic growth also has helped

korean market is even more important major us exports to south korea include semiconductors machinery particularly semiconductor production machinery aircraft and agricultural products south korea is among united statess largest markets for agricultural products and beef us exports for 2006 registered an alltime high over 30 billion in part due to the weakening value of the us dollar which fell by

accompanied by numerous disagreements over trade policies the intensity of the disputes has diminished considerably since the late 1980s and early 1990s in large measure because south korea has enacted set of sweeping marketoriented reforms as quid pro quo for receiving 58 billion package from the international monetary fund imf following the near collapse of the south korean economy in 1997 in particular as result of the reforms south korea has opened its doors to foreign investors ushering in billions of dollars of foreign portfolio and foreign direct investment fdi the result is that foreign companies including us firms now are significant shareholders in many prominent industrial conglomerates chaebol own an estimated 40 of the value of the shares traded on south koreas stock exchange and at one point owned about onethird of the korean banking industry after his election to one fiveyear term in 2002 south korean president roh moohyun said that more extensive reforms were needed to help accomplish his goals of raising per capita gross domestic product gdp to 20000 and of transforming south korea into major economic hub in northeast asia in essence for nearly decade most us traderelated complaints are echoed by voices within the south korean establishment the united states and south korea appear to have become more adept at managing their trade disputes so that they tend to be less acrimonious than they were in the 1980s and 1990s this may be partly due to the quarterly workinglevel trade action agenda trade meetings that were initiated in early 2001 both sides credit the meetings which appear to be unique to the ussouth korean trade relationship with creating more constructive dialogue by serving as actionforcing events the korus fta negotiations2 usrok economic relations advanced to the point that the two sides on february 2 2006 announced their intent to launch negotiations to form bilateral free trade agreement fta south korea and the united states have completed six 2 for more on the fta see crs report rl33435 the proposed south koreaus free trade agreement korus fta by william cooper and mark manyin crs4 rounds of negotiations and were as of february 12 in the midst of the seventh round which began in washington on february 11 and was scheduled to end on february 14 2007 the two sides have reported progress in some areas such as industrial tariffs customs administration anticorruption measures and foreign investment but sharp differences remain over trade in autos pharmaceuticals and agricultural products and over antidumping procedures both sides are still aiming to complete the negotiation before the end of march to comply with tpa deadlines if an agreement is reached it would be the united statess largest fta since the north american free trade agreement nafta to go into effect ftas must be approved by congress the ussouth korea fta korus fta negotiations are being conducted under the trade promotion authority tpa that the congress granted to the president under the bipartisan trade promotion act tpa of 2002 pl 107 210 the presidents tpa is scheduled to expire on july 1 2007 that is an agreement must be signed before july 1 2007 if it is to receive expedited congressional consideration under that authority in addition the tpa requires 90 day presidential notification to congress of intent to sign the agreement therefore the korus fta would have to be completed before april 2 20073 the decision to launch the fta is regarded by some as highrisk high reward move by both governments the economic side of the usrok relationship has been source of strength and stability in recent years even as the diplomatic and military sides have been frayed by differences between seoul and washington over how best to deal with north korea and how to adapt the us troop presence in korea the launch of the fta talks has brought to the surface number of long standing deepseated differences in trade and investment relations that remained below the surface for years if south korean and us negotiators can successfully address them the relationship would strengthen if not and the negotiations fail the bilateral relationship could be seriously harmed for some time as failure may be sign of the lack of trust south koreas economy the 1997 financial crisis and imfdirected reforms south koreas 1997 financial crisis was seminal event in the countrys history during the autumn of 1997 spurred in part by the bankruptcy of six of the countrys top thirty industrial conglomerates chaebol and sharp increase in repayments required on shortterm foreign debt investors lost confidence in the economy and capital fled the country the korean won lost half its value in the space of few days tumbling from 900 to 1900 won to the dollar in futile attempt to prop up the currency the governments foreign currency reserves dropped to 4 billion an amount insufficient to carry the country through another day in december 1997 barely year after joining the organization for economic 3 because the agreement would have to be translated and legally scrubbed before given april 2 2007 the negotiations would probably have to be completed as much as month before then crs5 cooperation and development oecd seoul turned to the imf for economic assistance at virtually the same time south koreans elected longtime democracy activist kim dae jung to the presidency the first time since the early 1960s that an opposition leader had won the countrys highest office after negotiating for weeks over the details on december 4 1997 south korea and the imf agreed to 58 billion support package in return seoul agreed to tighten its fiscal and monetary policies and engage in farreaching marketoriented reforms of its financial and corporate sectors and of its labor market policies south korea also agreed to open its economy further to foreign goods and investors the newlyelected kim government adopted most of the

of korea following the financial crisis south korea entered into severe recession in 1998 gross domestic product gdp contracted by 67 and unemployment nearly quadrupled rising to 76 in 1998 the slowdown generated substantial antiimf and antiamerican sentiment among many south koreans economic events from 19992006 the economy rebounded in 1999 and 2000 growing by over 10 and 9 respectively and enabling the south korean government to rapidly retire many of the debts it incurred in 19974 in 2001 however growth slowed considerably dragged down by combination of internal and external developments including decline in consumer and business confidence the bursting of koreas stock market bubble 4 in august 2001 seoul paid off the last of the 195 billion it had borrowed from the imf crs6 rising oil prices and sharp falloff in exports to the united states and japan which entered economic downturns of their own the government responded by lowering interest rates unveiling an economic stimulus package and easing the rules on the use of credit cards these measures boosted consumer spending which helped to double the growth rate from 31 in 2001 to 63 in 2002 growth also was boosted by rapid economic integration with china domestic investment however remained low in 2003 overuse of personal credit cards led to the nearcollapse of many financial firms and sharp slowdown in economic growth which fell back to 31 until the late 1990s the consumer sector of the economy had been largely untapped with korean lenders focusing on the corporate sector thus when the government liberalized financial regulations and forced koreas giant conglomerates to curtail their borrowing in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis banks and other financial institutions turned to consumers at times recklessly as new source of profit the number of credit card holders behind in their payments increased sharply with an estimated 8 of the population in default in march 20045 in 2003 and 2004 all eight of koreas specialized creditcard issuers registered massive losses that collectively were more than double their assets in most cases insolvency was avoided only through bailouts and takeovers by affiliated members of the companies respective chaebol groupings most of these moves appear to have been engineered regulatorally enabled andor encouraged by the government which feared collapse of the financial system if the firms were allowed to fail the government responded to the household debt crisis by tightening restrictions on credit card use and issuance and by initiating refinancing and forgiveness program for individual debtors for 2004 south koreas economy grew by 46 below the 6 growth rate the government had expected6 much of the growth was driven by surge in exports particularly to china which rose by over 30 from 2003 sharp rise in oil prices south korea imports all of its oil and lackluster domestic demand contributed to the slowerthanexpected growth rate in 2005 economic growth slowed to around 4 due in part to slowdown in export growth early in the year the government responded by unveiling 65 billion fiscal stimulus policy beginning in the late spring south korean domestic production and demand began to increase indicating an improvement in the credit card problem despite rising energy prices private spending rose by 32 in 2005 compared to 05 contraction the year before toward the end of the year the south korean stock market and the won sharply appreciated in value the latter against both the us dollar and the japanese yen despite this trend south korean exports continued to rise albeit at slower rate exports rose by just over 12 in 5 hyeseung seo south korea unveils program to help ease consumer debt the asian wall street journal

merchandise trade surplus in 2005 was about 23 billion7 in 2006 south koreas economic growth increased to an estimated 5 significantly the rebound appeared to be more balanced than in previous years when rising exports had been the primary driver of south koreas economic growth for most of 2006 private consumption continued its upward trajectory though its rate of growth dipped in the final months of the year while exports were up rising energy imports caused the merchandise trade surplus to decline considerably south koreas soaring housing prices particularly in the greater seoul area where around 40 of the population lives became dominant political issue in 2006 exacerbating concerns about increasing economic inequality the issue is likely to figure prominently in the runup to the december 2007 presidential election the government has taken number of steps designed to rein in real estate speculation leading some to fear that more government action could cause the housing sector to experience hard landing in 2007 economic reforms financial sector and chaebol reforms assessing koreas economic reforms to date depends on ones perspective if the point of comparison is the korean economy in 1997 then the governments progress has been impressive south koreas economy today is far more transparent open to foreign investors and efficient than it was seven years ago progress has been particularly notable in opening the country to foreign direct investment see below and in reforming the financial sector in the years following the crisis the government spent about 140 billion to bail out ailing banks and mutual funds8 this amount is approximately 2530 of the countrys gdp nearly twice the level required to save mexicos financial system during its crisis in 1995 notably predictions that the government would have to spend substantially more funds have not come to pass and koreas banking sector as whole has returned to profitability by the end of 2001 non performing loans loans which are unlikely to be repaid had fallen to 24 of total loans compared with 164 in 1998 in 2001 the percentage of nonperforming loans for large banks in the united states was 15 the roh government has accelerated south koreas efforts to reprivatize the banks that were nationalized in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis by 2000 the nationalization program had brought about onethird of the banking industrys assets into government hands and state ownership of the banking sector formed the crux of major trade dispute with the united states and european union in which state owned and

seventhlargest bank through 2006 the korean banking sector continued to be increasingly profitable10 if the yardstick used to assess south koreas reforms is the us economy however it becomes clear that seoul has far to go if it is to make the economy truly responsive to marketoriented pressures and incentives progress has been particularly difficult in the governments attempts to pressure the chaebol to correct the problems revealed by the 1997 crisis including excessively high debt levels heavy reliance on shortterm debt the lack of transparency weak corporate governance and corporate structures dominated by individual families rather than professional business managers although two of the largest chaebol daewoo and hyundai have been dismantled and debtequity ratios for most of the top conglomerates have been reduced corporate governance and crossshareholdings within chaebol groupings remain major problems the bailouts of struggling credit card affiliates in 2003 and 2004 seemed to many to indicate that the chaebol had not reformed their past practices of forcing their profitable enterprises to rescue failing ones also in 2003 massive accounting scandal at sk global the trading unit of the countrys fourthlargest chaebol sk group revealed similar structural problems11 additionally the reckless credit card lending activities of korean credit card firms in 2003 and 2004 exposed the continued weaknesses in risk management and due diligence by korean financial interests one of the governments responses has been to accelerate plans to further restructure the financial industry by passing new laws allowing the consolidation of banking insurance asset management and brokerage services some critics however worry that this crosssectoral consolidation will accentuate the problem of crossshareholding within chaebol groupings also bailouts of the two largest credit card companies lg card and samsung card in 2003 have raised fears that the too big to fail dynamic

general motors purchase of daewoo motors in 200213 citigroups 24 billion purchase of koram bank in march 2004 was the largest foreign direct investment in korean history and citigroups largest investment outside north america the daewoo motors case despite the increased openness to foreign ownership number of highprofile acquisitions by foreign companies have been either delayed or cancelled due to nationalistic objections to the sale disagreements over the sales price andor the discovery of previously undisclosed debts owed by the target korean company these delaying actions often have backfired resulting in far lower eventual sale prices case in point was the protracted sale of daewoo motors in june 2000 daewoo motors creditors many of them governmentowned or controlled

the purchase making the affiliate one of gms most profitable sales have been particularly strong in china and gm has chosen to house its global mini and small car development teams in the korean company14 the newbridge capital case many koreans however have reacted with alarm to foreign investment and there has been growing discussion of restricting the takeover of korean companies by foreigners for instance when newbridge capital sold its 50 stake in korea first bank in early 2005 at high profit it was accused of being foreign exploiter the south korean government attempted to limit or eliminate an investment treaty with malaysia newbridges home that allowed the company to avoid paying korean taxes on its gains newbridge bought korea first bank in 1999 and is credited in many circles with turning around the banks fortunes part of the korean governments apparent ambivalence to foreign investment particularly in the financial sector is that foreign multinationals often are more resistant to government pressure newbridge for instance reportedly resisted efforts by the south koreas financial supervisory commission to advance loans to two failing companies hynix and lg credit15 the lone star case in 2006 the governments moves against lone star texasbased private equity fund again raised fears among foreign businesspeople that highprofile investments remain vulnerable to politicallycharged investigations earlier in the year lone star announced preliminary agreement to sell its controlling stake in the korea exchange bank keb koreas fifth largest to the countrys largest bank kookmin bank for 74 billion lone star purchased keb in 2003 for 12 billion shortly after the announcement which sparked an outcry against foreign predators in south korea south

south korean exports to china are intermediate goods used in the production of finished goods that ultimately are exported from china to other countries including the united states growing number of koreans are studying the chinese language and traveling to china and public opinion polls show that growing number of koreans have favorable views of china these developments combined with sharp decline in favorable views of the united states have led many american observers to worry that chinese influence over south korean policy is likely to rise in the future at the expense of the united

foreign currency that are thought to go to the north korean elite providing critical base of support for north korean leader kim jongil alternatively coordinated us and south korean policies could use economic leverage to pressure north korea in broad terms the bush administration has stated that it supports south koreas economic engagement with north korea including the kaesong industrial zone19 in 2004 and 2005 the united states approved several export controls clearances that were required by us law for south korean firms to bring items such as computer and telecommunications equipment to kaesong20 since the kic opened it has been south korean policy to request that its fta partners allow exports from kaesong to be considered as made in korea meaning south korea thereby enabling these products to receive the preferential status conferred by the fta the united states has refused to consider kaesong as part of the korus fta two important issues for the united states in considering south koreas demand are the conditions for north korean workers and the income the kic provides for the north korean government some us labor and human rights advocates have argued that north korean workers in kaesong are being exploited south korean officials as well as other analysts counter by saying that conditions 19 see for instance joint declaration on the rokus alliance and peace on the

north korean government derives hard currency from several sources in the kic project including leasing fees and surcharges levied on north korean workers wages which are paid to an arm of the north korean government agency before being passed on to employees in the form of north korean won21 to date according to information provided by the south korean government these streams likely total less than 20 million in hard currency however if the south korean government realizes its most ambitious goals for the kaesong project by the middle of the next decade the north korean government would likely derive hundreds of millions of dollars annually from tax revenues and its slice of north korean workers wages assuming the kics current tax and wage structures remain in place22 some south koreans caution that the uncertainties over the future course of the kic project make such projections highly speculative major us trade disputes with south korea given the disparities in size and economic dependence it is not surprising that the united states typically sets the agenda of usrok trade talks since the 1997 financial crisis these complaints have tended to be directed at regulations promulgated by domestic ministries such as the ministry of health and welfare the korean food and drug administration and the ministry of environment that traditionally have had little contact with foreign governments or firms one element of the us strategy toward korea appears to be attempting to raise the pressure on these ministries by pushing for the korean cabinet to focus on the issue in general us exporters and trade negotiators identify the lack of transparency of koreas trading and regulatory systems as the most significant barriers to trade with korea in almost every major product sector in 2004 the transparency issue became standalone item in the quarterly trade action agenda meetings many us government officials also complain that seoul continues to use government regulations and standardsetting powers to discriminate against foreign firms in politically sensitive industries such as automobiles and telecommunications 21 north korean workers in kaesong receive base monthly salary of 50 for 48hour work week in 2005 the average workweek including overtime at kaesong was 55 hours bringing the average gross monthly salary to 67 per month south korean officials say they are unsure of precisely how much is taken by the north korean government but from conversations with workers and other sources they estimate the government takes an estimated 30 social services fee from the wages to pay for housing and other services that are to be provided the north korean state if these figures are correct the average kaesong workers takehome monthly pay in 2005 was just under 37 paid in north korean won presumably payments are made at the official rate of exchange which is much lower than black market rates the north korean government also levies 15

issues have been emphasized two of the most contentious agricultural trade disputes over the past two years have involved beef and rice south koreas beef ban major political trade issue on the

during the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations 19861993 south korea was granted 10year grace period before opening its rice market to imports in return for receiving this concession south korea agreed to allow minimum access for rice through the use of quotas the grace period ended on the last day of 2004 prior to that date south korea notified the wto that it wished to extend the minimum access quota system rather than convert to tariffs under the uruguay round agreement seoul could do this only if it obtained the consent of other wto members which could demand concessions to expand their quota the united states availed itself of this right and on december 30 2004 us and south korean officials announced an agreement under which korea will double the amount of rice it imports over the next 10 years provide guaranteed access for 50000 mt of us rice each year and make imported rice available directly to korean consumers in november 2005 after months of delay and

even more precipitously against the japanese yen this is particularly worrisome to many korean exporters because they compete directly against more japanese than us companies and because many korean

canada mexico brazil as well as china the rise in steel prices since 2003 has to some extent defused this issue assistance to hynix semiconductor in 2001 major trade dispute erupted between the united states and south korea over allegations that the seoul government was propping up hynix semiconductor presently the worlds third largest producer of dynamic random access memory dram semiconductor chips in 2001 and 2002 hynixs leading creditors most of which were owned by the korean government orchestrated series of rescue packages that kept hynix in business by enabling it to restructure its 86 trillion won over 7 billion in debt in the united states micron technology the idahobased second largest producer of drams led campaign against the support packages arguing that they amounted to governmentsponsored bailouts that allow hynix to export at low prices and that they were prime cause of the drastic plunge in global chip prices in 2001 and 2002 micron the last usbased dram producer eventually filed countervailing duty case which it won resulting in 44 punitive tariff being assessed against hynixs exports to the united states in similar case the european union imposed 34 countervailing duty against hynix korea challenged both rulings in the wto wto panel was formed and in february 2005 ruled that the united states had failed to properly demonstrate that the korean government had subsidized hynix the united states appealed in june 2005 the wtos appellate body reversed the ruling in part by using definition of what government actions constitute subsidy that is broader than the definition used by the panel55 because appellate body decisions cannot be appealed the united statess punitive tariffs will remain in place meanwhile hynix appears to have undergone

development agenda ustr officials consistently have praised south korea for attempting to bridge the differences between the developed and developing countries particularly on non agricultural market access issues such as industrial tariffs and services seoul also has been criticized consistently for resisting agricultural liberalization in the negotiations koreas tariffs on agricultural products except rice average 66 compared with 75 average for tariffs on industrial products57 koreas complaints against us antidumping and cvd practices for over decade south korea has chafed at the united statess use of antidumping and countervailing duty cvd laws to raise tariffs on korean exports according to one study in july 2000 the five cvd and 18 antidumping orders against south korean exports covered approximately 25 billion or over 7 of us imports from south korea in 1999 moreover these tariff hikes have tended to be concentrated in handful of korean industries semiconductors steel televisions and telecommunications equipment that have considerable political influence in seoul during the uruguay round 19861993 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the wtos predecessor organization korea was one of several countries demanding revisions to global antidumping rules changes the united states opposed because of concerns that they would constrain us antidumping investigators south korea joined most prominently by japan has taken up this issue again in the doha development agenda talks against us opposition and has made it priority issue in the korus fta talks58 in recent years seoul has become more assertive in using the wto to challenge united statess trade practices in 1999 and 2000 seoul took the us to the wto over allegedly discriminatory us antidumping duties placed on korean exports of steel and semiconductors korea won both of the steel cases it initiated us visa policies south koreans complaints about us visa policies tend to fall into two categories59 first some korean government officials korean businesses the american chamber of commerce in korea and koreanamericans have questioned why south korea is

although south koreas status in the us visa waiver program vwp is not formally part of the fta negotiations it is priority the south korean government is pursuing with the united states61 any changes made by the united states in this area are likely to play political role in selling the agreement in seoul among the statutory requirements for countries to participate in the us visa waiver program is that the country must have low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate for two years averaging more than 2 over both years and not exceeding 25 in any one year according to state department officials south koreas visa refusal rates have consistently been over this threshold the fy2004 rate was 36 and according to one report in early 2005 the rate again was below 462 meeting the refusal rate is not the only requirement countrys participation in the vwp must also be deemed to be in the economic law enforcement and security interests of the united states since the late 1990s country has been added to the vwp an indication of the difficulty in meeting the participation requirements for south korea to become participant would likely require significant attention from the white house during his november 2005 summit with president roh in south korea president bush announced that the united states would work with seoul to develop roadmap to assist korea in meeting the requirements for membership in the visa waiver program move that has been supported by number of groups in the united states63 hr 4304 introduced in november 2005 by representative james moran would designate south korea as program country under the vwp the second category of complaints is lodged against us visa policies implemented since the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states particularly requirements for mandatory interviews fingerprinting and greater scrutiny of business travelers for possible technology transfer risks like citizens of many other countries koreans particularly have objected to the fingerprinting which some koreans have likened to requirements imposed upon them during japans thirtyfiveyear occupation of the korean peninsula in the first half of the 20th century
