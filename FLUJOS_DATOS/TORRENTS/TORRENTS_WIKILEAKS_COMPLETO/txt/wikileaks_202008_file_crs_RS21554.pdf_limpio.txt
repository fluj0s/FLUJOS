agreements exempt citizens of parties from residency and work permit requirements15 free trade areas part icular wto issues substantially all trade one of the most problematic aspects of article xxiv particularly as it applies to the exclusion of economic sectors from ftas is the meaning of the term substantially all trade the term has not been defined either by gatt parties acting jointly or by gatt work ing parties whose re ports have tended to be inconclusive16 the 1994 understanding does not ex pressly define the term however the preamble states that the trade expansion to which regional agreements contribute is increased if the elimination between the constituent territories of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce extends to all trade and diminished if any major sector is excluded in examining whether ftas comply with this obligation working parties have take n into account both quantita tive and qualitative factors17 the working parties did express concerns regarding the ex clusion of certain agricultural trade in the us ftas with israel and canada but ne ither panel recommended the disapproval of the ftas and both reports were subsequently adopted18 status of safeguard measures article xix of the gatt as expanded upon in the wto agreement on safeguards allows parties to impose temporary restrictions on imports in the event of import surges ar ticle 21 of the safeguards agreement states the general rule that wto member may apply safeguard measure to product only if that member has determined that such product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities absolute or relative to domestic production and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products19 article xix is not listed as an fta exception in article xxiv paragraph 8b and the safeguards agreement leaves open the stion of the relations hip of safeguards

may be justified under article xxiv see wto analytical index guide to wto law and practice at httpwwwwtoorgenglishres_ebooksp_eanalytic_index_egatt1994_ehtmarticle24ftas20 wto members have expressed differing views on the subject arguing that 1 safeguards may not be imposed against ft partners because such measures are not exempted in paragraph 8b 2 safeguards must be applied on an mfn basis in part because of the requirement in article 22 of the safeguards agreement that safeguard be applied to product being imported irrespective of sour ce and 3 safeguards are allowed among fta parties so long as thirdparty rights are not infringed21 while not ruling on the relationship of article xxiv to the imposition of safeguards wto panels and the appellate body have identified requirement of parallelism in the safeguards agreement dictating that if seri ous injury were to be based on all imports including those from the fta the safeguards should apply to the same imports for example in the wto challenge to the now removed safeguard on steel imports imposed by the united states in march 2002 the panel as upheld by the ppellate body faulted the united states for including the imports of affected products from us fta partners in its investigation of whether increased imports were the cause of serious injury while excluding these countries imports from the remedial safeguard without providing reasoned and adequate explanation for why the imports covered by the safeguard alone satisfied the requirements for imposing the measure22 the north american free trade agreement nafta as
