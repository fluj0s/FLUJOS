level of 14298 billion an increase of 236 million however after scorekeeping adjustments the conference report provided total of 14565 billion including 574 million in mandatory funding the report included increases for number of agencies which were above either the house or senate approved levels also the fy2000 totals included 68 million of emergency funding for the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund however the legislation was not transmitted to the president president clinton had been expected to veto the bill due to differences involving riders on oil royalty valuations mining and grazing as well as the funding levels for the lands legacy initiative and the national endowment for the arts instead controversial issues were renegotiated and the final negotiat ed agreement for the interior bill was incorporated with others into the consolid ated appropriations act for fy2000 hr 3194 hrept 106479 originally this measure provided appropriations only for the district of columbia this omnibus measure passed the house on november 18 1999 and the senate on november 19 1999 and was sent to the president on november 22 1999 the interior appropriations portion of the consolidated measure also was introduced as separate bill hr 3423 which the consolidated measure would enact by crossreference on november 29 1999 the president signed into law the

report the law provided for governmentwide cuts equal to 038 of the discretionary budget authority for fy2000 in carrying out the rescissions some programs may be reduced by more or less than the 038 however program or activity may be reduced by more than 15 reduction shall be made to any military personnel account and reductions made to the department of defense and department of energy defense activities shall be applied proportionally finally the office of management and budget is required in the presidents fy2001 budget submission to the congress to provide report specifying such

requested by the administration 1269 billion but 52 million more than appropriated for fy1999 1184 billion the total amount was divided among ten activities about half the amount 646 million was for management of lands andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs6 resources this activity funds blm land programs including protection use improvement development disposal cadastral survey classification acquisition of easements and other interests as well as other activities such as maintenance of facilities the assessment of the mineral potential of public lands and the general administr ation of the agency the figure represented significant increase 34 million over the amount appropriated for fy1999 613 million and was also more than 5 million the amount requested 641 million part of the increase was to be directed towards health of the land programs nearly another quarter292 millionof the fy2000 appropriation for blm was for wildland fire management this activity supports interiors fire activities including preparedness suppression emergency rehabilitation and hazardous fuels reduction while more than 5 million the amount appropriated for last year this figure represented substantial decrease 14 million from the amount requested for fy2000 306 million the administration had sought the increase partly for rehabilitation of doi fire facilities and for blms fuels management program which involves using both prescribed fire and mechanical means to remove vegetative buildup that can cause fires the law contained 135 million for the payment in lieu of taxes program pilt which compensates local governments for most federal land within their jurisdictions because the federal government does not pay taxes on land it owns pilt money may be used for variety of local government purposes including schools firefighting and maintenance of roads the amount was 10 million greater than the amount requested for fy2000 and also appropriated for fy1999 125 million the pilt program has been controversial since its establishment in 1976 and in recent years the levels of appropriations have been substantially less than the authorized amounts for more information on pilt appropriations issues see crs report 98574 pilt payments in lieu of taxes somewhat simplified funding for the oregon and california grant lands which include highly productive timber lands was 99 million this activity funds programs related to the revested oregon and california railroad grant lands and related areas including for land improvements and the management protection and development of resources on these lands this figure was about 2 million less than the administration had requested for fy2000 but 2 million more than enacted for last year the law included 155 million for land acquisition and the explanatory language accompanying the final conference agreement h rept 106479 identified the areas proposed to be acquired this amount was slightly larger 1 million than the amount appropriated last year but the administration had sought to more than triple last years appropriation requesting 49 million generally the administration had sought the increase as part of its lands legacy initiative billion dollar multiagency effort to preserve restore and acquire lands see lands legacy initiative hereafter the majority of the requested increase for blm land acquisitions was for purchasing private inholdings in the california desert on this subject the explanatory language specified that 5 million was included for blm land acquisitions in the california desert property of the catellus mining company elsewhere in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs7 law an additional 10 million was provided for such california desert land acquisitions 5 million for the national park service and 5 million in title vi the explanatory language stated that an additional 15 million may be provided for future california desert land acquisitions but that future funding decisions would be based upon progress made by the interior and defense departments on desert tortoise mitigation and acquisition and expansion at the national training center for the army at fort irwin california the fy2000 appropriati on law contained the following levels of funding for other blm activities for construction the figure was 11 million sizeable increase over the presidents fy2000 request 8 million but only slightly higher than 04 million the amount enacted for fy1999 for the central hazardous materials fund the figure was 10 million the same as enacted for fy1999 but 1 million less than requested by the president for fy2000 the figure for range improvements was also 10 million the same as the fy1999 enacted level and the fy2000 requested level for service charges deposits and forfeitures 9 million was included which matched the fy2000 request but was 1 million more than the fy1999 appropriation for miscellaneous trust funds 8 million were provided which also equaled the fy2000 request but was less than the fy1999 enacted amount by 1 million mining one of the most controversial issues in the fy2000 interior appropriations 337 related to november 7 1997 legal opinion of the solicitor of the department of the interior that each mining claim can use more than 5 acres for activities associated with mining millsites the decision affected modern mining operations such as heapleach mines for gold and other hardrock minerals which typically require large tracts of land beyond that of the mining claim for mining related purposes including disposal of waste rock critics of the decision charged that it constituted new interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 1872 mining law 30 usc 42 was inconsistent with the practice of the department of the interior in granting operating plans for mining without regard to acreage limitations or the ratio of millsite locations to mining claims and was an indirect way of reforming the 1872 mining law the department of the interior refuted these criticisms in senate testimony asserting that its opinion was based both in law and practice the millsite language in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 provided twoyear exemption from the solicitors opinion for 1 patent applications grandfathered as part of the 1995 mining patent moratorium 2 any mining operation with an approved plan of operation and 3 any operation with plan of operation submitted to blm or the forest service before november 7 1997the date of the solicitors opinion the earlier conference report had excluded plans of operation submitted prior to may 21 1999 the explanatory language accompanying the conference agreement expressed the view that it would be inequitable to apply the opinion retrospectively in these instances specifically the exemption is for fy2000 and fy2001 the house and senatepassed measures contained opposing language on the subject with the house agreeing to support and the senate to overturn the opinion of the solicitor during initial floor consideration the house had agreed to language barring funds appropriated by this act from being used to process applications forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs8 approvals of patents plans of operations or amendments to plans that conflict with the opinion of the solicitor by contrast the senatepassed language would have prohibited the departments of the interior and agriculture in any fiscal year from limiting the number or acreage of millsites based on the ratio between the number or acreage of millsites and the number or acreage of mining claims the senatepassed language apparently would reverse the solicitors opinion permanently and comprehensively as well as prospectively on the floor the senate rejected an amendment to delete the millsite language from the bill so as to allow the solicitors opinion to stand related amendment essentially designed to protect ongoing mining operations from the solicitors opinion was subsequently withdrawn the senatepassed language had first been included by the senate appropriations committee in adopting this language which appeared to apply to all mining claims and millsites the senate appropriations committee went further than its interior subcommittee the subcommittee earlier had adopted an amendment making the solicitors opinion inapplicable to existing mines operating under approved operating plans the current millsite debate arises on the heels of recent battle in the long war over the 1872 mining law governing mining on federal lands which has evolved into stalemate between the laws critics and supporters earlier this year the interior departments decision on millsite acreage led to the administrations denial march 1999 of an operating plan for the crown jewel mine in washington on the grounds that the plan exceeded the lodeclaim to millsite ratio opponents of the mine also feared that the site would leach chemicals congress subsequently enacted law the 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 10631 to direct that millsites and acreage for the crown jewel mining operation not be limited that its plan of operation be approved and that other patent applications and plans of operation for milling submitted prior to the law be given permits for more information on the millsite debate and related issues see crs report rl30310 the mining law millsite debate the consolidated appropriations act included other mining language 312 that essentially retained the mining patent moratorium contained in previous appropriations laws the language continued the prohibition on accepting and processing applications for patents for mining or mill site claims on federal lands however applications meeting certain requirements that were filed on or before september 30 1994 were grandfathered and thirdparty contractors were authorized to process grandfathered applications identical language had been included in both the houseand senatepassed bills grazing the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 contained language 123 to extend grazing permits and leases issued under 43 usc 1752 that expire or are transferred until the permit renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations including any necessary environmental analyses although 43 usc 1752 addresses grazing permits issued by both the blm and the forest service elsewhere 123 refers only to the secretary of the interior the first conference report and chamber passed measures also referenced the secretary of the interior or the bureau of land manage ment the fy2000 law sought to address heavy agency workload in processing the relatively large number of grazing permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs9 and leases which are up for renewal some members especially from the west had argued that the delay in processing renewals threatened ranchers bank loans the law preserved the authority of the secretary when the renewal process is complete to cancel suspend or modify permits and leases the explanatory language directed the interior department to develop and implement schedule to alleviate the backlog of permits and leases up for renewal and described the inclusion of 25 million to expedite the renewal process many environmental groups had opposed the permit extension language as allowing blm to delay required environmental analyses thereby continuing permits with possibly detrimental conditions or terms the house and senate initially had agreed to different provisions on this issue the senatepassed bill would have extended grazing permits and leases which expired or were transferred in any fiscal year whereas the house bill would have extended grazing permits expiring during fy2000 for the balance of that fiscal year the house bill specified that after the renewal process the terms and conditions of permits could be modified and permits could be reissued for up to 10 years the senate appropriations committee report stated that the governments inability to complete permit renewals should not prevent or interrupt grazing on the floor during initial consideration the senate tabled an amendment 58 37 to require blm to establish schedule to complete the processing of expiring grazing permits and leases the amendment would have required all permits and leases expiring in fy1999 fy2000 and fy2001 to be processed by blm by september 30 2001 it would have extended the permits and leases until that date or the date on which blm completed the processing whichever was earlier supporters of the amendment argued that time certain for completing the renewal process was needed to assure that they would be completed in timely way and that the existing senate language was too broad in its application to expirations in any fiscal year the amendment had substantial support from environmental groups wildlife population surveys the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 did not contain language on blm and forest service wildlife surveys for activities on federal land the first conference report passed earlier by both chambers had included language to grant the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of the interior authority to decide whether to gather additional information on wildlife populations with regard to inventorying monitoring or surveying requirements for activities on federal land the language was modification of senatepassed provision which had been opposed by many environmentalists and the administration the administration had opposed the language as slowing down timber sales increasing project costs possibly increasing litigation and in the breadth of its application to activities on federal lands potentially having farreaching negative consequences the senate appropriations committee originally had granted the agencies related discretion on the grounds that requiring wildlife surveys in all cases would be costly and time consuming and that species knowledge and research methodologies are in some cases insufficient for conducting wildlife surveys during initial floor consideration the senate rejected an amendment 4552 to delete language on this subject those advocating deletion charged that the bill wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs10 overturn recent court decisions requiring agencies to undertake certain species monitoring and data collection before conducting timber sales they argued that agencies should be required to develop new data on species through comprehensive wildlife surveys before making decisions on ground breaking activities supporters of the senatepassed language had asserted that recent court rulings deviated from earlier ones allowing challenged timber sales to proceed and upholding agency practices of surveying populations essentially by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population data they contended that recent court decisions setting conditions for species monitoring and data collection would be impossible to meet costing between 5 billion and 9 billion further they argued that the secretaries had discretion to use where warranted and that in the past agencies have used discretion in implementing regulations in this area they claimed that the language only maintains the status quo for one year fy2000 lwcf funding the consolidated appropriations act provided blm with 155 million from the land and water conservation fund lwcf which is the principal source of funds for acquiring recreation lands with additional funds provided in title vi of the act as projected by the budget office of the department of the interior total lwcf funding for blm was 35 million the blm the other three major land management agencies and state agencies receive money from the fund the enacted figure was more than the house provided 15 millionand the senate provided 17 million but less than the administration requested 49 million for

appropriations act for fy2000 provided 8781 million much of the administrations proposed increase was in resource management which includes the endangered species program fisheries and refuge management among other items which would have gone from 6611 million to 7240 million an increase of 629 million the house and senate agreed to 7160 million the administration requested that the endangered species funding including the cooperative endangered species fund increase from 1248 million to 1949 million see table 3 the fy2000 enacted level was 1317 million the decrease for recovery shown in the table is more apparent than real in fy1999 recovery included an earmarked 20 million for salmon recovery in washington state the administration proposal assumed that the earmark was for fy1999 only for fy2000 the law included an earmark of 39 million of recovery funds for salmon in washington state the administration proposed to continue strict limit on funding for the listing function which includes designation of critical habitat and included its specific caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs11 at the proposed level of 75 million in the bill itself the language limits the discretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings eg if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species delisting and downlisting are not covered by the cap with the cap court order to carry forward listing decision on particular species makes listing into zero sum game at least at fiscal level the listing of some species or designation of their critical habitats would preclude the listing of others fws supported this change as protection of the budgets of other programs the fy2000 law contained this limitation and set funding for listing at 62 million the administration also proposed new restriction within the listing function under the proposed restriction at most 1 million of the requested 75 million could be spent on critical habitat designation fws has traditionally deemphasized designation of critical habitat feeling it an inefficient use of resources supporters of designation praise either the required consideration of economic impacts of designation or the additional measure of protection that may be provided under some circumstances the fy2000 law did not include this limitation table 3 funding for endangered species programs

congress appropriated 10779 million for fy1999 the fy2000 law provided for 10779httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs12 million the payment levels have been controversial since the small additions of land to the national wildlife refuge system over the last several years mean that reduced dollars must be spread still further the situation has produced calls for congress to increase the appropriation especially since local governments often incorrectly view the payments as entitlements even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations payments under pilt see blm above benefit some counties with land in the national wildlife refuge system however those lands that are acquired rather than reserved from the public domain are not eligible for pilt payments western refuge lands are primarily reserved from the public domain eastern refuges are primarily acquired lands land acquisition for the national wildlife refuge system would increase from 480 million to 736 million or 533 under the presidents proposal since much of the increase in the cooperative endangered species conservation fund would be used for state grants in habitat acquisition for habitat conservation plans ie not purchases that will necessarily become part of the national wildlife refuge system these two programs together would represent significant increase in acquisition for wildlife conservation

service nps currently manages the 378 units that comprise the national park system including 54 full or actual national parks the premier units of the system in addition to the national parks the diverse park system includes national preserves recreation areas reserves monuments battlefields seashores and number of other categories the system has grown to more than 83 million acres in 49 states and the district of columbia and several us territories in recent years park visits annually have totaled more than 285 million the nps has the often contradictory mission of facilitating access andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs13 serving park system visitors while protecting and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to it according to the administration and park advocacy groups the park service had operated with tight budgets over recent decades during this period congress restricted appropriations to operate and maintain the park system while expanding management responsibilities and continuing to add new units to the system it was asserted that restricted funding combined with increased visitation stretched personnel impaired operations and generated multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance however spending for the nps now appears to have higher priority temporary closure of nps units part of federal governmentwide shutdown during the budget debates of late 1995 and early 1996 helped galvanize public support for expanding nps funding which has increased annually since fy1996 in may 1999 the white house warned that the stringent spending caps set by the house appropriations panel would lead to cuts to the nps that threatened to force reduced services and hours of operation at all park units and probable closure of smaller units and backcountry areas of larger parks the possibility of repeat of politically unpopular parks closure likely helped secure additional monies in the house panels bill the administrations fy2000 request for the nps totaled 2059 billion an increase of 294 million over the fy1999 enacted level of 1764 billion the largest component of the nps budget is operations which under the budget proposal would increase by 104 million from 1286 billion in fy1999 to 1390 in fy2000 the budget contained an allocation of 131 million for everglades ecosystem restoration for the nps out of the interior departments total of 152 million the senate appropriations committee approved funding for the nps at 172 billion or 41 million less than fy1999 the senate passed bill provides total nps appropriation of 1750 billion it includes 136 billion for operations which exceeds current funding of 129 billion by 70 million but is less than the administrations request of 139 billion the bill provides an extra 27 million in operational funding to be spread among 100 park units and national historic trails with critical health and safety deficiencies and other special needs the administration had requested 25 million for 91 parks the house appropriations committee recommended total of 172 billion or 338 million less than the administrations request the house panel recommended 139 billion for park operations 102 million increase over fy1999 enacted the house bill provides total of 114 million for everglades restoration the nps share would be 944 million and 20 million from other interior department bureaus the house passed bill would boost total nps funding to 1755 billion keeping park operations at approximately 139 billion nearly the same as requested and identical to the amount recommended by the house committee the conferees increased the nps total spending to 1810 billion the conferees agreed to spend 1365 billion on operations closer to the senate approved number than the house approvedadministration requested figure the final conference agreement contained these funding levels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs14 an amendment agreed to in the senate passed version could require the nps to postpone new sound thresholds it wants to use to measure noise from air tour overflights of grand canyon national park the amendment would delay use of

provides land acquisition funds to states known as the stateside grant program to implement their state recreation plans these funds are administered by the nps and were last appropriated in fy1995 the house approved an amendment sponsored by representative mcgovern 213202 to provide 30 million to this program to offset the increase the amendment provided for decrease of 1 million in blm management of land and resources and 29 million in doe fossil energy research and development last year the house rejected similar amendments to fund the stateside grant program the senate amendment agreed to by voice vote provided 20 million to the stateside program and senator chafee the amendments sponsor stated that in conference he would support the houses higher figure the conference committee provided 21 million and earmarked 25 million for wisconsin if certain requirements are met the fy2000 appropriations law with the addition of title vi land money brought stateside grants up to 41 million nearly double the conference committee figure for nps land acquisitions the fy2000 appropriations law provided total of 1347 million including title vi funds as projected by the budget office of the department of the interior the administration had requested 172 million for the land acquisition program an increase of 24 million above the fy1999 enacted level for additional information on land acquisitions see p 47 deferred maintenance the park system most would concede has formidable maintenance burden with thousands of miles of roads and thousands of permanent structures bridges tunnels employee housing units water and waste systems etc the nps has valued these assets at over 35 billion but they would deteriorate without adequate care and maintenance mounting concerns about the buildup of unmet maintenance needs has prompted congress to seek new funding sources congress and the administration have generally agreed to provide additional funding for the operation of the park system and to attack the maintenance backlog in response to congressional appropriation leaders the fy2000 budget proposal highlighted an interior departmentwide campaign to prioritize maintenance over five year period the park service would increase maintenance spending by 29 million from 412 million in fy1999 to 441 million in fy2000 the explanatory statement accompanying the conference report hr 3194 h rept 106479 stated that 433 million was provided for park maintenance instead of 443 million as proposed by the house and 432 million as proposed by the senate title vi of the interior portion of the fy2000 appropriations law provided an additional 5 million for backlog maintenance of the nps recreation fee demonstration program the recreation fee program being tested by the nps and three other federal land management agencies began inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs15 fy1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees with most of the added fees being retained by the unit where the money is collected it was hoped that the additional fees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive in pursuing selffinancing for operating and maintaining their units the nps collected more than 136 million under this program in fy1999 the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill extended the fee demonstration program for two additional years the fy2000 appropriations law continued the fee demonstration program allowing public land agencies to keep 100 of fees urban park and recreation fund this costsharing park service

the conference agreement did not include house approved amendment to fund the urban park and recreation recovery uparr program at 2 million the administrati ons request many feared similar fate for the program in fy2000 however the fy2000 appropriations law provided 2 million the first new funding in 5 years for fy2000 the administration requested 4 million appropriation for uparr neither the house nor the senate appropriations committee bills contained separate funding for this program the house committee report 106222 recommended that all nps funding increases be focused upon reducing operational shortfalls and serious maintenance backlogs an amendment to restore the requested 4 million for the uparr program was agreed to by voice vote during house floor action on hr 2466 and the senate voted 15 million these funds were included as part of national recreation and preservation instead of as freestanding program the conference agreed to 2 million for uparr as part of this larger

primary science agency in providing earth and biological science information related to natural hazards certain aspects of the environment and energy mineral water and biological sciences in addition it is the federal governments principal civilian mapping agency and primary source of data on the quality and quantity of the nations water resources in further definition of its scientific role the usgs budget for fy2000 was restructured to contain new integrated science budget activity for science support for the departments land management bureaus as well as specific placebased studies research conducted with this funding would be identified through collaborative effort with the land and wildlife management bureaus to address their most pressing needs and will initially provide support to the bureau of land management us fish and wildlife service and national park service the budget also was restructured to consolidate all facilities costs into an overall facilities budget and administrative costs into science support category this may give the appearance that programs throughout the bureau are decreasing but that is because facilities and administration costs were previously part of program budgets separating out facilities and administration will allow clearer view of the money budgeted directly for science for fy2000 the administrati on requested 838485 million for the us geological survey in the appropriation category of surveys investigations andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs18 research this was an increase of 39589 million over the 1999 enacted level essentially all of the funds are used in four major program areas and in the new category of integrated science the four major program areas are the national mapping program geologi c hazards resource and processes water resources investigations and biological research with the exception of integrated science all of these appear to show an apparent decrease with the difference being the separate breakout of facilities and science support however not all the apparent decreases are real for the national mapping program the administration requested 135434 million2881 million less than enacted for fy1999 however decreases for budget restructuring totaled 19462 million indicating an overall increase of 16581 million for fy2000 in the geologic hazards resource and processes program the budget request was 198617 million this was 40533 million less than enacted for fy1999 the reduction for restructuring was 40267 million indicating small net decrease in program funding most of this reduction was in the subprogram area of geologic resource assessments for water resources investigations decreases given for technical adjustments related to budget restructuring was greater than program decreases thus indicating gains in funding for the science aspects of the program the fy 2000 request was for 172506 million is this area for biological research the administration requested 124964 million in fy 2000 this was 37497 million less than enacted for fy1999 the reduction for budget restructuring was 36864 million indicating net reduction in the program most of the reduction was in the subprogram category of biological research and monitoring integrated science shows an initial budget request of 47686 million of which 30286 million can be attributed to technical adjustments related to budget restructuring this leaves 174 million in new funding in this category with 15 million to focus science resources on the highest priorities of land managers and 24 million to begin new placebased studies of ecosystems of concern specifically the great lakes platte river greater yellowstone and mojave the total fte for the usgs remains level at 9737 the senate appropriations committee recommended 140596 million for the national mapping program an increase of 5162 million over the budget request for geologic hazards resource and processes the committee recommended 245734 million an increase of 47117 over the request water resources investigations were increased 43727 million over the request to 216233 million and biological research was increased 35284 million to 160248 million funding for integrated science was zeroed out and science support and facilities were reduced considerably from the request total funding recommended for the usgs was 813243 million or 25242 million less than requested the committee did not approve the budget restructuring of the geological survey asserting that the survey needed to seek broader involvement from within in restructuring its programs however the committee expressed support for restructuri ng in general to improve program efficiency particularly when tied to strategic plans the senatepassed appropriation for the us geological survey totaled 8131 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs19 the house passed hr 2466 with an appropriation totaling 820444 million for the us geological survey decrease of

processes an increase of 11464 million 185301 million for water resources an increase of 12795 million and 137674 million for biological research an increase of 12710 million from the request the budget request of 47686 million for new integrated science activity placebased and doi science was not approved but science support and facilities were each recommended for funding at or slightly above the request the house also noted that the surveys budget submissions have emphasized number of new activities outside the traditional mission of the survey and to the detriment of some of the longstanding core mission areas consequently the house directed the survey to provide statement of the surveys vision of its future role with emphasis on the major topical areas that are central to the surveys mission and the type of activities that are needed to fulfill that mission both the original conference report and the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 contained an appropriation of 823833 million for the us geologi cal survey for surveys investigations and research of the total 60856 million were to be used for cooperation with states and municipalities for water resources investigations and 164 million were to be available until expended for conducting inquiries into the economic conditions affecting mining and materials processing industries another 2 million of the

reclamation and enforcement osm to ensure that land mined for coal would be returned to condition capable of supporting its premining land use smcra also established an abandoned mine lands aml fund with fees levied on coal production to reclaim abandoned sites that pose serious health or safety hazards congress intention was that individual states and indian tribes would develop their own regulatory programs to enforce uniform minimum standards estab lished by law and regulations osm is required to maintain oversight of state regulatory programs the administration request for the office of surface mining for fy2000 at 3058 million was 271 million above the fy1999 appropriation most of the increase was targeted to accelerating the pace of abandoned mine land reclamation by boosting the appropriation from the aml fund in 2000 the total request included funding for regulation and technology programs and appropriations from the abandoned mine lands fund the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 provided total of 2924 million for the office of surface mining of the total presidential request 947 million was for regulation and technology programs an increase of 13 million from adjusted fy1999 levels that would restore some of the reduction made in fy1999 from fy1998 levels senate appropriations added 13 million to cover fixed cost increases and an additional 15 million for state regulatory program grants bringing the level recommended to the full senate to nearly 962 million the house approved 960 million the senate agreed to 962 million and this level was enacted the administrations aml request for fy2000 was 2112 million an increase of 257 million over adjusted fy1999 levels the appalachian clean streams initiative boosted from 5 to 7 million from fy1998 to fy1999 was proposed to increase by another 3 million in fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs23 appropriations for aml activities are based on states current and historic coal production minimum program states are states with lower coal production that nevertheless have sites needing reclamation the minimum funding level for each of these states was increased to 2 million in 1992 however over the objection of these states congress appropriated 15 million to minimum program states in fy1996fy1998 the administration budget proposed to restore the minimum funding level to 2 million in fy2000 this and the significant boost in the proposed appropriation from the aml fund were apparently to address the dissatisfactions expressed in recent years by states and tribes that are recipients of reclamation grants senate appropriations however rejected the boost recommending level of 1857 million 25 million less than the administration this level was adopted by the full senate the senate version also accepted committee recommendations to fund minimum program states at 15 million but did agree with boosting the appalachian clean streams initiative acsi to 7 million the house committee on appropriations nearly split the boost requested by the administ ration recommending 1965 million but increasing acsi to 8 million these levels were adopted by the full house the conferees on hr 2466 settled upon an appropriation of 1912 million for aml 8 million to acsi and 15 million to the minimum program states the final budget package as enacted into law increased the total to 1962

bia provides wide variety of services to federally recognized american indian and alaska native tribes and their members and has historically been the lead agency in federal dealings with tribes programs provided or funded through the bia include government operations courts law enforcement fire protection social programs education roads natural resource and real estate management economic development employment assistance housing repair dams indian rights protection implementation of land and water settlements and partial gaming oversight among others the key issues for the bia are the equitable distribution of bia funding among tribes the movement toward greater tribal influence on bia programs and expenditures especially the role of contract support costs and bia reorganization and downsizing additional significant issues raised by proposed provisions of previous interior appropriations bills have included taxation of certain indian businesses and tribal sovereign immunity from suit greater tribal control over federal indian programs has been the goal of indian policy since the 1970s in the bia this policy has taken three forms tribal contracting to run individual bia programs under the indian selfdetermination act pl 93638 as amended tribal compacting with the bia to manage all or most of tribes bia programs under the selfgovernance program pl 103413 and shifting programs into portion of the bia budget called tribal priority allocations tpa in which tribes have more influence in bia budget planning and within which each tribe has authority to reprogram all its tpa funds in fy1998 tpa accounts for 495 of the bias operation of indian programs including most of the bia fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs24 for tribal governments operations human services courts and law enforcement natural resources and community development and for 445 of total bia direct appropriations the bia has been under pressure from tribes the administration and congress to reorganize but proposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement under the clinton administrations national performance review reinventing government initiative the bia had planned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the tribal shares process in which tribes and the bia determine first which bia functions are inherently federal and which are available for tribal management and second what each tribes share of funds is for the latter functions but the bia has indicated that the interior solicitor has advised against such procedure appropriations committee reports for fy1997 and fy1998 directed the bia to develop reorganization plan and consolidate central area and agency offices consequently the bia indicated it is developing reorganization plans and consolidation options with the appropriations committees approval the bia commissioned the national academy of public administration napa to study bias administration and management napa published its report in september 1999 study of management and administration the bureau of indian affairs the conference committee on the fy2000 interior appropri ations bill hr 2466 noted napas conclusion that the assistant secretaryindian affairs lacks the staff support necessary to lead bia particularly in the areas of planning budgeting human resources management and information resource managemen t recommended that bia implement the napa report and provided 250000 for an office of policy analysis and planning at bias washington central office the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 directed the secretary of the interior to reorganize the bia based on the napa recommendations and provided 5 million for this purpose the issue of the equitable distribution of bia fundingoften referred to as meanstestinghas two aspects one relating to how funds are distributed the other relating to whether tribes other financial resources are taken into account first much if not most bia funding even while serving tribal needs is not required to be distributed on national per capita or other formula basis second tribes own non bia resources especially business revenues are not always required to be taken into account for both the fy1998 and fy1999 interior appropriations bills the senate appropriations committee proposed 1 requiring the bia to develop several alternate formulas for distributing tpa funds on the basis of need taking into account tribal business revenues including gaming and 2 requiring tribes to submit tribal business revenue information to bia and in the fy1999 bill proposed implementing the new distribution formula in fy2000 in addition the senate committees fy1999 bill proposed reallocating half of tpa funds from tribes outside alaska in the top 10 of percapita tribal business revenues to tribes in the bottom 20 of per capita tribal business revenues the house appropriations committee provided 250000 in fy1999 to continue the fy1998 tpaallocation workgroup see below to develop needsmeasurement methods directed the bia to develop tpa allocation criteria that address equity in tpa funding and included an administrative provision assuring tribes who return funds to the bia that the federal trust responsibility tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs25 them and the federal governmenttogovernment relationship with the tribes will not be diminished supporters of the senate committees proposals claim that bia funding is inequitably distributed that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds received per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need that only 30 percent of tpa funding is based on formulas and that gao study shows some rich tribes got more tpa funds in fy1998 than tribes with outside revenues opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty that bia funding is insufficient to meet tribal needs and that meanstesting tpa funding would penalize tribes who still have severe needs would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes has not been fully analyzed and would be unfair since it is not required of state or local governments receiving federal assistance in considering similar proposals in the fy1998 appropriations bill congress had dropped the requirements for formula and tribal income data and instead had distributed some fy1998 tpa funds so that each tribe might receive the minimum funding recommended by the 1994 report of the joint tribalbiadoi task force on bia reorganization 160000 per tribe except 200000 per tribe in alaska with allocation of any remaining tpa funds based on recommendation of tribalfederal task force in addition several senators had requested the gao to report on tpa distribution issues the tribalfederal tpa task force made its distribution recommendations on january 29 1998 and also recommended creating longterm workgroup on tpa funding allocation recommendation the bia supported the gao presented its tpa distribution study in april and july 1998 among the gao findings were that twothirds of fy1998 tpa funds were distributed based on historical levels and onethird was distributed based on formulas that tpa distribution per capita varied widely across bia areas and that tribal governments reporting of revenues were inconsistent in including or excluding nonfederal revenues the gao results were used by the senate appropriations committee in developing the fy1999 proposals described above congress in the interior appropriat ions portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act dropped the senate appropriations committees proposed reallocation scheme and dropped the requirement that tribes submit revenue data but retained the requirement that the bia develop proposals for alternative tpa funding methods congress also retained the house provision of 250000 for the tpa workgroup and the language concerning tribes returning funds to the bia the biatribal workgroup on tribal needs assessment formed in january 1998 delivered its report in july 1999 among the reports conclusions were that variation in tribes circumstances makes formula distribution problematic tpa funding results from history geography and policies current funding does not meet needs identified measures of tribal need and revenue are not fully available and base tpa funding should not be redistributed for fy2000 the senate proposed authorizing the secretary of the interior to redistribute tpa fundswithout reducing any tribes tpa share more than 10to alleviate tribal funding inequities to meet identified unmet needs the house had similar proposal the conference report on hr 2466 included the senates proposal but allowed the secretary to go over the 10 limit in situations of dual enrollmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs26 overlapping service areas or inaccurate distribution methodologies the senate bill also directed the bia to distribute funds for its postsecondary institutions by formula the conference report on hr 2466 included this provision the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 retained both the tpa and postsecondary funding provisions as approved in the conference report during congressional debates over fy1997 and fy1998 interior appropriations congress considered but did not approve several additional controversial provisions one proposal considered in the house would have prohibited the interior secretary from using his general authority to take land into trust for tribe unless the tribe had agreed with state and local governments on the collection of state and local retail sales taxes from nonmembers of the tribe this proposal was also introduced in the 105th congress in hr 1168 on which hearings were held june 24 1998 the other provision proposed by the senate appropriations committee would have waived tribal governments sovereign immunity to civil suit in federal court if tribe accepted tpa funding the tribal immunity waiver provision was withdrawn on the senate floor the senate indian affairs committee held several hearings in 1998 on bill s 1691 introduced february 27 1998 restricting tribal sovereign immunity one of the issues raised at the hearings was the degree to which tribes are insured against torts and other liability claims at the committees markup of s 1691 consideration was postponed on the motion of the bills sponsor who later introduced five new more specific bills neither of these proposals was offered during consideration of fy1999 interior appropriations in the interior portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act however congress required the interior secretary to study tribal liability insurance coverage and make report with legislative recommendations by april 1 1999 the joint biatribal workgroup on tribal needs assessment was charged with preparing the insurance coverage report in considering the fy1999 and fy2000 bills both the house and senate appropriations committees took note of several further issues in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act congress placed biafunded law enforcement under centralized line authority and made bia lawenforcement funds unavailab for reprogramming changes were suggested for fy2000 concerning support costs for selfdetermination contracts and selfgovernance compacts congress for fy1999 forbade use of fy1999 funds to pay for unpaid contract support costs from earlier years in spite of court decisions confirming federal responsibility for such costs the house and the senate recommended the same provision for fy2000 and it was included in the conference report and the fy2000 appropriations law for fy1999 congress also approved oneyear moratorium on selfdetermination contracts and selfgovernance compacts so that the bia and tribes could address the contract support costs problem and the gao could conduct study of the issue the gaos report published in june 1999 indian selfdetermination act shortfalls in indian ct support costs need to be addressed gaorced99150 offered four alternative methods for funding contract support costs and recommended that bia and ihs be directed to develop standard policy on funding contract support costs for fy2000 the senate recommended an extension of the moratorium on self determination contracts and compacts while the house bill contained provision for moratorium the conference committee bill included the moratorium provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs27 but the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 dropped the moratorium provision in addition congress for fy1999 included bill language restricting the huron cemetery in kansas to use as cemetery an oklahoma tribe has at times proposed using it for gaming the senate recommended the same provision for fy2000 and it was included in the conference report and in the fy2000 appropriations law for fy2000 the senate also would prohibit taking lands into trust in clark county washington for the shoalwater bay indian tribe pending tribalcounty agreement on development issues the conference committee retained this provision as did the enacted measure the senate during debate on the fy1999 interior appropriations bill approved an amendment prohibiting the interior secretary from approving class iii indian gaming compacts without state approval and from promulgating during fy1999 proposed regulations for approving gaming compacts in situations where state invokes its immunity from suit over compact negotiations congress chose only to prohibit promulgation of the regulations and that only for the first half of fy1999 the regulations were promulgated by the secretary of the interior on april 12 1999 64 fr 17535 and immediately challenged in federal court by florida and alabama who argue the secretary has authority for such regulations under igra the secretary has stated that he would not approve any compacts under the regulations until the courts decided whether he had such authority for fy2000 neither appropriations committee reported any gamingcompact provisions the house did not accept proposed amendment to prohibit funding for any gaming compacts not agreed to by both state and tribe but the senate did approve provision prohibiting funds to implement the secretar ys april 1999 regulations the conference committee on hr 2466 dropped the senate provision based on the interior secretarys assurances that he would not implement these regulations until federal courts ruled on their legality the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 followed the conference recommendation bias fy1999 direct appropriations enacted to date were 1746 billion for fy2000 the administration proposed 19 billion an increase of 89 over fy1999 included in the proposal were

were debated in forest service budget and authorizing legislation the fy2000 budget request proposed declines both in salvage sales from 1112 billion board feet or bbf to 1001 bbf and in new green sales from 2511 bbf to 2251 bbf the proposed sale program of 325 bbf would have been the lowest level since fy1950 the house and senate passed more timber sale funds and directed fy2000 sales to be at the fy1999 level the conference agreed to slightly lower 2 million timber sale funds for fy2000 and this level was enacted for fy2000 several related provisions were included in the fy1999 omnibus consolidated appropriations act the 10 roads and trails fund was altered to allow its use to improve forest health conditions and repair or reconstruct roads bridges and trails emphasizing the

offset proposed decline in appropriations for fy2000 the house senate conference and fy2000 appropriations law included the fy1999 provision in addition the initial conference report for fy2000 modified senate language allowing the interior and agricultur secretaries to decide whether to gather additional information on wildlife populations under inventorying monitoring or surveying requirements for activities on federal lands see wildlife population surveys above this was to alleviate the agencies from the survey and manage requirements to implement the presidents forest plan the agencies were successfully challenged in court with accompanying injunctions on timber sales for not fulfilling these requirements the provision was deleted from the final conference report and measure as enacted for fy2000 land management planning management of the federal lands has been controversial for decades increasing conflicts among users in the 1960s and early 1970s led congress to enact the national forest management act of 1976 nfma and the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma to establish and guide land and resource management planning for the national forests and blm lands despite lofty goals the public participatory planning processes have not led to harmonious land management bills to improve planning some emphasizing forest health have been introduced in both houses in several congresses but none have been enacted the fy2000 forest service appropriations bills included sections affecting land management planning one in the house senate conference and enacted measures directed the forest service to continue management under existing plans with numerous exceptions until the final planning regulations released in draft on oct 5 1999 are revised this provision was included in the fy1999 appropriations act the other section included in the senate and conference versions and the fy2000 appropriations law would prohibit the agency from completing the rpa program this provision also was included in the fy1999 appropriations act forest roads road construction in the national forests continued to be controversial some interests oppose new roads because roads increase access to areas they believe should be preserved in pristine condition because roads are major source of erosion stream sedimentation and other environmental degradation and because road funding is asserted to be corporate subsidy for the timber industry supporters argue that access roads are needed for forest protection eg from wildfire and for timber harvesting and other onsite uses and maintain that roads can be built without causing significant environmental problems for fy2000 the house and senate passed modest increases from fy1999 appropr iations for road construction 19 million and 15 million respectively while the administration had proposed modest decrease 15 million house amendment proposed by hon george miller to prohibit funding

that the forest service has had substantial lack of leadership concerning managerial accountability and stated the forest service should pay close attention to napa recommendations concerning this matter and organizational structure the house committee report discussed problems of agency accountability and included separate section on forest service trust fund accountability and performanc the

from sales of spr oil in fy1997 and fy1998 the 105th congress approved conventional appropriation of 1601 million for the program in fy1999 this followed the cancellation of another authorized sale with oil prices declining sharply amid projected budget surplus the congressional consensus was that further sale was inadvisable in all roughly 28 million barrels of spr oil were previously sold to finance maintenance and upgrade of spr facilities purchase of oil for the reserve ended in 1994 attention turned during the first session of the 106th congress to finding ways to replenish the spr while some urged or proposed that this be accomplished through direct appropriations other ideas were advanced partly in the context of concerns about domestic producers who were hurt by the steep and prolonged decline in crude oil prices that did not ease until the spring of 1999 one idea advanced in late 1998 was to have royalties on oil production from federal leases paid in kind that is paid in

indian health service the indian health service ihs carries out the federal responsibility of assuring comprehensive preventive curative rehabilitative and environmental health services for approximately 149 million american indians and alaska natives who belong to more than 557 federally recognized tribes in 34 states care is provided through system of federal tribal and urban indian operated programs and facilities that serves as the major source of health care for american indians and alaska natives ihshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs39 funding is separated into two accounts indian health services and indian health facilities included in indian health services are such services as hospital and health clinic programs dental health mental health alcohol and substance abuse programs preventive health services urban health projects and funding for indian health professions the indian health facilities account includes funds for maintenance and improvement construction of health facilities sanitation facilities and environmental health support the ihs program is funded through combination of federal appropriations and collections of reimbursements from medicare medicai d and private insurance for services provided to eligible patients who have such insurance coverage the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 provided 2398 billion for the indian health service 2079 billion for the indian health services and 319 million for indian health facilities this appropriation was 15 million below the administrations fy2000 budget request 338000 below the housepassed level 70 million above the senatepassed level and 155 million above the fy1999 appropriated level the population served by the ihs has higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than other us populations although the differences in mortality rates have diminished in recent years in such areas as infant and maternal mortality as well as mortality associated with alcoholism injuries tuberculosis gastroenteritis and other conditions american indians and alaska natives also have less access to health care than does the general us population with the number of physicians and nurses per indian beneficiary dropping this number was already below that of the general population in the 1980s according to the ihs per capita health spending for ihs was 1397 in fy1997 compared to the us per capita expenditure of about 3900 the population eligible for ihs services is increasing at rate of approximately 2 per year according to the ihs the increases in program funding over the past decade have failed to keep pace with increases in the eligible population and with inflation many ihs health care facilities are reportedly in need of repair or replacement in fact the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act conference report hereafter referred to as the acts conference report gave the ihs 319 million 27 million over fy1999 funding for site purchase facility construction repair demolition and maintenance also included in this years appropriations were funds for ambulances and for purchase of department of defense equipment for health facilities and funding for the hopi tribe to reduce their debt for meeting hospital staff housing needs in recent years funding for health care facilities had decreased to remedy this fact the act authorized the transfer of 10 million of the indian health care improvement fund monies to ihs health care facilities and asked that the ihs report back on how the money was used the acts conference report expressed an expectation that the ihs work closely with the tribes and the administration to make needed revisions to the facilities construction priority system given the extreme need for new and replacement hospitals and clinics the acts conference report asked that the administration determine base funding amount and have this amount serve as minimum annualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs40 amount in each future years budget request according to the acts conference report issues that needed to be examined in revising the current construction priority system included but were not limited to projects funded primarily by the tribes anomalies such as extremely remote location facilities recognition of projects that involve or minimal increases in operational costs and alternative financing and modular construction options the acts conference report asked the ihs to reexamine the current system for construction of health facilities and to develop more flexible and responsive program to accommodate more readily the wide variances in tribal needs and capabilities the distribution of contract support costs across all ihs selfdetermination contracts and selfgovernance compacts is contentious issue because funding has been insufficient to cover all tribal costs contract support costs are the costs awarded to tribe for the administration of program under contract or compact authorized by the indian selfdetermination act the operation costs for these contracts and compacts are allocated separately congress has tried to ensure that contract support funds are distributed fairly under proposed prorata distribution scheme the support for current tribal organizations and individual tribes would decline as new tribes entered into contracts and compacts the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 provided 229 million for contract support costs the acts conference report stated that of this total only 10 million may be used for costs associated with new and expanded contracts grants selfgovernance compacts or annual funding agreements on the issue of general increases the acts conference report expressed congressional concerns about the lack of resolution as to whether tribes have an entitlement to full funding of these contract support costs the acts conference report noted the inherent conflict in the authorizing statute which implies 100 funding requirement while at the same time making these funds subject to appropriation the acts conference report strongly encourages the service to continue its work with the tribes and with the legislative committees of jurisdiction in an effort to resolve the legislative discrepancies that exist currently and to ensure that these costs can be funded fairly in fact the acts conferen ce report noted recent court decision that decided that the law unequivocally makes contracts providing such costs subject to the availability of appropriations and that any agency can only spend as much money as has been appropriated for contract support costs the acts conference report agreed with house language on the distribution of funding increases among ihs programs the acts conference report stated that fixed cost increases should be distributed equitably across all serviceoperated and triballyoperated programs other program increases should not automatically be distributed on prorata basis for example 1000000 program increase distributed across all health program s would give each program an insignificant amount of additional funding in such case the acts conference report wanted the ihs to select very limited number of projects so that demonstrable results can be achieved the acts conference report suggested that ihs develop objective criteria for evaluating project proposals prior to the distribution of programspecific increases that are unrelated to fixed costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs41 on june 30 1999 the general accounting office gao released indian self determina tion act

still on hopi partitioned land some of whom refuse to relocate the remaining 383 families were not on hopi partitioned land but were in various stages of acquiring replacement housing negotiations had gone forward among the two tribes the navajo families on hopi partitioned land and the federal government especially regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states the united states and the hopi tribe reached proposed settlement agreement on december 14 1995 attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for navajo families on hopi partitioned land the navajohopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104 301 approved the settlement agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been resolved by these agreements however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo families with homesites on hopi partitioned land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing leases an initial hopi report said 60 of the 80 homesites affected had signed the leases the hopi tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997fy1999 interior appropriations acts the fy2000 interior appropriations bill proposed by the president contains proviso forbidding onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home is provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families since onhir has large backlog of other familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs42 that need homes the settlement agreement approved by pl 104301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumstances to begin quietpossession actions against the united states in the year 2000 if navajo families on hopi partitioned land have not entered into leases with the hopi tribe congress has in the past been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees apparent low level of interest in moving to the new lands acquired for the navajo reservation for relocatee use appropriations committee reports in

the amount recommended by the senate and the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 did the same other related agencies one of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delineate d below is whether federal government support for the arts and culture is an appropriate federal role and if it is what should be the shape of that support if the continued federal role is not appropriate might the federal commitment be scaled back such that greater private support or state support would be encouraged each program has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue smithsonian the smithsonian institution si is museum education and research complex of 16 museums and galleries and the national zoo nine of its museums and galleries are located on the mall between the us capitol and the washington monument and si counted over 30 million visitors in 1998 the national air and space museum alone had 88 million visitors in 1998 the smithsonian is estimated to be 70 percent federally funded federal commitment was established by initial legislation in 1846 in addition to receiving federal appropriations the smithsonian has private trust funds which include endowments donations and other revenues from its memberships for smithsonian national and resident associates sales stores and magazine as well as comparable membership programs for individual facilities which are relatively autonomous in their operations eg the national air and space museum and the national zoo etc the fy2000 clinton administration budget would have provided 4474 million

for completion of construction of the national museum of the american indian nmai on the mall initially the nmai was controversial opponents of the new museum argued that the current smithsonian museums needed renovation repair and maintenance of the collection with an estimated 141 million items more than the public needed another museum on the mall proponents argued that there had been too long delay in providing museumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs43 in washington to house the indian collection private donations to the smithsonian and fundraising campaign focusing on individuals foundations and corporations totaled 367 million representing onethird of the total cost and the amount required to meet the nonappropriated portion of project funding of this amount an estimated 15 million came from the indian community directly congress asked that there be an attempt to scale down the plans and cost of the museum however the total projected cost of the american indian museum still remained at an estimated 110 million the final fy1999 interior appropriations provided 16 million for the construction of the american indian museum the groundbreaking ceremony for the nmai took

the report of the commission on the future of the smithsonian concluded that total of 50 million each year for the next decade would be necessary to assure that present facilities are restored to the point of being safe for people and collections and considering the national zoo separately it would need 10 million year for the next 5 years the fy2000 budget request included 17 million to become available october 1 2000 to complete the renovation of the american art and portrait gallery and 6 million for the national zoo repair and restoration the senate appropriations committee reported the

program grant was established in 1998 for pre and postdoctoral research in latino history art and culture using smithsonian resources the smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in 1996 and generated public programs including americas smithsonian traveling exhibit the smithsonian indicated that to offset the high cost of the traveling exhibit the si might require admission charges for other special exhibits in the smithsonian buildings on the mall although the smithsonian did not implement policy of admission charges the fact that the smithsonian was considering admission fees may be signal for the future in view of the trend toward diminished federal support the smithsonian has used bond issues for some construc tion projects including the renovation of the dulles national air

for works of art to adorn the us capitol spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts some argue that

list of priorities for some house members among the house republican leadership small group was formed called the values action team to coordinate legislative action with conservative groups eg christian coalition focus on the family and the family research council in contrast the congressional member organization for the arts cmo testified in favor of full support for the arts the presidents committee on the arts released publication creative america that recommends that federal funding be restored for nea neh and imls to levels adequate to fulfill their national roles the goal expressed was for appropriations to equal 200 per person by the year 2000 for all three agencies the controversy involving charges of obscenity concerning small number of nea individual grants still lingers in spite of attempts to resolve these problems through statutory provisions to date nea projects have been judged obscene by the courts on november 5 1996 federal appeals court upheld an earlier decision nea v finley ruling that applying the general standards of decency clause to nea grants was unconstitutional however in anticipation of congressional reaction to neas individual grants nea eliminated grants to individua ls by arts discipline except to maintain literature fellowships jazz masters and national heritage fellowships in the folk and traditional arts on june 25 1998 the supreme court reversed the federal appeals court decision for nea v finley ca9100f3d 671 by vote of 8 to 1 stating that the nea can consider general standards of decency when judging grants for artistic merit and that the decency provision does not inherently interfere with first amendment rights nor violate constitutional vagueness principles in the 105th congress the fy1998 interior appropriations act pl 10583 included nea reform measures among them was an increase in the funding allocation from 35 to 40 to states for basic state arts grants and for grants to underservedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30206crs46 populations in addition language emphasizing arts education was included the legislation placed 15 cap on nea funds allocated to each state exempting only those grants with national impact three members of the house and three members of the senate were added to the national council on the arts but the size of the national council was reduced from 26 to 20 both nea and neh were given specific authority to solicit funding and to invest those funds also in the 105th congress in june 1998 the house interior appropriations subcom mittee marked up the fy1999 interior appropriations bill recommending termination of 98 million for the national endowment for the arts nea funding was tossed back and forth the house appropriations committe restored

21 1998 the house voted 253 173 to approve an amendment to restore 98 million for the nea in fy1999 the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act provided 98 million for the nea 1107 million for neh and 23405

fy1999 appropriation on july 15 1999 the house passed the fy2000 interior appropriations bill hr 2466 allowing the same appropriation for nea neh and oms as reported by the house an amendment by

january 12 1999 the clinton administration announced an initiative that addressed many resource protection issues this initiative was included in the fy2000 budget proposal and many of its components have been incorporated in legislation introduced by senator boxer s 446 and representative miller hr 798 other broad legislative proposals that are related have been introduced by representative young hr 701 and senator landrieu s 25 hr 701 was reported by the house resources committee amended on november 10 1999 one component of the administrations proposal addressed entirely in interior appropriations is increasing federal land acquisition funding using the land and water conservation fund lwcf other components portions of which would fall under the jurisdiction of interior appropriations include 1 providing grants to states and localities to acquire land and plan for open space 2 expanding funding for other resource protection efforts including protection of farm land forest land and range land and land and resource restoration 3 funding smart growth partnerships and 4 expanding funding for ocean and coastal protection the administration estimated that these proposal s would require just over 1 billion to fully implement and projected that most of the funding 900 million would come from fully funding the lwcf at its currently authorized maximum level of 900 million almost half of these funds 413 million would be spent by federal agencies on land acquisition as shown in table 4 table 4 land and water conservation fund for federal agencies in millions

4lewis and clark trail along missouri river 5civil war battlefields including gettysburg and antietam neither the house nor the senate appropriations committees supported this overall request for fy2000 the house appropriations committee listed several troubling aspects of the proposal in the committee report including that most of the funds would not go to federal agencies there is large maintenance backlog that would not be addressed and some funds would be spent on purposes that have little to do with the activities of the federal agencies this should not be surprise as earlier on february 8 1999 representative ralph regula chairman of the interior appropriations subcommittee expressed concern about the presidents lands legacy initiative he noted that it conflicted with the subcommittees number one priority of addressing the critical backlog maintenance problems and operational shortfalls in national parks wildlife refuges national forests and other public lands totaling more than 15 billion the house provided 1595 million and earmarked most funds to specified acquisitions the administration listed several objections to this lower funding level in july 1 1999 letter to house appropriations committee chairman bill young the senate appropriations committee also rejected the administration proposal and in its report commented that the proposals would change the purposes of the lwcf in many ways if funded the committee stated that minority of the 900 million would be spent for purposes currently funded through the lwcf and called for authorizing these changes before funds are appropriated the report did state that the committee supports many existing programs that the administration proposed increased funding for but not at the proposed levels the senate provided 1979 million for the lwcf 215 million less than the administrations request the conference committee provided 2452 million to the federal agencies which was higher than either the senate or the house amounts also it provided 21 million to the stateside grant program funding it for the first time since fy1995 when the interior appropriations bill became part of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 new title vi was added to interior appropriations to provide additional funding of 1975 million for lands legacy most but not all of these funds could be used for land acquisitions of this total 81 million will go to the forest service and 1165 million to the three land acquisition agencies at the department of the interior from title vi funds alone the forest service received 61 million for the baca ranch acquisition making total of 101 million and 5 million for the forest legacy program for total of 30 million some of the earmarks in the department of the interior included an additional 20 million to the stateside grants program for total of 41 million up to 35 million for land acquisition in florida up to 195 million for acquisition of mineral rights in the grand staircaseescalante national monument in utah and an additional 5 million for maintenance in the national park system for an estimated total of 438 million in addition the law required
