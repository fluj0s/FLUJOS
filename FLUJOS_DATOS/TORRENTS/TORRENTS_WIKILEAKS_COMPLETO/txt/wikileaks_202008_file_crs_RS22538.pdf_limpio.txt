uc benefits in given week and the average weekly uc benefit amount was 291 originally the intent of the uc program among other things was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions1 this intent is reflected in the current uc programs funding and benefit structure when the economy grows uc program revenue rises through increased tax re venues while uc program spendi ng falls as fewer workers are unemployed the effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy this also creates surplus of funds or cushion of available funds for the uc program to draw upon during recession in recession uc tax revenue falls and uc program spending rises as more workers their jobs and receive uc benefits the increased amount of uc payments to unemp loyed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy other programs that may provide workers with income support are more specialized these programs may target special
