and communications containing commercial abusive or objectionable content and which are sent to peop or individuals without their consent by email fax or instant messages such as sms are considered to be spam several variants of this definition have been adopted in other countries for instance in australia spam does not have to be bulk in nature and even single unsolicited commercial ele ctronic message could be considered to be spam many regional and international organizationsbodie sworking groupsinitiatives such as wsis world summit on information society itu oecd wgig wo rking group on

with the issue of spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia as well spam has be used for phishing spreading viruses and fraud specific regulation has been issued to with spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia though other existing legislations and regulations such as the telecom act or the anti ecrime act in the kingdom could indirectly apply to spam as the telecom and it regulatory authority in saudi arabia the communications and it commission citc now plans to develop suitable framework in the kingdom of saudi arabia to address the issue of spam this assessment of antispam regulations in saudi rabia has been developed to help identify how the issue of spam is currently being addressed by t he existing saudi legislations the spam definition used in this document will be u sed for the sole purpose of this document until formal definition of spam is agreed upon in the kin gdom of saudi arabia 11 approach used our approach to meet the objective of this exercise was based on identification of relevant legislatio ns to be reviewed initially and then considering thes legislations from the perspective of the broad control requirements to address spam as well as th elements in the regulatory framework recommended by oecd in this regard 1 electronic messages that are not requested by the recipient and are of an advertising or promotional nature 2 messages that are sent in numbers exceeding pred efined threshold in predefined period of time review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 6 of 64 confidential internal use only 2 executive summary spam represents major annoyance and threat to ict applications users in general and to internet users in particular until recently internet users were the largest segment of any society to be affe cted by spam now spam is spreading into all means of co mmunications like mobile phones facsimile transmissions and spammers are always on highaler t to exploit any new technology in order for them to achieve their goals many countries region and international organizationsbodiesworking groupsinitiatives have taken steps to deal with th issue of spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia spam has been repor tedly used for phishing spreading viruses and fraud currently there is formal framework in p lace to explicitly deal with the issue in the kingdom of saudi arabia though there are differen t legislations and regulations such as the saudi telecom act and the anti ecrime act that could ind irectly apply to spam since the development of antispam legislative guid elines that tackles spam is fundamental the telecom and it regulatory authority in saudi arabia the communications and it commission citc plans to develop suitable framework in th kingdom of saudi arabia to address the issue of spam hence this report assesses the antispam reg ulations in saudi arabia and identifies how the issue of spam is currently being addressed by the xisting saudi legislations the assessment was based on consideration of the ad equacy of the relevant legislations in saudi arabia as well as benchmarking it against the elem ents in the regulatory framework recommended by oecd in this regard moreover selected recent spam related complaints and legal cases were analyzed to further understand the gaps in the curr ent antispam related legislations currently antispam legislation exists in saudi arabia in order to focus the review on the most relevant legislations the spam activity lifecycle developed for use as reference framework during the study was used to identify the most rel evant legislations key legislations identified as being of relevance in this context were3 the privacydata protection domain since the issue of consent as well as protection of email addresses and mobile numbers is central to the priv acy domain the telecom domain specifically in the context of the telecom act its bylaws and the licensing requirements of the various service provi ders which is relevant in the context of the control it exerts on the media or carriage provider s to the spammers the commercial domain in the context of consumer p rotection regulations where according to the anticommercial fraud law the ministry of c ommerce moc will be in charge of enforcing this law the banking domain specifically in the context of the banking act which falls under the responsibility of sama and the phishing related iss ues in the kingdom caused by spam and the it domain specifically in the context of the transactions act and the ecrimes law provisions in these legislations were also reviewed against provisions recommended by bodies like oecd and itu having reviewed the stated laws in the kingdom it was considered that while legislations like telecom act provided certain controls on the privac of information related to telecom service 3 the anti ecrime act and electronic transactions l aw please refer to appendix and b for detailed information about other laws and licenses please refer to citc web site at httpwwwcitcgovsa review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 7 of 64 confidential internal use only subscribers universal privacy law existed in th kingdom that ensure that data was used only for the purpose for which it was provided while the ex isting telecom act and associated licensing agreements do provide for privacy requirements the lack of suitable audit mechanism appears to have resulted in weak enforcement while the existing telecom law and its bylaws pro vide good basis for the control of telecommunication service providers in the kingdom neither it nor its bylaws address spam fully spam has not been clearly defined in any of the exi sting legislations while the anti ecrime act prohibits certain type of content in electronic mes sages it does not explicitly address the issue of unsolicited commercial messages considered to be major form of spam although licensing agreements exist with isps blue tooth message providers and bulk sms service providers significant gaps exist in the ability of the existing terms and conditions to address spam effectively the anticommercial fraud law and the anti ecrime act establish suitable basis for prosecution of spammers involved in publishing illegal content in cluding misleading and fraudulent advertisements pornographic and sexual content as well as content that breach the privacy of other individuals in the kingdom however as mentioned arlier significant gaps exist in the anti ecrime act ability to address spam since it does not for instance explicitly define spam and unsolicited commercial advertisements nature of consent requir ed and requirements for legitimate messaging while sama does provide internet banking security g uidelines there are explicit instructions published as yet on the manner in which phishing re lated issues need to be addressed by the banks both in terms of user education and awareness as w ell as reporting phishing cases indeed formal procedure for reporting phishing complaints is bein g developed currently in conjunction with the banks as are user education and awareness guideline s it is also considered that weaknesses in the anti crime act enforcement mechanism resulting from the lack of formal coordination mechanisms between moi and citc and the absence of it crime investigation specialists could limit the effectiv eness of addressing phishing crimes having also considered the existing legislations in the context of the regulatory elements recommended by oecd it is obvious that the current regulatory framework in saudi arabia falls behind the key requirements recommended by oecd to further understand the gaps three spam related complaintscases provided by citc were analyzed the analysis of these cases indicate that the lack of formal framework to address spam had resulted in none of the cases being prosecuted in court of justice and accordingly penal action was taken against the perpetrators in conclusion while the existing legislations in s audi arabia do address spam in certain aspects it is evident that significant gaps still exist in the gislative framework that still needs to be addresse d the three cases highlight the importance of being able to address spam through welldefined policy framework that encompasses regulations internation agreements welldefined enforcement mechanisms and industry initiatives review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 8 of 64 confidential internal use only 3 identification of legal domains in an earlier document we had identified the key s takeholder groups involved with either initiating r dealing with spam by reviewing the spam activity l ifecycle these stakeholder groups are shown in the figure below in order to effectively address spam within the kin gdom ideally there should be suitable guidelines that impose suitable controls on each stage of the spam activity lifecycle not just at the last stage to support the prosecution of the spam offenders thro ugh spam act accordingly we consider it important to consider t he availability in the kingdom of 1 suitable privacy or data protection act which sures that personal information obtained by various organizations in the first stage of the spa m activity lifecycle are used only for the purpose that it was obtained thus organizations re barred from using these personal details for emarketing purposes themselves or providing this in formation to other emarketing companies or spammers for the purpose of sending messages the p rivacy act would typically also address prohibition of address harvesting and dictionary at tacks needless to say this privacy requirement goes much beyond the need to address sp am and impacts number of other aspects within the kingdom 2 suitable conditions within their licensing agreemen ts or specific industry driven initiatives to prevent stakeholder groups within the third stage f the spam activity life cycle media from using their infrastructure or allowing others to us their infrastructure for the purpose of spamming this also implies that they would ensure that they would immediately deactivate the account of any subscriber found to be involved in s pamming activities the industry driven initiative such as code of conduct would apply to both stakeholders like the isps as well as emarketing companies like the bulk sms service prov iders who need to comply with optin or optout requirements this requirement for the code of conduct again goes well beyond the need to address spam and could impact number of other operational areas of these stakeholders as well 3 an antispam framework that defines spam and provi des provisions for penalties that would be enforced in the case of violations detected in t his regard an antispam framework should also identify mechanism to handle complaints pro secutions and investigations obtain details initiate spam media mail host

moi review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 9 of 64 confidential internal use only 4 it is possible that the principles of the antispam framework may be contained in full or partially in domain specific legislations related to banking it andor telecom and accordingly the banking act ecrime law etransactions act nd the telecom act may also be relevant in this regard though this is to be confirmed the figure below depicts the logic used to identify the key legal domains and the relevant regulatory bodiesstakeholders that are potentially of direct relevance in the context of the review of the relev ant legislations and enforcement 31 relevant legal domains using the above analysis we concluded that the fiv most relevant legal domains that are of direct relevance in the review of existing legislations ar 1 the privacydata protection domain 2 the telecom domain specifically in the context of the telecom act and the licensing requirements of the various service providers 3 the banking domain specifically in the context of the banking act 4 the anticommercial fraud law4 5 the it domain specifically in the context of the transactions act and

commission 5911 the commission if it deems that according t article thirty eight of the act violation has occurred may refer the matter to the violations co mmittee the telecom act provides broad framework to contr ol the key telecom service providers including the isps and the content providers eg bulk sms s ervice providers the telecom act establishes the citc as the nodal agency on all communication r elated matters the licensing agreements defined for the isps and the bulk sms service providers are driven from the telecom act 413 licensing agreements all parties wanting to provide information and comm unication technology services must obtain license from the citc in this connection citc has issued number of guidelines for those who have the desire to obtain the type b class license5 bluetooth providers internet service providers nd bulk sms service providers also need to obtain ty pe b class license and are bound by the terms and conditions stipulated in the license it is in this connection that we considered it pertinent to review the terms and conditions of these licenses lso for its relevance in addressing spam the bluetooth message providers wishing to send off ers and promote advertisements must obtain license from citc beforehand this license addresse s the privacy of the bluetooth display name and 5 the commission may issue two types of telecommunicat ions licenses pursuant to commission statutes indi vidual licenses and class licenses there shall initially be two ty pes of class licenses type and type b class lice nses the following services and networks shall unless the commission d ecides otherwise require type b class license internet service provider isp services b valueadded network services c gmpcs or global mobile personal communication rvices d public call office pco and any other service or network that the commission decides require type b class license review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 16 of 64 confidential internal use only prohibits the sending of bluetooth messages to pers ons not interested to receive these messages moreover the bluetooth provider shall keep the rec ords of the sent messages for at period of 6 months at least and ensure that their sent messages are free of viruses harmful to users equipment an d do not contradict with the shari laws morals thics general rules or conventions and not to incl ude any violation to the prevailing regulations and byl aws in the kingdom the isp licensing agreement applies to range of i nternet based services apart from isp dialup and broadband internet access and also includes intern et content publishing and internet advertising the isp licensing agreement states that among other conditions the licensee is obliged to not provide its services or worldwide web connectiv ity except through the methods determined by the citc perform and observe all controls and instruction is sued by the citc and the other concerned governmental authorities maintain the confidentiality and accounts of the bscribers 414 gap analysis the various articles in telecom act and its bylaws as well as the licensing agreements provide reasonably sound basis for some of the key principl used in controlling spam especially in terms of obliging telecom service providers to keep user information confidential protecting personal information and addressing user complaints some of the specific aspects related to obtaining c onsent prior to sending smses as well as specific controls on the isp operations have been provided i n the licensing agreements violations of the telecom act its bylaws or licensing agreements re punishable by penalties of up to sr 5 million however these measures are not considered adequate to control spam in this context it is worthwhile to consider the co des of practice and best current practice guideline s prescribed by the isp associations in the uk and au stralia examples of some of the practices recommended by them for the isps in order to contr ol spam more effectively include isps should ensure that their email systems will t relay email for unauthorized third parties isps should ensure that all email generated within their own networks can be attributed to particular customer or system and should ensure th at the immediate source of email which arrives from other networks can be determined isps should operate appropriate arrangements for th handling of reports of abuse by their customers they should publish contact details for their abuse team on their website and also ensure that ip allocation entries in regional regis tries such as ripe contain appropriate abuse team email addresses where abuse is proved the isp should take effectiv action to prevent the customer from continuing that abuse the legal basis on which ser vices are provided to customers should allow such action to be taken isps should treat use of unsolicited bulk email ub to promote secondary services as an abuse of the provision of that secondary service isps should not permit customers to distribute tool s or lists of email addresses whose purpose is the sending of ube isps should disseminate information on the action t aken in regard to customers who have sent ube review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 17 of 64 confidential internal use only isps should educate their customers on the nature f ube and should ensure that their customers have been made aware that sending ube wil l be treated as unacceptable behavior isps should inform their customers about any automa ted antispam mechanisms in operation and should educate their customers about any potent ial harmful sideeffects isps should also provide advice to their consumers detailing how they can protect themselves maawg message antiabuse working group also recom mends inclusion of terms that state within the boundaries of the appropriate legal fram ework isps and network operators must address the problem of compromised enduser equipme nt by establishing timely processes to allow such enduser equipment and network elements to be managed and eliminated as sources of spam isps and network operators utilize industry standar d technology to authenticate their email andor their sources isps and network operators should block potentially infecting email file attachments in the case of filtering email or email file attachments b ased on content properties in the context of any required legislation prior agreement is to be ttained from the customer isps and network operators actively monitor the vol ume of inbound and outbound email traffic to determine unusual network activity and the sourc of such activity and respond appropriately isps and network operators establish appropriate in tercompany processes for reacting to other network operators incident reports also accepting end user complaints isps network operators and enterprise email provid ers should communicate their security policies and procedures to their subscribers isps and network operators attempt to send nondeli very notices ndns only for messages originated by their own account holders isps and network operators take measures to ensure that only their account holders use their mail submit servers isps and network operators ensure that all domain n ames domain name system dns records and applicable internet protocol ip addre ss registration records eg whois shared whois project swip or referral whois rwhois ar responsibly maintained with correct complete and current information and that this information includes points of contact for roles responsible for resolving abuse issues in cluding but not limited to postal address phone number and email address isps and network operators ensure that all their pu blicly routable and internetvisible ip addresses have appropriate and uptodate forward nd reverse dns records and whois and swip entries that all local area network lan operators are com pliant with request for comments rfcs 1918 address allocation for private internets and that in particular lans do not use ip space globally registered to someone else or ip sp ace not registered to anyone as private ip space inclusion of such conditions in the telecom act it s bylaws licensing agreements or in separate spam related isp code of conduct that the isps need to abide by will enable better control on the initiation and spread of spam through media like th isps review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 18 of 64 confidential internal use only it should be noted that while citc has strong reg ulatory framework in place in most cases the lack of periodic audits has resulted in weaknesses in t he implementation of the frameworks this also applies to the isps licensing agreements 415 controlling em arketing service providers in order to address spam effectively it is imperat ive that suitable control be imposed on the activit ies of emarketing service providers including bluetoot h messages providers and bulk sms service providers through regulatory guidelines and other means the special terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service addresses the licensing conditions for the bulk sms service provi ders key conditions included in these terms and conditions include message shall be sent to the subscriber without his approval all ads andor promotional materials for the servic shall contain numbers allocated only for the service advertised also the cost of the messa ge shall be written clearly and shown in the video ads so that the beneficiaries can have adequ ate information before obtaining the services any message shall be sent through licensed message centers and telecommunication networks in the kingdom coordination shall be made with licensed telecommun ication network operators within the kingdom to use their networks within the kingdom in sending the bulk short messages to subscribers outside the kingdom licensee shall be responsible for any legal or fina ncial consequences that may be incurred by the operator if the licensee breaches the internat ional agreements governing the relation between the internal operators and the operators ou tside the kingdom such as gsm association aa19 agreement for messaging between international opera tors if the service provider is to use the internet in s ending and receiving the messages all servers shall be based in the kingdom the service shall not be used as means for the co llection of amounts due for other services such as the internet subscription fees without pri or permission from the citc these conditions do impose significant constraints on the bulk sms service providers ability to send spam messages provided its implementation is suita bly monitored through periodic audits however it should be noted that key gaps that exist relate to controls on the process used for obtaining user consent the process used for maintaining user consent recor ds inclusion of accurate information about sendersmes sage authorizers provision and operation of functional unsubscribe facility sending commercial electronic messages about age nsitive material and complaints handling it is useful to consider practices used in other co untries in this regard particularly the

these gaps are addressed suitably either through incorporation of these clauses in the licensing agreement or throug h suitable emarketing code of conduct there are si gnificant limitations on the extent of control that can be imposed on the emarketing companies it is also imperative that in conjunction with the tightening of controls of the licensing terms and conditions that suitable audit

accounts username and password it would not be possible to transfer the money in the account to an other account easily since creation of new beneficiary takes 2448 hours in most cases it sig nificantly limits the ability to transfer funds immediately limiting the impact of phishing atta ck based on discussions with sama officials we were i nformed that formal procedure for reporting phishing complaints is being developed currently in conjunction with the banks as are user education and awareness guidelines it was considered that phishing attacks particular ly if it has not resulted in financial crime wou ld be addressed by the newly promulgated anti ecrime act though it was considered imperative to strengthen the anti ecrime act enforcement mechani sm without which the effectiveness the law could be limited in this connection it is useful to consider that rticle 4 of the anti ecrime act stipulates that any person who commits any of the following c rimes shall be punished by imprisonment for 3 years maximum and fine of more than sr 2 milli on or either one of them 1 take possession for himself or for third party t hrough an information network computer or

according to the existing situation there is we ll defined and documented process in place for handling complaints phishing attacks are typically reported by banks to sama initially who then report it

prov isions in the law that are focused on controlling aspects related to spam though there are suitable provisions against specific types of fraud for instance the etransactions act provides protection against impersonation of another persons identity review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 23 of 64 confidential internal use only forgery of electronic signatures or digital certifi cates etc as well as unauthorized access into syste ms for the purpose of misusing such certificates 45 anti ecrime act the anti ecrime act aims at creating legal and reg ulatory standards to combat information computer and internet crimes through specifying determining the relevant crimes and punitive actions for each crime or violation in order to achieve the followi ng 1 maintain information security 2 safeguard the rights associated with legitimate use of computers and networks 3 safeguard public interests morals and communal va lues 4 develop and safeguard the national economy while the anti ecrime act does not specifically or fully address spam it does address certain aspects of spam including aspects relating to usin g spam for phishing purposes spreading viruses or publishing content that could be considered detr imental to the kingdoms economy or security offensive to its religious values and morals or co ntrary to the privacy of resident individuals article 3 provides for suitable punishment for phis hing related crimes and states that any pers on who commits any of the following crimes shall be pu nished by imprisonment for 3 years maximum and fine of more than sr 2 million or either one of them 1 take hold for himself or for third party through an information network computer or similar means of cash money or voucher or signin g such

punishment will be imprisonment fo r 3 years review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 24 of 64 confidential internal use only thus while we believe that the anti ecrime act est ablishes suitable basis for prosecution of spammers involved in publishing pornography conten t considered offensive to the kingdoms economy or security as well as content considered i nappropriate to the religious and moral values and also the use of spam for phishing or spreading harm ful viruses and other malware it does not address the definition of spam including the requirement f or the users consent to receive such messages the prosecution of spammers involved in sending uns olicited commercial advertisements on the assumption that the users consent is require ment for sending such commercial messages and advertisements the minimum requirements that messages containing c ommercial advertisements need to comply with including the need to include provis ion for unsubscribing from such messages it should also be noted that the anti ecrimes act is focused on the prosecution of personnel and entities involved in such activities operating fro m saudi arabia accordingly as with other such law s the anti ecrime act is unlikely to be able to addr ess the spam that might have originated in another country 46 conclusion having reviewed laws in the kingdom considered to b relevant in the context of addressing spam and its effects it was concluded that there is privacy law in the kingdom to contro l the misuse of emails and mobile numbers obtained for specific purposes by organizations in kingdom for the purpose of spamming it is proposed that the newly established unit with in the general security forces specialized in fighting ecrimes should be addressing the issue of trading and exchanging contact details in black markets as part of its duties while the existing telecom law and its bylaws pro vide good basis for the control of telecommunication service providers in the kingdom neither it nor its bylaws address spam fully while licensing agreements exist with isps nd bulk sms service providers there are significant gaps in the terms and conditions in the context of its ability to address spam fully the electronic transaction law was not considered d irectly relevant to the spam issue while the anti ecrimes act does deal with certain aspects of spam particularly in relation to sending of offensive messages from content perspe ctive spreading viruses and phishing it falls short of addressing the spam issue fully in t hat it does not explicitly define and deal with spam does not explicitly deal with specific forms of spa m such as fax spam does not explicitly indicate if explicit implicit or inferred consent of the receiver is requirement for sending commercial advertisement m essages does not stipulate if unsolicited commercial messag can be considered spam does not state the minimum requirements for legitim ate commercial messages such as the unsubscribe option for users to request the sender not to send such spam anymore review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 25 of 64 confidential internal use only does not specify the penalties for sending or causi ng to send unsolicited commercial messages if this was to be considered spam in order to illustrate this gap further we have co nsidered the key requirements specified by oecd to comprehensively deal with spam in reg ulatory framework these include specific consideration of technical elements while controls on emarketing through smses have bee n partially addressed in the general and specific terms and conditions of type b class lic ense for bulk sms service such controls have been imposed on emarketing sending of commerc ial messages through emails or faxes clause 11 section 37 of the telecom acts prohibits the m isuse of telecom service to cause annoyance but does not explicitly define what could be considered annoyance consent in its antispam regulation document published in n ovember 2005 oecds task force on spam introduced consent as fundamental consideration in developing antispam legislations number of conceptual frameworks have been utilized in rela tion to consent including optin and optout models and provisions that allow for consent to be inferred where there is preexisting relationship while the general and specific terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service explicitly specify that consent of the rece iver is required before sending commercial messages to them such stipulations have been made in any of the existing legislations in the context of emarketing through emails faxes or other means privacy according to oecds task force on spam the term pr ivacy is generally linked to that of use of personal data depending on the jurisdiction perso nal data may be considered to include information such as addresses email and otherwise personal preferences and data such as agemedical conditions of individual natural persons while privacy act has been legislated in the kin gdom various aspects of privacy have been dealt with separately in various legislations for instan ce article 40 of the basic law of governance in the ki ngdom of saudi arabia states that correspondence by telegraph and mail telephone versations and other means of communication shall be protected they may not be s eized delayed viewed or listened to except in cases set forth in the law article 6 of the newly enacted anti ecrime act in the kingdom provides for up to five years in prison and fine of up to 3 million riyals for breaching personal privacy by illegally sending private information about individuals usi ng data networks the telecom bylaw in its clause 1 of article 56 co nfidentiality of user information prohibits telecom service providers from disclosing users information except the user s name address and listed phone number to anyone without the writt consent of the user this implies that all other information about the user stored by the serv ice provider shall be kept private however there is law which explicitly prohibits the use of personal information such as addresses email and otherwise personal preferences and d ata such as agemedical conditions of individual natural persons from being used for purposes other than the purpose for which it was collected by any organization in the kingdom including emarketing s ervice providers review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 26 of 64 confidential internal use only commercial elements the majority of spam is sent in order to achieve profit through the sale of goods of services or through some sort of fraud arguably one of the be tter ways of reducing spam is to reduce the economic benefits that the spammer receives from nding spam messages for this reason many legislative definitions of spam stress the commerci nature of spam that spam is sent for marketing purposes or to achieve financial gain accordingly it is important that emarketing or sen ding of commercial messages through any electronic media should be suitably regulated at t his point while the general and special terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms s ervice providers do impose some restrictions there are such constraints imposed on emarketing through other means including emails bluetooth instant messaging im and faxes bulk in keeping with the oecd recommendations some spam regulators specify threshold beyond which messages emails sms or fax sent above thi s cutoff point are designated as spam other regulators like the acma in australia do not make particular reference to bulk messaging thereby allowing that even single unsolicited commercial electronic message could be spam while clause 11 section 37 of the telecom acts pro hibits the misuse of telecom service to cause annoyance it does not explicitly the threshold bey ond which emarketing messages could be considered an annoyance since spam mails have not been dealt with explicitly in any legislation and other qualification regarding the threshold beyond which the sender could be considered to be sending spam messages has been provided in any oth er legislation it is not clear if this could be construed to imply that even single unsolicited lectronic message could be considered to be spam content according to oecd one of the main concerns of the community and regulatory bodies is the illicit content of considerable amount of spam includin g those that promote pornography illegal online gambling services pyramid schemes getrichquick schemes or misleading and deceptive business practices the stateless nature of messages has led to it being used to convey commercial offers and other content of dubious nature often with the t rue origin of the message disguised the indiscriminate method of distribution is of particu lar concern as it is common for minors to receive spam that is pornographic illegal or offensive in the kingdom of saudi arabia content of the mess ages is of additional concern especially if it contradicts the religious and moral values of the k ingdom gambling pornography drugs and alcohol are strictly prohibited in the kingdom while the anticommercial fraud law deals with the content of the message if it is of fraudulent and misleading nature the anti ecrime act effectively deals with messages considered to be offensive to the kingdoms security or economy as well as religi ous or moral values the anti ecrime act also prohibits the sending of any kind of pornographic r obscene messages or promotes gambling alcohol drugs or the methods to smuggle and utiliz these substances damage threat and annoyance spam causes harm to wide range of parties and sys tems the costs to the victims of spam vary from systemic point of view damage may be done b spam that effects denial of service to parties or by spam that is used as vehicle for ther malicious tools for example viruses this systemic damage imposes costs in relation to infras tructure human resources and in terms of opportunity cost when systems are damaged secondly the cost of spam can be measured in terms of focus on the content of the spam review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 27 of 64 confidential internal use only while damage and threat are clearly addressed in ar ticle 3 of the anti ecrime act annoyance is not defined also section 37 of the telecom act prohibi t the use of technology to cause annoyance to others however the term annoyance is not defined and it remains ambiguous what is meant by annoyance the use of emails sms messages and fax to cause d amage threat or annoyance can now be prosecuted under article 3 of the ecrime law ann oyance is not defined or quantified but can still be considered under invasion of privacy or causing dam age to the others also other form of threat and damage like spreadin g viruses can be prosecuted under article 5 of the anti ecrime act that prohibits the use of the info rmation systems and information networks to disrupt or interrupt the work of the information network r destroy delete erase disclose damage or alter software or data used by or stored in the network requirements for legitimate messaging legitimate messages are sent through the same messa ging media as spam according to oecd recommendations unless there is desire to cease use of messaging media or prevent its use for commercial transactions then any response to spam also needs to define what messaging is appropriate and lawful while the special terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service impose the use of the senders name clear price of the serv ices promoted and an option to unsubscribe from those messages these conditions are only applicabl to bulk sms operating under license from citc such conditions exist for emarketing throu gh emails im bluetooth or faxes exemptions and restrictions exemptions and restrictions are subject to the defi nition of spam spam must be defined and according to the definition of spam some content c ould be exempted from antispam regulations by example messages containing religious content indeed the solicitation of monetary contribution through bulk communications has been prohibited as per recent directive while the existing legislations do address spam in certain aspects it is evident that significant gap s still exist in the legislative framework within the kingdom that still needs to be addressed review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 28 of 64 confidential internal use only 5 review of legal cases the purpose of this review was to consider the mann er in which selected recent spam related complaints and legal cases were dealt with specifi cally from the perspective of analyzing the gaps in the current antispam related legislations and regu lations that might have hampered the prosecution of the offending parties 51 approach used the three cases provided by citc for the purpose f the review involved different types of complaints none of the three cases had been prosec uted in court of justice and penal action was taken against the perpetrators we reviewed the cas to identify the gaps that prevented the indicate d prosecution from reaching the specialized courts of justice each of the three cases was addressed separately by considering the nature of the case presented as an executive summary of each case the approach taken to handle the case this sectio n looks at the various steps taken during the prosecution process investigations forensics etc the action taken this section describes the actio n taken by citc against the alleged offender in each case the analysis of the cases focused on gaps in the ex isting legislations that hampered the prosecution 52 case1 email spam case by microsoft against sahara nature of the case microsoft saudi arabia filed complaint with citc against sahara aljazeerah an isp registered in the kingdom of saudi arabia and licensed to provide internet and bulk sms services in the kingdom of saudi arabia by citc microsoft claimed that the ir spamtrap mailboxes captured number of spam emails sent by sahara aljazeerah on behalf of giant stores in the kingdom of saudi arabia the emails contained link to the giant stores s audi arabia website the messages were sent by sahara without the consent of microsoft and involve d use of different domain owned by sahara jazeerah to send the spam messages the emails did not have clear return email address nor an unsubscribe option microsoft used an international forensics company t trace the originator of the email the forensics investigation linked the email to sahara aljazeera h locally registered isp in the kingdom of saudi arabia microsoft then filed complaint with citc through their lawyers in the kingdom of saudi arabia along with copy of the forensic investigation rep ort the approach taken citc undertook the investigation of the case the vidence provided by microsoft was considered in detail representative from sahara aljazeerah was called in by citc for questioning the representative admitted the companys responsibility for sending t he emails which was found to have been sent out in bulk to email addresses obtained using an email harvesting software review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 29 of 64 confidential internal use only the investigation report filed by citc stated tha t this case could only be prosecuted under clause 11 section 37 of the telecom act by considering i t case of misuse of telecom to cause annoyance however since the term annoyances had not bee n clearly defined in the telecom act and was considered to be ambiguous it could not be applied to this case this was particularly so ce such emails were sent out only 23 times month the action taken since it was not possible to consider the complaint an offence under any of the existing legislations or regulations citc recommended that sahara aljazeer ah be made to sign commitment paper confirming that they would refrain from sending sim ilar messages in the future the citc legal department send the report and the r elated recommendation to the committee of arbitration and dispute resolution in telecom relat ed matters the committee was requested to revert within stated period in case they did not agree with the recommendation since the committee did not revert with contradicting decision within the stated notice period the case was considered closed by the legal department analysis the messages sent by sahara aljazeerah satisfy mos t of the conditions used most commonly to define spam mails particularly the mail was unsolicited the complainant did not pt to receive mails of this nature from sahara aljazeerah the mail did not have clear return email addresses sahara aljazeerah masked the real originating email address and instead used another email address in the senders field the mail was commercial in nature the emails sent were promotional in nature and were aimed at making financial gain to the beneficiary giant stores the mails were sent out in bulk sahara aljazeerah s representative admitted sending these commercial email to large list of email addresses even though these type of emails were sent out only once or twice every month the mails used harvested address lists either direc tly or using dictionary attacks the companys representative admitted using email hunt er an email harvesting software to compile the list of email addresses to which the co mmercial emails were sent the mails did not have an unsubscribe link the mai ls did not have an optout link as documented in the investigation report however since there is legal definition of spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia the emails sent by sahara aljazeerah could not formally be classif ied as spam as identified by citc while clause 11 section 37 of the telecom act prohibits misuse of technology to cause annoyance the definition of annoyance is not clear and as such it was not clea r if such emails could be considered to be an annoyan ce and if so the threshold number of emails that would qualify as an annoyance with some exceptions the laws in saudi arabia do n ot explicitly prohibit the sending of specific type s of content in messages be it commercial financial political or other types of content the excepti ons relate to the use of electronic means to threaten r blackmail others while the need for consent of the users before send ing commercial messages has been addressed for sms messages in the sms service providers obligati ons within the special terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service none f the existing laws or regulations in the review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 30 of 64 confidential internal use only kingdom insist on the need to obtain the consent of the users before sending commercial email or fax messages while protection of user information and nondisclo sure of users private information by telecom service providers to third parties is provided in s ections 56 57 and 58 of the citc bylaw and articl 10 of the class b licensing conditions there are n stipulations in any of the telecom or other laws that prohibit the use of email harvesting software to obtain email addresses for the purpose of emarketing furthermore while clause 10 article 10 of class b services licensing conditions prohibits the use of subscribers telephone numbers for use in advertising campaigns it does not prohibit use of other personal information such as email addresses to do so law in the kingdom currently stipulates that com mercial messages sent by email sms fax or other means should clearly include the senders addr ess or an unsubscribe option the current laws contain penal codes for misuse of technology breach of telecom act breach of crime law and breach of citc bylaws and licensing conditions these penalties could be in the form of fines withdrawal of licenses or any other penal ty decided by the committee of arbitration and dispute resolution within citc but since this case does not satisfy the conditions of misuse of technology penal action could be taken against sahara aljazeerah 53 case2 mobile spam nature of the case the case was filed with citc by user with compl aint related to the receipt of unsolicited sms messages on his mobile containing links to premium charge dating numbers outside the kingdom of saudi arabia the dating numbers connected callers to live chat room with various other users connected from within saudi arabia and other countr ies to exchange obscene chats the complainant said that he was not able to optou t of receiving such messages and asked the commission to intervene and prevent such messages f rom reaching his and other mobiles in the kingdom specifically because the sms messages coul d be sent to mobiles owned by minors and that the disturbing and extremely obscene nature of the chat rooms was not suitable for minors and contradicted local and islamic values of the kingdo m of saudi arabia the cost of calling the premium rate number had als not been indicated clearly by the advertiser saudi telecom did not respond to citcs request to identify the sender of the message the approach taken since the message was sent from place that was ou tside the jurisdiction of the laws of the kingdom of saudi arabia and did not contain link to pr emium rate number in saudi arabia it was considered that the laws of saudi arabia could not be applied to either the initiator or the beneficia ry of the revenue generated from sending similar messa ges the action taken citc did not file an investigation report in this c ase entity was prosecuted and there was involvement from lawyers or courts citc consulted with both mobile operators in the ki ngdom on what could be done to prevent such cases the mobile operators indicated that while th types of messages could not be stopped completely few technical measures could be imple mented to filter messages based on their content joining international treaties eg aa19 agreemen ts in this regard would also help limit the damage caused by similar messages review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 31 of 64 confidential internal use only citc requested saudi telecom to identify the source of similar messages and to take suitable action to block content of similar nature in the future saud i telecom confirmed that they had taken suitable action to block all messages coming from that bulk sms service provider in the future and also were in the process of implementing certain technical asures to filter messages containing content considered obscene or going against the religious nd social values of the kingdom of saudi arabia they did not respond with the identity of the sende r analysis the sms messages sent from outside the kingdom agai n satisfy most of the conditions used most commonly to define spam mails particularly since the messages were unsolicited the complainant did not opt to receive smses of this nature from the party sending such messages the messages were commercial in nature the message s sent were promotional in nature and were aimed at making financial gain to the benefici ary the owner of the premium rate number the messages appeared to have been sent out in bulk the messages were not personalized and as such appeared to have been sent out in bulk the messages did not have an unsubscribe option it was not possible for the person receiving such messages to request the sender not to send suc h messages however since there is legal definition of spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia the messages sent by the bulk sms sender could not formally be c lassified as spam it would have been possible to initiate action agai nst bulk sms service provider or the beneficiary involved in such activities if the service provider or beneficiary had been based in saudi arabia ce the sms service providers obligations within the s pecial terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service stipulate that message shall be sent to the subscriber without his approval all ads andor promotional materials for the servic shall contain numbers allocated only for the service advertised also the cost of the messa ge shall be written clearly and shown in the video ads so that the beneficiaries can have adequ ate information before obtaining the services any message shall be sent through licensed message centers and telecommunication networks in the kingdom if the service provider is to use the internet in s ending and receiving the messages all servers shall be based in the kingdom etc while clause 11 section 37 of the telecom act pro hibits misuse of technology to cause annoyance the definition of annoyance is not cl ear and as such it is not clear if such messages could be considered to be an annoyance and if so t he threshold number of emails that would qualify as an annoyance since the bulk sms sender in this case is based utside the kingdom and outside the jurisdiction of its laws it would only have been possible to prose cutepenalize them for sending spam if the kingdom had spam related agreement with the count ry in which the sender was operating in however since the kingdom does not have any such s pam related agreement in place currently it was not possible to prosecutepenalize the sender if it were possible to trace the manner in which th spammer obtained the mobile numbers to local bulk sms service provider or to local telecom ope rator it would have been possible to penalize the local bulk sms service provider or to the local tel ecom operator since article 56 of the telecom review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 32 of 64 confidential internal use only bylaws states that service

case this case was filed at citc by saudi telecom user complaining that he had repeatedly received an sms on his mobile containing link to local 700 number the sms invited him to participate in general knowledge competition and win various prize s including cars and cash after receiving the invitation number of times th user decided to participate by calling the advertised premium rate number following number of calls to the advertised number apart from not winning anything his phone bill reached 5000 riyal s and his line was disconnected the user registered complaint with citc on the gr ounds that 3 the company that sent the messages was not identifi ed in the message 4 the huge number of messages sent inviting him to pa rticipate caused him significant annoyance 5 the competition probably did not offer any prizes and instead only sought to make illegal financial gains from the premium rates by making th users repetitively call their 700 numbers the approach taken upon receiving the complaints by the user citc ope ned an in investigation on the matter and called in the 700 services licensees representative for q uestioning the investigation determined that the promotional s ms messages were being sent from outside saudi arabia when interviewed the 700 services licensee s representative denied all allegations about sending bulk sms messages to promote their services both directly from inside saudi arabia or by hiring cross border service provider he also cla imed those messages could be sent by competitors to damage his companys reputation the companys representative also stated that his c ompany had been using provisionally allotted 700 number for the purpose of competitions however th ey have recently stopped all further competitions using their provisional 700 number since the forma l approval for the 700 number is still pending the action taken citc decided that they were not able to prosecute t he 700 service licensee under the existing laws of the kingdom specifically the telecom act and its s ubsequent bylaws citc decided not to take the case any further part icularly since the company also confirmed that they longer offered competitions using the 700 servic number analysis clearly the messages sent to the user fall within the commonly used definition of spam since it involved sending of unsolicited messages to the user sending of messages that were promotional and comme rcial in nature given the lack of personalization of the messages it could be assumed that the messages were sent out in bulk since the sms service providers obligations in the special terms and conditions of type b class license for bulk sms service states that messag shall be sent to the subscriber without his approval it would have been possible to prosecute the bulk sms service provider if it were local bulk sms service provider review of current legislations and selected legal c ases final version page 34 of 64 confidential

current laws in the kingdom including the ccri act as well as the telecom act and its bylaws do not address the issue of spam in its entirety g iven the lack of formal definition of spam in the kingdom it is not even possible to classify unsoli cited messages as spam in most instances while certain requirements have been addressed with in the licensing agreements eg the need for users consent before sending unsolicited commercia l sms messages to them specific penalties have been defined within the licensing agreements r other law in the kingdom other than possible withdrawal of the license while the telecom act contains some conditions that could be used to prosecute perpetrators for offences that are similar to spam in nature throug h the inclusion of term on misuse of telecom facilities for causing annoyance it does not pro vide the proper definition or metrics to measure an d identify what could be considered an annoyance while the telecom act does provide for privacy of p ersonal information of subscribers of the telecom firm there is provision in any other law that p revents misuse of personal information for purposes other than the purpose it was collected by any agen cy the lack of international agreements to prosecute s ervice providers who send unsolicited commercial or objectionable messages from other countries has also encouraged companies to send such promotional messages from other countries it is important to address the problem in its entir ety through the use of effective legislations tha t cover the issue in its entirety
