defense and trade division july 26 2006 abstract in announcing the eus decision to reimpose sanctions peter mandelson the eus top trade official said that the eu will not accept system of tax benefits which give us exporters including boeing unfair advantage against their european competitors the eu had planned to reimpose the sanctions on may 16 2006 but congress passed on may 11 2006 tax bill which among other things repealed the grandfathered fsceti benefits for sales contracts and leases subsequently the eu repealed the countermeasures thus ending one of the longestrunning and most bitter transatlantic trade dispute in recent years this report describes the eu action within the context of the wto evaluates the old eu retaliation list and the outcome order code rs21742 updated july 26 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web european trade retaliation the fsceti case raymond j ahearn specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21742 foreign sales corporations fscs are subsidiaries of us companies that conduct export sales on the behalf of their parents and the eti is successor tax regime the fsc law initially was found to be inconsistent with us wto obligations in early 2000 following the ruling congress passed the replacement eti tax provision but this law was also found inconsistent with wto obligations in 2002 subsequently the wto authorized the eu to retaliate in the absence of us compliance and the eu began imposing escalating retaliatory duties starting at 5 on 4 billion of us exports on march 1 2004 after reaching 14 in december 2004 these sanctions were lifted in january 2005 subsequent to congressional repeal of the fsceti provisions in the american jobs creation act pl 108357 of october 2004 but february 12 2006 wto ruling determined that the act perpetuated the illegal subsidies with twoyear phaseout of the tax breaks and grandfather clause covering exporters that had sales contracts dated before september 17 2003 in announcing the eus decision to reimpose sanctions peter mandelson the eus top trade official said that the eu will not accept system of tax benefits which give us exporters including boeing unfair advantage against their european competitors the eu had planned to reimpose the sanctions on may 16 2006 but congress passed on may 11 2006 tax bill which among other things repealed the grandfathered fsceti benefits for sales contracts and leases subsequently the eu repealed the countermeasures thus ending one of the longestrunning and most bitter transatlantic trade dispute in recent years this report describes the eu action within the context of the wto evaluates the old eu retaliation list and the outcome the report will be not be updated trade retaliation and the wto the initial round of retaliatory tariffs implemented by the eu stemmed from delay by the united states to comply with wto rulings the wto found that us tax legislation relating to export income constituted an unacceptable export subsidy under the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures when the wto arbitrator determined on august 30 2002 that the eu could impose tariffs on 4 billion an amount roughly equal to the annual value of the us export subsidy of us exports eu officials congressional research service the library of congress crs2 indicated they would not apply the tariffs as long as the united states was making progress towards wto compliance however upon receiving final wto authorization to retaliate on may 7 2003 eu officials stated they would begin imposing tariffs by january 1 2004 if the repeal of these tax provisions was not signed into law by then in november 2003 eu officials again delayed the imposition of the retaliatory tariffs until march 1 2004 provided that congress passed legislation to bring the united states into compliance with its wto obligations when there was floor action on bills introduced to bring the us into compliance the eu on march 1 2004 began imposing retaliatory duties starting at 5 on 40 billion of us exports1 subsequently the senate passed its eti repeal bill s 1637 by vote of 925 on may 11 2004 and the house passed its bill hr 4520 by vote of 251178 on june 17 in october 2004 conference agreement was reached and president bush signed the bill which became known as the american jobs creation act into law pl 108357 as result the eu suspended retaliation effective january 1 2005 but moved to challenge the legality of certain provisions transitional arrangements for its abolition and the grandfathering benefits for us corporations that had already signed contracts in the repeal in early 2006 the wtos appellate body agreed with an earlier compliance panel httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21742 that the us repeal legislation failed to comply with its wto obligations because of the grandfathering and twoyear transition period under which the fsceti benefits would be phased out on january 31 2006 the eu adopted regulation 1712005 providing for the reimposition of retaliatory duties by may 16 2006 but the countermeasures were never imposed due to the fact that congress as part of the may 11 2006 tax increase prevention and reconciliation act repealed the grandfathered fsceti benefits this trade dispute was fought out under the auspices of the wtos dispute settlement understanding dsu according to the dsu wto member found to have violated wto obligations is expected to comply by withdrawing or eliminating the offending measure if the complaining party believes that the other member has not complied by the end of the compliance period it may negotiate compensation agreement or it may ask the dispute settlement body for authorization to suspend concessions usually the imposition of higher duties on items from the other country the purpose of suspension of concessions which is referred to interchangeably as retaliation or countermeasures is to restore the balance of concessions that existed before the adoption of the rule or provision that had been nullified as well as to serve as an incentive for compliance2 since the wto went into effect in 1995 the united states has imposed retaliatory duties on eu exports in two cases bananas and beef in both cases after many years of litigation the wto found in favor of us petitions alleging that an eu import ban on beef treated with hormones and system of import quotas for bananas were discriminatory and violated wto rules in 1999 eu offers of compensation for lost exports in lieu of lifting its beef hormone ban or changing its banana regime were rejected 1 for background and summary of this dispute see crs report rs20746 export tax benefits and the wto the extraterritorial income exclusion and foreign sales corporations by david l brumbaugh 2 for elaboration see crs report rl32014 wto dispute settlement status of us compliance in pending cases by jeanne j grimmett crs3 by the united states and 100 tariffs were imposed on 307 million 191 million for the banana case and 116 million for the beef case of imports from the eu principally luxury products such as danish ham truffles roquefort cheese and italian handbags exports from britain spain and france were mostly targeted in the banana case and exports from france germany italy and denmark in the beef case because these countries were deemed most responsible and supportive of the discriminatory policy in the respective cases3 although the united states in 2002 lifted the 100 retaliatory duties related to the banana case after changes in eu policy the tariff on beef remains in effect today matter of considerable continuing dispute between the two sides for its part the eu came to the brink of imposing retaliatory tariffs in reaction to president bushs march 2002 decision to provide the us steel industry with safeguard tariff protection claiming that this action violated the wto safeguard agreement the eu won its challenge before the wto and was prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs against 2 billion in us exports in drawing up its retaliation list the eu targeted goods made in states that are considered swing states in the presidential election as shown in table 1 us sectors on eu 2002 steel retaliation list categories of steel textiles and apparel citrus found in the vegetables edible fruits and nuts category and fruit juice httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21742 accounted for 53 of the total trade targeted ohio pennsylvania and west virginia are prominent steel producing states the carolinas prominent textile and apparel producing states and florida prominent citrus producing state california also is large citrus producer but exports relatively small amount to europe fsc retaliation list unlike the steel dispute congress not the president has to take action to bring us law into conformity with wto obligations in order to settle the fsceti case perhaps with this important difference in mind the eu drew up retaliation list that appeared much more diffuse in terms of geographic impact on producers and states than in the steel case where retaliation was concentrated in few states arguably pivotal to next novembers presidential election the list tilted heavily towards large number of products that seemingly could be made just about anywhere in the united states the list also excluded politically sensitive products such as citrus fruits orange and grapefruit juice cigarettes apples and rice that were on the steel list steel and textile and apparel products were also targeted less heavily to avoid disruption to eu production the list was also skewed towards consumer goods rather than component parts or intermediate goods as shown in table 2 us sectors on eu 2003 fsceti retaliation list the precious stones and jewelry sector was most heavily targeted accounting for 36 of the total trade targeted but less than 3 of total us exports to the eu this sector consists of products such as diamonds gold silver base metals and jewelry major jewelry producing states included new york massachusetts rhode island and to lesser extent california florida texas new mexico and new jersey 3 higher tariffs are intended to increase the cost of targeted items to consumers and thus lead to declining purchases companies and workers hurt by declining sales in turn could be expected to lobby their representatives for change in policy crs4 the next four sectors impacted most heavily machinery and mechanical appliances wood and paper articles leather and leather articles and toys and sports equipment account for 35 of the total targeted trade products listed from these sectors also could be made in many different states and regions of the united states for example in the machinery and mechanical appliances sector products such as piston engines hydraulic turbines refrigerators household scales cranes forklift trucks and machine tools are included the wood and paper products sector includes products such as particle board building materials plywood wood panels paper and paperboard wallpaper toilet paper note books and unused postage stamps the leather sector comprises products such as raw hides and skins and articles of leather such as handbags briefcases and gloves and the toys and sports equipment sector includes such items as doll carriages dolls electric trains billiard tables cross country and downhill skis tennis racquets and balls ice skates and fishhooks as shown in table 3 major us sectors excluded from eu 2003 fsceti retaliation list sectors totally left off the retaliation list account for close to 40 of us exports to the eu in addition exports from the two largest us export sectors machinery and electrical machinery were targeted minimally less than 1 billion of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21742 49 billion in exports from these sectors as these latter two sectors account for 34 of us exports to the eu it can be seen that close to 75 of us exports to the eu were basically non targeted the nontargeted sectors are characterized by massive amounts of crossinvestment and intraindustry trade that integrates markets tightly trade data for example show that the seven largest categories of us exports to the eu machinery electrical machinery optical equipment aircraft vehicles organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals are also among the top nine categories of imports from the eu these seven sectors accounted for 70 of us exports to the eu and 61 of imports from the eu in 20024 many of the products in these key sectors such as aircraft parts auto parts and chemicals are components in products that eu companies export back to the us or components in products that european subsidiaries of us companies use in their production process other items such as optical devices and medical equipment may not necessarily be produced in the eu most of the exports from the machinery and mechanical appliances and electrical machinery sectors were left off the list as well due perhaps to similar concerns about hurting or disrupting eu producer interests outcome if congress had not acted on may 11 2006 to repeal the grandfathered fsceti tax benefits the eu planned to reimpose the sanctions by may 16 2006 given the value of the tax breaks that remained at the time the eu reportedly planned to reimpose sanctions 14 additional tariff on 24 billion of us exports an amount of retaliation that would yield around an additional 330 million this tariff rate would not be raised over time unlike the previous fsc retaliation revoked after congress repealed the fsc in 2004 the eu added new tariff items to the 2005 retaliation list but some products 4 data from the world trade atlas subscription trade statistics database was compiled by j michael donnelly information research specialist crs crs5 codes were eliminated from the 2003 list eu regulation 1712005 adopted january 31 2005 contains the revised list the eus plan to reimpose sanctions aroused strong us reaction the office of the us trade representative issued statement urging the eu not to reimpose sanctions and argued that new sanctions will reinforce the perception that the eu is primarily acting in response to the us filing of wto complaint against airbus subsidies senate finance committee chairman charles grassley stated that the europeans seemed to have appreciated and accepted our compliance efforts until we raised the issue of airbus subsidies in the wto the blatant linkage of wto disputes is dangerous precedent but after president bush signed on may 17 2006 the repeal of the grandfathered tax provisions into law the eu countermeasures were definitively repealed as announced in commission notice published in the official journal 2006c 12607 on may 30 2006 thus ended one of the longest running and most bitter transatlantic trade disputes in recent years
