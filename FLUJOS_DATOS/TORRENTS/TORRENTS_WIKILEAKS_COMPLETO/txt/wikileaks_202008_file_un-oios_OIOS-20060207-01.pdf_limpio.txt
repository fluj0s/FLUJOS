an amount of approx imately us500000 could not be accounted for this was the information that he had communicated to idoios along with the fact that officer 1 was an officer of the fuel cell at the time the complainant was unable to provide any further information to id oios about the matter under investigation 10 the current situation regarding the unmil fuel c ell and fuel management within unmil has been investigated under idoios cas 043004 and was not revisited during this investigation vi findings 11 the original complainant when reinterviewed b idoios was not able to provide any concrete evidence to suggest that offic er 1 was in any way responsible for the us500000 discrepancy in the fuel cell account s indeed he stated that he had never mentioned the exact amount involved and that officer 1s name had only come up because officer 1 was the officer of the fuel cell at the time 12 officer 1 is longer with the united nations and therefore longer falls under the authority of oios 4 13 the discrepancy mentioned to idoios by the co mplainant did exist but it had already been noted by the iad1oios auditors who in their final report suggested that the missing fuel could most probably be attributed to the actions of the former fuel supervisor and the bowser drivers these persons we re dismissed from the mission once their actions became known 14 unmil has acted on the recommendations of the ia doios auditors and as demonstrated by the results of the investigation in to idoios case 043004 the situation regarding fuel management in the mission is much im proved vii
