washington dc july 2002the united states is the second largest pr oducer of cotton but is the worlds largest exporter marketing year 2003 exports are estimated at 29 million metric tons and account for 41 of world cotton exports the wca region is the third largest producer accounting for 5 of world cotton production nd the second largest exporter accounting for 12 of world cotton exports uzbekista n is the third largest exporter with about 10 of world exports china the worlds largest cotton producer is also the worlds largest importer of raw cotton9 wca countries are low cost producers of cotton10for example in 2001 the average cost of production in benin one of the four sponsors of the cotton initiative was 31 cents per pound in the united states the n ational average cost of production was 68 cents per pound in 2001 the economic rationale for the african initiative the economic rationale for the african cotton initiative is based in part on an analysis conducted by icac which estimate s that cotton producers in developing countries not just africa face annual losse s of about 95 billion as result of subsidies that other countries provide their cotton farmers11losses of this magnitude according to icac are the result of the excess produc tion stimulated by subsidies that depress world cotton prices the icac study notes that world prices for cotton at 42 cents per pound in 20002001 were at their lowest level in 30 years low cotton prices according to icac particularly affect revenues ear ned by some of the poorest african countries while producers in subsidizing countries are shi elded from price declines by subsidies icac points out that the united states pr ovides the largest amount of subsidies to its cotton producers which it estimated t 23 billion in 20012002 other countries subsidies in 200102 included china 12 billion european union eu countries greece and spain 716 million turkey 59 million brazil 50 million and egypt

tons lower than actual production in that year 700000 tons less than actual production in 20002001 and 14 million tons less than actual in 20012002 the simulated removal of subsidies resu lting in lower production leads to higher prices in the short term the simulated dec line in us production results in average international prices per pound of cotton 6 cents higher than realized in 199900 12 cents higher than in 200001 and 22 cents higher th an in 200102 higher prices would reduce the demand for cotton thus the initial price increases would be lowered by 1 2 and

depressing world cotton prices icac says that weak consumer demand resulting from the recent economic slowdown and continuing competition from synthetic fibers are preventing world cotton consumption from more rapid growth in add ition says icac improved technology the strong us dollar and the expansion of co tton production into new areas contributed to the increase in world cotton supply in 2001

opportunity to increase market access and further discipline trade distorting domestic support nd export subsidiesa sectoral initiative focusing specifically on the us cotton p rogram is counterproductive to us cottons interest and distracts from multilateral reform of agricultural trade implications for us cotton programs adoption of standalone sectoral initia tive as proposed by the african countries could mean that cotton producers would after four years longer be receiving payments under 2002 farm bill programs that are linke d to production namely marketing loan assistance and loan deficiencypayments17cotton producers also could become ineligible to receive payments under the 2002 farm bills new countercyclical payments ccp program ccp payments are li nked to the level of

for cotton and all other agricultural products and substantial imp rovements in market access for cotton cotton products and other agricultural goods under this lates t formulation of the us proposal trade distorting programs like marketing loan gainsloan deficiencypayments would be reduced but not eliminated the us proposal which recognizes subsidy element in export credit programs also could result in changes in us export credit guarantees for cotton and other products while elimination or reduction of us cotton subsidies could benefit farmers in african and other lowcost producers of cotton eg australia the economic effects in the united states could be both positive and negative us consumers could benefit from lower prices for products made from cotton u s tariffs and quotas on textiles would also have to be liberalized for us consumers to receive much benefit from cotton subsidy reduction or elimination taxpayers could ben efit from not having to pay for support of cotton producers however cotton producer s industries that supply inputs to cotton production and rural communities could be dversely affected workers in ginning transportation and marketing warehousin g and cotton seed crushing could all be adversely affected those affected could be expected to oppose the elimination of subsidies andor demand adjustment assistance to compensate for adverse impacts of subsidy elimination status of the issue the african cotton initiative remains on the wto negotiating agenda and is an issue that appears to be blocking the completion of the doha round the four african sponsors of the proposal other african countries and ot her developing countries continue to insist on separate sectoral approach to the co tton subsidy issue the united states on the other hand continues to insist on includi ng cotton subsidies in broader negotiating approach us cotton subsidies also are being challenged in wto dispute settlement where brazil is arguing that the united states has exceeded its subsidy reduction commitments for cotton21if brazil wins this dispute the united states either would be obliged to alter its cotton subsidy programs or accept the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by brazil on some of its products in 2004 in terested members of congress will be closely monitoring the wto agriculture negotiations the african cotton initiative and the wto
