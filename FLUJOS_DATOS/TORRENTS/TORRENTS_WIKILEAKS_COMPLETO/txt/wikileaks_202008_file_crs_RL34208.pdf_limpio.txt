discussed as source of information for health care decision makers that may aid them in reaching evidence based decisions the premise that what is newest is not always the best is the core of the rationale behind comparative effec tiveness research diverse governmental and nongovernmental organizations have publicly expressed their support and reservations about compara tive effectiveness researc h many bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that support compara tive effectiveness research including s 3 hr 2184 hr 3162 champ act and the healthy americans act s 334 and hr 3163 although publicly supported by many governmental and nongovernmental entities in the abstract controversy about co mparative clinical effectiveness research lies in its practice and implementation health technology assessment tools eg comparative clinical effectiveness costeffectiveness and costbenefit analys is have been used for decades in the united states to determine whether and what type of research is needed the scope and scale of current comparative effectiv eness research efforts must be understood this report summarizes research effort s that have been funded and conducted both

firms including cons ulting firms private insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the oregon health plan and the vha some other countries have given comparative clinical effectiveness and costeffectiveness more explicit roles in their health care systems proponents maintain that new compara tive clinical effectiveness research entity in the united states could have the potential to increase the efficiency and coordination of research boos t the perceived independen ce and scientific integrity of the research or generate research not

comparative clinical effectiveness and costeffectiveness research background history and overview comparative clinical effectiveness research has been discussed as an avenue for producing information to help health care decision makers such as patients providers and public and private payers reach informed evidencebased decisions proponents maintain that such informa tion would aid in using limited resources effectively and efficiently becomes even more necessary as resources become more limited variation in medical practice patterns persist1 and the rate of health care spending continues to rise2 recent institute of medicine iom report on the future of drug safety notes what is newest is not always the best3 and that decision makers need information on the comparative risks and benefits of trea tments and services diverse governmental and nongovern mental organizations have publicly expressed their support or reservations about increas ed comparative clinical effectiveness research the house ways and means subcommittee on health held hearing on june 12 2007 that discussed th creation of publicprivate body that would oversee comparative clinical effectiveness research the director of the congressional budget office cbo concl uded at the hearing that comparative clinical effectiveness research combined with changes in payment incentives offers promising mechanism for reducing health care costs to significant degree over the long term while maintaining or improving the health of americans while emphasizing that significant cost savings from

hr 3162 the childrens health and medicare protection champ act of 200713 would establish publicprivate funding mechanism for comparative clinical effectiveness res earch overseen by an indepe ndent commission and trust fund that would be appropriated at least 90 million in fy2008 100 million in fy2009 110 million in 2010 and more than 90 million in years thereafter cbo has stated that the information produced by the comparative effectiveness portion of the champ act would reduce to tal spending by public and private purchasers by 05 billion over 5 years and 6 billion over 10 years direct spending by the federal government was estimated to be reduced by 01 billion over 5 years and 13 billion over 10 years thus the ma jority of the savings from the research would be realized by private purchasers rath er than by the federal government the net federal expenditures from the comparative effectiveness portion of the champ act were estimated to be 05 bi llion over 5 years and 11 billion over 10 years cbo assumed the savings would primar ily be realized through changes in physicians practice patterns and to sser extent changes in coverage rules14 the healthy americans act s

is demonstrated between the treatment and health outcome external validity is measured when continuedwhat is comparative effectiveness research comparative effectiveness research is term that has been defined by people in many different ways all agree that comparative effectiveness research compares the effectiveness of two or more health care services or treatments and is one form of health technology assessment it co mpares outcomes resulting from different treatments or services and provides information about th relative effectiveness of treatments additional specifics about the resear ch and its definition are sources of contention in particular effectiveness how s hould effectiveness be measured should the research compare only the effectiveness the effect in routine clinical practice or also the efficacy t he effect under optimal conditions of treatments or services costs should costs be included in the research should the costs be reported separately from the ffectiveness results or should costeffectiveness ratio be the ultimate goal effectiveness how should it be measured effectiveness is complicated to measure measuring the benefit or effectiveness is not straightforward matte r which factors are included and how they are counted can greatly affect the results quantifying benef its and effectiveness often requires assumptions about the popula tion benefitting from the treatment for example to what extent will the benefits from the treatment vary across the country and in different settings more specifica lly how should the benefits observed in clinical trial be extrapolated to the rest of the population researchers have debated such questions over the years resulting in an expert consensus17 concerning best research methods these suggested thods include the practice of conducting sensitivity analyses to assess how study results would change if parameters such as effectiveness were measured differently18 effectiveness differs from efficacy treatments efficacy is the effect of the treatment under optimal conditions treatments ffectiveness is the effect of the treatment in routine clinical practice19 for example randomized clinical trialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs5 19 continued relationship is demonstrated between the tr eatment and health outcome across different settings patients and procedures for administ

food and drug administra tion fda marketing approval typically aim to assess the relative safety and efficacy of treatment so as to best determine the sole effect of the treatment absent any othe r influential factors clinical trials for fda approval also typically compare the efficacy of an investigational treatment to placebo20 rather than another treatment effectiveness research relaxes the strict exclusionary criteria that are typically required in such trials in order to assess the treatment in the wide range of patients and environments in which the product is actually used efficacy and effectiveness research results may differ because often in clinical practice patients may have more than one illness doses may vary methods of administering the treatment may vary and patients may simultaneously take treatments for multiple illnesses moreover large segments of the potential patient population are often excluded from efficacy tria ls in order to achieve more uniform study population21 an often cited example is th at many patients with high blood pressure also have diabetes yet efficacy clinical trials for high blood pressure treatments may not include patients with diabetes as result any interaction between blood pressure and diabetes medications may not be known until the treatment is approved by the fda and used in clinical practice also different patients may respond to treatments differently due to physiologic differences such as different metabolic rates of drugs and sa fety of anesthesia in surgical options although conducted after fda approval postmarketing22 also known as phase iv studies are not necessarily effectiv eness studies and only rarely could be classified as comparative effectiveness st udies postmarketing studies most often assess any ongoing safety concer ns of one drug or device rather than the effectiveness of product moreover the few studies th at compare two or mo re treatments often only assess the equivalence or superiority of the study sponsors product rather than the relative effectivene ss of competing products costs should they be included costs are complicated to measure costs are not always easy to define or measure the total treatment costs may differ sometimes dramatically dependinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs6 23 for more information see alan m garber costeffectiveness and evidence

treatment may or may not be preceded by insurance coverage decisions decisions involving costs ie pricing and insurance reimbursement may or may not be pr eceded by coverage decisions technology assessments may occur at any point in the layers of decision making since safety profile comparisons clinical guidelines compara tive effectiveness costeffectiveness or costbenefit analyses may all be

university press 2005upon which perspective eg pa tient government payer private insurer society is taken in the analysis and which costs are included23 as with the measurement of effectiveness researchers have tried to re solve these issues through expert consensus of best research methods and the pr actice of conducting sensitivity analyses inclusion depends on role in health care decision making much of the controversy surrounding whether co sts should be included in comparative effectiveness research lies in the questions when how and by whom will the research results be used to make decisions24 the issue is most controversial if results that include costs are used to make insurance reimbursement pricing or coverage decisions the inclusion of costs in research tends to not be as controversial when the results are not dir ectly linked to medical and health policy decision making one reason for the contr oversy is that policymakers may disagree about the way costs are measured or whic h costs are included in research study costeffectiveness and costbenefit two ways to include costs costeffectiveness and costbenefit analys is are two frequently used techniques of incorporating costs in the results of hea lth technology assessments the techniques compare the costs to the health benefits received from services or treatments both methods are used to help determine whet her the additional health benefits of service or treatment can justify the additional costs costeffectiveness and cost benefit differ in how the hea lth benefits are measured in costbenefit analysis the health benefits are monetarized and the results are stated either in the form of ratio or monetary difference be tween costs and benefits25 in costeffectiveness analyses the health benefits are commonly measured in nonmonetary units such as life years ie the additional years of life gained or life years adjusted for quality ie quality adjusted life years qalys and the end pr oduct is usually ratio of the costs and benefits eg dollarsqaly also coste ffectiveness analysis always compares one or more alternatives while costbenefit analysis can be used to assess single optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs7 26 pubmed is free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the national institutes of health and includes over 17 million

has been used in the us and other countries and the potential role of new comparative effectiveness entity research in the published medical literature the published medical literature is one source of information that may help assess the extent to which various types of entities are currently conducting comparativ clinical effectiveness research we conducted search of the published medical litera ture which included all studies published in pubmed journals that compared the effectiveness of at least two treatments or services be tween january 2004 and august 200726 the search was not intended to be an exhaustive search of all comparative clinical effectiveness studies but rather was intended to summarize the information available from one large source of recently completed studies it did not include studies that compared treatment or service to placebo studi conducted through initiatives discussed later in this report were excluded from this literature search each study was categorized by the type of research entity that conducted the study which was determined by the affiliation of the studys contact author the categories of types of research entities were academic privat institute pharmaceutical companies and government private institute was define d in this search as forprofit or non profit research group that was not based at university or pharmaceutical company examples of private institutes include hosp itals and private practices not affiliated with universities such as the kaiser permanente medical center and the black hills regional eye institute res earch conducted at veterans affairs va hospitals was categorized as government research the relative share of studies published by different types of entities is shown in figure 1 the kinds of studies published by each type of entity are shown in table 1 the published studies primarily focu sed on treatments for mental health disorders and cardiovascular disease most comparative clinical effectiveness studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs8 27 notably this result does not necessarily im ply that academic researchers produce the most comparative clinical effectiveness studies si nce

comparative clinical effectiveness studies in the medical literature few studies focused on the comparative effectiveness of treatments in sub populations which was defined as populations other than white middleage males or females for diseases such as ovarian can cer that only occur in females sub populations such as children elderl and nonwhite races may respond to treatments differently due to physiologic differences such as different metabolic rates of drugs and safety of anesthesia in surg ical options thus research including sub populations may help inform clinical prac tice also few studies included patients with more than one disease ie comorbidities28 since nearly 60 of hospitalizations have at least one comorb idity ie two diseases and over 33 have two or more ie at least

multifaceted interventions and participator clinical guideline development were found to be more effective35 other more difficult factors to change such as the management structure of the private in surer employing the physician were also found to influence prescribing habits36 researchers and polic makers have tested many methods for changing clinical prac tice and optimal strate gies have evolved over the years37 overall changing clinical practice is not simple or inexpensive process and requires more than disseminating information and expecting individuals to combthrough research

entity the multitude of current comparative effectiveness research entities in the us introduces the question why would ne w entity be needed to conduct more comparative clinical effectiveness resear ch many entities are currently conducting comparative effectiveness research but the results are not centralized nor are they necessarily in format that is easy for h ealth care decision makers to use thus one possible reason that could be offered in support of new research entity might be increased efficiency and coordination of research the entity could also arguably improve researchers indepe ndence and scientific integr ity or spawn the genesis of research not currently being conducted on drugs other health technologies or services factors that may influence its success many factors might influence whether the aforementioned potential gains from new entity could be realized some of these influential factors might be determined when the entity is established the ideal structure funding source42 mission and authority of the entity may depend upon the intended use of the research for example if the entity aims to influence insurers decisions then input from these stakeholders may help achieve this goal if the entity aims to change clinical practice then decision makers may wish to plan how the new research will help achieve this goal additionally if like the ota the audience is congress then there may be some benefit to establishing the entity as congressional agency there may also be some efficiency gains to having the agency work with existing agencies in the executive branch such as ahrq or nih other factors influential to the entitys success would more likely be determined by the entitys administration including which treatments would be studied would different types of treatme nt options such as drugs and surgery be compared to each other would the research methods include systematic reviews decision models and observational studies as well as randomized trials who would oversee and review the studies methods timing and clinical endpointshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs21 which researchers and what exper tise would be required to conduct the studies how would the results be presented and used how would the political support for the entity be maintained the answers to these questions could have repercussions on many interested parties including physicians patients payers manufacturers researchers and federal agencies for example the timing of the research could influence the impact of the research since the amount of information that is known about treatment differs at different time periods the issue is that conclusions may need to be modified when more information becomes available in particular research area on the one hand waiting for perfect information on treatme nt before conducting any analyses would help curb modifications but any resulting conclusions may have limited impact on improving clinical decision making on the other hand analyzing areas with imperfect information would be more likely to have large impact on clinical decision making but the conclusions ma change once more information becomes available middle but imperfect opti on would be to reevaluate conclusions as more information becomes available while this option would allow all information to be incorporated into decisions in timely manner it would also increase the overall costs of technology ssessments new entity might need to grapple with these types of decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34208crs22 43 for more information see dwight s

oregon health plan was the first largescale public attempt to apply costeffectiveness analysis to set priorities for medical services the struggles of the program had ripple effects on the use of costeffectiveness analysis in other settings the act created the oregon health services commission and charged it with developing list that ranked medical services by priority the program initially used costeffectiveness analysis to develop the prioritized list the value of the health benefits was determined by assessing 1 oregonians co mmunity values of different treatments in town meetings 2 oregonians ratings of the desirability of health states ie healthrelated quality of life and 3 medical professionals judgment of the efficacy of different treatments96 the resulting costeffectiveness
